While doing so is a convenience to be enjoyed, such actions raise the risk that spilling of crumbs or liquid may occur. For example, passengers in cars, trains and airplanes, as a result of sharp turns or sudden movements, may spill food or drink on clothing. Where the drivers and passengers are in transit to an important event (business meetings, weddings, etc.) such outcomes can be extremely disadvantageous. In the past, drivers and passengers alike, have used garment protection devices to prevent soiling of their garments.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,814,277; 6,836,900; 4,663,779; 5,031,241; 6,789,265 and 7,237,271, all of which are herein incorporated by reference as if each is presented in their respective entirety, describe configurations of garment protection devices. While such disclosures are directed principally to preventing food or beverages from soiling a garment, the configurations therein are not adapted for ease of use, ease of cleaning and/or adaptability to different use case scenarios.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, what is needed in the art is an approach that leverages the particular features of a garment protection device but improves upon those features. For example, what is needed in the art is a garment protection device that is affixable by persons of different adaptability levels, that permits wide range of movement while being worn, and is configured such that any spilled food or drink is easily retained and removed from the device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An ergonomic garment protection device is provided that is affixable by persons of different adaptability levels and permits a wide range of movement while being worn. Such a garment protection device is configured such that any spilled food or drink is easily retained and removed from the device. For example, the garment protection device can be used by passengers or operators of a vehicle. In addition, the garment protection device can be used to catch chips, drinks, ice cream or other foods when watching TV or at a sporting event. Similarly, such a garment protection device can be worn at a movie theater and be deployed to catch popcorn from falling on the user's lap.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a particular implementation of an ergonomically improved garment protection device, the provided garment protection device comprises or is configured with a collar assembly, a garment protection panel and a capture pocket. In one or more particular implementations, each of the collar assembly, garment protection panel and capture pocket are formed of the same material. In one configuration, the collar assembly has a first surface and a second surface, wherein the second surface is configured to be in substantial contact with the neck and/or shoulders of a wearer and wherein the collar assembly is configured to substantially surround the neck of the wearer when placed on the wearer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one particular implementation, the collar assembly is further configured to have an opening to allow the passage of the neck of a wearer. In one or more particular implementations, the garment protection panel forms a contiguous impervious service with the collar assembly and has a substantially curved surface, where the curvature of the garment protection panel substantially matches the curvature of the torso of the wearer. In a further implementation, the garment protection panel is configured to extend as a contiguous protection surface from the first surface of the collar assembly and extend along a first axis that is orthogonal to the opening passage or gap of the collar assembly. In a further implementation, the garment protection panel has a first panel section that has a first width W, a second panel section that is contiguous with the first panel section and having a second width W&#x2032;, and at least a third panel section configured with an end portion having a semicircular shape and two side portions. The garment protection device further includes a capture pocket configured to enclose a volume of space between the capture pocket and the third panel section of the garment protection panel. In one particular implementation, a base portion of the capture pocket is configured to have sufficient width so as to allow for insertion of cleaning materials or utensils.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front, perspective view of a particular embodiment of the garment protection device described herein;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a front view of the garment protection device described herein;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a rear view of the garment protection device described herein;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a left side view of the garment protection device described herein</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is right side view of the garment protection device described herein;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a top view of the garment protection device described herein;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a bottom view of the garment protection device described herein; and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a top-left view of the garment protection device described herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">By way of overview and introduction, and with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, the present disclosure relates to an ergonomically improved garment protection device <b>100</b> that includes at least a collar assembly <b>102</b>, garment protection panel <b>104</b> and a capture pocket <b>106</b>. In one or more configurations, the garment protection device <b>100</b> is configured to protect a wearer from spills. For example, the torso of a wearer of the described garment protection device <b>100</b> is protected from direct spills. In circumstances where the wearer is attempting to consume food or drink and spills some of such food or drink, the garment protection panel <b>104</b> provides for an impervious panel to protect the wearer's garment. In a further implementation, the capture pocket <b>106</b> is disposed at one end of the garment protection device <b>100</b> is and configured to capture or collect dropped food or drink that has impacted the garment protection panel <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a further implementation, the collar assembly <b>102</b> allows for the wearer to affix the garment protection device to the wearer. For example, the semicircular &#x201c;c&#x201d; shaped collar assembly <b>102</b> allows for one-handed operation. In this manner, the present device avoids the need to affix the collar assembly <b>102</b> to the wearer through the use or straps tabs or other devices that would require two hands or high degrees of manual dexterity.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It will be appreciated that the described garment protection device <b>100</b> is suitable for use by both men and women, as well as by children. However, particular modifications in size, relative dimensions or configurations that allow for a more optimized fit for individuals of different body types are envisioned and understood.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one particular implementation, the garment protection device <b>100</b> is formed of a rigid or semi-rigid material. For instance, in one particular implementation, the garment protection device <b>100</b> is formed of a sheet of plastic, metal, natural, carbon fiber or composite material. By way of non-limiting example, the garment protection device <b>100</b> is formed of a single sheet of pliant, or pliable material, such a thin plastic sheeting. In a particular implementation, the garment protection device <b>100</b> is formed or produced by injection molding or a similar casting or forming process.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another configuration, the garment protection device <b>100</b> is formed of multiple layers of materials. In one arrangement, the layers of material are the same (such as several layers of plastic material). In an alternative configuration, the multiple layers are formed of different materials. In a further, non-limiting implementation, the garment protection device <b>100</b> is formed of an outer layer of pliant, fluid impermeable material over a flexible core. For instance, in one or more arrangements, a flexible plastic sheet encases a foam core, or other light weight inner material. In one embodiment, the material sheet used to form the collar assembly, garment protection panel and capture pocket are made of flexible, liquid-impermeable materials, such as polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, or biodegradable material or bioplastic. In one or more implementations, the material sheet has a thickness of less than about 1 mm, or more typically less than about 0.5 mm, or even more particularly, less than about 0.3 mm. In one or more implementations, such as where the material is polyethylene, the material has a thickness of about 0.05 mm to about 0.25 mm. In yet an alternative implementation, the material sheet has a thickness of less than 2 mm. In a further implementation, the material sheet has a thickness of between about 2 mm to about 1.5 mm. In one or more further configurations, the sheet material may be embossed and/or matte finished. The material may be transparent, translucent or opaque, and may have a variety of colors, logos or designs printed thereon for promotions and advertising.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a further particular implementation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, the garment protection device <b>100</b>, is configured to include at least three (3) components, the collar assembly <b>102</b>, the garment protection panel <b>104</b> and the capture pocket <b>106</b>. In one or more particular implementations, each of the collar assembly <b>102</b>, garment protection panel <b>104</b> and capture pocket <b>106</b> are formed of the same material. Furthermore, in one or more implementations, each of the components described herein (the collar assembly <b>102</b>, the garment protection panel <b>104</b> and the capture pocket <b>106</b>) are formed of a continuous sheet or surface of a single material. However, in one or more alternative configurations, one or more of the collar assembly <b>102</b>, the garment protection panel <b>104</b> and the capture pocket <b>106</b> are formed of a different material.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a further implementation, the lip or rim <b>109</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> particularly), can be made of a different material such as soft rubber for a more comfortable fit. Likewise, the collar assembly <b>102</b> may be formed of a different material than the garment protection panel <b>104</b> and the capture pocket <b>106</b>. Likewise, the garment protection panel <b>104</b> may be formed of a different material than the collar assembly <b>102</b> or the capture pocket <b>106</b>. For example, each of the collar assembly <b>102</b>, lip <b>109</b>, the garment protection panel <b>104</b> and the capture pocket <b>106</b> are formed of a different material.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Turning now to the collar assembly <b>102</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, the collar assembly <b>102</b> is configured to fit around the neck of the wearer. In one configuration, the collar assembly <b>102</b> has a first surface <b>101</b> and a second surface <b>105</b>, wherein the second surface <b>105</b> is configured to be in substantial contact with the neck and shoulders of a wearer. For example, the collar assembly <b>102</b> is configured to substantially surround the neck of the wearer when placed on the wearer. In one or more further implementations, the collar assembly <b>102</b> is further configured to have an opening <b>103</b> to allow the passage of the neck of a wearer.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the collar assembly <b>102</b> includes a semicircular portion <b>202</b> that is configured to partially encircle the neck of the wearer. For instance, a portion of the semicircular portion <b>202</b> is configured such that the weight of the garment protection device <b>100</b> is directed along a central vertical axis of the wearer's body. In this configuration, the collar assembly <b>102</b> transfers a portion of the weight of the garment protection device <b>100</b> from the wearers neck to the shoulders of the wearer. In one or more further implementations the collar assembly <b>102</b> transfers the weight of the garment protection device <b>100</b> substantially equally between the neck and shoulders of the wearer. In further implementations, the distribution of the weight of the garment protection device <b>100</b> is not equally distributed between the neck and shoulders of the wearer. Such non-equal distribution of the weight of the garment protection device <b>100</b> can be implemented based on the shape and orientation of the collar assembly <b>102</b>. For instance, where the collar assembly <b>102</b> is configured with portions thereof to lay flat on the shoulders of the wearers, such a configuration is designed to transfer more weight of the garment protection device <b>100</b> to the shoulders of the wearer. Such configurations can be used to prevent the collar assembly <b>102</b> from applying uncomfortable pressure to the neck of the wearer. In a further implementation, the collar assembly <b>102</b> is configured to distribute the weight of the garment protection device <b>100</b> progressively in response to the increased weight of the garment protection device <b>100</b>. For example, the design of the collar assembly <b>102</b> can include spring leaf configuration (such that the collar assembly has a concave shape between the rims <b>109</b>) or other element design integral to the collar assembly <b>102</b> that will cause the amount of surface area of the collar assembly <b>102</b> in contact with the shoulders of the wearer to increase as weight (in the form of added food or drink) is added to the garment protection device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a further implementation, the collar assembly <b>102</b> is configured with a &#x201c;c&#x201d;-shaped or similar shaped configuration. In this shaped configuration, there is a gap <b>103</b> between two portions of the collar assembly <b>102</b> that allows for the insertion of the wearer's neck. In one or more further configurations, the semicircular portion <b>202</b> of the collar assembly <b>102</b> is 1-2 inches in width. In one or more further implementations, the semicircular portion <b>202</b> of the collar assembly <b>102</b> is greater than 2 inches or less than 1 inch in width. By way of non-limiting example, the semicircular portion <b>202</b> of the collar assembly <b>102</b> is an elongated material strip that forms a contiguous surface the garment protection panel <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in a further detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, a short portion <b>107</b> of the collar assembly <b>102</b> is configured to extend from garment protection panel <b>104</b> so as to create the &#x201c;c&#x201d;-shaped collar assembly <b>102</b>. In this configuration, the semicircular portion <b>202</b> of the collar assembly is configured to extend from the top of the garment protection panel <b>104</b> and partially encircle the neck of the wearer, while the short portion <b>107</b> extends only a partial way to encircle the neck of the wearer. In this way the gap <b>103</b> is introduced that permits the insertion of the wearer's neck. In one or more configurations, the short portion <b>107</b> is connected or contiguous to the garment protection panel <b>104</b> and extends or is disposed for a length of 1-3 inches away from the garment panel body on the opposite side of the neck of the wearer as the semicircular portion <b>202</b>. In alternative configurations, the short portion <b>107</b> is configured to extend or is disposed more than three (3) inches away from the garment panel body on the opposite side of the neck of the wearer as the semicircular portion <b>202</b> so as to accommodate larger neck dimensions.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one or more further implementations, the collar assembly <b>102</b> is configured with a buffer or rim <b>109</b> disposed along the edge of the flat material. In one or more configurations this rim is configured to extend along the perimeter of the entire garment protection device <b>100</b>. It will be appreciated that the rim <b>109</b>, regardless of the form or configuration provided, can serve additional purposes. For example, the rim <b>109</b> can provide additional structural strength to the collar assembly <b>102</b>. As shown, the collar assembly <b>102</b> is formed of a material strip that is secured (partially) around the neck of the wearer. The inclusion of the rim <b>109</b> at the edges of the collar assembly <b>102</b> provides additional strength to the collar assembly <b>102</b>, allowing the collar assembly <b>102</b> to flex or be deformed during the securing process without breaking. Additionally, the rim <b>109</b> can be extended around the perimeter of the garment protection device <b>100</b>. In this configuration, the rim <b>109</b> also imparts additional structural strength to the overall device, thus permitting a degree of flex or deformation while in use. The rim <b>109</b> also functions as a lip, preventing liquids that have been spilled onto the garment protection device <b>100</b> from spilling past the perimeter of the garment protector.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one or more implementations, the collar assembly <b>102</b> may be provided in a variety of sizes. For example, the collar assembly <b>102</b> is configured to fit around any size neck, from those of a child to those of a larger sized adult. For example, the collar assembly <b>102</b> may be configured in sizes ranging from 9&#x2033; to 20&#x2033; in neck diameter, but other sizes are understood and envisioned.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a further configuration, a portion of the collar assembly <b>102</b> is a substantially flat material that is configured to lie parallel to the shoulders of the wearer. In one or more configurations, the collar assembly <b>102</b> can be secured to the wearer using only one hand. Therefore, the configured collar assembly <b>102</b> described in the presently pending application is suitable for use by users having a wide range of manual dexterity or gross motor functionality.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Continuing with the description of the garment protection device <b>100</b> includes a garment protection panel <b>104</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref>. In one or more configurations, the garment protection panel <b>104</b> is configured to extend from the collar assembly <b>102</b> to overlay a substantial portion of the torso of the wearer. In one or more particular implementations, the garment protection panel <b>104</b> is a substantially flat panel having a front surface and a back surface. In one or more particular implementations, the garment protection panel <b>104</b> has a substantially curved surface (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), where the curvature follows the general curvature of the torso of the wearer. In a further implementation, the garment protection panel <b>104</b> is configured to extend as a contiguous protection surface from the first surface of the collar assembly and extend in a first axis (shown as dashed line F of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) that is orthogonal to the opening passage or gap <b>103</b> of the collar assembly <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one or more implementations, the length of the garment protection panel <b>104</b> is between 6 and 12 inches. However, in alternative configurations, the length of the garment protection panel <b>104</b> can be up to 18 inches.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one particular implementation, the garment protection panel <b>104</b> has a portion having a first maximum width W (shown in dashed line W of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The garment protection panel <b>104</b>, has a second portion that is contiguous with the first portion and having a second maximum width W&#x2032;. In one or more further implementations, the garment protection panel <b>104</b> has an end portion that is contiguous with the second panel section. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the end portion has a semicircular shape, wherein the maximum width between the opposing ends of end portion is W&#x2033;. In one or more configurations, the garment protection panel is configured such that the maximum width of the first portion, W, is greater than the maximum width of the second portion W&#x2032;. Furthermore, the maximum width of the first portion W is such that it is less than the maximum width of the end portion W&#x2033;.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">By way of non-limiting example, the garment protection panel <b>104</b> is configured with undulating or alternating widths. For example, the width of W may be 12 inches, while the width of W&#x2032; is 9 inches, while the width of W&#x2033; is 14 inches. It should be appreciated that alternative values are envisioned so long as the relative values of W, W&#x2032; and W&#x2033; are maintained.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a further implementation, the center of the garment protection panel <b>104</b> (aligned along axis F) is further raised relative to the edges of the garment protection panel. For example, the center of the garment protection panel <b>104</b> is configured to slope from the center (along axis F) to the edges, such that fluid would be directed away from the center of the garment protection panel <b>104</b> and towards the edges. In one or more implementations, the rim <b>109</b> encircles the garment protection panel <b>104</b> and is coextensive with the rim <b>109</b> buffer of the collar assembly <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In will be appreciated that the undulating or curving edges of the garment protection panel <b>104</b> allow for a wearer to have a wide range of arm movement without obstruction by the garment protection device <b>100</b>. Such wide range of movement is important when the wearer is operating a motor vehicle or transport device. However, in devices described herein that are solely designed for passengers, or in circumstances where freedom of movement is less of a primary concern, the individual widths of the panel sections can be the same or substantially similar dimensions.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one or more further configurations and shown in particular detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, but with particular attention to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the garment protection device <b>100</b> includes a capture pocket <b>106</b>. The capture pocket <b>106</b>, in one particular implementation, is configured to have an inner capture surface <b>604</b> and an outer capture surface <b>404</b>. In one or more implementations, the capture pocket <b>106</b> is configured to enclose a volume bounded by the garment protection panel <b>104</b> and the inner surface <b>604</b> of the capture pocket <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">By way of further example, the capture pocket <b>106</b> is configured to be contiguous with the front surface of the garment protection panel <b>102</b>. As shown with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, the capture pocket <b>106</b> is configured extend away from the front surface of the garment protection panel <b>104</b> along a first path axis (A) that is substantially orthogonal to the first axis F. In this arrangement, food or drink and that impacts on the garment protection panel <b>104</b> or is dropped directly into the capture pocket <b>106</b> is retained within the capture pocket <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Additionally, the capture pocket <b>106</b> is also configured to further extend orthogonally, along axis B, from axis X, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In one or more further implementations, as further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, the capture pocket provides a minimum width &#x201c;C&#x201d; to a bottom portion on the capture pocket <b>106</b>. Such a minimum width of &#x201c;C&#x201d; is between 0.2 and 1 inches. However, larger or smaller dimensions, such as between 0.1 and 4 inches are envisioned for the value of C. It will be appreciated that a minimum width for the bottom portion of width &#x201c;C&#x201d; permits easy access to the base of the capture pocket <b>106</b> and allows for cleaning of any materials captured thereby.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one or more implementations, the depth of the opening of the capture pocket <b>106</b> (depicted by dashed line H of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) is between 1-4 inches. As used herein, it will be appreciated that the depth of the opening of the capture pocket <b>106</b> corresponds to the distance between the surface of the garment protection panel <b>104</b> and the inner surface <b>604</b> capture pocket <b>106</b> along axis H. In another configuration, the depth of the opening of the capture pocket <b>106</b> is between about 2 and about 8 inches. In one or more implementations, the depth of the opening of the capture pocket <b>106</b> varies in relationship to the width of the capture pocket <b>106</b> (where width is shown by dashed line G). Here, the depth of the opening of the capture pocket <b>106</b> includes a maximum and a minimum opening value. In one implementation, the minimum value is &#xbd;, &#xbc; or &#x215b; of the maximum opening value. In this configuration, the depth at any point along axis H is between the minimum and maximum opening values</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in one or more further implementations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the outer surface <b>404</b> of the capture pocket <b>106</b> is configured to extend so as to be contiguous with the at least the two side portions of the third panel of the garment protection panel <b>104</b>. In one or more particular implementations, the maximum width of the capture pocket <b>106</b> is the same as the maximum width of the end portion of the garment protection panel <b>104</b> (shown in reference to path W&#x2033; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). However, in one or more further implementations, the width of the capture pocket <b>106</b> (shown in dashed line G of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) is greater or smaller than the maximum width of the end portion of the garment protection panel <b>104</b>. In one or more particular implementations, the width of the capture pocket <b>106</b> is between about 9 inches to about 15 inches.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">While this specification contains many specific embodiment details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any embodiment or of what can be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features that can be specific to particular embodiments of particular embodiments.
