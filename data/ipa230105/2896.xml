Such turbine components are often protected by a thermal and/or chemical barrier coating. The current coatings used on airfoils exposed to the hot gases of combustion in gas turbine engines for both environmental protection and as bond coats in thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems include both diffusion aluminides and various metal alloy coatings. These coatings are applied over substrate materials, typically nickel-based superalloys, to provide protection against oxidation and corrosion attack. These coatings are formed on the substrate in a number of different ways. For example, a nickel aluminide layer may be grown as an outer coat on a nickel base superalloy by simply exposing the substrate to an aluminum rich environment at elevated temperatures. The aluminum diffuses into the substrate and combines with the nickel to form an outer surface of the nickel-aluminum alloy.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, as the increased demands for engine performance elevate the engine operating temperatures and/or the engine life requirements, improvements in the performance of coatings when used as environmental coatings or as bond coatings are needed over and above the capabilities of these existing coatings. Because of these demands, a coating that can be used for environmental protection or as a bond coat capable of withstanding higher operating temperatures or operating for a longer period of time before requiring removal for repair, or both, is desired. These known coating materials and deposition techniques have several shortcomings. Most metal alloy coatings deposited by low pressure plasma spray, plasma vapor deposition (PVD), electron beam PVD (EBPVD), cathodic arc, or similar sputtering techniques are line of sight coatings, meaning that interiors of components are not able to be coated. Platinum electroplating of exteriors typically forms a reasonably uniform coating, however, electroplating the interior of a component has proven to be challenging. The resulting electroplating coatings are often too thin to be protective or too thick that there are other adverse mechanical effects, such as high weight gain or fatigue life debit. Similarly, alum inide coatings suffer from non-uniformity on interior passages of components. Aluminide coatings are brittle, which can lead to reduced life when exposed to fatigue.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, most of these coatings are on the order of greater than 10 micrometers in thickness, which can cause component weight to increase, making design of the disks and other support structures more challenging. Many of these coatings also require high temperature (e.g., greater than 500&#xb0; C.) steps to deposit or promote enough interdiffusion of the coating into the alloy to achieve adhesion. It is desired by many to have coatings that (1) protect metals from oxidation and corrosion, (2) are capable of high film thickness and composition uniformity on arbitrary geometries, (3) have high adhesion to the metal, (4) are sufficiently thin to not materially increase weight or reduce fatigue life outside of current design practices for bare metal, and/or (5) are deposited at sufficiently low temperature (e.g., 500&#xb0; C. or less) to not cause microstructural changes to the metal.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, improved protective coatings and methods for depositing the protective coatings are needed.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to protective coatings on substrates including aerospace components and methods for depositing the protective coatings.
