Many application fields have been and are contemplated, from small devices such as mobile phones and laptop computers through car batteries and other batteries for e-mobility. Various components of the batteries have a decisive role with respect to the performance of the battery such as the electrolyte, the electrode materials, and the separator. Particular attention has been paid to the cathode materials. Several materials have been suggested, such as lithium iron phosphates, lithium cobalt oxides, and lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxides. Although extensive research has been performed the solutions found so far still leave room for improvement.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0007">Currently, a certain interest in so-called Ni-rich electrode active materials may be observed, for example electrode active materials that contain 75 mol-% or more of Ni, referring to the total TM content.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0008">A particularly Ni-rich material is LiNiO<sub>2</sub>, sometimes abbreviated as LNO. However, pure LNO suffers from various drawbacks that have lowered interest in its commercial use. The most important among these drawbacks is the difficile synthesis of stoichiometric LiNiO<sub>2 </sub>due to its tendency towards Li off-stoichiometry (Li<sub>1&#x2212;z</sub>Ni<sub>1+z</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and various instability problems of its delithiated state, which can be of (electro)chemical, mechanical or thermal nature.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0009">It was an objective of the present invention to provide a process for making Ni-rich electrode active materials with excellent electrochemical properties.
