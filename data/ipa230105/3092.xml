num="0001">None</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Aspects of the disclosure relate to completions of wellbores for recovery of hydrocarbons from geological strata. More specifically, aspects of the disclosure relate to an arrangement and method that provide for wellbore separation of different sections of tubing through the use by an activated control line that shears a set of pins that connect the different sections of tubing together.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hydrocarbon recovery from wellbores is becoming more difficult over time as easy to reach hydrocarbon reserves are depleted/exhausted. Operators, in order to reach new reserves, must drill deeper or through more difficult strata to reach alternative sources of hydrocarbons. Additionally, new reserves of hydrocarbons are being extracted from shale, therefore putting conventional drilling technology at risk as the new shale technologies become more cost effective.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Reaching hydrocarbon sources with a drill bit, however, is merely a first step in removing the hydrocarbons from those sources. A wellbore must be &#x201c;completed&#x201d; in order for the hydrocarbons to be successfully removed for long term production. Once drilling has stopped at a hydrocarbon source, for example, operators lower casing into the hole that is &#x201c;hung&#x201d; from the drilling platform or the surface. The purpose of the casing is to prevent the wellbore sides from collapsing in upon itself, thereby destroying the well. The casing may have different diameter sizes that are specially made to fit inside one another as the casing is progressively lowered into the wellbore down to the position where drilling stopped. As a leak tight production well is desired, further processing downhole must be accomplished to create a wellbore that is free from defects and leak tight.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">During wellbore completions, the casing is freely hanging from the surface and must be anchored to allow the wellbore more stability. Such stability may include both vertical and lateral stability. To achieve this stability, the gap between the casing and the geological stratum must be filled with a material that will allow for shear and bending moment forces to be exerted on the casing. Such forces may occur during production (removal of the hydrocarbons), and therefore it is desired by operators to withstand anticipated kicks and service forces that may be exerted. Understandably, as wells grow deeper, hydrocarbon reserves are under more pressure, and therefore the possibility of having a large force on the casing and accompanying structures increases. A mixture of cementitious material is pumped down the wellbore, and the cementitious material flows out of the bottom of the hung casing and fills the annulus between the exterior face of the casing and the rough wellbore wall that was drilled. The cementitious material is then left to dry, creating an exterior sleeve of anchoring material between the wellbore wall and the hung casing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">After hardening, a second set of piping, called production tubing, is then lowered into the wellbore. The purpose of the production tubing is to accept the hydrocarbons emanating from the strata and convey these hydrocarbons to the surface. The production tubing may be held in place by packers placed within the casing and around the production tubing. This allows for the hydrocarbons to be extracted only through the production tubing while the hydrocarbons are prevented from only entering the casing of the well.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to start the flow of hydrocarbons into the well, an arrangement may be lowered into the well that will perforate both the tubing and the cementitious material as well as the geological formation. This arrangement, called a perforating gun, is used at a specific area where hydrocarbons are expected to be next to the wellbore. The perforations resulting from the actuations of the gun allow a free flow of hydrocarbons from the relatively higher pressure stratum into the lower pressure environment within the casing and production tubing, resulting in hydrocarbon flow into the casing and production tubing. As the production tubing is &#x201c;packed off&#x201d; within the casing, the hydrocarbons only enter the production tubing and travel to the surface where they are recovered by operators. As will be understood, the number of perforations from the perforating gun may vary according to the size of the wellbore, the pressure of the hydrocarbon reserve, the expected recovery of the amounts of hydrocarbons, and other variables.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As hydrostatic forces may be encountered during the drilling process, in some instances, a wellbore must be pressurized during the drilling process to prevent the relatively higher pressure hydrocarbons from immediately entering the wellbore. In these instances, a polished bore receptacle (&#x201c;PBR&#x201d;) is used. The polished bore receptacle provides a sealing action and ensures isolation of liner string pressure. The polished bore receptacle has two primary functions. The PBR acts as an expansion joint and provides stroke length for extreme tubing movement during well treatment and production. The PBR also allows for removal of the production tubing string, while leaving a polished bore and anchor seal assembly set in a packer. When used as an expansion joint, the PBR is pinned in a &#x201c;shear-up&#x201d; position when assembled on a tubing string and then run in the wellbore above a packer. The number of pins used is determined by the weight of the tubing below the PBR. Thus, the pins must be of sufficient strength to sustain the weight of a slick joint when running the packer. The pins are sheared by the application of upper forces, in conventional applications. For example, the pinned system requires a force applied to the tubing to shear the pins. This can be in the form of an over pull or slack off. In other embodiments, separation of tubing may occur through a latch system that relies on pressure differential. In such embodiments, the tubing must be isolated or a packer must be set to allow for application of pressure to activate the unlatching process. In the cases of over pull or slack off, large forces are placed on the tubing, and such jarring can cause damage. The tubing, therefore, must be &#x201c;over designed&#x201d; to take such structural loading, resulting in expensive wellbore completion costs.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is a need to provide apparatus and methods that are easier to operate than conventional apparatus, and methods where an over pull or slack off are not needed for unlatching activities.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is a further need to provide apparatus and methods that do not have the drawbacks of a heavily designed tubing configuration used with conventional pin designs.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">There is a further need to prevent other excessive activities related to tubing isolation pressure activities.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">There is a further need to provide apparatus and methods for disconnection of tubing within a wellbore that is simple in operation so that operators can selectively choose to disconnect tubing.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">There is also a need to provide a design that may be used with conventional unlatching systems as a failsafe system that will allow disconnection at the discretion of an operator if other methods for disconnection have failed.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">There is a still further need to reduce economic costs associated with operations and apparatus described above with conventional tools.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">So that the manner in which the above recited features of the present disclosure can be understood in detail, a more particular description of the disclosure, briefly summarized below, may be had by reference to embodiments, some of which are illustrated in the drawings. It is to be noted that the drawings illustrate only typical embodiments of this disclosure and are therefore not to be considered limiting of its scope, for the disclosure may admit to other equally effective embodiments without specific recitation. Accordingly, the following summary provides just a few aspects of the description and should not be used to limit the described embodiments to a single concept.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, a method for disconnecting production tubing at a polished bore receptacle is disclosed. The method may comprise placing the polished bore receptacle within a wellbore, the polished bore receptacle having a first section of tubing, a second section of tubing, and a tubing disconnect latch system connecting the first section of tubing and second section of tubing.

The method may also comprise expanding the piston from the unexpanded position to the expanded position within the polished bore receptacle through one of fluid pressure and an electrical actuator connected to the piston. The method may further comprise shearing a set of pins connecting a collet with one of the first section of tubing and second section of tubing. The method may also provide for disconnecting the tubing disconnect latch system. The method may also comprise separating the first section of tubing from the second section of tubing.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another embodiment, an arrangement is described. The arrangement comprises a polished bore receptacle and a first section of tubing within the polished bore receptacle. The arrangement further provides a second section of tubing within the polished bore receptacle. The arrangement is further configured with a collet configured to move from a first position to a second position and a tubing disconnect latch system connecting the first section of tubing to the second section of tubing, the latch system configured to move from a latched position to an unlatched position though contact with the collet in the first position.

First, the process of creating a wellbore with a drilling rig is described. Following the creation of the wellbore, a number of steps to &#x201c;complete&#x201d; the wellbore are described to start the wellbore flow of hydrocarbons. Differing types of technologies may be used in this completion activity, and the described embodiments should not be considered limiting. Wellbores may be completed when the wellbore is in a completely vertical orientation or may be completed in a horizontal orientation. Other variations of inclined wells may be completed. The aspects of the disclosure described provide a method of activation of the tubing separation through a control line. The use of a control line allows operators the ability to selectively determine when unlatching may occur. Such control line activation prevents over pulls or slack offs that are required with conventional apparatus. Eliminating over pulls or slack offs prevents damage to production tubing and limits economic costs.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Although described as a stand alone system, the use of a control line for unlatching purposes may be retrofitted into a conventional apparatus. When retrofitted, the resulting apparatus provides a secondary method of disconnection of tubing, providing a greater degree of safety for operators. Thus, a retrofitted apparatus may be provided with a contingency release if components become stuck within a wellbore and disconnection between a top and bottom section of production tubing is desired. As will also be apparent, the apparatus and methods described are applicable on larger scale piping, therefore the use of the word &#x201c;tubing&#x201d; is merely used as a convention for description of piping of a smaller diameter.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In standalone arrangements described in accordance with the drawings, the aspects described relate to a single trip completion system. In general, single trip/single activation completion systems are not chosen for wellbores, as multiple action systems provide greater redundancy and safety. Such multiple action systems, however, can be costly to create and operate, leading to economic inefficiency. Aspects described herein provide a simplified completion design that minimizes risks of operators and enhances operational efficiency.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a drilling rig <b>100</b> is illustrated. The purpose of the drilling rig <b>100</b> is to recover hydrocarbons located beneath the surface <b>110</b>. Different stratum <b>104</b> may be encountered during the creation of a wellbore <b>102</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a single stratum <b>104</b> layer is provided. As will be understood, multiple layers of stratum <b>104</b> may be encountered. In embodiments, the stratum <b>104</b> may be horizontal layers. In other embodiments, the stratum <b>104</b> may be vertically configured. In still further embodiments, the stratum <b>104</b> may have both horizontal and vertical layers. Stratum <b>104</b> beneath the surface <b>110</b> may be varied in composition, and may include sand, clay, silt, rock and/or combinations of these. Operators, therefore, need to assess the composition of the stratum <b>104</b> in order to maximum penetration of a drill bit <b>106</b> that will be used in the drilling process. The wellbore <b>102</b> is formed within the stratum <b>104</b> by a drill bit <b>106</b>. In embodiments, the drill bit <b>106</b> is rotated such that contact between the drill bit <b>106</b> and the stratum <b>104</b> causes portions (&#x201c;cuttings&#x201d;) of the stratum <b>104</b> to be loosened at the bottom of the wellbore <b>102</b>. Differing types of drill bits <b>106</b> may be used to penetrate different types of stratum <b>104</b>. The types of stratum <b>104</b> encountered, therefore, is an important characteristic for operators. The types of drill bits <b>106</b> may vary widely. In some embodiments, polycrystalline diamond compact (&#x201c;PDC&#x201d;) drill bits may be used. In other embodiments, roller cone bits, diamond impregnated or hammer bits may be used. In embodiments, during the drilling process, vibration may be placed upon the drill bit <b>106</b> to aid in the breaking of stratum <b>104</b> that are encountered by the drill bit <b>106</b>. Such vibration may increase the overall rate of penetration (&#x201c;ROP&#x201d;), increasing the efficiency of the drilling operations.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As the wellbore <b>102</b> penetrates further into the stratum <b>104</b>, operators may add portions of drill string pipe <b>114</b> to form a drill string <b>112</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the drill string <b>112</b> may extend into the stratum <b>104</b> in a vertical orientation. In other embodiments, the drill string <b>112</b> and the wellbore <b>102</b> may deviate from a vertical orientation. In some embodiments, the wellbore <b>102</b> may be drilled in certain sections in a horizontal direction, parallel with the surface <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The drill bit <b>106</b> is larger in diameter than the drill string <b>112</b> such that when the drill bit <b>106</b> produces the hole for the wellbore <b>102</b>, an annular space is created between the drill string <b>112</b> and the inside face of the wellbore <b>102</b>. This annular space provides a pathway for removal of cuttings from the wellbore <b>102</b>. Drilling fluids include water and specialty chemicals to aid in the formation of the wellbore. Other additives, such as defoamers, corrosion inhibitors, alkalinity control, bactericides, emulsifiers, wetting agents, filtration reducers, flocculants, foaming agents, lubricants, pipe-freeing agents, scale inhibitors, scavengers, surfactants, temperature stabilizers, scale inhibitors, thinners, dispersants, tracers, viscosifiers, and wetting agents may be added.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The drilling fluids may be stored in a pit <b>127</b> located at the drill site. The pit <b>127</b> may have a liner to prevent the drilling fluids from entering surface groundwater and/or contacting surface soils. In other embodiments, the drilling fluids may be stored in a tank alleviating the need for a pit <b>127</b>. The pit <b>127</b> may have a recirculation line <b>126</b> that connects the pit <b>127</b> to a shaker <b>109</b> that is configured to process the drilling fluids after progressing from the downhole environment.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Drilling fluid from the pit <b>127</b> is pumped by a mud pump <b>129</b> that is connected to a swivel <b>119</b>. The drill string <b>112</b> is suspended by a drive <b>118</b> from a derrick <b>120</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the drive <b>118</b> may be a unit that sits atop the drill string <b>112</b> and is known in the industry as a &#x201c;top drive&#x201d;. The top drive is configured to provide the rotational motion of the drill string <b>112</b> and attached drill bit <b>106</b>. Although the drill string <b>112</b> is illustrated as being rotated by a top drive, other configurations are possible. A rotary drive located at or near the surface <b>110</b> may be used by operators to provide the rotational force. Power for the rotary drive or the top drive may be provided by diesel generators.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Drilling fluid is provided to the drill string <b>112</b> through a swivel <b>119</b> suspended by the derrick <b>120</b>. The drilling fluid exits the drill string <b>112</b> at the drill bit <b>106</b> and has several functions in the drilling process. The drilling fluid is used to cool the drill bit <b>106</b> and remove the cuttings generated by the drill bit <b>106</b>. The drilling fluid with the loosened cuttings enters the annular area outside of the drill string <b>112</b> and travels up the wellbore <b>102</b> to a shaker <b>109</b>. The drilling fluid provides further information on the stratum <b>104</b> being encountered and may be tested with a viscometer, for example, to determine formation properties. Such formation properties allow engineers the ability to determine if drilling should proceed or terminate.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The shaker <b>109</b> is configured to separate the cuttings from the drilling fluid. The cuttings, after separation, may be analyzed by operators to determine if the stratum <b>104</b> currently being penetrated has hydrocarbons stored within the stratum level that is currently being penetrated by the drill bit <b>106</b>. The drilling fluid is then recirculated to the pit <b>127</b> through the recirculation line <b>126</b>. The shaker <b>109</b> separates the cuttings from the drilling fluid by providing an acceleration of the fluid on to a screening surface. As will be understood, the shaker <b>109</b> may provide a linear or cylindrical acceleration for the materials being processed through the shaker <b>109</b>. In embodiments, the shaker <b>109</b> may be configured with one running speed. In other embodiments, the shaker <b>109</b> may be configured with multiple operating speeds. In embodiments, shaker <b>109</b> may operate at multiple operating speeds. The shaker <b>109</b> may be configured with a low speed setting of 6.5 &#x201c;g&#x201d; and a high speed setting of 7.5 &#x201c;g&#x201d;, where &#x201c;g&#x201d; is defined as the acceleration of gravity. Large cuttings are trapped on the screens, while the drilling fluid passes through the screens and is captured for reuse. Tests may be taken of the drilling fluid after passing through the shaker <b>109</b> to determine if the drilling fluid is adequate to reuse. Viscometers may be used to perform such testing.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As will be understood, smaller cuttings may pass entirely through the screens of the shaker <b>109</b> such that the fluids may include many smaller size cuttings. The overall quality of the drilling fluid, therefore, may be compromised by such smaller cuttings. The drilling fluid may be, as example, water based, oil based, or synthetic based types of fluids. The fluid provides several functions, such as the capability to suspend and release cuttings in the fluid flow, the control of formation pressures (pressures downhole), maintain wellbore stability, minimize formation damage, cool, lubricate and support the bit and drilling assembly, transmission of energy to tools and the bit, control corrosion and facilitate completion of the wellbore. In embodiments, the drilling fluid may also minimize environmental impact of the well construction process.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a cross-section of a completed well <b>200</b> is illustrated when drilled as described above. The completed well <b>200</b> has several sections of casing that provide support for the overall well <b>200</b> to allow hydrocarbons <b>212</b> trapped below a surface geological stratum <b>214</b>. The hydrocarbons <b>212</b> may be oil, gas or a mixture of gas and oil. A base or conductor pipe <b>202</b> extends from the surface <b>216</b> and provides a sturdy connection point of the remainder of the well <b>200</b>. Extending below the conductor pipe <b>202</b> is a section of surface casing <b>204</b>, followed by intermediate casing <b>206</b> and production casing <b>208</b>. At the bottom of the well <b>200</b>, a perforated interval <b>210</b> allows the hydrocarbons <b>212</b> to enter the production tubing, described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, that resides within the production casing <b>208</b>. As will be seen, a cementitious layer <b>218</b> encases the exterior portions of the conductor pipe <b>202</b>, surface casing <b>204</b>, intermediate casing <b>206</b> and production casing <b>208</b> in areas that do not include <b>210</b> perforated interval.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A PBR <b>410</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, may be used on the inside diameter of the casing to prevent fluids from traveling up-hole during the drilling process described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The PBR <b>410</b> is provided with a honed interior and exterior diameter to provide sealing surfaces. Production tubing sealing assemblies may be lowered on to the polished bore receptacle for connection of tubing further downhole from the PBR <b>410</b>. The PBR <b>410</b> isolates the liner inside diameter from formation pressure that forces out cement during the cementing process, described above. As the PBR <b>410</b> is used for production tubing sealing assemblies, disconnecting tubing to and from the PBR <b>410</b> is accomplished through aspects described below.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a cross-section of a gravel pack used in connection with the completed well <b>200</b> is illustrated. Within the production casing <b>208</b>, production tubing <b>300</b> is run to accept hydrocarbons <b>212</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). In non-limiting embodiments, production tubing <b>300</b> may be 1&#x215e; inch (4.76 cm) to 2&#x215e; inch (7.3 cm) in diameter. In order to limit the amount of sand and fines that enter the wellbore, a gravel-pack packer <b>302</b> may be located in the vicinity of the perforated interval <b>210</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). A gravel pack screen <b>304</b> may be positioned within the well <b>200</b> to provide for filtering of larger materials from entering the well <b>200</b>. A sump packer <b>306</b> may also be placed at the bottom of the well <b>200</b> so that the gravel pack screen <b>304</b> may be located on the perforated interval <b>210</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Gravel may be placed in the casing and perforations <b>308</b> in the perforated interval <b>210</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). As will be understood, different configurations may be used at the bottom of production tubing <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a partial cross-section of an arrangement <b>401</b> having a tubing disconnect latch system <b>400</b> is illustrated as part of a PBR <b>410</b>. The tubing disconnect latch system <b>400</b> is activated via a control line <b>502</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, that applies a fluid pressure to a release piston <b>402</b> in the latch <b>400</b> to shear a set of pins <b>404</b>, thereby disengaging the latch system <b>400</b> when a collet <b>412</b> engages the latch system <b>400</b>. The release piston <b>402</b> has a set of o-rings <b>403</b> to maintain pressure within the piston <b>402</b> as it moves. In the illustrated embodiment, 2 o-rings are provided. The production tubing <b>300</b> may be disconnected without requiring tubing isolation to pressure up and creating a tubing annulus pressure differential. This arrangement of the latch <b>400</b> also alleviates the need for a set packer to create a differential pressure used in conventional apparatus. The fluid pressure exerted via the control line <b>502</b> may be through a pump <b>550</b> or an accumulator <b>560</b> that is controlled by an operator (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). As will be understood, the pressure provided to the control line <b>502</b> may be reduced or eliminated once the set of pins <b>404</b> is sheared. In embodiments, operators will notice a reduction in pressure of the control line once the set of pins <b>404</b> are sheared and the hydraulic volume of the piston <b>402</b> increases. At this point, the operators may decrease the pressure in the control line <b>502</b> allowing for unlatching to proceed. As will be understood, materials used for the PBR <b>410</b>, the collet <b>412</b>, and release piston <b>402</b> may be made of stainless steel.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Aspects of the disclosure provide a method for disconnecting a tubing disconnect latch system <b>400</b> that works independently from tubing forces, wherein tail pipe weight and tubing manipulation do not activate the release mechanism. A release piston <b>402</b> is held in position by the set of pins <b>404</b>. The pins <b>404</b> prevent premature activation of the release piston <b>402</b>. Once the set of pins <b>404</b> are sheared, the piston <b>402</b> expands and pressure is released. A collet <b>412</b> is freed and moves to disengage the tubing disconnect latch system <b>400</b>, thereby parting the tubing <b>408</b> at a polished bore receptacle <b>410</b>. A first section of tubing <b>420</b> is released from a second section of tubing <b>430</b>. The tubing disconnect latch system <b>400</b> may be enclosed in a polished bore receptacle <b>410</b>, as illustrated.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an atmospheric chamber <b>500</b> is provided within the polished bore receptacle <b>410</b>. The purpose of the atmospheric chamber <b>500</b> may be provided to ensure a contingency release is absolute annulus pressure. Pressure may be provided to the polished bore receptacle <b>410</b> through a control line <b>502</b> via a port on an outside of the polished bore receptacle <b>410</b>. The pressure may come from a first environment, namely at the drill rig <b>100</b> and pumped down to the tubing disconnect latch system <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As a differential pressure is not generated through use of a packer, actuation of the tubing disconnect latch system <b>400</b> is quicker and more economical than conventional apparatus. Manufacturing the tubing disconnect latch system <b>400</b> including the collet <b>412</b> and the atmospheric chamber <b>500</b> is economical. Variations of the strength needed for disengagement for the first section of tubing <b>420</b> from the second section of tubing <b>430</b> may be achieved by providing different materials within the set of pins <b>404</b>, or by increasing or reducing the size of the pins <b>404</b>. As will be understood, aspects of the tubing disconnect latch system <b>400</b> may be increased or decreased in size according to the flow needs of the well <b>200</b>. As is provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the set of pins <b>404</b> is at least partially recessed in the first section of tubing <b>420</b>.

The actuator <b>498</b> may be located in a downhole portion of the drill string <b>112</b>. The actuator <b>498</b> may be connected to the piston <b>402</b> such that upon receipt of a signal, the actuator <b>498</b> moves the piston <b>402</b> to a position according to the signal received. In one non-limiting embodiment, the piston <b>402</b> may be positioned in a fully open position and in a fully closed position. In another non-limiting embodiment, the piston <b>402</b> may be positioned through a gradation of positions from fully open to fully closed. In some embodiments, signals may be generated by the actuator <b>498</b> thereby identifying to an operator the exact positioning of the piston <b>402</b> to provide real time updates to operators. Such positioning data may be useful, for example, in identifying if an error or fault has occurred in the system during operations. In some embodiments, both an electrical system actuation and a fluid pressure actuation may be used. Such a configuration would allow for a single failure proof design that would ensure piston <b>402</b> actuation in extreme wellbore conditions. In embodiments, the actuator <b>498</b> may be an electric linear actuator that is controlled by a relay or control module that may be located either in the uphole environment or downhole. Power may be supplied to the electric linear actuator through a power supply fed through a drilling rig or auxiliary electrical power source.
