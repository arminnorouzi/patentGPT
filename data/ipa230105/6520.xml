Performing laser welding instead of TIG welding enables a reduction in the axial lengths of the coil ends <b>220</b>A and <b>220</b>B. TIG welding requires axially outwardly bending the extremities of the coil pieces (which are brought into abutment with each other) such that the extremities extend in the axial direction.

Laser welding enables local heating, thus making it possible to heat only the extremities <b>40</b> and regions adjacent thereto and effectively reduce damage to the insulating coating <b>62</b> (such as carbonization).

When the extremities <b>40</b> are formed into C shapes, this process makes it possible to simultaneously remove, from the X1 side lateral faces, the portions of the insulating coating <b>62</b> extending over the first distance L<b>10</b> and remove, from the X2 side lateral faces, the portions of the insulating coating <b>62</b> extending over the second distance L<b>20</b>. Such removal reduces the necessity of an additional process, such as notching the coating in advance before the coating removing step. The coating on the extremities <b>40</b> of the coil pieces <b>52</b> is thus more efficiently removable.

Because the extremities <b>40</b> are C-shaped, end faces of the linear conductor <b>60</b> in the lengthwise direction are included in the X1 side or X2 side lateral faces and are similarly exposed.

Similarly, the press may cut X2 side portions of the linear conductor <b>60</b> in removing, from the X2 side lateral faces, the portions of the insulating coating <b>62</b> extending over the second distance L<b>20</b> from the tips of the coil pieces <b>52</b>. This makes it possible to reliably remove targeted portions of the insulating coating <b>62</b> during this cutting step. In this case, the widthwise dimension of the linear conductor <b>60</b> decreases from a pre-cutting dimension L<b>30</b> (see the upper diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>) to a post-cutting dimension L<b>31</b> (see the lower diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The first distance L<b>10</b> and the second distance L<b>20</b> are each preferably equal to or longer than a coating removing laser application range (which will be described below) such that the lateral faces of the linear conductor <b>60</b> are exposed at least in an area corresponding to the welding target location <b>90</b>.

Scanning indicated by the arrows <b>150</b> to <b>153</b> is part of entire scanning to be performed on the work. For the extremities <b>40</b> on the first side in the lengthwise direction, the application position is reciprocated in the above-described manner while being shifted in the lengthwise direction.

The same goes for the extremities <b>40</b> on the second side in the lengthwise direction. The number of reciprocating motions (or the number of times scanning is to be performed in the widthwise direction) may be appropriately set in accordance with, for example, the diameter (or beam diameter) of the coating removing laser such that the coating removing laser is applied to the entirety of the desired application range (see the hatched area <b>521</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). In the present embodiment, the application range is indicated by the hatched area <b>521</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>.

For the X2 side lateral face, the application range extends over a distance L<b>42</b> (which is another exemplary predetermined distance) from the tip of each coil piece <b>52</b>. By way of example, the distance L<b>41</b> and the distance L<b>42</b> are equal to each other in the present embodiment.

In this case, the direction of coating removing laser scanning may be inclined with respect to the X direction.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Instead of making reciprocating motions, only scanning from the first widthwise side to the second widthwise side may be performed continuously (or only scanning from the second widthwise side to the first widthwise side may be performed continuously). In this case, the application of the coating removing laser to a piece of work will be stopped after scanning from the first widthwise side to the second widthwise side. Such an application mode is preferably used when the coating removing laser is produced by, for example, pulse oscillation. Also in the case of making reciprocating motions, the application of the coating removing laser may be stopped on the second widthwise side or the first widthwise side. Such an application mode is similarly preferably used when the coating removing laser is produced by, for example, pulse oscillation. In the case of making reciprocating motions, the application of the coating removing laser may be performed continuously without being stopped such that the coating removing laser is applied to the entire application range.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The coating removing step further includes the step (S<b>144</b>) of reversing the work kept in an aligned state.

Such reversing may be carried out by any method. In the example schematically illustrated in the right portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, for example, the work is reversed using the reversing jig <b>1310</b> (see the arrow R<b>133</b>).

The applying step (S<b>145</b>) may hereinafter be referred to as a &#x201c;second applying step&#x201d; for the sake of distinction. The second applying step may be similar to the first applying step described above, except that the surfaces to which the coating removing laser is to be applied are different. Accordingly, the application range in the second applying step extends over the distance L<b>41</b> (which is one exemplary predetermined distance) from the tip of each coil piece <b>52</b> for the X1 side lateral face, and extends over the distance L<b>42</b> (which is another exemplary predetermined distance) from the tip of each coil piece <b>52</b> for the X2 side lateral face.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Applying the coating removing laser to the second side surfaces of the extremities <b>40</b> by the second applying step removes portions of the insulating coating <b>62</b> on the second side surfaces of the extremities <b>40</b>.

In other words, in the region extending beyond the distance L<b>11</b> from the tip of each coil piece <b>52</b>, the insulating coating <b>62</b> has a closed cross-sectional shape, which tends to make it difficult for the insulating coating <b>62</b> to be separated if the insulating coating <b>62</b> is carbonized.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Accordingly, performing this coating removing step in Embodiment 2 makes it necessary to additionally remove the portions of the insulating coating <b>62</b> on the lateral faces of the linear conductor <b>60</b> in advance in the region of the application range, which extends beyond the distance L<b>11</b> from the tip of each coil piece <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">By contrast, in Embodiment 1 described above, portions of the insulating coating <b>62</b> on the first side and second side surfaces within the application range are disconnected from the other portions of the insulating coating <b>62</b> on both sides in the widthwise direction as illustrated in the lower diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the application range in Embodiment 1 extends over the distance L<b>41</b> from the tip of each coil piece <b>52</b> for the X1 side lateral face, and extends over the distance L<b>42</b> from the tip of each coil piece <b>52</b> for the X2 side lateral face; however, Embodiment 1 involves removing a portion of the insulating coating <b>62</b> extending over the first distance L<b>10</b> from the tip of each coil piece <b>52</b>, and removing, from the X2 side lateral face, a portion of the insulating coating <b>62</b> extending over the second distance L<b>20</b> from the tip of each coil piece <b>52</b>. The distance L<b>41</b> is equal to or shorter than the first distance L<b>10</b>. The distance L<b>42</b> is equal to or shorter than the second distance L<b>20</b>. Accordingly, Embodiment 1 described above makes it substantially unnecessary to additionally remove the portions of the insulating coating <b>62</b> on the lateral faces of the linear conductor <b>60</b> in advance, thus making the step more efficient.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Although each embodiment has been described in detail thus far, the present disclosure is not limited to any particular embodiment. Various modifications and changes may be made within the scope of the claims. All or a plurality of constituent elements in the foregoing embodiments may be combined.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In one example, Embodiment 1 described above may involve the step of performing a preliminary process, such as notching portions of the insulating coating <b>62</b>, before the first applying step and/or the second applying step such that separation of the insulating coating <b>62</b> is promoted during the first applying step and/or the second applying step. The same goes for Embodiment 2.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Embodiment 1 described above includes the first applying step and the second applying step so as to remove the insulating coating <b>62</b> on both Y-direction surfaces of the extremities <b>40</b> of the coil pieces <b>52</b>. Alternatively, either the first applying step or the second applying step may be performed. In this case, the coating removing step may remove only a portion of the insulating coating <b>62</b> on a surface which is included in both Y-direction surfaces of each extremity <b>40</b> and which will define the abutment plane <b>401</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). The same goes for Embodiment 2.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In Embodiment 1 described above, the coating removing laser application position is changed in a linear pattern. The coating removing laser application position does not necessarily have to be changed in this pattern. In one example, the coating removing laser application position may be changed in any other pattern, such as a spiral pattern. The same goes for Embodiment 2.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE REFERENCE NUMERALS</heading><p id="p-0112" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0111"><b>1</b> motor (rotary electric machine)</li>        <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0112"><b>24</b> stator coil</li>        <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0113"><b>52</b> coil piece</li>        <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0114"><b>40</b> extremity</li>        <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0115"><b>60</b> linear conductor</li>        <li id="ul0003-0006" num="0116"><b>62</b> insulating coating (insulating film)</li>        <li id="ul0003-0007" num="0117"><b>134</b> station (laser separator)</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
