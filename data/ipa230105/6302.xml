To this end, in an embodiment, the case <b>120</b> has a crimping part <b>121</b> that has an upper end bent more inward than the cap assembly <b>130</b>, such that the cap assembly <b>130</b> is fixed so as not to be separated upward, and a beading part <b>122</b> that has a lower portion bent more inward than the cap assembly <b>130</b>, such that the cap assembly <b>130</b> is supported so as not to move downward. A gasket G is installed between the can <b>120</b> and the cap assembly <b>130</b> to insulate the case <b>120</b> and the cap assembly <b>130</b>.

In an embodiment, the top plate <b>131</b> has a notch <b>131</b>A formed therein. Therefore, when the pressure due to an internal gas is greater than a certain pressure (e.g., a preset pressure), the top plate <b>131</b> is broken around the notch <b>131</b>A by the pressure, such that the internal gas can be quickly discharged. The top plate <b>131</b> has a valve hole <b>131</b>B for installing the valve <b>140</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>), and the valve <b>140</b> is installed and operated in the valve hole <b>131</b>B, which will later be explained in further detail.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The support plate <b>132</b> is disposed under the top plate <b>131</b>. The support plate <b>132</b> may be formed to have greater rigidity than the top plate <b>131</b>, for example, to be thicker than the top plate <b>131</b>. Accordingly, by supporting/reinforcing the top plate <b>131</b> by the support plate <b>132</b>, the top plate <b>131</b> can be prevented or substantially prevented from being improperly deformed by an external impact. The support plate <b>132</b> may have a first through hole <b>132</b>A formed at a center thereof. The first through hole <b>132</b>A provides a passage through which the bottom plate <b>134</b> is coupled to the top plate <b>131</b>. In addition, in the support plate <b>132</b>, at least one second through hole <b>132</b>B may be formed around the first through hole <b>132</b>A. The second through hole <b>132</b>B provides a passage for the internal gas to pass therethrough. Accordingly, a pressure due to the internal gas may act on the top plate <b>131</b> through the second through hole <b>132</b>B. If the pressure is greater than a certain pressure (e.g. a preset pressure), the top plate <b>131</b> is broken around the notch <b>131</b>A by the pressure, as described above. At least a portion of the second through hole <b>132</b>B communicates with the valve hole <b>131</b>B of the top plate <b>131</b>. Accordingly, when the valve <b>140</b> is opened, the internal gas may be discharged through the second through hole <b>132</b>B and the valve <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The insulating plate <b>133</b> is disposed between the support plate <b>132</b> and the bottom plate <b>134</b> to insulate the support plate <b>132</b> and the bottom plate <b>134</b>. The insulating plate <b>133</b> may be formed in an annular shape along a corresponding area between the first through hole <b>132</b>A and the second through hole <b>132</b>B so as not to block the first and second through holes <b>132</b>A and <b>132</b>B of the support plate <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The bottom plate <b>134</b> is disposed under the insulating plate <b>133</b> and is electrically connected to the top plate <b>131</b>. In an embodiment, the bottom plate <b>134</b> may include a first region <b>134</b>A in contact with the insulating plate <b>133</b>, a second region <b>134</b>B bent from the first region <b>134</b>A and positioned in the first through hole <b>132</b>A of the support plate <b>132</b>, and a third region <b>134</b>C extending from the second region <b>134</b>B to be in contact with the top plate <b>131</b>. In this case, the bottom plate <b>134</b> may be electrically connected to the second electrode plate <b>112</b> of the electrode assembly <b>110</b> through the first region <b>134</b>A. In an embodiment, in the bottom plate <b>134</b>, a notch <b>134</b>D is formed between the second region <b>134</b>B and the third region <b>134</b>C. Therefore, when the pressure due to the internal gas is greater than a certain pressure (e.g., a preset pressure), the bottom plate <b>134</b> is broken around the notch <b>134</b>D by the pressure, such that the second region <b>134</b>B and the third region <b>134</b>C are separated from each other, thereby blocking the flow of current.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The valve <b>140</b> is installed in the valve hole <b>131</b>B of the top plate <b>131</b> of the cap assembly <b>130</b> and can be selectively opened and closed. In an embodiment, the valve <b>140</b> includes a shaft <b>141</b>, a first flange <b>142</b>, a second flange <b>143</b>, and a spring <b>144</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The shaft <b>141</b> is disposed through the valve hole <b>131</b>B and is installed to be movable up and down. In an embodiment, an outer diameter of the shaft <b>141</b> is formed to be substantially the same as, or slight smaller than, an inner diameter of the valve hole <b>131</b>B to allow smooth sliding motion. In an embodiment, the shaft <b>141</b> has a first opening <b>141</b>A formed on a lower outer circumferential surface, a second opening <b>141</b>B formed on an upper end surface, and a passage <b>141</b>C formed inside to connect the first opening <b>141</b>A and the second opening <b>141</b>B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> illustrate that the passage <b>141</b>C extends in a radial direction from the first opening <b>141</b>A and extends in a longitudinal direction near a center of the shaft <b>141</b> to the second opening <b>141</b>B. In an embodiment, a diameter of the first opening <b>141</b>A is formed to be smaller than a depth or a length of the valve hole <b>131</b>B. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the shaft <b>141</b> moves relatively upward such that the first opening <b>141</b>A comes into contact with the inner circumferential surface of the valve hole <b>131</b>B, thereby closing the valve <b>140</b> (herein, this position is referred to as a &#x201c;closed position&#x201d;). In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the shaft <b>141</b> moves downward from the closed position such that the first opening <b>141</b>A is located below the valve hole <b>131</b>B beyond the valve hole <b>131</b>B, thereby opening the valve <b>140</b> (herein, this position is referred to as an &#x201c;open position&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first flange <b>142</b> protrudes in the radial direction from the upper end of the shaft <b>141</b>. Therefore, when the shaft <b>141</b> moves from the closed position to the open position, the first flange <b>142</b> is constrained in the valve hole <b>131</b>B, thereby further moving the shaft <b>141</b> downward to prevent the shaft <b>141</b> from being separated from the valve hole <b>131</b>B.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Likewise, the second flange <b>143</b> protrudes in the radial direction from the lower end of the shaft <b>141</b>. Therefore, when the shaft <b>141</b> moves from the open position to the closed position, the second flange <b>143</b> is below the valve hole <b>131</b>B, thereby further moving the shaft <b>141</b> upward to prevent the shaft <b>141</b> from being separated from the valve hole <b>131</b>B.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The spring <b>144</b> serves to urge the shaft <b>141</b> into the closed position. Therefore, when an external force is removed after the shaft <b>141</b> moves from the closed position to the open position by the external force, the shaft <b>141</b> automatically returns to the closed position by the spring <b>144</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">On the basis of the configuration described above, a method of discharging an internal gas by using the valve <b>140</b> in the secondary battery <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure will be described below.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a specific process during manufacture of the secondary battery <b>100</b>, it is desired to discharge an internal gas.
