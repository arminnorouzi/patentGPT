The present invention also relates to a process for preparing (1,2-dimethyl-3-methylenecyclopentyl)acetaldehyde.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0002">Pineapple mealybug (scientific name: <i>Dysmicoccus brevipes</i>) is a pest belonging to the order Hemiptera, and sucks the juice of many agricultural plants, such as pineapples, bananas, coffee, and citrus to damage these agricultural plants. Further, pineapple mealybugs discharge honeydew which contains sugar to cause fungi-induced diseases.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">These damage and diseases reduce the yield and quality of such agricultural plants, which is a serious problem.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Generally, insecticides have been used for controlling mealybugs. However, mealybugs live in narrow spaces behind leaves and/or plant barks and are themselves covered with a waxy substance. Therefore, insecticides are difficult to come in contact with the pest body. This results in insufficient effects of the insecticides.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">In the light of adverse effects of insecticides on the environment and human health, there is recently a demand for the development of a new highly safe, and eco-friendly control method such as mating disruption and/or mass trapping using sex pheromones of insects. Development of such a new control method requires the industrial and inexpensive preparation of a sex pheromone in a large amount.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">A sex pheromone of a sexually reproducing lineage of the pineapple mealybug is reported to be an optically active (1S,2S)-(&#x2212;)-(1,2-dimethyl-3-methylenecyclopentyl)acetaldehyde (Non-Patent Literatures 1 and 2 listed below). It is reported that (1R,2R)-(+)-(1,2-dimethyl-3-methylenecyclopentyl)acetaldehyde which is an enantiomer, and (1R,2S)-(1,2-dimethyl-3-methylenecyclopentyl)acetaldehyde and (1S,2R)-(1,2-dimethyl-3-methylenecyclopentyl)acetaldehyde which are diastereomers of this sex pheromone do not adversely affect the attraction activity of natural sex pheromones (Non-Patent Literatures 1 and 2 listed below). Therefore, for the establishment of a technique for controlling the pests utilizing sex pheromones, it is thought to be efficient to establish a process for preparing these stereoisomer mixtures containing natural pheromones, in view of the inexpensive supply of the pheromone and for an economical control method.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">One process for preparing a mixture of stereoisomers of this pheromone is reported as follows. 2,3-Dimethyl-2-cyclopenten-1-ol is acetylated, and then, the reaction product is reacted with a base, and subsequently, reacted with trimethylsilyl chloride, the reaction product is subjected to an Ireland-Claisen rearrangement reaction to form (1,2-dimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)acetic acid as an intermediate, and then, the skeleton of the intermediate is transformed into the skeleton of the target compound, and the functional group of the transformed compound is converted into the target functional group of the target compound to form a mixture of the enantiomers and/or the diastereomers (Non-Patent Literatures 2 and 3 listed below)</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">Like the aforesaid Ireland-Claisen rearrangement reaction, a Johnson-Claisen rearrangement reaction is known as a Claisen rearrangement reaction of an allylalcohol such as a 2-cyclopenten-1-ol compound, in which the 2-cyclopenten-1-ol compound is reacted with a trialkyl orthoacetate in the presence of a weakly acidic catalyst such as propionic acid to form a (2-cyclopentenyl)acetate compound (Non-Patent Literature 4 listed below).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">LIST OF THE LITERATURES</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Non-Patent Literatures</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0009">[Non-Patent Literature 1] J.

Thus, the prior art fails to industrially and economically prepare (1,2-dimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)acetic acid and a (1,2-dimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)acetate ester compound as the intermediate in a large amount.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0015">The present invention has been made in these circumstances, and aims to overcome the aforesaid
