In the two modes, control information related to multicast services is sent in a broadcast manner over an air interface and data information is sent in a broadcast or multicast manner over an air interface.

However, in the related art, a transmission mode of multicast services that is to be selected by the RAN side is usually determined only based on a statistical result of multicast service demands on the RAN side.

A multicast service corresponding to the multicast service identifier may include but is not limited to an MBMS service or an MBS service.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The mode policy information may be used to determine or indicate a transmission mode of the multicast service corresponding to the multicast service identifier, and the mode policy information may include but is not limited to one or more of a transmission mode type, quality of service requirement information, and the like. Optionally, the mode policy information may be information determined by the core-network-side device based on a quality of service requirement of the multicast service corresponding to the multicast service identifier, a statistical result of joined UEs of the multicast service, and the like.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Step <b>302</b>: Send, in a first transmission mode, data of the multicast service corresponding to the multicast service identifier, where the first transmission mode is a transmission mode determined based on the mode policy information, or the first transmission mode is a transmission mode indicated by the mode policy information.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In this embodiment, the access-network-side device may determine, based on the mode policy information sent by the core-network-side device, a transmission mode for sending the data of the multicast service corresponding to the multicast service identifier. The transmission mode of the multicast service may include a unicast mode, a multicast mode, and the like. The unicast mode may include a point-to-point (Point to Point, PTP) mode, and the multicast mode may include a point-to-multipoint (Point to Multipoint, PTM) mode.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, in a case that a protocol predefines that the mode policy information sent by the core-network-side device serves as reference information (also referred to as a reference basis), the access-network-side device may determine, with reference to the mode policy information, the first transmission mode for sending the data of the multicast service corresponding to the multicast service identifier. In a case that the protocol predefines that the mode policy information sent by the core-network-side device serves as mandatory indication information (also referred to as an only basis), the access-network-side device may directly use the first transmission mode indicated by the mode policy information to send the data of the multicast service corresponding to the multicast service identifier. Alternatively, the core-network-side device may indicate to the access-network-side device whether the mode policy information is used as reference information or mandatory indication information, so that the access-network-side device may determine, according to the indication of the core-network-side device, whether to determine, with reference to the mode policy information, a transmission mode for sending the data of the multicast service corresponding to the multicast service identifier, or to directly use a transmission mode indicated by the mode policy information to send the data of the multicast service corresponding to the multicast service identifier.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">It should be noted that, in a case that the access-network-side device determines, based on the mode policy information, the first transmission mode for sending the data of the multicast service, the access-network-side device may determine, only based on the mode policy information, a transmission mode of the data of the multicast service. For example, in a case that the mode policy information includes quality of service requirement information, if a reliability requirement in the quality of service requirement information is relatively high, the data of the multicast service may be sent in the PTP mode; otherwise, the data of the multicast service may be sent in the PTM mode. Alternatively, the access-network-side device may determine the transmission mode of the data of the multicast service based on both the mode policy information and other mode parameters, for example, may determine, based on the mode policy information, a statistical result of joined UEs of the multicast service, a resource status of the access-network-side device, and the like, the transmission mode of the data of the multicast service.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the service transmission method provided by this embodiment of the present disclosure, the first message is received from the core-network-side device, where the first message includes the multicast service identifier and the mode policy information; and the data of the multicast service corresponding to the multicast service identifier is sent in the first transmission mode, where the first transmission mode is a transmission mode determined based on the mode policy information, or the first transmission mode is a transmission mode indicated by the mode policy information. In this way, the data of the multicast service corresponding to the multicast service identifier is sent in the transmission mode determined based on or indicated by the mode policy information sent by the core-network-side device. This not only provides a decision-making basis different from that in the related art for determining the transmission mode of the multicast service, but also makes sending of the multicast service better satisfy the quality of service requirements.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Optionally, the mode policy information includes a transmission mode type or quality of service requirement information.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one implementation, the core-network-side device may explicitly indicate, to the access-network-side device, the transmission mode of the data of the multicast service, for example, the transmission mode type such as a PTP mode or a PTM mode may be directly carried in the first message.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Correspondingly, the access-network-side device may directly use a transmission mode indicated by the transmission mode type to send the data of the multicast service, that is, the transmission mode type is used as the only basis for determining the transmission mode of the multicast service. For example, if the transmission mode type is a PTP mode, the data of the multicast service is sent in the PTP mode; or if the transmission mode type is a PTM mode, the data of the multicast service is sent in the PTM mode. Alternatively, the access-network-side device may determine, with reference to the transmission mode type, a transmission mode for sending the data of the multicast service, that is, the transmission mode type is used as a reference basis for determining the transmission mode of the multicast service.
