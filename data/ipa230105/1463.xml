id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a spiral tube capable of improving resistance performance against a collapse load generated by a difference between an internal pressure and an external pressure.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">For example, in a high-speed train system, of <b>300</b> km/h or more, two resistances must be solved depending on the speed. One is to design an aerodynamic travelling body to reduce air resistance rising exponentially, and the other introduce a magnetic levitation system to reduce frictional resistance between the travelling body and a track.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Meanwhile, in a Hyperloop Concept, raised by Elon Musk in 2012 and first introduced by the technical staff of Tesla and SpaceX, a technology that can transport passengers at a maximum speed of 1200 km/h without air resistance by inserting a small travelling body (usually 28 seats) into a vacuum tube sealed at a pressure of approximately 0.001 atm, is proposed. Thereafter, various attempts have been made to actually implement such a system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this attempt, while the electromagnetic and mechanical levitation and propulsion systems are important, it is also important to implement a tube structure to maintain a sub-vacuum state of approximately 0.001 atmosphere in infrastructure, accounting for about 50% or more of an initial investment value.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since the tube is set to be larger than a cross-sectional area of the travelling body since the tube is a passage through which a travelling body a passenger or a cargo moves, in general, a blockage ratio expressed by a. cross-sectional area of the travelling body to a blockage ratio of the tube is 0.38 to 0.60.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, in the hyperloop concept proposed in 2012, it was shown that when a diameter of the travelling body is 1.38 m a blockage ratio is 0.38, but when the diameter of the travelling body is 1.38 m, a height at which a person cannot stand up, there may be disadvantages to the passenger's boarding ability. Recently, in approaches such as Virgin Hyperloop One, the diameter of the travelling body is 2.4 m and the diameter of the tube is 3.66 m, which has a trend of enlargement.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There are several mechanical performance requirements for the tube. One thereof is that an outgassing rate must be low to maintain a sub-vacuum of approximately 0.001 atm. For example, the steel material has excellent characteristics such as yield strength and tensile strength, but at about 0.001 atm, the outgassing rate is excellent compared to concrete or polymer composite materials, which are other candidate materials for the tube, so a tube made of steel material is considered first.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As the diameter of the tube increases, a thickness of the tube also increases. For example, according to a pipeline design standard (DNV-OS-F101 standard), for example, when the diameter increases to 4 m, a safety thickness securing the resistance to collapse load along with a safety factor increases to 28.4 mm. Here, if the thickness of the steel is thicker than 25 mm, there is a significant restriction on a production method of the tube,</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Specifically, a production equipment is set so that the hot-rolled coil of steel has a thickness of 25 mm or less, and steel products having a thickness of 25 mm or more usually have to be manufactured as a thick plate, When manufacturing a tube, a production cost of thick plate products is much higher than that of the continuous process of hot-rolled coils using a method that a continuous process cannot be performed. Therefore, it is necessary to make the thickness of the tube 25 mm or less to enable a continuous process in the manufacture of the tube and to reduce the initial investment cost.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As related prior art, there is an invention disclosed in Republic of Korea Patent Publication No. 1731869 B1 (noticed on May 4, 2017).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">An aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a spiral tube capable of improving resistance performance against a collapse load generated by a difference between an internal pressure and an external pressure, while having a reduced thickness.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a spiral tube includes: a tube body in which a strip is connected in a spiral shape and welded at a front end thereof;

Such a smooth surface is especially for smooth movement of fluids (gas, oil, water, or the like) inside the spiral tube.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">On the other hand, the spiral tube according to the present disclosure is intended to be used as a tube in which the travelling body moves at a predetermined distance from the inner surface and has a vacuum thereinside. In the spiral tube, the resistance performance against the collapse load may be sufficiently secured.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to exemplary drawings.

shape is employed, so that an effect of reinforcing rigidity of the spiral tube can be further increased.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described above, the spiral tube according to an embodiment of the present disclosure adopts the stiffener <b>2</b> coupled to the inner surface thereof, so that it is possible to safely secure the resistance performance of the spiral tube against the collapse load caused by a pressure difference between an internal pressure, which is almost a vacuum, and an external pressure, which is atmospheric pressure.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In particular, when a diameter increases to 4 m in a normal pipeline, a safety thickness securing the resistance performance against the collapse load along with the safety factor increases to 28.4 mm, but in the spiral tube according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the thickness of the tube body <b>1</b> can be reduced to 25 mm or less while securing the same performance due to the stiffener <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next, an important factor affecting the resistance performance of the spiral tube against the collapse load is ovality, which is a geometrical characteristic of the tube itself.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, when the tube body <b>1</b> has a diameter of <b>4</b> m, which is a large diameter, and has ovality of about 5.0%, a long axis diameter of the tube body increases by about 100 mm compared to a nominal diameter of 4 m. As a minor axis diameter is reduced by about 100 mm, the tube body may have an elliptical cross-sectional shape.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The eliptical phenomenon may appear when forming the tube body <b>1</b>, and may be further deteriorated by an external load during transport or construction of the tube body.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the case of spiral tube whose inside is maintained an almost vacuum state, because of this elliptical phenomenon, when external atmospheric pressure acts as a load, collapse tends to occur in a direction of the minor axis diameter, so control of the elliptical phenomenon is required.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As the elliptical phenomenon increases, the resistance performance against the collapse load decreases, so that the spiral tube according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may employ the stiffener <b>2</b> coupled to an inner surface thereof when the tube body <b>1</b> is formed, thereby safely securing the resistance performance against the collapse load by minimizing the elliptical phenomenon.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> are views illustrating collapse analysis of the spiral tube according to the prior art and the present disclosure</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates a shape of numerical analysis of a collapse of a spiral tube according to the prior art, the spiral tube of the prior art. having a diameter of 4 m, a thickness of 25 mm, and ovality of 5% applied thereto.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition, a maximum resistive pressure was 0.17 MPa by applying a steel material having yield strength of 400 MPa and tensile strength of 440 MPa.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">However, considering a safety factor of 2.0, it can be seen that the spiral tube according to the prior art. cannot resist atmospheric pressure when an inside thereof is almost in a vacuum state and collapses, In other words, if the diameter is <b>4</b> m, a tube having a thickness of 25 mm cannot be used, and the thickness of the tube must be further increased.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrates a shape of numerical analysis for a collapse of a spiral tube according to the present disclosure, and the spiral tube of the present disclosure having a diameter of 4 m and a thickness of 25 mm, and ovality of 5% applied thereto.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition, the same steel material as that of the spiral tube of the prior art was used.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the spiral tube according to the present disclosure, a maximum resistance pressure was shown to 0.30 MPa by a stiffener <b>2</b> coupled to an inner surface thereof, and when an inside thereof is vacuum even considering a safety factor of 2.0, it can be seen that it resists an external atmospheric pressure, which is 1 atm.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As described above, according to the present disclosure, by locating the stiffener in the tube body, resistance performance against he collapse load may be provided, while reducing the thickness of the tube.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described in more detail through examples.
