Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Digital interfaces are used to transmit data between electronic devices. Certain digital interfaces are designed or configured specially to transmit a particular type of data on a particular data path. For example, digital interfaces such as USB Audio are configured to transmit audio data on an audio data path (e.g., audio channel). However, having digital interfaces designed or configured for transmissions of only certain types of data (e.g., audio data) on certain data paths can be limiting in cases where there are no other or limited concurrent suitable alternatives for transmissions of other types of data (e.g., general data, bulk data); thus, causing a constrained efficiency in the digital interface's usage. As a consequence, systems with these dedicated digital interfaces can also be limiting.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there is a need to utilize dedicated digital interfaces for different data types. Specifically, there is a need to use digital interfaces that are dedicated for certain types of data for transmission of other types of data. There is also a need to accommodate for the transmission of different types of data over a dedicated digital interface.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it is desirable to provide systems and methods for transmitting data over a digital interface to address the above needs.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect of the invention, a method for transmitting data over a digital interface is provided.

Examples of the preferred embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in conjunction with these preferred embodiments, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to such preferred embodiments. On the contrary, it is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. The present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known mechanisms have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It should be noted herein that throughout the various drawings like numerals refer to like parts. The various drawings illustrated and described herein are used to illustrate various features of the invention. To the extent that a particular feature is illustrated in one drawing and not another, except where otherwise indicated or where the structure inherently prohibits incorporation of the feature, it is to be understood that those features may be adapted to be included in the embodiments represented in the other figures, as if they were fully illustrated in those figures. Unless otherwise indicated, the drawings are not necessarily to scale. Any dimensions provided on the drawings are not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the invention but merely illustrative.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Systems and techniques are provided to transmit data over a digital interface between sender and receiver devices (e.g., computer, mobile phone, media players, mobile devices, etc.). The digital interface is configured for transmitting a primary type of data as opposed to a secondary type of data; thereby, resulting in at least a technical problem of constrained efficiency in digital interfaces and systems using them. Nevertheless, systems and techniques are provided where the secondary type of data can be transmitted in the digital interface to solve the technical problem of constrained efficiency in digital interfaces and systems using them. As such, the primary and/or secondary types of data are transmitted from the sender to the receiver via the digital interface. The primary and secondary types of data may be different and/or unrelated and could be any type of data including, but not limited to, audio data, general data, and bulk data. Yet, the received primary and secondary types of data are still useful after the transmission.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">An advantage of the present invention allows for the use of an existing digital interface (or digital transport or channel) that was designed or configured for transmitting a particular data type (e.g., primary type data) to be used for transmitting additional related/unrelated information, which may be in the form of another data type (e.g., secondary type data). For example, digital audio transmission has become ubiquitous in consumer AV devices via digital interfaces (e.g., optical/coaxial SPDIF, HDMI, USB Audio, AES i2s, etc.). Although these transports are digital in nature, they are configured/designed specifically for transmitting audio data (e.g., on audio channel(s) specific for audio data) instead of transmitting data such as bulk data or general data (other than data for handshaking since the purpose of handshaking is to establish a transport). Therefore, rather than establishing or creating separate data channel(s), the present invention can allow for the transmission of data such as bulk data or general data on digital audio-playback transports using the existing audio channel(s).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">To make a person skilled in the art understand the technical solutions to the technical problem better, the following clearly and completely describes the technical solutions in the example embodiments with reference to any accompany drawings. The described embodiments are merely some but not all of the embodiments. All other embodiments obtained by a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments without creative efforts shall fall within the protection scope.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with respect to audio and audio transports, the present invention can be adapted for other media types and transports. Data generally sounds like white noise and is very loud. Its' presence in the transport should not result in an unpleasant user-experience or worse, a damaged loudspeaker/transducer. Therefore, once the audio transport is established, the preferred embodiments of present invention are based on various requirements, including: 1) making as little modification as possible to the existing architecture (e.g., preserve existing architecture as much as possible; do minimal modification if any in order for the data to ride on the existing transport); 2) having adjustable audio fidelity quality and options to preserve its' quality as much as possible (e.g., none or minimal distortion when data is transmitted); 3) having data rate set as high as possible; 4) having a data return control path, though optional, is desirable to confirm that the data was received successfully by the receiver from the sender (although a bidirectional path is desirable, it can merely be an asymmetric path and it does not need to be a high capacity return path if it's simply for feedback and acknowledgment (e.g., yes, no, success, failed). Some of these requirements are competing and a balance may be made depending on use-case.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to one embodiment, data is hidden in a PCM (pulse code modulation) audio stream, which includes samples of an audio waveform. For example, a last n-bits technique may be implemented for data hiding. To elaborate, the last bit of a 16 bit data that represents a single sample may be used for data. The last bit of the audio signal may be ignored and data injected into it at the sender. Then the last bit with the injected data may be retrieved to construct the data at the receiver. One bit or n bits may be used for the injected data. Adjusting n controls bandwidth vs. audio fidelity tradeoffs. The more n increases for data bandwidth, the more audio fidelity suffers. Depending on the length of the sample, one or two bits may be acceptable. Yet, 5 or 6 bits may not be acceptable (strange things may be heard). Therefore, balancing between increasing bandwidth and maintaining acceptable audio fidelity is necessary. Since the least significant bit normally represents the smallest change, changes to the least significant bit will affect the audio signal the least.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For another example, data hiding in the frequency domain includes at the sender a first transform into the frequency domain, hide or embed data in the higher frequency where the higher frequency content is replaced with injected data, then inverse transform to get back to time domain for transmission to the receiver. Then at the receiver, a complemented process is performed for decoding, extracting, un-hiding, reconstructing, and/or recovering the data. High frequency is chosen because human ears are less sensitive to hearing changes in the high frequencies as compared to low frequencies. Hiding can be done in different domains (e.g., wavelet, DCT (discrete cosine transform), and Hadamard transform). Since data is being hidden in the PCM, the data hiding can include FEC (forward error correction). FEC contains some redundancy data for correcting errors in the received data without using a back channel. FEC may be as simple as sending some redundancy data twice or as sophisticated as Reed Solomon coding. Yet, general error correction may be included with the use of a return path (e.g. retransmit)</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">None of these schemes under this embodiment requires any change in the existing transport. Rather, they capitalize on modifying the PCM data. Therefore, these schemes can work with any transport transmitting PCM data. Choosing the frequency band determines bandwidth vs. audio fidelity tradeoff. There can also be dynamic bandwidth adjustments depending on music content. For example, the frequencies may dynamically increase or decrease the chosen band of frequencies (may include any of low, mid, or high (preferable) frequencies) based on achieving acceptable audio fidelity for the music content being transmitted for playback. Aspects of this embodiment may capitalize on a masking effect to inject more data into surrounding frequency bands of a high energy band. Further, the receiver may be signaled by the sender to mute the volume on playback during a pause or transition between music tracks where the sender transmits data at full bandwidth between music tracks. During an audio stream for playback, the present invention allows for audio on a separate channel, data on a separate channel, and audio and data (in same packet/file and/or in different packets/file) on a common channel to be transmitted.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Another aspect of this embodiment may include having the sender (source) compress the PCM data (using existing compression methods such as ADPCM, MP3, or AAC), and use the recovered bandwidth to transmit data. Receiver (sink) then un-compresses the PCM data and reconstructs/recovers the transmitted data. A ten times compression is common, leaving about 90% of the bandwidth available for data transmission. Using half of this to attenuate the volume level, there is still about 45% data efficiency. The compression may be performed on a continuous stream (rather than per-file), e.g., it is possible to achieve higher compression level during silent pauses or transitions between the music tracks. Although this may increase the complexity of the system, it further increases the data bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Other aspects of this embodiment may include implementing Sync signals to trigger the receiver to start decoding incoming data. Sync signal can be in a predefined header (a sequence of bits) which may contain an identifier and optional parameters describing the incoming data. The identifier is preferred since it is unlikely to occur in natural music/sound.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to another embodiment, some modifications may be made at the receiver and/or sender. For example, a technique may be implemented to use free audio channels. If the transport allows for multichannel, e.g. 8 channels, but only 2 channels are being used to transmit stereo, then it is possible to exploit the remaining unused and free 6 channels to transmit data. For USB audio, it is configurable to have 8 channels. In other words, it has the bandwidth to handle 8 channels (e.g., speaker channels FR, FL, RR, RL, C, SL, SR, and SUB). Receiver may declare to sender that it can handle 8 channels. Sender may respond that it only uses two channels. Receiver may still request for sender to provide 8 channels. As such, sender sends 2 channels and leaves the other 6 channels empty for sender/receiver to transmit embedded data. To negotiate 8 channels, there might not be an available handshake standard, so it may be necessary to fake the 8 channels. The amount of modifications to the receiver and/or sender may depend on the amount of control that is available over the receiver and/or sender.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">For another example, a technique for channel reduction may be implemented. To elaborate, the technique includes reducing stereo to mono and transmitting data using the freed up channel. A downside is that the data channel is likely to sound noisy. Alternatively, it is possible to omit the whole stereo audio, then sender will have two freed up channels to transmit data at full bandwidth. This will affect the end user from receiving any audio, but it may be fine if this is short or temporary for embedded data transmissions. User may just hear a short pulse and then be done with it.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to various embodiments, a return channel (or reverse channel) may be implemented. There are various ways to do this. For example, a technique includes utilizing a protocol's recording path. USB Audio may be bi-directional to allow playback and recording. The recording path is digital and may be used in a similar manner to provide a return channel to the playback source. By opening the recording path, it is possible to use it to communicate from receiver back to sender.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For another example, a technique includes utilizing a protocol's control path. Some protocols such as USB HID (human interface device) protocol has a control path. Most audio playback devices have some controls (e.g., play, pause, forward, reverse) buttons, and their key presses are transmitted back to the playback source via USB HID. The receiver may emulate these key presses to transmit data back to the playback source. For a mobile phone, a USB Audio transport is established between the mobile phone and a device to playback audio on the device. Since the source is remote at the mobile phone (sender), it is possible that the mobile phone can accept some control of the media playback (e.g., play, pause, next track, forward, reverse etc.) from the device (receiver). During the data transmission, these controls can be used as a way to provide feedback to the sender. Forward control could mean &#x201c;thank you, data received properly.&#x201d; Reverse control could mean &#x201c;there is a problem with data transmission.&#x201d; By having just these two states, various representations of the data are possible. For instance, transmitting back two signals can be implemented similar to Morse code. In particular, Morse code has one state (up, down) and duration that can be used to transmit any data. If two states, more data can be transmitted faster. So by using forward, reverse, and other existing commands, it is possible to have any number of corresponding states (e.g., 2, 3, 4, etc.). In this way, control commands can be used to transmit data from receiver back to sender.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">For yet another example, a technique includes utilizing an auxiliary path. Auxiliary paths are return paths that are not part of the transmission path protocol. In the case of a Bluetooth headset, the microphone path may be used in conjunction with USB Audio transmission.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Finally in another example, a technique includes utilizing manual feedback. At the data receiving end, the device's LED blinking and color may provide a &#x2018;manual&#x2019; user return path. So a successful transmission should conclude with a joyous display of blinks and colors, and conversely for failed transmission. The user can then tap some sender's user-interface button to retry.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is noted that individual embodiments may be described as a process which may be depicted as a flowchart, a flow diagram, a data flow diagram, a structure diagram, or a block diagram. Although a flowchart may describe the operations as a sequential process, many of the operations can be performed in parallel or concurrently. In addition, the order of the operations may be re-arranged. A process is terminated when its operations are completed, but could have additional steps not included in a drawing. A process may correspond to a method, a function, a procedure, a subroutine, a subprogram, etc.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is also noted that one or more features/process described herein may be implemented in a computer-usable data and/or computer-executable instructions, such as in one or more program modules, executed by one or more computers or other devices.
