VP642 from Palau. Being a small linear peptide molecule, dolastatin 10 is considered a promising anti-cancer drug showing potency against breast and liver cancers, solid tumors and some types of leukemias. Preclinical research indicated potency in experimental antineoplastic and tubulin assembly systems.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="42.25mm" wi="76.03mm" file="US20230000995A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Dolastatin 10 is a mitotic inhibitor that acts on the microtubule assembly by interfering with tubulin formation and thereby disrupt cell division by mitosis and induces apoptosis and Bcl-2 phosphorylation in several malignant cell types. It also noncompetitively inhibits binding of vincristine to tubulin (at a location known as the vinca/peptide region), while having been shown to bind to the RZX/MAY region.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">Dolastatin 10 is chemically related to symplostatin and analogues thereof, and the family of auristatins are potent synthetic analogs of dolastatin 10. Dolastatin 10 has been shown to inhibit the growth of L1210 murine leukemia cells in culture, with a concordant rise in the mitotic index, and its IC50 value for cell growth was 0.5 nM. Comparable values for the other drugs were 0.5 nM for maytansine, 1 nM for rhizoxin, 20 nM for vinblastine, and 7 &#x3bc;M for phomopsin A. IC50 values were also obtained for the polymerization of purified tubulin in glutamate: 1.2 &#x3bc;M for dolastatin 10, 1.4 &#x3bc;M for phomopsin A, 1.5 &#x3bc;M for vinblastine, 3.5 &#x3bc;M for maytansine, and 6.8 &#x3bc;M for rhizoxin. Dolastatin 10 and vinblastine were comparable in their effects on microtubule assembly dependent on microtubule associated proteins. Preliminary studies indicated that dolastatin 10, like vinblastine, causes formation of a cold-stable tubulin aggregate at higher drug concentrations. Dolastatin 10 was shown to be the strongest inhibitor of the binding of radiolabeled vinblastine and vincristine to tubulin.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">Bai, Ruoli, et al.

The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0053">As presented hereinabove, dolastatin 10 is a potent antimitotic peptide isolated from the marine mollusk Dolabella <i>auricularia</i>. Four of its five residues are modified amino acids (in sequence, dolavaline, valine, dolaisoleuine, dolaproine, dolaphenine). Besides inhibiting tubulin polymerization, dolastatin 10 noncompetitively inhibits vinca alkaloid binding to tubulin, inhibits nucleotide exchange and formation of the &#x3b2;s cross-link, and stabilizes the colchicine binding activity of tubulin.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0054">It is difficult to link dolastatin 10 to potential carriers due to lack of functional groups suitable for effective conjugation. Therefore, modified analogs known in the art are used for conjugation through modified N-terminus (typically, monomethyl Val or alpha-amino isobutyric acid).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0055">While conceiving the present invention, the inventor contemplated a dolastatin 10 analog that would allow the potent peptide to be conjugated to a bioactive, diagnostic or labeling moiety, such as an antibody, a nanoparticle, a protein, a biodegradable polymer, a peptide, and the likes, with minimal reduction of activity compared to the activity of the naturally occurring molecule. The inventor had further contemplated a modification that introduces a functional group to dolastatin 10&#x2014;one which would allow conjugating a dolastatin 10 analog to a bioactive, diagnostic or labeling moiety via a biocleavable linker. The inventor had further contemplated a modification that would be conducive to solid-state peptide synthesis methodologies that would open the possibility of rapid, effective and versatile high-throughput preparation and screening of series of analogs and conjugates thereof.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0056">While reducing the present invention to practice, the inventor directed the abovementioned modification to the C-terminus of dolastatin 10, particularly to the thiazole moiety that exhibits two aromatic carbon positions capable of various substitutions (positions 18 and 19 in the structure presented in the Background section above).

In some embodiments, the term &#x201c;moiety&#x201d; refers to the major part of a molecule being attached to another molecule or a functional group. In some embodiments, the moiety substantially exhibits the same biologic activity of the molecule. In some embodiments, the moiety can generate the molecule upon cleavage from a conjugate comprising the same.

A linking moiety may include atoms that form a part of one or both of the chemical moieties it links, and/or include atoms that do not form a part of one or both of the chemical moieties it links. For example, a peptide bond (amide) linking moiety that links two amino acids includes at least a nitrogen atom and a hydrogen atom from one amino acid and at least a carboxyl of the other amino acid. In general, the linking moiety can be formed during a chemical reaction, such that by reacting two or more functional/reactive groups, the linking moiety is formed as a new chemical entity which can comprise a bond (between two atoms), or one or more bonded atoms. Alternatively, the linking moiety can be a chemical moiety comprising two or more reactive groups to which the reactive groups of other compounds can be attached, either directly or indirectly.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0083">In the context of some embodiments of the present invention, the term &#x201c;linking moiety&#x201d; is synonymous with the term &#x201c;cleavable linker&#x201d;, meaning that the linking moiety is selected or designed to break under certain conditions, or at certain locations in the treated subject. The term &#x201c;biocleavable linker&#x201d;, for example, refers to a cleavable linker that, inter alia, breaks under physiological conditions.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0084">The positions at which the elements of the conjugate are linked to one-another are generally selected such that once cleaved off the conjugate, any or at least some of the moieties stemming from the cleavage substantially exhibit their original biological activity (mechanism of biological activity), or at least some thereof. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the linking moiety is formed such that the biological activity of the elements of the conjugate remains substantially the same as the biological activity of the standalone elements, while still in the conjugated form. In some embodiments, the functional moiety of the conjugate can be regarded as a prodrug as long as it is bound to the conjugate that regains its original functional activity once cleaved-off the conjugate.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0085">Representative examples of reactive (functional) groups that may be used to form a cleavable linker include, without limitation, acyl halide, aldehyde, alkoxy, alkyne, amide, amine, aryloxy, azide, aziridine, azo, carbamate, carbonyl, carboxyl, carboxylate, cyano, diene, dienophile, epoxy, guanidine, guanyl, halide, hydrazide, hydrazine, hydroxy, hydroxylamine, imino, isocyanate, isothiocyanate, maleimide, N-hydroxycuccinimide, carboxylic acid halide, alkyl halide, nitro, phosphate, phosphonate, sulfinyl, sulfonamide, sulfonate, thioalkoxy, thioaryloxy, thiocarbamate, thiocarbonyl, thiohydroxy, thiourea and urea, as these terms are defined hereinafter.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0086">According some embodiments of the present invention, various elements of the conjugate presented herein are attached to one or more linking moieties via spacer moieties. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;spacer moiety&#x201d; describes a chemical moiety that typically extends between two chemical moieties and is attached to each of the chemical moieties via covalent bonds. The spacer moiety may be linear or cyclic, be branched or unbranched, rigid or flexible, hydrophobic or hydrophilic.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0087">The nature of the spacer moieties can be regarded as having an effect on two aspects, the synthetic aspect, namely the influence of the spacer moieties on the process of preparing the conjugates presented herein, and the influence of the spacer moieties on the biology activity of the conjugates in terms of drug-release profile(s), biological activity, bioavailability and other ADME-Tox considerations.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0088">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the spacer moieties are selected such that they allow and/or promote the conjugation reaction between various elements of the conjugates presented herein, and reduce the probability for the formation of side-products due to undesired reactions. Such traits can be selected for in terms of spacer's length, flexibility, structure and specific chemical reactivity or lack thereof. Spacer moieties with fewer reactive groups will present a simpler synthetic challenge, requiring less protection/deprotection steps and affording higher chemical yields. For example, saturated and linear alkyls of 1-10, or 1-5 carbon atoms, having one reactive group at the end atom for conjugation with a corresponding reactive group, would afford substantially higher yield and fewer side products. Similarly, a spacer moiety based on one or two chained benzyl rings would also lead to an efficient conjugation reaction.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0089">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the spacer moieties are selected such that they provide favorable cleavage conditions, as these are discussed hereinbelow. For example, a spacer may alter the accessibility of an enzyme to the linking moiety, thereby allowing the enzyme to cleave the linkage between the bioactive agent and the conjugate.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;targeting moiety&#x201d; describes a molecular entity that exhibits an affinity to a desired molecular or bodily site (e.g., particular organ, cells, tissues, organelles, biopolymers, receptors or the likes). In some embodiments, a targeting moiety is specific to certain targets. The target is typically a biomolecule that occurs at a higher concentration or exclusively at the targeted bodily site. In some embodiments, the targeting moiety is a biomolecule or a derivative thereof that has a specific and relatively high affinity to the target.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0212">Targeting moieties are often employed as the bimolecular carrier in order to direct a drug to specific structures in the body or sites of physiological functions. According to some embodiments, a targeting moiety is a compound with structure or site specific reactivity.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0213">Exemplary targeting agents include, without limitation, peptides, proteins, porphyrins, hormones, antigens, haptens, antibodies and fragments thereof, DNA fragments, RNA fragments and analogs and derivatives thereof, and any receptor ligands that bind to receptors that are expressed specifically or more abundantly at the targeted bodily sites.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0214">As used herein, the term &#x201c;biomolecule&#x201d; refers to molecules (e.g., polypeptides, amino acids, polynucleotides, nucleotides, polysaccharides, sugars, lipids, nucleoproteins, glycoproteins, lipoproteins, steroids, metabolites, etc.) whether naturally-occurring or artificially created (e.g., by synthetic or recombinant methods) that are commonly found in cells and tissues. Specific classes of biomolecules include, but are not limited to, enzymes, receptors, neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, cell response modifiers such as growth factors and chemotactic factors, antibodies, vaccines, haptens, toxins, interferons, ribozymes, anti-sense agents, plasmids, DNA, and RNA.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0215">In some embodiments, a targeting moiety comprises a cell-internalizing moiety, such that the molecular structure can more readily penetrate a targeted cell. Exemplary cell-internalizing moieties include, without limitation, positively charges (at physiological environment) moieties such as guanidines and amines, and moieties containing same (e.g., arginine and lysine).</p><p id="p-0223" num="0216">In some embodiments, the targeting moiety exhibits a specific affinity to cancerous cells and neoplastic tissues. Such targeting moieties may be used to target the molecular structure presented herein, thereby delivering anticancerous bioactive agents, according to some embodiments of the present invention, to cancerous cells and tissues. The result is an enhanced effect and an improved exposure of the cancerous cells and neoplastic tissues to the anticancerous bioactive agent, preferably accompanied by reduced exposure of non-cancerous cells to the anticancerous bioactive agents.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0217">A class of compounds that is suitable as targeting moieties, according to some embodiments of the present invention, are short peptides and peptide analogs, generally referred to herein as peptidomimetic compounds, that display more favorable pharmacological properties than their prototype native peptides. The native peptide itself, the pharmacological properties of which have been optimized, generally serves as a lead for the development of these peptidomimetics. In general, a small number of amino acids (usually four to eight) are responsible for the biological activity (recognition and binding; targeting) of a peptide ligand (targeting moiety) by a receptor (target). Once this biologically active site is determined, a lead structure for development of peptidomimetic can be optimized, for example by molecular modeling programs. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,811,392, 6,407,059 and 7,084,244, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, describe the preparation and use of a class of cyclic peptidomimetic targeting moieties, which can be used in the context of some embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0218">Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) constitute an exemplary class of targeting moiety that may be used in the context of some embodiments of the present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 6,395,474, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes PNA as an analogue of DNA in which the phosphodiester backbone of DNA is replaced with a pseudo-peptide such as N-(2-amino-ethyl)-glycine. Methylenecarbonyl linkers attach DNA, RNA, or synthetic nucleobases to the polyamide backbone. PNA, obeying Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding rules, mimics the behavior of DNA and RNA by binding to complementary nucleic acid sequences such as those found in DNA, RNA, and other PNAs. An exemplary molecular structure utilizing PNA, according to some embodiments of the present invention, may bind, for example, to a specific mutated nucleic acid sequence found in the DNA of a cancerous tumor.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0219">One example of a class of targeting moieties, which can be used advantageously in the context of embodiments of the present invention, is the family of tumor-targeting moieties that bind selectively to &#x3b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x3b2;<sub>3 </sub>and &#x3b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x3b2;<sub>5 </sub>integrins, referred to herein as the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) family [Arap, W. et al., <i>Science, </i>1998, 279(5349):377-80].

In addition to the dolastatin 10 analog, some of the functional moieties contemplated above and demonstrated below, can also be prepared by SSPS techniques and reagents, as also demonstrated in the Examples section that follows.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0224">The use of SSPS allows diversification of the product, namely allows relatively simple exploration of analogs space aiming at discovering new compounds with improved bioactivity and ADME-Tox properties, and optimization thereof. For example, since the conjugate, according to some embodiments of the present invention, may comprise a number of naturally occurring and/or synthetic amino-acid residues, as well as other conjugate elements that are built into the structure by SSPS, such as the linker, it would be relatively simple to form a family of analogous conjugates using standard or high-throughput SSPS techniques.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0225">Hence, according to some embodiments of the present invention, there is provided a process for producing the dolastatin 10 analog provided herein, using SSPS approach. The process may include a step of attaching a first peptide unit of the analog to a solid support resin, and thereafter adding the next peptide units sequentially before releasing the resulting molecule from the resin. The first peptide unit of the dolastatin 10 analog to be attached the resin may be an amine-protected variant of 2-(1-(<sup>&#x3bb;2</sup>-azaneyl)-2-phenylethyl)-5/6-(A-B-substituted)-thiazole, such as BU-5, presented hereinbelow. The following peptide units to be coupled to the first unit may be an amine-protected derivative of (2R,3R)-3-methoxy-2-methyl-3-((S)-pyrrolidin-2-yl)propanoic acid (BU-1), followed by an amine-protected derivative of (3R,4S,5S)-3-methoxy-5-methyl-4-(methylamino)heptanoic acid (BU-2), followed by an amine-protected derivative of Val-OH, followed by dimethyl-Val to afford Dolas-OL after cleaving the nascent peptide from the resin.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0226">In embodiments wherein the conjugate comprises a peptide-like functional moiety, the same approach h may be applied, starting from constructing the functional moiety or from the dolastatin 10 analog side, and working the way down the sequence to afford a complete conjugate.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0227">The linker moiety may also be part of the SSPS process, or alternatively, the two major moiety of the conjugate may be synthesized separately, by SSPS or otherwise, and thereafter be coupled to form a linking moiety.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0228">Medical Conditions:</p><p id="p-0236" num="0229">The dolastatin 10 analog presented herein can be used to treat any medical condition that is treatable by dolastatin 10, by administration of a therapeutically effective amount of the dolastatin 10 analog to a subject in need thereof.

Currently available anticancer chemotherapies act by affecting specific molecular targets in proliferating cancer cells, leading to inhibition of essential intracellular processes such as DNA transcription, synthesis and replication.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0240">Unfortunately anticancerous drugs are highly toxic, as they are designed to kill mammalian cells, and are therefore harmful also to normal proliferating cells resulting in debilitating and even lethal side effects. Some of these adverse effects are gastrointestinal toxicity, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea when the epithelial lining of the intestine is affected. Other side effects include alopecia, when the hair follicles are attacked, bone marrow suppression and neutropenia due to toxicity of hematopoietic precursors. Therefore the effectiveness of currently used anticancerous drugs is dose-limited due to their toxicity to normal rapidly growing cells. The use of a conjugate according to embodiments of the present invention, can optimize the balance between the desired anticancer activity of certain anticancer drugs and their adverse side effects, by quantitative determination of the actual amount of drug released in the targeted cells.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0241">One of the contemporary approaches in the fight against cancer is engineering of molecular targeted drugs that permeate cancer cells and specifically modulate activity of molecules that belong to signal-transduction pathways. These targets include products of frequently mutated oncogenes, such as k-Ras and other proteins that belong to tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathways. For example, Imatinib (Gleevec&#xae;), is the first such drug, approved for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Imatinib blocks the activity of non-receptor tyrosine kinase BCR-Abl oncogene, present in 95% of patients with CML. Imatinib was found to be effective in the treatment of CML and certain tumors of the digestive tract. Nevertheless, as others, this new compound is not completely specific to its target; therefore side effects emerge, including severe congestive cardiac failure, pulmonary tuberculosis, liver toxicity, sweet syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis), leukocytosis, dermal edemas, nausea, rash and musculoskeletal pain.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0242">Angiogenesis inhibitors are currently investigated for their use in cancer treatment and to date, one anti-angiogenetic drug, Bevacizumab (Avastin&#xae;), was approved for the treatment of solid tumors in combination with standard chemotherapy. However, as in all chemotherapeutic drugs, Bevacizumab causes a number of adverse side effects such as hypertension, blood clots, neutropenia, neuropathy, proteinuria and bowel perforation.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0243">In some embodiments, the functional moiety of the conjugates presented herein, is a targeting moiety that is responsible for the higher concentration of the conjugate at the targeted bodily site compared to non-targeted bodily sites, thereby reducing the adverse side effects associated with the toxicity of the anti-cancer drugs attached thereto. In addition, the linking moieties attached the anti-cancer drugs to the conjugate are selected such that they cleave in conditions that are present at the targeted site more so than in non-targeted sites, thereby releasing the payload of drugs at the targeted site at a higher rate compared to non-targeted sites.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0244">In the context of some embodiments of the present invention, the term &#x201c;cancer&#x201d; refers, but not limited to acute lymphoblastic, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, adrenocortical carcinoma, AIDS-related lymphoma, anal cancer, appendix cancer, basal-cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, brain cancer, brainstem glioma, breast cancer, bronchial adenomas/carcinoids, Burkitt's lymphoma, carcinoid tumor, cerebellar or cerebral astrocytoma, cervical cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, chondrosarcoma, chronic lymphocytic or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous or chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloproliferative disorders, colon cancer, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, endometrial uterine cancer, ependymoma, esophageal cancer, Ewing's sarcoma, extracranial germ cell tumor, extragonadal germ cell tumor, extrahepatic bile duct cancer, gallbladder cancer, gastric (stomach) cancer, gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), gestational trophoblastic tumor, glioma of the brain stem, hairy cell leukemia, head and neck cancer, heart cancer, hepatocellular (liver) cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, hypopharyngeal cancer, hypothalamic and visual pathway glioma, intraocular melanoma, Islet cell carcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma, laryngeal cancer, leukaemia, lip and oral cavity cancer, liposarcoma, lymphoma, male breast cancer, malignant mesothelioma, medulloblastoma, melanoma, Merkel cell skin carcinoma, mesothelioma, metastatic squamous neck cancer, mouth cancer, multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome, multiple myeloma, multiple myeloma/plasma cell neoplasm, mycosis fungoides, myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases, nasal cavity and paranasal sinus cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, neuroblastoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, non-melanoma skin cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, oligodendroglioma, oral cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma, ovarian cancer, ovarian germ cell tumor, ovarian epithelial cancer (surface epithelial-stromal tumor), ovarian low malignant potential tumor, pancreatic cancer, paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer, parathyroid cancer, penile cancer, pharyngeal cancer, pheochromocytoma, pineal astrocytoma, pineal germinoma, pineoblastoma and supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors, pituitary adenoma, plasma cell neoplasia, pleuropulmonary blastoma, primary carcinoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, primary liver cancer, prostate cancer, rectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, renal pelvis and ureter carcinoma, retinoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, salivary gland cancer, S&#xe9;zary syndrome, small cell lung cancer, small intestine cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, stomach cancer, supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor, testicular cancer, throat cancer, thymoma and thymic carcinoma, thyroid cancer, transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter, urethral cancer, uterine sarcoma, vaginal cancer, visual pathway and hypothalamic glioma, vulvar cancer, Waldenstr&#xf6;m macroglobulinemia and Wilms tumor.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0245">It is expected that during the life of a patent maturing from this application dolastatin 10 analogs and conjugates comprising the same will be developed and the scope of the term ratiometric luminescent theranostic conjugates is intended to include all such new technologies a priori.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0246">As used herein the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; refers to &#xb1;10%.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0247">The terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;, &#x201c;includes&#x201d;, &#x201c;including&#x201d;, &#x201c;having&#x201d; and their conjugates mean &#x201c;including but not limited to&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0248">The term &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; means &#x201c;including and limited to&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0249">The term &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; means that the composition, method or structure may include additional ingredients, steps and/or parts, but only if the additional ingredients, steps and/or parts do not materially alter the basic and novel characteristics of the claimed composition, method or structure.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0250">As used herein, the phrases &#x201c;substantially devoid of&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;essentially devoid of&#x201d; in the context of a certain substance, refer to a composition that is totally devoid of this substance or includes less than about 5, 1, 0.5 or 0.1 percent of the substance by total weight or volume of the composition.

SSTRs are heterogeneously expressed in the variety of human solid tumors. So far, the most useful peptide developed as a drug carrier for SSTR overexpressed malignancies has been the S&#x2014;S-bridged octapeptide octreotide (sandostatin) that preferentially targets SSTR2. Several drug conjugates based on octreotide have been reported bearing small molecule drugs camptothecin (CPT) and doxorubicin. However, no peptide conjugates bearing anticancer dolastatin payload were reported hitherto.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0272">One of the objectives of the present invention is to provide a reliable and practical platform for the production of conjugates of dolastatin and peptides, such as SSTR ligands and analogs thereof. The presently disclosed platform allows, inter alia, to employ the fast and cost-effective solid phase synthesis of peptides and peptidomimetic building-blocks. For example, the platform allows the preparation of a C-terminus modified octreotide, namely octreotide amide, conjugated to the presently disclosed Dolas-Ol analog through various linkers. This fast and reproducible synthesis, effected mostly by solid phase chemistry, enables the production and characterization of eltire series of such conjugates in high throughput screening for rapid structure-function optimization.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0273">Octreotide, sold under the brand name Sandostatin among others, is an octapeptide that mimics natural somatostatin pharmacologically, though it is a more potent inhibitor of growth hormone, glucagon, and insulin than the natural hormone. It was first synthesized in 1979, by the chemist Wilfried Bauer. It was approved for use in the United States in 1988. As a demonstrative example, Dolas-Ol was conjugated to the SSTR2 ligand octreotide-amide, via a biocleavable linker moiety, connecting between the N-terminus of the octreotide and the added hydroxyl group on the dolastatin analog side (see scheme below).</p><p id="p-0285" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00014" num="00014"><img id="EMI-C00014" he="131.91mm" wi="108.46mm" file="US20230000995A1-20230105-C00014.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0286" num="0274">A fast and convenient Fmoc chemistry SPPS synthesis of these novel conjugates is provides herein.
