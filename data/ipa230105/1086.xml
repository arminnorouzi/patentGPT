device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A variety of diseases exists that require regular treatment by delivery of medicament using a medicament delivery device. Such delivery can be performed by using injection devices, which are applied either by medical personnel or by patients themselves. As an example, type-1 and type-2 diabetes can be treated by patients themselves by injection of insulin doses, for example once or several times per day. For instance, a pre-filled disposable insulin pen can be used as an injection device. Alternatively, a re-usable pen may be used. A re-usable pen allows replacement of an empty medicament cartridge by a new one. Either pen may come with a set of one-way needles that are replaced before each use. The insulin dose to be injected can then for instance be manually selected at the insulin pen by turning a dosage knob and observing the actual dose from a dose window or display of the insulin pen. The dose is then injected by inserting the needle into a suited skin portion and pressing an injection button of the insulin pen. To be able to monitor insulin injection, for instance to prevent false handling of the insulin pen or to keep track of the doses already applied, it is desirable to measure information related to a condition and/or use of the injection device, such as for instance information on the injected insulin dose.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure relates to an improved medicament delivery device and a dosage measurement system for a medicament delivery device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the present disclosure, there is provided a medicament delivery device comprising: a reservoir for medicament; a dispensing mechanism operable to dispense medicament from the reservoir, the dispensing mechanism comprising a sleeve configured to rotate during the dispensing of medicament and having a plurality of formations at an end of the sleeve; and, a dosage measurement system comprising at least one mechanically actuated sensor configured such that, in use, rotation of the sleeve causes successive formations to engage the sensor such that the sensor detects rotation of the sleeve and a processor configured to determine a dosage dispensed from the medicament reservoir based on the detected rotation of the sleeve.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The use of a mechanical sensor that engages with the sleeve provides a compact system for determining the dose dispensed from the medicament reservoir. A mechanical sensor is generally more energy efficient that other kinds of sensor, for example, a light gate, and thus a smaller battery can be used. Since the mechanical sensor engages formations on the sleeve of the dispensing mechanism, the system can be made more portable than if the sensor detected external components of the device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the plurality of formations comprise a plurality of teeth.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the formations are formed on a proximal end of the sleeve.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The formations being on the proximal end of the sleeve allows for the sensor to be axially aligned with the sleeve. The sensor can be provided proximally of the sleeve.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the sleeve is a dial sleeve or a drive sleeve.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the sensor comprises a sensing member that is configured to move from an unactuated state to an actuated state when the sensing member is engaged by one of the formations during rotation of the sleeve, wherein the sensor detects movement of the sensing member between the unactuated and actuated states.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, each formation comprises a leading edge and wherein engagement of the sensor with the leading edge of a first of the formations until engagement of the sensor with the leading edge of an adjacent second of the formations during rotation of the sleeve represents one encoding period, and wherein the sensor is actuated for between 40 to 60% of the encoding period and, preferably, the sensor is actuated for about 50% of the encoding period. Such a configuration results in a symmetric scheme, which may be helpful for tolerance robustness as tolerances are in many situations symmetrically distributed.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the medicament delivery device further comprises a dose dial and a housing, wherein the dose dial is configured to be rotated relative to the housing to set a dose of medicament to be delivered by the dispensing mechanism, and wherein the sensor is mounted to the dose dial.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The sensor being mounted to the dose dial allows for a compact medicament delivery device. In some embodiments, the sensor is mounted to the inside of the dose dial such that the dosage measurement system is discreet and compact.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the medicament delivery device comprises a torque limiter, wherein the sensor is mounted to the dose dial via the torque limiter such that rotation of the dose dial relative to the housing with a torque greater than a predetermined limit causes the torque limiter to move to an open state such that the dose dial can rotate relative to the sensor and, preferably, the torque limiter comprises an overload clutch.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The torque limiter prevents damage to the sensor if the user exerts a large torque on the dose dial during the setting of a dose to be delivered by the measurement delivery device.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the medicament delivery device further comprises a one-way mechanism, wherein the sensor is mounted to the dose dial via the one-way mechanism such that the sensor is resisted from rotating relative to the dose dial in the direction that the sleeve rotates during the dispensing of medicament and is permitted to rotate relative to the dose dial in the opposite direction that the sleeve rotates during the dispensing of medicament.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The one-way mechanism prevents damage to the sensor if the user urges the sleeve to rotate in a opposite direction to the direction that the sleeve is intended to rotate during the dispensing of medicament, since the sensor will rotate together with the sleeve in said opposite direction.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to another aspect, there is provided a dosage measurement system for a medicament delivery device, wherein the medicament delivery device comprises: a housing containing a reservoir for medicament; and, a dispensing mechanism operable to dispense medicament from the reservoir and comprising a component configured to rotate during the dispensing of medicament, the component comprising a plurality of formations; and, an actuator configured to be movable relative to the housing upon actuation to operate the dispensing mechanism to dispense medicament from the reservoir, the dosage measurement system comprising: a sensor moveable from an idle position to a detecting position wherein rotation of the component causes successive formations to be detected by the sensor such that the sensor detects rotation of the component; a processor configured to determine a dosage dispensed from the medicament reservoir based on the detected rotation of the component; and, an activation switch moveable from an initial off state to an on state to activate the dosage measurement system upon actuation of the actuator, the sensor configured to be mounted to the actuator such that actuation of the actuator causes the sensor to move relative to the housing to reach the detecting position, wherein the activation switch reaches the on state prior to the sensor reaching the detecting position.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The configuration of the sensor and activation switch ensures that the dosage measurement system is activated prior to the sensor reaching the detecting position. This helps to ensure that the sensor is not in the detecting position before the dosage measurement system is powered on.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the actuator is slidable relative to the housing. A sliding movement of the actuator may be easier for a patient, particularly if the patient is elderly or infirm.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the activation switch comprises a pivotal member that pivots from the off state to the on state to activate the dosage measurement system.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the medicament delivery device comprises a stop and wherein the activation switch is configured to rest against the stop when the activation switch is in the off state.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the activation switch is configured to engage a part of the medicament delivery device when the actuator is moved to operate the dispensing mechanism such that the activation switch is urged to the on state and, preferably, said part comprises a part of the dispensing mechanism.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">This configuration allows for actuation of the activation switch without requiring additional components. In some embodiments, said part comprises a drive sleeve of the dispensing mechanism.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the activation switch is configured such that the activation switch moves a first distance from the off state to the on state and the sensor is configured such that the sensor moves a second distance from the idle position to the detecting position, wherein the second distance is greater than the first distance. This helps to ensure that the activation switch reaches the on position before the sensor reaches the detecting position.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the dosage measurement system comprises first and second radial bearings, wherein the actuator is rotatably mounted to a part of the device via the first and second bearings, the first and second bearings being axially spaced. The part of the device may be, for example, a rotatable sleeve, for example, a dial sleeve, of the device or may be the housing.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the dosage measurement system comprises a support member and a coupling member, wherein the dose setting dial is fixed relative to the support member and wherein the support member coupled to the coupling member and, preferably, the support member is coupled to the coupling member via a pivot.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the support member is rotatably coupled to the coupling member via at least one radial bearing and, preferably, via first and second radial bearings. Optionally, the second radial bearing is axially spaced from the first radial bearing in the direction of actuation movement of the actuator.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the dosage measurement system has any of the features discussed above. In some embodiments, there is provided a medicament delivery device comprising a dosage measurement system having any of the features discussed above.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to another aspect, there is provided a dosage measurement system for a medicament delivery device, wherein the medicament delivery device comprises a reservoir for medicament and a dispensing mechanism operable to dispense medicament from the reservoir, the dispensing mechanism comprising a component configured to rotate during the dispensing of medicament, the component comprising a plurality of first and second encoder regions, the dosage measurement system comprising: first and second sensors that are offset such that, in use, rotation of the component causes one of the first encoder regions to align with the first sensor whilst one of the second encoder regions aligns with the second sensor and then one of the second encoder regions to align with the first sensor whilst one of the first encoder regions aligns with the second sensor, the first and second sensors configured to differentiate between the first and second encoder regions to detect rotation of the component; and, a processor configured to determine a dosage dispensed from the medicament reservoir based on the detected rotation of the component.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The provision of first and second offset sensors increases the resolution of measurement of the rotation of the component for a given size of encoding regions, allowing for a more accurate determination of the dosage dispensed from the medicament reservoir.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the component comprises a plurality of formations, wherein each first encoding region comprises at least a portion of a respective formation that is detectable by the first and second sensors as the component rotates, wherein the second encoder regions are provided between adjacent first encoder regions.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, wherein each formation comprises a tooth, wherein each first encoding region comprises at least a portion of a respective tooth that is detectable by the first and second sensors as the component rotates, wherein each second encoder comprises at least a gap between adjacent teeth.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the first and second sensors are arranged such that for all rotational positions of the component in which the first sensor aligns with one of the first encoding regions, the second sensor aligns with one of the second encoding regions.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">This helps to ensure that the maximum resolution of measurement of rotation of the component can be achieved for a given number and size of encoding regions. Also, it is possible to ascertain that initial axial movement will cause a first encoding region to align with one of the first and second sensors and therefore false reading due to the initial axial movement can be disregarded.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the component comprises a plurality of encoding periods, wherein each encoding period comprises one of the first encoding regions and an adjacent second encoding region, wherein for a given rotational position of the component the first sensor is aligned with a portion of one of the encoding periods and the second sensor is aligned with a different portion of one of the encoding periods.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the dosage measurement system further comprises a third sensor that is aligned with a different portion of one of the encoding periods to the first and second sensors when the component is in said given rotational positon.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The processor is therefore able to determine the direction of rotation of the component.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the dosage measurement system further comprises a fourth sensor that aligns with a different portion of one of the encoding periods to the first, second and third sensors when the component is in said given rotational positon. The processor is therefore able to determine the direction of rotation of the component.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, dosage measurement system further comprises a third sensor configured such that, in use, when the component is rotated the third sensor aligns with one of the first encoding regions at the same time that the first sensor aligns with one of the first encoding regions.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The third sensor provides redundancy should the first sensor fail to detect the encoding region due to a detecting error and also allows for improbable detection events to be filtered. Therefore, there is pairwise redundancy that allows for detection and compensation of erroneous switch state detection.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the dosage measurement system further comprises a fourth sensor configured such that, in use, when the component is rotated the fourth sensor aligns with one of the first encoding regions at the same time that the second sensor aligns with one of the first encoding regions.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The fourth sensor provides redundancy should the second sensor fail to detect the encoding region due to a detecting error and also allows for improbable detection events to be filtered. Therefore, there is pairwise redundancy that allows for detection and compensation of erroneous switch state detection.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, when the first sensor is aligned with a transition between first and second encoding regions, the third sensor is also aligned with a transition between first and second encoding regions. In some embodiments, when the second sensor is aligned with a transition between first and second encoding regions, the fourth sensor is also aligned with a transition between first and second encoding regions.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, each of the first and second encoding regions extends about the rotational axis of the component by the same predetermined angle.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments: said predetermined angle is about 15 degrees or 30 degrees.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the second sensor is offset from the first sensor about the rotational axis in a first direction by an odd number integer multiple of the angle that each first encoding region subtends about the rotational axis.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, second sensor is offset from the first sensor about the rotational axis in the first direction by 165 degrees.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, each of the first and second encoding regions comprises a length that extends in the direction of rotation of the component, wherein the dosage measurement system comprises a third sensor that is offset from the first and second sensors such that, in use, when the first sensor is aligned with one of the first encoding regions and the second sensor is aligned with one of the second encoding regions, the third sensor is aligned with a different portion along the length of one of the first and second encoding regions.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, the processor is configured to determine a dosage dispensed from the medicament reservoir by a process including counting the number of transitions between the first and second encoding regions detected by the first and second sensors.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the first and second sensors are configured to move from an idle position to a detecting position, wherein movement of the sensors to the detecting position causes one of the first and second regions to align with one of the first encoding regions, and wherein the processor is configured such that when determining the dosage dispensed the processor compensates for said alignment when the sensor moves to the detecting positon.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">This allows for improved accuracy in embodiments wherein the sensors are moved axially into a detecting position. This is because, in some embodiments, such axial movement will cause one of the first and second sensors to align with a first encoding region which will appear as a false reading of a transition to said first encoding region. The processor can disregard this false reading to more accurately determine the dosage dispensed.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the processor is configured to determine a dosage dispensed from the medicament reservoir based on a signal from one of the first and second sensors and an inverse signal from the other one of the first and second sensors.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the processor is configured to determine a dosage dispensed from the medicament reservoir based on a superposition of the signal from one of the first and second sensors and the inverse signal from the other one of the first and second sensors.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the processor is configured to determine a dosage dispensed from the medicament reservoir by comparing the superposition to a first threshold value and a second threshold value, greater than the first threshold value, and, preferably, counting the number of times the superposition transitions from a value lower than the first threshold value to a value greater than the second threshold value and/or from a value higher than the second threshold value to a value lower than the first threshold value.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">This helps to improve the accuracy of the dosage determination by helping to filter out errors such as sensor noise and switch bouncing.

The present disclosure is however not limited to such application and may equally well be deployed with medicament delivery devices that eject other medicaments.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The term &#x201c;distal&#x201d; refers to a location that is relatively closer to a site of medicament delivery (for example, the injection site in the case of an injection device), and the term &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; refers to a location that is relatively further away from the site of medicament delivery.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded view of a medicament delivery device <b>1</b>. In this example, the medicament delivery device <b>1</b> is an injection device <b>1</b>, such as Sanofi's AllStar&#xae; insulin injection pen or Sanofi's SoloStar&#xae; insulin injection pen, however the present disclosure is also compatible with other types and makes of injection pens as described below. The present disclosure is also compatible with other types of medicament delivery devices such as needless injectors.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The injection device <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a pre-filled injection pen that comprises a housing <b>2</b> and contains a reservoir <b>14</b> for medicament which, in the present embodiment, is an insulin container <b>14</b>. A needle <b>15</b> can be affixed to the reservoir <b>14</b>. The injection device <b>1</b> may be disposable or re-usable. The needle <b>15</b> is protected by an inner needle cap <b>16</b> and an outer needle cap <b>17</b> and/or an alternative cap <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">An insulin dose to be ejected from injection device <b>1</b> can be programmed by moving a dose setting member <b>12</b>, which in the present embodiment is a dose setting dial <b>12</b> that can be turned relative to the housing <b>2</b> to allow for the dose to be &#x2018;dialed in&#x2019;. A currently programmed dose is then displayed via dosage window <b>13</b>, for instance in multiples of units. For example, where the injection device <b>1</b> is configured to administer human insulin, the dosage may be displayed in so-called International Units (IU), wherein one IU is the biological equivalent of about 45.5 micrograms of pure crystalline insulin ( 1/22 mg). Other units may be employed in medicament delivery devices for delivering analogue insulin or other medicaments.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The dosage window <b>13</b> may be in the form of an aperture in the housing <b>2</b>, which permits a user to view a limited portion of a number sleeve <b>10</b> that is configured to move when the dose setting dial <b>12</b> is turned, to provide a visual indication of a currently programmed dose. It should be noted that the selected dose may equally well be displayed differently than as shown in the dosage window <b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, only every second dose unit may be shown, due to space restrictions on the number sleeve <b>10</b>. The un-numbered dose units may be represented by tick marks between the displayed numerals. Alternatively, the number sleeve <b>10</b> may remain stationary during the dose dialling phase, and the dosage window <b>13</b> may move as a dose is dialed in to reveal the number corresponding to the dialed dose. In either case, the number sleeve <b>10</b> may be a component which rotates when a dose is being dispensed from the injection device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In this example, the dose setting dial <b>12</b> includes one or more formations <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>, <b>12</b><i>c </i>that facilitate programming because they improve the grip a user feels when grasping the dose setting dial <b>12</b>. In another example (not shown) the dose setting dial does not include formations.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The injection device <b>1</b> may be configured so that turning the dose setting dial <b>12</b> causes a mechanical click sound to provide acoustical feedback to a user. The number sleeve <b>10</b> mechanically interacts with a piston in insulin container <b>14</b>. When needle <b>15</b> is stuck into a skin portion of a patient, and then the dose setting dial <b>12</b> is pushed axially relative to the housing <b>2</b>, the insulin dose displayed in display window <b>13</b> will be ejected from injection device <b>1</b>. The dose setting dial <b>12</b> therefore forms an actuator that may be actuated by the user to dispense medicament. When the needle <b>15</b> of injection device <b>1</b> remains for a certain time in the skin portion after the dose setting dial <b>12</b> is pushed, a high percentage of the dose is actually injected into the patient's body. Ejection of the insulin dose may also cause a mechanical click sound, which is however different from the sounds produced when rotating the dose setting dial <b>12</b> to set the dose to be delivered.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The injection device <b>1</b> comprises a dial sleeve <b>10</b> which, in the present embodiment, is the same component as the number sleeve <b>10</b>. In other embodiments (not shown), the dial sleeve <b>10</b> may be secured to the proximal end of the number sleeve <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The dial sleeve <b>10</b> has a proximal end close to the dose setting dial <b>12</b>. The dial sleeve <b>10</b> (and the number sleeve <b>10</b>, which is the same component) rotates relative to the dose setting dial <b>12</b> during dose ejection, but not during dose dialling. During dose dialling, the user rotates the dose setting dial <b>12</b> relative to the housing <b>2</b>, which causes corresponding rotation of the dial sleeve <b>10</b> relative to the housing <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In order to operate the injection device <b>1</b> to dispense medicament from the container <b>14</b>, the dose setting dial <b>12</b> is configured to move axially relative to the housing <b>2</b> and dial sleeve <b>10</b> of the injection device <b>1</b> by a short distance. This movement occurs when a user exerts a force on the end of the dose setting dial <b>12</b>. For example, the user pushing the does setting dial <b>12</b> axially towards the injection site. This movement disengages a clutch (not shown) and allows the dial sleeve <b>10</b> and other internal components of the injection device <b>1</b> to rotate relative to the dose setting dial <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the injection device <b>1</b> may comprise a separate injection button (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that is mounted to the dose setting dial <b>12</b> and which moves axially relative to the housing <b>2</b> in order to cause the medicament to be dispensed. The injection button may be located at the proximal end of the dose setting dial <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the various embodiment, during delivery of the insulin dose the dose setting dial <b>12</b> is moved to its initial position in an axial movement, that is to say without rotation, while the number sleeve <b>10</b> is rotated to return to its initial position, e.g. to display a dose of zero units.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The injection device <b>1</b> may be used for several injection processes until either the insulin container <b>14</b> is empty or the expiration date of the medicament in the injection device <b>1</b> (for example, 28 days after the first use) is reached.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Before using injection device <b>1</b> for the first time, it may be necessary to perform a so-called &#x201c;prime shot&#x201d; to remove air from insulin container <b>14</b> and needle <b>15</b>, for instance by selecting two units of insulin and pressing the dose setting dial <b>12</b> while holding the injection device <b>1</b> with the needle <b>15</b> pointing upwards. For simplicity of presentation, in the following, it will be assumed that the ejected doses substantially correspond to the injected doses, so that, for instance the number of medicament dose units ejected from the injection device <b>1</b> is equal to the number of medicament dose units received by the user. Nevertheless, differences (e.g. losses) between the ejected amounts and the injected doses may need to be taken into account in some applications of the device.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>15</b></figref>, an embodiment of a medicament delivery device <b>100</b> is shown. The medicament delivery device <b>100</b> is similar to the medicament delivery device <b>1</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and thus a detailed description of common features of the medicament delivery device <b>100</b> will not be repeated hereinafter. A difference is that the medicament delivery device <b>100</b> comprises a dosage measurement system <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The medicament delivery device <b>100</b> comprises a housing <b>102</b> containing a reservoir (not shown) for medicament. The medicament delivery device <b>100</b> further comprises a dispensing mechanism <b>104</b> operable to dispense medicament from the reservoir.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The dispensing mechanism <b>104</b> comprises a clutch <b>105</b>, dial sleeve <b>106</b>, a drive sleeve <b>107</b>, a drive member (not shown), a plunger rod (not shown) and a piston (not shown). The drive member may comprise a biasing member (not shown), for example, a spring, and is configured to bias the drive sleeve <b>107</b> to rotate relative to the housing <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The drive sleeve <b>107</b> is coupled to the plunger rod such that rotation of the drive sleeve <b>107</b> in a first rotational direction (shown by arrow &#x2018;X&#x2019; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>11</b></figref>) causes the plunger rod to move axially in the distal direction to dispense medicament from the reservoir. More specifically, the piston (not shown) is mounted to the distal end of the plunger rod such that axial movement of the plunger rod in the distal direction during rotation of the drive sleeve <b>107</b> in the first rotational direction X causes the piston to slide distally within the reservoir to dispense medicament therefrom.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In one embodiment, the drive sleeve <b>107</b> and plunger rod comprise corresponding threads (not shown) that engage so that rotation of the drive sleeve <b>107</b> causes axial movement of the plunge rod. In other embodiments (not shown), the drive sleeve <b>107</b> is coupled to the plunger rod via one or more intermediate components (not shown).</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The clutch <b>105</b> is initially in an engaged position in which the clutch <b>105</b> prevents the drive sleeve <b>107</b> from rotating in the first rotational direction X under the force of the drive member. In some embodiments, the clutch <b>105</b> has one or more splines (not shown) or other engaging elements that engage with the drive sleeve <b>107</b> or another component when the clutch <b>105</b> is in the engaged position to prevent rotation of the drive sleeve <b>107</b> relative to the housing <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The medicament delivery device <b>100</b> further comprises a dose setting member <b>108</b>, which in the present embodiments is a dose setting dial <b>108</b> that is mounted to the proximal end of the housing <b>102</b>. An medicament dose to be expelled from medicament delivery device <b>100</b> can be programmed, or &#x2018;dialed in&#x2019; by turning a dose setting dial <b>108</b>, and a currently programmed dose is then displayed via dosage window (not shown), for instance in multiples of units. In some embodiments, the dose setting dial <b>108</b> is rotated in a second rotational direction, opposite to the first rotational direction X, relative to the housing <b>102</b> such that the dial sleeve <b>106</b> is also rotated in the second rotational direction relative to the housing <b>102</b> from an initial position (representing a dose of &#x2018;zero&#x2019;) until the desired dose is selected.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The dial sleeve <b>106</b> has a proximal end close to the dose setting dial <b>108</b>. The dial sleeve <b>106</b> (and the number sleeve <b>106</b>, which is the same component) rotates relative to the dose setting dial <b>108</b> during dose ejection, but not during dose dialling. In other embodiments (for example, embodiments wherein the dose setting dial <b>108</b> comprises a separate actuator such as a push button, the dial sleeve <b>106</b> does not rotate relative to the dose setting dial <b>108</b> during dose ejection and instead the dose setting dial <b>108</b> rotates together with the dose sleeve <b>106</b>, optionally both the dose setting dial <b>108</b> and dial sleeve <b>106</b> rotating relative to the actuator).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">During dose dialling, the user rotates the dose setting dial <b>108</b> relative to the housing <b>102</b> in the second rotational direction, which causes corresponding rotation of the dial sleeve <b>106</b> relative to the housing <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The dispensing mechanism <b>104</b> further comprises a number sleeve <b>106</b> which in the present embodiment is the same component as the dial sleeve <b>106</b>. In other embodiments (not shown), the dial sleeve may be secured to the number sleeve.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">The user will be able to determine that the desired dose has been selected by viewing the number sleeve <b>106</b> through the viewing window (not shown) in the housing <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The dose setting dial <b>108</b> forms an actuator that may be actuated by the user to dispense medicament. In more detail, the dose setting dial <b>108</b> is slidable axially relative to the housing <b>102</b> to operate the dispensing mechanism <b>104</b> to dispense medicament from the reservoir. In some embodiments, rotation of the dose setting dial <b>108</b> in the second rotational direction during dose dialling causes the dose setting dial to move axially in the proximal direction. In other embodiments, rotation of the dose setting dial <b>108</b> in the second rotational direction during dose dialling does not cause the dose setting dial <b>108</b> to move axially.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In operation the dose setting dial <b>108</b> is configured to move axially relative to the housing <b>102</b> by a short distance. This movement occurs when a user exerts a force on the dose setting dial <b>108</b>, for example, the user pushing the dose setting dial <b>108</b> axially in the distal direction, towards the injection site. This axial movement of the dose setting dial <b>108</b> disengages the clutch <b>105</b> such that the clutch <b>105</b> moves to a disengaged position. For example, said distal movement of the dose setting dial <b>108</b> may cause a corresponding distal movement of the clutch <b>105</b> that disengages the clutch <b>105</b>, for instance, disengaging the splines or other engaging elements (not shown). Disengaging the clutch <b>105</b> allows the dial sleeve <b>106</b> and drive sleeve <b>107</b> to rotate relative to the housing <b>102</b> and dose setting dial <b>108</b> in the first rotational direction X under the force of the drive member to dispense medicament from the reservoir.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">As long as the dose setting dial <b>108</b> is kept depressed by the user, the clutch <b>105</b> will remain in the disengaged positon and thus the dial sleeve <b>106</b> and drive sleeve <b>107</b> will continue to rotate in the first rotational direction X under the force of the drive member to deliver medicament to the user until the dial sleeve <b>106</b> reaches the initial position. The dose setting dial <b>108</b> may be biased proximally by a dial biasing member (not shown).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The dial sleeve <b>106</b> comprises a cylindrical body <b>110</b> and an encoder ring <b>111</b> that is provided on the proximal end of the body <b>110</b>.

The pivot <b>128</b> helps to minimise the surface area of contact between the support member <b>121</b> and the coupling member <b>127</b> and thus to reduce friction therebetween.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">The pivot <b>128</b> is configured such that if the user exerts a force on the dose setting dial <b>108</b> that urges the dose setting dial <b>108</b> to tilt relative to the housing <b>102</b>, for example, by applying an off-centre force at a peripheral edge of the dose setting dial <b>108</b>, then the dose setting dial <b>108</b> will be urged to tilt about the pivot <b>128</b>. However, the first and second radial bearings <b>125</b>, <b>126</b> are configured to resist said tilting of the dose setting dial <b>108</b> and thus the radial bearings <b>125</b>, <b>126</b> help to maintain the dose setting dial <b>108</b> in alignment with the housing <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">In more detail, it is desirable to prevent tilting of the dose setting dial <b>108</b> relative to the housing <b>102</b>, which could otherwise cause misalignment of the sensor <b>114</b> relative to the formations <b>112</b>. For instance, if the user presses on an edge of the dose setting dial <b>108</b> during actuation, this could cause the dose setting dial <b>108</b> to be urged to tilt relative to the longitudinal axis of the medicament delivery device <b>100</b>, such that the proximal end of the dose setting dial <b>108</b> is no longer perpendicular to the longitudinal axis and is now instead at an angle thereto.

Therefore, if the user exerts a force on the dose setting dial <b>108</b> that causes the dose setting dial <b>108</b> to tilt, the second bearing <b>126</b> will provide a reaction force that prevents tilting of the dose setting dial <b>108</b>. The second bearing <b>126</b> being spaced from the pivot <b>128</b> means that the reaction force needed to be exerted by the second bearing <b>126</b> to stabilise the dose setting dial <b>108</b> and prevent tilting is smaller than if the second bearing <b>126</b> was located closer to the pivot <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">The second bearing <b>126</b> may be located radially outwards of the first bearing <b>125</b>, in other words, further away from the longitudinal axis of the medicament delivery device <b>100</b> than the first bearing <b>125</b>. That is, the second bearing <b>126</b> may have a larger diameter than the first bearing <b>125</b>. Thus, the reaction torque exerted by the first bearing <b>125</b> if the dose setting dial <b>108</b> is rotating whilst tilted is reduced in comparison to if the first bearing <b>125</b> had a larger diameter. This reduces friction resisting rotation of the dose setting dial <b>108</b>. The second bearing <b>126</b> has a larger diameter than the first bearing <b>125</b> to provide support when the dose dial setting <b>108</b> is tilted about the pivot <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Optionally, the support member <b>121</b>, or another component, may comprise the aforementioned stop <b>122</b> against which the activation switch <b>119</b> abuts when in the off state.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Operation of the medicament delivery device <b>100</b> will now be described.

The axial movement of the dose setting dial <b>108</b> first causes the activation switch <b>119</b> to abut the drive sleeve <b>107</b> such that the activation switch <b>119</b> is moved to the on state and thus the processor <b>115</b> of the dosage measurement system <b>101</b> is powered-on.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">Continued movement of the dose setting dial <b>108</b> in the distal direction causes the sensor <b>114</b> to move to the detecting position, wherein the sensor <b>114</b> overlaps the formations <b>112</b> in the axial direction of the medicament delivery device <b>100</b>, and then the dispensing mechanism <b>104</b> is operated to expel medicament from the reservoir for delivery via the needle. For instance, the medicament delivery device <b>100</b> may comprise a release mechanism that is activated to release the drive member when the dose setting dial <b>108</b> has been moved distally to an axial position in which the sensor <b>114</b> is in the detecting position, or in other embodiments the dose setting dial <b>108</b> has been moved further distally in the axial positon (e.g. by a third distance D<b>3</b>).</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">In the present embodiment, movement of the dose setting dial <b>108</b> by the third distance D<b>3</b> relative to the housing <b>102</b> causes the clutch <b>105</b> to be disengaged such that the clutch <b>105</b> moves to a disengaged position. Thus, the dial sleeve <b>106</b> and drive sleeve <b>107</b> are allowed to rotate relative to the housing <b>102</b> and dose setting dial <b>108</b> in the first rotational direction X under the force of the drive member to dispense medicament from the reservoir.

However, the mechanical switch of the first sensor <b>214</b>A may momentarily &#x2018;bounce&#x2019; such that it outputs a LOW reading. In such a scenario, the superposition <b>220</b> would be below the second threshold value <b>227</b> but would still be greater than the first threshold value <b>226</b> because the inverse signal is still HIGH (the superposition would be in the UNDEFINED state).

Thus, the switch bounce will not be counted by the processor in the dosage dispensing calculation and thus will not contribute to an erroneous dosage determination value. Alternatively, if after the &#x2018;bounce&#x2019; the first sensor <b>214</b>A instead again output a HIGH reading, the superposition <b>220</b> would transition back to the High state H and this would not be counted as an increment by the processor because the superposition was previously in HIGH state H before moving to the UNDEFINED state and thus had not transitioned from the LOW state L to the HIGH state H.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">In some embodiments, when the dial sleeve <b>206</b> has reached the zero position and has finished rotation such that the programmed dosage has been dispensed from the reservoir, the first and second sensors <b>214</b>A, <b>214</b>B will each align with a particular encoding region <b>223</b>, <b>224</b> for longer than when the dial sleeve <b>206</b> is rotating and the first and second sensors <b>214</b>A,<b>214</b>C are aligning with successive encoding regions <b>223</b>, <b>224</b>.

However, in alternative embodiments (not shown) the actuator instead comprises a component that is moveable relative to the dose setting dial to dispense medicament. In one embodiment (not shown), the actuator comprises a push button that is mounted to the dose setting dial and is slidable axially relative to the dose setting dial to operate the dispensing mechanism to dispense medicament from the reservoir. In operation the push button is configured to move axially relative to the housing and dial sleeve by a short distance. This movement occurs when a user exerts a force on the push button. For example, the user pushing push button axially in the distal direction towards the injection site. This axial movement of the push button disengages the clutch such that the clutch moves to a disengaged position and thus allows the dial sleeve and drive sleeve to rotate relative to the housing and dose setting dial in the first rotational direction under the force of the drive member to dispense medicament from the reservoir. The push button may be located at the proximal end of the dose setting dial. Push button may be biased proximally.

In some embodiments, the signals are filtered by a low-pass filter. In some embodiments, the signals are filtered before input to the processor. In other embodiments, the processor filters the signals.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0268">Electromechanical switches comprise electrical contacts that may swing for a short time after switching on or off. This may lead to several fast signal pulses after the original signal edge, which is called bouncing. Bouncing can be reduced by switches with oscillation-minimized contact designs. Further, as mentioned above, the signals can be filtered by electronics or software as far as the bouncing duration is shorter than the regular signal pulse duration. This filtering is called debouncing.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0269">It is advantageous to improve power management so that a smaller battery having less capacity can be used, resulting in a smaller dosage measurement system. It is advantageous to reduce peak currents because small batteries are more sensitive to peak currents.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0270">Improved power management may include reducing the energy consumption during shelf-life. In one such embodiment (not shown), the battery is mechanically disconnected during shelf life by a strip, for example, a paper or plastic strip. The strip can be pulled by the user to activate the dosage measurement system. In another embodiment (not shown), the battery is mechanically disconnected by a mechanism. When the actuator is pressed for the first time, a component breaks and enables a durable connection between electronics and battery. In yet another embodiment (not shown), the battery is mechanically disconnected by a life switch on the PCB. This activation may be irreversible. In yet another embodiment, the electronics remains in a strong power save mode until the actuator is pressed for the first time.

In some embodiments, the shortest gaps were around 700 &#x3bc;s. In such embodiments, a sampling interval of 500 &#x3bc;s was enough to detect such short gaps properly. In such an embodiment, a minimum sampling frequency to detect all signal edges is calculated as:</p><p id="p-0273" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <mi>f</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mi>min</mi>     </mrow>     <mo>=</mo>     <mfrac>      <mn>1</mn>      <mi>T</mi>     </mfrac>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>[</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>Equation</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mn>1</mn>     </mrow>     <mo>]</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0274" num="0272">In Equation 1, fmin is the minimum sampling frequency and T is the sampling interval. Thus, for a sampling interval of 500 &#x3bc;s, the minimum sampling frequency is 2 kHz.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0273">Using mechanical switches instead of light gates/barriers decreases the energy consumption because in some embodiments the states of the mechanical switches can be detected with less than 100 &#x3bc;A per switch. If the signals have a good quality, energy can be saved additionally by detecting the edges per interrupt. This means that the switch may be connected to an interrupt port of the processor. The interrupt port can be selected for being triggered by raising/falling edge in the switch state thereby allowing the processor to wait in a low-energy state instead of performing a permanent energy expensive polling operation at a high sampling frequency.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0274">In embodiments wherein light gates/barriers are used, during the estimated sampling period of 500 &#x3bc;s, the IR-LED may be switched on (rising time typical 10 &#x3bc;s@&#x2264;100 k&#x3a9;, sinking the same), the ADC may acquire (2 &#x3bc;s) and convert (5 &#x3bc;s) and the rest of the time the IR-LED can be switched off to save power. This has been found to reduce power.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0275">In some embodiments (not shown), the medicament delivery device comprises a user interface, for example, one or more LEDs that prompt or provide indication to the user. The user interface may be optimised to reduce power consumption. For example, if multiple LEDs of one colour are used for a particular prompt or indication, the number of LEDs of that colour may be reduced. In some embodiments, the LED power is reduced. In some embodiments, an injection reminder functionality, for example, a reminder alarm, is removed. In some embodiments, a dwell time indication (for example, a visual or audible indicator of the amount of time that the medicament delivery device should be held in place after injection is removed. In some embodiments, an end of life pattern is removed (for instance, an indicator that the dosage measurement system and/or medicament delivery device has reached the end of its operational life. In some embodiments, the user interface is omitted.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0276">In some embodiments, a BLE (Bluetooth&#x2122; Low Energy) advertising duration is reduced. The advertising time defines how long the medicament delivery device tries to connect to the mobile phone or other device. This parameter is important when the mobile phone is often unreachable (for example, being too far away or switched off). Experiments have shown that 5 seconds are enough when the mobile phone is inside the properly reachable radio-range. So the advertising time could be reduced from 15 seconds to around 5 seconds. This means that the advertising energy can be improved by a factor of 3.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0277">In some embodiments, the BLE communication timeout is reduced. After the data transfer the communication channel stays currently open for 3 seconds. This can be improved when the mobile phone or other device sends an explicit communication close command to the medicament delivery device and the timeout is just left as fall-back.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0278">In some embodiments, the number of communication attempts per day is reduced. The data could be transferred to the mobile phone after an injection, but only when the last data transfer was more than a predetermined time period (for example, 12 hours) prior to that. In some embodiments, priming log data is never transferred separately. This helps to save energy for users with several injections and/or priming doses per day.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0279">There might be use cases where users want to force an immediate data transfer. This could be initiated by a button press pattern. One step more would be to transmit only after a specific button press pattern (for example, pressing the actuator or another button five times in quick succession, or a certain number of long presses of the button). In some embodiments, data is transmitted after a normal button release event, but only if last data transfer was more than a predetermined time period (for example, 12 hours) prior to that. In some embodiments, priming data is not transmitted separately. For example, if the user performs a priming operation in which one or two increments of rotation are detected by the processor, then this is not transmitted separately to the medicament delivery data (in some embodiments, primings, for example, measurements equal to or less than two increments of rotation, are disregarded and not transmitted).</p><p id="p-0282" num="0280">It is advantageous to avoid or reduce current peaks because they reduce the usable capacity of batteries. It is therefore advantageous to optimise the energy management for the UI, the sensor and the communication current peaks. In some embodiments, current peaks of electronic components are aligned successively. In some embodiments, components with high currents are not active at the same time as components with high peak currents, or at least such simultaneous occurrences are minimised.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0281">The visible LED may have high peak currents, but the timing is controllable. The BLE communication may have high peak currents, which may not be controllable nor predictable. Therefore, in some embodiments communication is only started after a potential user feedback by LED has completed.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0282">The radio range may be dependent on the transmit power of the dosage measurement system (for example, the System on Chip, SoC, component). Reducing the power will reduce the average current and the peak current. In some embodiments, the maximum output power is +0 dBm and has a peak current of 5.3 mA. If the maximum output power was instead+4 dBm then the peak current would be 7.5 mA, which may be too high for a smaller battery type. Reducing the output power to &#x2212;4 dBm results in a peak current of 4.2 mA.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0283">In some embodiments, the battery is a CR1225 coin cell having a nominal capacity of 48 mAh.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0284">While the embodiments above have been described in relation to collecting data from an insulin injector pen, it is noted that embodiments of the invention may be used for other purposes, such as monitoring of injections of other medicaments.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0285">The injection device may comprise a cartridge containing a liquid drug or medicament.
