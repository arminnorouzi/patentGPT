In the context of the currently high speed or in a scenario of requiring a fast lift, a variable-speed lift operation enables one to accommodate a high acceleration upon actuation by speed control before the electric platform reaches the maximum speed. The variable-speed lift operation resembles a continuous speed variation and improves lift performance, realizing maximum exploitation of the performance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Existing speed control technologies available in the market mostly perform speed control by a gear selector switch, a multi-gear toggle switch, or by defining different pushbuttons or different operations to correspond to different speeds, which, however, are not intuitive to operate. Besides, only limited gear positions can be arranged, which limits speed variation. Further, more control and detection ports are needed to match the gear positions, rendering a complex product structure.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide continuously variable speed controllers, electric lift mechanisms, and electric massaging mechanisms, which achieve a continuous speed variation and a simplified product structure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide the following technical solution: a continuously variable speed controller comprising an operating unit, an operation detector coupled to the operating unit to detect a continuous variation of an action of the operating unit, an information processor electrically connected to the operation detector to obtain a corresponding motor speed variation quantity based on a detection result from the operation detector, and a motor controller electrically connected to the information processor to receive the motor speed variation quantity and adjust a speed of the motor continuously based on the motor speed variation quantity.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an embodiment, the operating unit comprises a first shell and a paddle provided on the first shell; the operation detector comprises at least one of a pressure sensor provided in a stressed zone of the paddle and an angle sensor provided on a follow-up surface of the paddle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, the pressure sensor comprises a piezoelectric transducer, a piezoresistive transducer, or a conductive elastic member, wherein deformation of the conductive elastic member results in a change to resistive value.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment, the information processor and the motor controller are integrated onto a first signal processing board, the first signal processing board being provided in the first shell and electrically connected to the pressure sensor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment, the operating unit comprises a second shell and a first rotating housing provided on the second shell; the operation detector comprises a magnetically inductive sensor and a magnet, wherein the magnetically inductive sensor is provided on the first rotating housing and rotatable with the first rotating housing, and the magnet is fixed in the second shell.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, the operating unit comprises a second shell and a first rotating housing provided on the second shell; the operation detector comprises a magnetically inductive sensor and a magnet, wherein the magnetically inductive sensor is fixed in the second shell, and the magnet is fixed on the first rotating housing and rotatable with the first rotating housing.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, the operating unit comprises a third shell and a second rotating housing provided on the third shell, and the operation detector comprises a rotating encoder fixed in the third shell or an angle sensor fixed on the second rotating housing.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, the operating unit comprises a fourth shell and a pushbutton provided on the fourth shell.
