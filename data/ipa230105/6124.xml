description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The following description of certain embodiments presents various descriptions of specific embodiments. However, the innovations described herein can be embodied in a multitude of different ways, for example, as defined and covered by the claims. In this description, reference is made to the drawings where like reference numerals can indicate identical or functionally similar elements. It will be understood that elements illustrated in the figures are not necessarily drawn to scale. Moreover, it will be understood that certain embodiments can include more elements than illustrated in a drawing and/or a subset of the elements illustrated in a drawing. Further, some embodiments can incorporate any suitable combination of features from two or more drawings.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">A feedback circuit, a ladder filter, a multi-mode longitudinally coupled SAW (e.g., a double mode SAW (DMS)) filter, and/or a coupled resonator filter (CRF) can include interdigital transducers (IDTs). To avoid or minimize the communication between IDTs, such IDTs can be implemented with physical layouts that are relatively far away from each other. However, the desire to minimize a filter die size can restrict options for designers to physically layout IDTs. In some instances, it is not possible to have IDTs with physical layouts sufficiently far away from each other to avoid communication between the IDTs.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Aspects of this disclosure relate to including an acoustic obstruction structure between IDTs of different feedback circuits to prevent or minimize acoustic communication between the IDTs of different feedback circuits. This can allow designers more flexibility in the physical layout of the feedback circuits. Aspects of this disclosure also relate to including an acoustic obstruction structure between IDTs in a ladder filter, between IDTs in a double mode SAW (DMS) filter, or between a feedback circuit and a main filter, to prevent or minimize the communication between the IDTs.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">To improve multi-frequency band rejection, several IDTs of feedback circuits for each rejection band can be implemented. IDTs of different feedback circuits can communicate with each other by acoustic coupling. Accordingly, an unwanted response can be excited and degrade the rejection performance of a filter. To overcome this problem, an acoustic obstruction structure can be positioned between IDTs. The acoustic obstruction structure can be, for example, a physical separation of portions of a piezoelectric layer to have a piezoelectric opening between the IDTs of different feedback circuits. The opening between the portions of the piezoelectric layer can be formed by way of, for example, etching.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Acoustic obstruction structures can be disposed between different IDTs in a filter, or canceling circuits arranged to cancel frequency components within different frequency bands. In some implementations, such obstruction structures can be implemented in an acoustic wave device that includes an acoustic wave filter coupled to the canceling circuits. For example, an obstruction structure can be positioned between a main filter circuit and the canceling circuit. The acoustic wave filter can be a surface acoustic wave filter. In some embodiments, the different canceling circuits can be coupled to both a transmit filter that includes first acoustic wave resonators and a receive filter that includes second acoustic wave resonators, in which the transmit filter and the receive filter are coupled to each other at a common node. According to certain embodiments, a surface acoustic wave device includes a surface acoustic wave filter, a multi-channel feedback circuit coupled to the surface acoustic wave filter, and an acoustic obstruction structure disposed between interdigital transducer electrodes of the multi-channel feedback circuit.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional side view of an acoustic wave device <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a schematic top plan view of the acoustic wave device <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.
