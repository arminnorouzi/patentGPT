The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention, since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Broadly, one embodiment of the present invention is a flat surfaced hair braiding kit accompanied by teaching techniques specific to the hair braiding kit design. The present invention makes learning the art of braiding while mastering the techniques of finger placement and coordination easier and faster. An added benefit is that the braiding kit teaches users how to keep hands close to the foundation base without creating excess tension from pulling on a flat surface before proceeding to a curved head. The hair braiding kit allows users to learn to braid with or without extensions and apply the techniques learned to create inverted and French plaits (individual braids) and cornrows.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, the term &#x201c;pre-pluck&#x201d; refers to a substrate having hair or a hair analog pre-sectioned. For new braiders, learning to part a full head of hair while also learning to braid simultaneously can be challenging. Pre-sectioned hair allows the new braider to find parts easier by tracing along the pre-sectioned path while focusing on the skill of braiding.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, the term &#x201c;multi-ethnic&#x201d; refers to the presence of multiple hair types or analogs thereof, associated with multiple ethnicities, on a single mannequin.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the braiding kit may have 2 platforms stitched in place to a single mat. Each platform comprises 3 columns of yarn, enabling a student to learn plaiting and cornrowing using 1-, 2- and 3-strand techniques, making the training platform more versatile. The yarns are generally U-shaped along the stitch pleat. In some cases, yarn color may serve as a unique identifier. A first &#x201c;basic&#x201d; platform may comprise 3 columns of yarn, e.g., within a weight category of about 6 to about 7, in 3 colors (e.g., blue, yellow, and red), each column having about 12 to about 16 strands of each color of yarn. The basic platform may be used to teach fundamentals of plaiting and cornrow. A second &#x201c;advanced&#x201d; platform may comprise 3 columns of thinner yarn, e.g., within a yarn weight category of about 4 to about 5, with about 66 to about 150 strands. The &#x201c;advanced&#x201d; strands may be randomly provided in assorted colors across all columns. The yarn strands of the advanced platform may reinforce the fundamentals of plaiting and cornrow learned on the basic platform. A jingle may be provided to assist students in learning where each finger goes.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The materials of manufacture are not particularly limited. While the term &#x201c;yarn&#x201d; is referred to throughout, any suitable hair strands or analog thereof may be used. In some embodiments, multiple types of yarn may be used. For example, different weights of yarn ranging, for example, from a yarn weight category of about 4 to a yarn category of about 7 may be provided in a single kit. The base mat of the present invention may be made of plastic, flexible woven or biodegradable material, for example.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The mat may include a connector that may releasably retain an attachment, such as a Velcro&#xae; fastener, clips, snaps, buckles, hook and fastener and the like.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the yarn or hair sample may be laced through a net backing such that both ends of the hair sample extend from the same side of the net backing and are secured in place with an adhesive substrate such as a sticker. The assembled net and adhesive substrate holding one or more hair samples may be used directly as a braiding kit or may be attached to a braiding kit mat. Multiple thicknesses, textures, etc. of sample hair and/or yarn may be added to the assembly.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, a game (also referred to herein as &#x201c;the effortless braid game&#x201d;) is provided to teach plaiting and cornrowing cognitively through pattern identification, sequence recognition, psycho-motor coordination, and testing. The game may be played by writing the answers, e.g., on paper, or by using a set of pawns or other pawn-like game pieces. The game pieces may be provided in 3 different colors (e.g., blue, yellow, red) to serve as unique identifiers. Alternatively, numbered game pieces may be used (e.g., 1, 2, 3). Students may work individually, in groups, or in pairs, as determined by a roll of dice. Students may predict the number that will result. In the event a determination cannot be made, a coin toss will determine the result. A stopwatch may be provided.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The game may be played on a board having a grid comprising about 7 rows and about 3-4 columns, or &#x201c;lanes&#x201d;, forming multiple grid cells. The number of game pieces matches the number of gameplay cells. For example, a grid having 3 lanes (not including a row label column) and 7 rows has 21 gameplay cells, so 21 game pieces are provided for play. At the end of successful gameplay, every game piece may be placed on the board. In some embodiments, at least 4 finger placement images relating to the braiding technique being taught may be provided in the grid cells. The grid may be selected based on the type of braid being simulated and the skill level of the student. A &#x201c;basic&#x201d; grid with 4 columns, row labels, and 3 individually colored game pieces may be used to learn plaits. An &#x201c;intermediate&#x201d; grid with 3 columns and a column of row numbers (e.g., 1,2,3) may also be used with 3 game pieces in a single solid color, or with numbers, to learn plaits. An &#x201c;advanced&#x201d; grid may be used to learn cornrows. The advanced grid combines a &#x201c;basic&#x201d; grid with an additional 6 rows interspersed with hints to add a game piece or other marker that matches the game piece in the center column of the immediately preceding row. The hints may be labeled &#x201c;Pick up a friend&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;1&#x201d;, &#x201c;2&#x201d;, &#x201c;3&#x201d;, for example. The hint cells may, in some cases, have color to aid the players. The hints are symbolic of periodically adding additional strands of yarn or hair to a plait to form a cornrow. The game pieces from the &#x201c;basic&#x201d; grid may be moved down as the players proceed through the &#x201c;advanced&#x201d; grid. Alternatively, all the game pieces may be removed from the basic grid for use on the advanced grid. In some cases, the board may be folded so that a basic grid or an advanced grid appears alone unless the board is unfolded to also exhibit both grids. In other cases, the board may have a basic grid on one surface and an advanced grid on an opposite surface and may be turned over to continue gameplay.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, the pawn movements may be determined based on the column in which they start. A pawn in &#x201c;lane&#x201d; 1 or 3 may either move one straight down or diagonally to the middle &#x201c;lane&#x201d;. A pawn in &#x201c;lane&#x201d; 2 may not move straight down. Rather, it moves diagonally. Once a pawn has moved straight down once, it may not move straight down again. Rather, it moves diagonally. In other embodiments, game pieces may be added to represent the &#x201c;move&#x201d;. In that case, at the end of play, all game pieces are present on the board.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, a pre-pluck multi-ethnic mannequin is provided, enabling students to practice parting cornrows by braiding each mannequin's hair in a complete hairstyle, such as Cornrow updo, Reverse Cornrow updo, Cornrows straight back, Cornrow and plait combo, and Plait hairstyles. The mannequin's gender may vary. In some cases, the mannequin may be non-gendered and faceless, with the entire surface of the mannequin head covered with varying textures of hair to build dexterity, competence, and confidence.
