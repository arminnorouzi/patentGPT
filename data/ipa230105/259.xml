id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from United Kingdom Patent Application No. 2107903.3, filed Jun. 2, 2021, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to pillows typically used for comfort whilst sleeping, and to pillows or other cushions that may be used to support and provide comfort to the head and/or neck of a user.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Pillows have long been used around the world to increase comfort whilst sleeping and to mitigate against head, neck and back pain resulting from a poor sleeping position. Pillows typically consist of a soft or deformable filler material encased in a fabric cover, which may then be covered again by a second removable cover. Typically, materials used for the filler material are polyester and viscoelastic polyurethane foam&#x2014;so called memory foam as these provide the requisite properties of softness, deformability and resilience. Other materials such as cotton, down, feathers or other polymer fibres may also be used.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Most commonly, pillows used for sleeping provide support to the head and neck of the user against a relatively flat or non-deformable surface used as a bed, whether this be a mattress also designed to compress in response to a user or a hard surface which does not. Pillows can be used directly onto a stone floor for example. The materials of the pillow compress and deform such that the pressure exerted by the weight of the head and neck is distributed throughout a region of the pillow as the contact area between the user and the pillow is increased. A pillow filler material presenting too much resistance to compression would lead to a lack of support, as a much smaller region of the head would make contact with the pillow resulting in discomfort at this region and potential skeletal malalignment and muscular tension. Conversely, a pillow filler material presenting too little resistance to compression may also lead to a lack of support, not only because such a material could be unable to provide the resistance required to support the user at all, but also as a greater resistance to adjustments to the position of the head or body part of body of the user may be presented due to the depression or trough formed by the weight of the user.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Pillows are designed to distribute the weight of the head and neck of a user over a larger area, such that the pressure exerted and thus experienced by the contact area of the head and neck is smaller. This is conventionally done by providing a deformable material confined to a volume comparable to that of an average human head, both convenient for the user to use to support their head and neck and to move to a different location on the bed structure. In this way, a user may tailor the pillow to their own preference by altering the angle or placement of the pillow on the bed structure, placing different regions of their head on to the pillow and shifting the pillow if they wish to change position to lie on their side or back.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, this personalisation of the use of the pillow is not without its limitations. Conventional pillows must be either dragged along the mattress to a new location or picked up wholesale in order to provide head and neck support to a user who may have rolled onto their side or back. If instead the user wishes to stay in the same location on the bed structure whilst changing position to lay on their back, they must shift themselves over the bed structure and pillow into a new position. This high level of friction and resistance may be difficult for some users to overcome for various reasons such as muscle condition, neck or back issues or disability.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Indeed, if a user wishes to tilt their head such that their chin angles further downward or upward, they must effectively lift or drag their head off or over the pillow; a task that may be significantly uncomfortable for those users with neck or back issues. Once tilted, the pillow may require adjustment as a previous compression or lack thereof in the new support region is uncomfortable, or must maintain the weight of their head in this position until they change position again. A tilt to the left or right may be easy for those fully able-bodied, but could represent an uncomfortable or difficult action for those who are not. Pressure sores are frequent among bed or chair bound patients especially on the back of the head and the ear, and long-term issues can develop from an improper sleeping position.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">These issues arise from the design of conventional pillows themselves, which encourage the head of the user to establish and then to remain static in a particular position on the pillow. Movement of the head and neck is resisted by the very design that allows them to deform when receiving the user's head or body part or body to provide comfort, as the mechanism by which a pillow works, i.e. allowing for and maintaining a deformation of the body of the pillow by the head by providing porous and low density structures that allow air to be moved into and out of them, means that any alteration in placement or movement of the head is resisted.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The deformation of the conventional compliant pillow creates a trough or depression that the head sits in, and can be retained in, as the trough or depression serves to resist a sidewise roll or adjustment of the position of the head.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other therapeutic pillows designed specifically for neck or back problems may instead provide for pillows with a lower degree of deformability. These pillows may be much more resilient to deformation to support improved alignment of the head and neck, but do so at the expense of comfort or the ability to adjust the pillow to the user's specific requirements. These pillows often aim to restrict the movement of the head and/or neck of the user in order to provide appropriately placed support.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention as outlined within this document aim to address some of these issues.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention addresses the disadvantages as outlined above. A pillow support comprising an upper surface and a lower surface, wherein the upper surface is arranged to support a pillow, and wherein the lower surface is configured to be at least in part convex such that the pillow support can rock along the direction of convex curvature when supporting the pillow. In some embodiments, the pillow support is comprised of a material suitable to retain the at least part convex configuration of the lower surface when supporting a pillow. In other embodiments, the lower surface has a first at least part convex curvature in a substantially longitudinal direction and a second at least part convex curvature in a substantially latitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In other embodiments of the invention, the pillow support is configured such that the first and/or second curvature is uniform. Other embodiments of the pillow support may have a majority of the lower surface configured to be convex. In other embodiments, the entire lower surface is configured to be convex. In other embodiments, the upper surface is at least in part concave. In other embodiments, the majority of upper surface is configured to be concave. In other embodiments, the entire upper surface is configured to be concave.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">There may be some embodiments in which the upper surface and the lower surface have complimentary curvatures. In some embodiments, the upper surface has a curvature which is uniform. In other embodiments, the upper surface is substantially flat. Further, some embodiments of the invention may comprise at least one airhole. Other embodiments may comprise a plurality of airholes. There are further embodiments that comprise more than one region comprising a plurality of airholes.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Some embodiments of the invention may comprise a hollow body. Other embodiments further comprise a base member and a joint, wherein the joint is configured to allow for the pillow support to adjust at least one of roll, pitch and yaw against base member. Another embodiment further comprises a compliant pillow. Yet another embodiment further comprises an outer cover. Another embodiment is configured to cradle the pillow.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The features outlined in the embodiments above and below may be combined as defined by the claims.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another embodiment, a pillow support suitable for use during sleep and/or rest comprises a pillow support configured to support the body or body part of a user, wherein the pillow support comprises an upper convex surface and the pillow support is further comprised of a material suitable to retain the shape of the upper convex surface under the weight of the user, wherein the degree of curvature is suitable to accommodate a user or a user's body part and optionally a compliant pillow.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another embodiment, the upper convex surface of the cradle/pillow support has a first curvature in a longitudinal direction and a second curvature in a latitudinal direction. In another embodiment, the first and/or second curvature of the cradle/pillow support is uniform. In another embodiment, the first and/or second curvature of the cradle/pillow support is not uniform e.g. the first and/or second curvature may become more shallow towards a given edge and more severe towards a different edge, or the first and/or second curvature may comprise several peaks and troughs, etc. In another embodiment, in addition to any combination of the features as described above, the cradle/pillow support may further comprise a lower surface opposed to the upper convex surface. This lower surface may be convex, flat, concave, may mirror the curvature of the upper surface, may have a curvature that is uniform, or may have a non-uniform curvature i.e. may become more shallow towards a given edge and more severe towards a different edge, or may comprise several peaks and troughs, etc.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another embodiment, the cradle/pillow support, further to any of the above embodiments, may further comprise at least one airhole. In another embodiment, further to any of the above embodiments, may further comprise at least one plurality of airholes. In any of the above embodiments, the cradle/pillow support may be hollow.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another embodiment, the pillow support comprises a cradle/pillow support according to any of the above described embodiments, and further comprises a base member mechanically coupled to the cradle/pillow support via a joint, wherein the joint is configured to allow the cradle/pillow support to adjust at least one of its pitch, roll and yaw relative to the base member. The base member may comprise a flat base of a size substantially similar to that of the net of the cradle/pillow support, and may exhibit chamfering or moulding suitable to allow for the cradle/pillow support to adjust its position on top of the base member. The joint may be any suitable joint such as a ball and socket, any spherical joint, revolute or prismatic joint, or a planar joint.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Any of the above embodiments may further support a compliant pillow and/or be encased in an outer cover.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another embodiment, a pillow support suitable for use during sleep and/or rest may comprise an outer cover, a compliant pillow, and a cradle/pillow support wherein the cradle/pillow support is substantially non-deformable under pressures and forces normal to the field of pillows and has a degree of curvature suitable to accommodate both the compliant pillow and a user or body part of a user, and is a width suitable to fit inside the outer cover. The components of the pillow support may be arranged such that the cradle/pillow support houses the compliant pillow, which in turn are both housed by the outer cover. The cradle/pillow support may allow the pillow support to retain contact with a bed structure while changing the pitch, roll or yaw.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another embodiment, a pillow support suitable for use during sleep and/or rest may comprise an outer cover, a compliant pillow, a base member and a cradle/pillow support wherein the cradle/pillow support is substantially non-deformable under pressures and forces normal to the field of pillows and has a degree of curvature suitable to accommodate both the compliant pillow and a user or body part of a user, and is a width suitable to fit inside the outer cover. The base member may be substantially flat and non-deformable, and may be of a size, thickness and weight suitable to fit inside the outer cover. The base member may further comprise a joint which is suitable to connect to the cradle/pillow support. The components of the pillow may be arranged such that the cradle/pillow support houses the compliant pillow, which in turn is connected via the joint to the base member which in turn are all housed by the outer cover. The joint may be configured to allow the pillow to adjust pitch, roll and yaw.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another embodiment, a pillow support suitable for use during sleep and/or rest may comprise an outer cover, a compliant pillow, a base member and a cradle/pillow support wherein the cradle/pillow support is substantially non-deformable under pressures and forces normal to the field of pillows and has a degree of curvature suitable to accommodate both the compliant pillow and a user or boy part of a user, and is a width suitable to fit inside the outer cover. The base member may be substantially flat and non-deformable, and is a size, thickness and weight suitable to fit inside the outer cover. The base member may further comprise a joint which is suitable to connect to the cradle/pillow support. The components of the pillow may be arranged such that the cradle/pillow support houses the compliant pillow, which in turn is connected via the joint to the base member which in turn are all housed by the outer cover. The joint may be configured to allow the pillow to adjust pitch, roll and yaw.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Advantageously, the embodiments of the invention provide for a synergistic relationship between the bed structure and the pillow. The bed structure, although commonly somewhat deformable, necessarily provides a substantially flat and supportive surface onto which a pillow is placed. A conventional pillow then allows for a user to define a static but personalised support. The present invention provides for this same process, but results in a personalised support which uses the flat support of the bed structure to provide stability for a wide range of more accessible and supported motion. The comfort of conventional pillows is provided via the compliant pillow. Additional comfort is provided to the user as there is a reduced barrier to movement of the head and neck via the cradle/pillow support or via the combination of the cradle/pillow support and the base member and joint. The pillow may be further customised and thus additional comfort may be provided to the user through the use of the at least one inner envelope flap, which allows for the volume of the compliant pillow to be decreased and thus for the density and rigidity of the compliant pillow to increase, depending on the user's preference.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Through the use of the pillow of the present invention, the pillow-mattress or pillow-bed structure combination no longer defines a flat and static environment. Freedom of movement is provided to the user via the cradle/pillow support, without any compromise in comfort.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The invention is described further hereinafter, by way of example only, with reference to, and as illustrated in, the accompanying drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an end on view of a conventional compliant pillow in use;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an end view of an embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a perspective view of an embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a plan view of an embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a side view of a cross section of an embodiment of the invention along the line V-V of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an end view of a cross section of an embodiment of the invention along the line VI-VI of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a plan view of an alternate embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an end on view of a yet further embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a still further embodiment of the invention assembled in conjunction with a pillow and cover as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the following paragraphs, the invention will be described in details by way of example with reference to the figures. It should be appreciated that the examples given are intended as exemplars to aid and inform the reader, and do not represent limitations that define the only way in which the invention may be implemented. The embodiments presented contain features that may be combined or omitted in any number of ways not explicitly disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A pillow support is disclosed herein. It should be understood that the term &#x201c;pillow&#x201d; as used here refers to any padded support, inclusive of cushions, pads, rests and other supports. However, padding is not necessarily required, and hard or non-deformable supports may also be used in order to carry out this invention as is described in more detail below. The primary example used herein describes a pillow support suitable to support the head of a user, but it should be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the head only and may be configured to support other body parts such as the neck, limbs, appendages, torso, hips, or the body as a whole.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Since the specific examples given herein refer to a pillow suitable for (but not limited to) supporting the head and/or neck of a user, the figures show a pillow support designed with a curvature particular to the range of motion of the head of a user. However, alternate curvatures can be used than that shown in the figures depending upon the body part or range and/or nature of motion of consideration. Further, although the primary intended use disclosed is support during sleeping, it will be understood that support for the user may be provided during rest, recovery or other use.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an end on view of a conventional compliant pillow <b>10</b> supported by a mattress or other bed structure <b>14</b> receiving the head of a user <b>12</b> is shown. While awake or when asleep, the user may wish to roll? move their head <b>12</b> left and right (as indicated by indicator A), but must do so within the depression or trough defined by their compression of the pillow via the weight of their head. In this, the user must overcome the resistance presented by the pillow trough made harder by the profoundly inelastic surface. Again, for those users who may suffer from skeletal or muscular issues, this may prove too difficult or burdensome.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a top end on view of an embodiment of the present invention. Here, the user's head <b>12</b> is still provided comfort and support by a soft and compliant pillow <b>10</b>, but also benefits from a pillow support <b>16</b>. The pillow support <b>16</b> comprises a stadium shaped structure that exhibits curvature, such that when placed upon the bed structure, the pillow support <b>16</b> will settle to an equilibrium position in which it makes contact with the bed structure via its centre with either end extending upwards and away from this point. The pillow support <b>16</b> comprises a shallow upper concave portion suitable to accommodate the head and neck of a user and optionally also a compliant pillow, and a shallow convex lower portion complementary to the shallow upper concave portion. The pillow support <b>16</b> acts as a rocking support accommodating the compliant pillow member <b>10</b> and the user's head and neck, although the invention may be carried out without the pillow member <b>10</b>. The pillow support <b>16</b> rests directly on top of the bed structure <b>14</b>, and allows for a rocking motion of the pillow support and thus a pillow supported as shown by B. This rocking motion allows for the pillow support to rock in response to the user's movement, without the user having to overcome the friction provided by trough or depression defined within the compliant pillow member <b>10</b>. Instead, the user may move their head within the range of motion as shown by A against a far reduced resistance to movement as defined by the trough or depression. The pillow support <b>16</b> may be shaped with an inner degree of curvature that is configured to house a body or body part of a user, and an outer degree of curvature that allows for the pillow support <b>16</b> to rock on a base member or substantially flat surface such that the natural range of movement of the house body or body part of the user is facilitated.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The pillow support <b>16</b> also provides a range of motion as shown by B, where B shows the range of motion of the invention during the rocking/rolling of the pillow support responsive to the movement of the user or user's body part. This allows for the point of the pillow support in contact with the bed structure <b>14</b> to change concordantly with the point of the user's head <b>12</b> that lies directly above this point, substantially mimicking the motion defined by the rocking of the head. In this way, the head of the user may rock and the pressure exerted on any one point on the head may be easily adjusted, as the position and orientation of the user's head <b>12</b> need not overcome the friction provided by the compliant pillow member <b>10</b> in order to change position.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the pillow support <b>16</b> in a perspective view. The curvature and dimensions of the pillow support <b>16</b> are chosen to suitably accommodate the relevant body part. The specific embodiment shown is designed to support the head and neck of a user, and as such is of a size and curvature specific to the average human head. Should the pillow support be used to support the hips and lower trunk of a user however, the dimensions and curvature of the pillow support <b>16</b> would of course be chosen to be suitable for this.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The pillow support is substantially non-deformable under pressures and forces normal to the field of pillows. Non-deformable in this context is used to describe that the pillow support provides a resilient structural element to the invention, but this pillow support may of course flex and bend in response to receiving the weight of a user. Typically materials that may be used to construct the pillow support <b>16</b> include but are limited to polyurethane, PLA, polypropylene or other plastics or synthetic materials, or natural materials such as wood or bamboo.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The pillow support <b>16</b> may comprise at least one airhole or a plurality of airholes or more than one plurality of airholes <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> that extend through the pillow support's entire thickness to improve ventilation. These airholes may be sized such that support to the compliant pillow member <b>10</b> is not compromised, but that air may still easily pass through the body of the pillow support <b>16</b>. The net of the pillow support may be a stadium shape, such that all sharp edges are removed. Further, the sides of the pillow support may be rounded to increase the comfort of the user. The thickness of the pillow support may be substantially uniform, or there may be a tapering or thinning of the pillow support towards the edges. There may only be a tapering towards the edges or regions of the edges which may be have the potential to cause the user discomfort, such that these thinned regions exhibit greater flexion and reduced rigidity.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The at least one airhole or plurality of airholes or more than one plurality of airholes <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> may be located at opposite ends of the body of the pillow support <b>16</b>, or may be located centrally or may be distributed throughout the entirety of the body of the pillow support <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a top down view of an embodiment of the pillow support <b>16</b>. In this embodiment, the pillow support may be able to rock along both axes V and VI that extend laterally and longitudinally, allowing for the user to adjust the position of their head and neck or indeed any other body part or entire body within the range of motion contained within a solid angle defined by the movement enabled by the curvature of the body of the pillow support <b>16</b>. The pillow support <b>16</b> may comprise one airhole only, or may comprise a plurality of airholes. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a first plurality of airholes <b>18</b> and a second plurality of airholes <b>20</b> are extant on either end of the pillow support <b>16</b>, but it may be that one airhole or one plurality of airholes is present on the pillow support <b>16</b> only. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the first and second plurality of airholes <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> are substantially similar. However, it may be that plurality <b>18</b> exhibits a different number and configuration of airholes to that of plurality <b>20</b>, or indeed that an additional plurality is present.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> displays a side view of a cross section of the pillow support <b>16</b> taken through axis V. As can be seen, the pillow support <b>16</b> is formed from one solid component with airholes <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> extending therethrough. However, in other embodiments, the pillow support <b>16</b> may comprise a hollow space between the underside <b>24</b> and the upper side <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the pillow support may be comprised of a scintillated material or composite parts that mechanically couple together. Further, the pillow support <b>16</b> may comprise a material that is pliable under forces larger than the weight of an average user's head or body or body part such as a high gauge aluminium, copper or silver wire, covered by a substantially compliant material such as foam or PVC. In this way, the curvature of the pillow support <b>16</b> may be provided by the material pliable under forces larger than the weight of the body or body part or consideration, and the supportive body of the pillow support <b>16</b> may be provided by the compliant material. Such a design would enable a curvature customisable to each user and or body part.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The pillow support <b>16</b> may also comprise a textured surface on the upper side <b>22</b> and or the underside <b>24</b>. Such a textured surface may improve engagement between the pillow support <b>16</b> and the user's body or body part, the bed structure <b>14</b> and or the compliant pillow member <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a cross section of the pillow support <b>16</b> taken along axis VI. In this embodiment, no airholes are present along this axis, but other embodiments may of course include airholes that extend part way or all the way through the pillow support <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> show an embodiment in which there is curvature present in the pillow support <b>16</b> along two different axes. Depending upon the body or body part considered, this curvature may be more or less pronounced in one or the other axis, or may even be absent in some embodiments should the range of motion desired be more limited. Depending upon the intended use of the invention, the curvature may not be uniform and may vary along the length or width of the invention in a uniform or non-uniform manner. The upper side <b>22</b> and the underside <b>24</b> may not exhibit complimentary curvatures as they do in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In fact, the upper side <b>22</b> and or the underside <b>24</b> may be flat whilst the other exhibits curvature, uniform or not.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an alternate embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the pillow support <b>116</b> is in the shape of a cassini oval or rather is comprised of two substantially circular end pieces abridged by a supportive strut. The substantially circular end pieces may comprise pluralities of airholes that extend through the body of the pillow support <b>116</b>. A first plurality of airholes <b>118</b> may extend through one region of the pillow support <b>116</b> and a second plurality of airholes <b>120</b> may extend through another region of the pillow support <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an embodiment in which a base member <b>28</b> is used in conjunction with the pillow support <b>16</b>, connected to the base member <b>28</b> via a joint <b>26</b>. The joint <b>26</b> maintains an alignment of the base member and the pillow support, but allows the orientation of the pillow support <b>16</b> against the base member <b>28</b> to be changed. Depending on the joint member used, the roll, pitch and yaw of the pillow support relative to the base member may be adjusted. In this embodiment, the pillow support may rock against the base member <b>28</b> within the solid angle defined by the range of motion enabled by the joint <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The pillow support <b>16</b> may employ the use of the base member <b>28</b> or may rest directly upon the bed structure. Base member <b>28</b> may be a comprised of a flat underside and a formed upper side. The flat underside may provide stability to the base member and the pillow support <b>16</b>, and the formed upper side may allow for the motion of the pillow support <b>16</b>. For example, if in an embodiment of the invention the pillow support <b>16</b> merely rocks from side to side on top of the base member, the upper side of the base member <b>28</b> may be a concave to present less opposition to this movement.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The joint <b>26</b> is chosen such that the range of motion it enables is suitable to support and facilitate the motion of the user or the user's body part that is being supported by the pillow support. For example, the range of motion required to support the head and neck of a user is much larger than that of the range of motion required to support the foot and ankle of a user. In order to provide support to the head and neck of a user, the pitch, roll and yaw of the pillow support are adjustable. In order to provide support to the foot and ankle of a user however, all that may be required is an adjustable roll. The joint <b>26</b> may be a spherical joint such as a ball and socket or other joint, revolute or prismatic joint, or a planar joint.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows an embodiment in which the pillow support is assembled with the pillow support <b>16</b>, compliant pillow member <b>10</b>, and an outer cover member <b>30</b>. The pillow support may be assembled by positioning the compliant pillow member <b>10</b> onto the pillow support <b>16</b>, such that the pillow support accommodates the compliant pillow member <b>10</b>, and then encasing both the pillow support <b>16</b> and the compliant pillow member <b>10</b> with the outer cover <b>30</b>. Ordinarily but by no means exclusively, the invention is orientated such that the user or user's body part rests or is positioned on the invention such that the compliant pillow provides a deformable and comfortable surface for said body or body part. In a normal configuration, a user rests against the outer cover <b>30</b> which abuts the compliant pillow member <b>10</b> which abuts the pillow support <b>16</b> which abuts the outer cover <b>30</b>, which all rests upon a substantially flat surface.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the pillow support may support the relevant body part of the user without the compliant pillow member <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, the pillow support <b>16</b> may comprise an integrated padding layer which substantially matches the shape and dimensions of the area of the pillow support that faces the user or user's body part. This integrated padding layer may be comprised of a polyurethane foam, memory foam, foam rubber or other padding materials.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The outer cover <b>30</b> may comprise a first envelope flap present at one end of the outer cover. The first envelope flap provides the user with the option of either inserting the compliant pillow member <b>10</b> into the main volume of the outer cover as defined by the walls of the outer cover <b>30</b>, or to insert the compliant pillow member <b>10</b> into the reduced volume as defined by the walls of the outer cover <b>30</b> and the first envelope flap. If the compliant pillow member <b>10</b> is housed only by the walls of the outer cover <b>30</b>, a somewhat larger volume is available for the compliant pillow member <b>10</b> to expand into as the compliant pillow may extend out of the bounds of the outer cover <b>30</b>. By restricting the volume available to the compliant pillow via the first envelope flap, a somewhat denser pillow is presented to the user. This may provide an increased level of support or provide for more comfortable accommodation of the user.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The outer cover <b>30</b> may be made out of any suitable material such as silk, cotton, satin or any other material that provides the requisite comfort to the user, and is pliable and resilient enough to deform to, be removed from and reapplied to the shape of the compliant pillow member <b>10</b> and pillow support <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another embodiment of the outer cover <b>30</b>, a second envelope flap defines a further reduced volume in which the compliant pillow member <b>10</b> may be accommodated. This second envelope flap runs perpendicularly along the inside wall of outer cover <b>30</b>, although the angle and position of further envelope flaps could be employed depending upon the dimensions and shape of the desired pillow. More than one of these envelope flaps may be used in conjunction with one another, for example the first envelope flap and the second envelope flap may be used simultaneously to limit the volume available to the compliant pillow member <b>10</b> both in length and width. It should be appreciated that outer cover <b>30</b> may comprise any number of envelope flaps in any number of combinations, such that the user may tailor the volume of the compliant pillow to their preference and required level of support. The rectangular shape of the pillow shown in the figures is not intended as a limitation to a rectangular pillow, and the skilled reader will understand that envelope flaps may be employed in a range of configurations suited to many pillow shapes, such as circular or generally rounded, triangular, irregular, polygonal or other.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">It will be understood that the above examples and embodiments are provided for the purposes of illustration and explanation and that the invention is not limited to such examples and embodiments.
