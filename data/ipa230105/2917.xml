Numerous amines and their derivatives are used as agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, or food additives. Several million tons of amines are produced annually. They are widely used in both the bulk and fine chemical industries as fundamental materials, additives, dyes, and agrochemicals.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Diamines are used as monomers to prepare polyamides, polyimides, and polyureas. For example, the five carbon compound 1, 5-diaminopentane receives increasing interest as platform chemical, especially as innovative building block for bio-based polymers. Nowadays, the chemical industry is in a transition from a petrochemical industry towards a more biobased industry Amino acids can be interesting starting materials for a variety of nitrogen-containing bulk chemicals after selective removal of the carboxylic group on the &#x3b1;-carbon atom. This nitrogen recycling avoids the repeated, energy-intensive functionalization of hydrocarbons with ammonia.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2014, 6649-6652 discloses decarboxylation of a wide range of amino acids with electrogenerated hypobromite. The highest total yield of aminopentanenitrile (APN) and diaminopentane (DAP) is 93% by decarboxylation of lysine. However, the concentration of the amino acid is quite low. Disadvantageously, the low concentration of reactants requires bigger reaction vessels and therefore more CAPEX in order to produce the same amount at the same time.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is still a need to develop an industrially applicable and efficient method to prepare an amine in higher selectivity and yield under mild conditions.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention therefore pertains to an electrochemical method for converting an amino acid and/or its salts to an amine and/or a nitrile in the presence of a solvent and a compound generating a mediator in reduced form in the solvent, wherein the concentration of the amino acid and/or its salts in the solvent is equal to or greater than 0.15 mol/L.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Without wishing to be bound by any theory, the total yield and selectivity of amine and nitrile obtained by the method according to the present invention is higher than prior art when the reaction medium has a high concentration of amino acid and/or its salts at the beginning of the reaction. Higher reactant concentration reduces the average cost as it increases the rates of out-put and favors large-scale production over small-scale production.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Throughout the description, including the claims, the term &#x201c;comprising one&#x201d; should be understood as being synonymous with the term &#x201c;comprising at least one&#x201d;, unless otherwise specified, and &#x201c;between&#x201d; should be understood as being inclusive of the limits.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As used herein, the terminology &#x201c;(C<sub>n</sub>&#x2014;C<sub>m</sub>)&#x201d; in reference to an organic group, wherein n and m are each integers, indicates that the group may contain from n carbon atoms to m carbon atoms per group.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As used herein, the terminology &#x201c;oxidative decarboxylation&#x201d; reactions are oxidation reactions in which a carboxylate or carboxylic acid group is removed, forming carbon dioxide.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As used herein, the term &#x201c;anode&#x201d; means the electrode from which electrons migrate to the outside circuit and is the electrode where oxidation occurs.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As used herein, the term &#x201c;cathode&#x201d; means the electrode to which electrons migrate from the outside circuit and is the electrode where reduction occurs.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The articles &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are used to refer to one or to more than one (i.e., to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes the meanings &#x201c;and&#x201d;, &#x201c;or&#x201d; and also all the other possible combinations of the elements connected to this term.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is specified that, in the continuation of the description, unless otherwise indicated, the values at the limits are included in the ranges of values which are given.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Ratios, concentrations, amounts, and other numerical data may be presented herein in a range format.
