These grabbers appear to work satisfactory for their intended purposes. However, designers strive to improve the art. One disadvantage of existing grabbers is that they are unable to maneuver between refuse carts that are closely spaced to one another for pick up. When a consumer takes refuse carts to the curb, most will align and position their carts close together. This makes it difficult for an automatic grabber to pick up the individual closely spaced refuse carts. Accordingly, the operator must exit the vehicle to space the refuse carts apart from one another for pick up. Thus, the refuse carts may be individually picked up by the grabber and dumped into the vehicle container. The collection route down time when an operator is required to leave the vehicle is expensive to refuse collection companies.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, the present disclosure provides the art with a grabber that enables pick up and dumping of closely spaced refuse carts with minimal exiting of the vehicle by the operator. The present disclosure provides a grabber assembly that is gear operated. The present disclosure provides positioning of the grabber arms close to one another.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a first aspect of the disclosure, a grabber assembly comprises a beam assembly with a bracket.

The vehicle <b>10</b> includes a cab <b>12</b> with a chassis <b>14</b> that includes a primary collecting container <b>16</b>. Also, a drivetrain, including wheels <b>18</b>, moves the vehicle in a conventional manner. The vehicle <b>10</b> includes front loading arms <b>20</b> that include an intermediate can <b>22</b>. The intermediate can <b>22</b> includes a grabber arm assembly <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the grabber arm assembly <b>24</b> is illustrated. The grabber arm assembly <b>24</b> includes a beam assembly <b>26</b>. The beam assembly <b>26</b> has an overall L-shape with a cylindrical bore <b>28</b> to receive a pivot pin. The cylindrical bore <b>28</b> enables the beam <b>26</b>, as well as the grabber arm assembly <b>24</b>, to pivot with respect to the intermediate can <b>22</b>. The beam assembly <b>26</b> includes a bracket assembly <b>30</b> on one of the L-shaped legs <b>32</b>. The bracket assembly <b>30</b> includes a grabber gear assembly <b>34</b> that moves the grabber arms <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> between the grasping and release positions. The grabber arms <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> include belt members <b>40</b>. The belt members <b>40</b> contact the refuse carts <b>42</b> when grasping the refuse carts, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The arms <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> are manufactured from a spring steel material. Also, a stop <b>44</b> is positioned on the bracket assembly <b>30</b> to keep gear assembly <b>34</b> from coming into contact with refuse carts <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> through <b>8</b></figref>, a better understanding of the grabber gear assembly <b>34</b> will be obtained.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The grabber gear assembly <b>34</b> includes a pair of gear mechanisms <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>. The gear mechanisms <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are substantially identical and the explanation of one will apply to both. The gear mechanisms <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> includes a pair of spherical thrust bearings <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>. The first thrust bearing <b>54</b> is secured to the first bracket plate <b>58</b>. The second thrust bearing <b>56</b> is secured to the second bracket plate <b>60</b>. A shaft or pivot pin <b>62</b> is positioned between the thrust bearings <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>. The shaft ends are connected with the thrust bearings <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>. One of the shafts <b>62</b> includes a driver mounting bracket <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The spherical thrust bearings <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> can be the same or different. In the current illustration, they are the same. The thrust bearings include a housing <b>66</b>, outer ring <b>68</b> and inner ring member <b>70</b>. A fastener <b>72</b> abuts washer <b>74</b> which secures the ring member <b>70</b> on the shaft <b>62</b>. The spherical thrust bearings <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> operates in a conventional manner. The housings <b>66</b> are secured with the bracket plates <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> to secure the gear mechanisms <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> with the bracket assembly <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each shaft <b>62</b> includes an arm pad mounting bracket <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>. Each arm pad mounting bracket <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> includes a mounting pad <b>80</b>. Shaft supports are coupled with the shaft <b>62</b> to secure the arm pad mounting brackets <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> onto the shaft <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Gear sections <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> are mounted on the shafts <b>62</b>. The gear sections <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> mesh with one another to provide rotational movement of the arm pad mounting supports <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> which, in turn, move the arm pad mounting supports <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> as well as the grabber arms <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> between an opened and a grasping position.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">An actuating driver <b>90</b> is coupled with the bracket <b>64</b> via a pin <b>92</b>. The actuating driver <b>90</b> can be a pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder or the like. The cylinder is a cushioned cylinder. The cushion cylinder enables a smooth operation of the cylinder to enable the opening and grasping of the grabber arms <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>. The cylinder is retracted to close or grasp and extends to open. Thus, with the use of downstream hydraulics, any valve leakage or cylinder leakage of the pistons will cause the grabber to move the arms <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> to their opened position.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The gear sections <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> are used to time the grabber arms <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> to enable the gear mechanisms <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> to be positioned closer together by a factor of two compared with existing grabbers. This enables the beam assembly <b>26</b> to be reshaped and enable the grabber arms <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> to be inserted between closely positioned refuse carts as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Also, the grabber arms <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, due to the spring steel, can deflect. This enables the grabber belts <b>40</b> to automatically adjust for a variety of to be picked up refuse carts. The belts <b>40</b> tensioned from the grabber arms <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> are sized to create a uniform load on the refuse carts. This provides a better grip on the cart. Also, rotation of the grabber gear assembly <b>34</b> is driven in an equal rotation so that both sides of a refuse cart will experience the same amount of force. The cushioned cylinder <b>90</b>, while enabling smooth operation, also reduces impact.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The self-aligning spherical thrust bearings provide a larger contact area as the arm moves from a pick up to a dump position. This permits angular misalignment and can withstand radial or heavy axial loads. This increases durability under rotational impact conditions such as lifting and dumping a refuse cart. The grabber arm may also be utilized on the chassis and dump directly into the primary container.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The foregoing description of the embodiments has been provided for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the disclosure.
