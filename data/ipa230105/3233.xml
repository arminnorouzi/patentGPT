The conventional wall fan suspension structure comprises a wall-side coupling part <b>70</b> and a fan-side coupling part <b>80</b>. The wall-side coupling part <b>70</b> is fixed and locked on a wall W, an insertion hook <b>71</b> is formed at a middle of the wall-side coupling part <b>70</b>, and the fan-side coupling part <b>80</b> is fixedly coupled to a wall fan Q. The fan-side coupling part <b>80</b> has a protruding unit <b>81</b>, and an insertion gap <b>82</b> is formed between the protruding unit <b>81</b> and the wall fan Q. When a user wants to hang the wall fan Q on the wall W, the user only needs to pick up the wall fan Q and align the insertion gap <b>82</b> with the insertion hook <b>71</b> and make sure that the insertion hook <b>71</b> is inserted into the insertion gap <b>82</b>, so that the wall-side coupling part <b>70</b> bears a weight of the wall fan Q, and the process of hanging the wall fan Q is completed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the aforementioned conventional wall fan suspension structure is extremely inconvenient when actually being used to hang the wall fan Q, the reason is that the insertion gap <b>82</b> is very narrow, and when the user aligns the insertion gap <b>82</b> with the insertion hook <b>71</b>, it often takes a certain amount of time to be able to align the insertion gap <b>82</b> with the insertion hook <b>71</b>. Moreover, with the wall fan Q having a certain weight, it is even more difficult for users with less strength to align the insertion gap <b>82</b> with the insertion hook <b>71</b>, and therefore, a wall fan suspension structure that is convenient for assembly is required.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention provides a wall fan suspension structure, and a main object of the invention is to make assembly convenient for users.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to achieve the aforementioned object, the wall fan suspension structure of the invention comprises:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">a wall-side coupling element with a first bottom plate part and a first side plate part connected to each other, the first side plate part extends from the first bottom plate part, and the first bottom plate part is provided for fixing on a wall surface; and</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">a fan-side coupling element with a second bottom plate part and a second side plate part connected to each other, the second side plate part extends from the second bottom plate part, the second bottom plate part is provided for coupling with a wall fan, and the second side plate part and the first side plate part are connected by sleeving with each other.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Based on the foregoing, it can be known that the invention mainly connects the second side plate part with the first side plate part by sleeving with each other, so that the wall-side coupling element and the fan-side coupling element can be coupled with each other in order to achieve the object of making assembly convenient for users.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a conventional wall fan suspension structure;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side view of the conventional wall fan suspension structure;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is an exploded view of a wall fan suspension structure of the invention;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is an exploded view of a wall fan suspension structure of the invention;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the combined wall fan suspension structure of the invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the wall fan suspension structure of the invention;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram of combination of the wall fan suspension structure of the invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> is a schematic diagram of combination of the wall fan suspension structure of the invention;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> is a schematic diagram of combination of the wall fan suspension structure of the invention;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an exploded view of the wall fan suspension structure according to a preferred embodiment of the invention; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the wall fan suspension structure according to a preferred embodiment of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The invention provides a wall fan suspension structure.
