A battery cell winding technique is widely used in the field of lithium-ion batteries by virtue of high production efficiency. However, electrode plates for being wound in a winding process are long (usually longer than 40 cm), and a positive electrode plate and a negative electrode plate expand in volume to different degrees during charge-and-discharge cycles. Especially, a silicon-containing negative electrode plate expands more severely in volume, thereby making the wound battery cell incur problems of deformation and wrinkles after a chemical formation capacity test. Nevertheless, by virtue of a high capacity per unit volume, the silicon-containing negative electrode plate is the most promising negative electrode plate for use in next-generation lithium-ion batteries. Therefore, it is crucial to alleviate the expansion and deformation problems of lithium-ion batteries, especially a lithium-ion battery that includes a silicon-containing negative electrode plate.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the problem that a battery cell in a lithium-ion battery cell expands and deforms, the present invention provides a lithium-ion battery and a preparation method thereof. By reserving a space in a punched pit of an outer packaging film (packaging film), the present invention effectively alleviates expansion and battery cell deformation, and in turn, improves the cycle stability of a full battery.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To achieve the foregoing objective, the present invention provides a lithium-ion battery. The lithium-ion battery includes a battery cell, an electrolytic solution, and a packaging film. The battery cell is formed by winding a positive electrode plate and a negative electrode plate that are separated by a separator. The lithium-ion battery is half-charged to obtain a half-charged full battery. The half-charged full battery is stripped of the packaging film to obtain a half-charged cell.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When a width of the half-charged full battery is w<sub>1</sub>, a width of the half-charged cell is w<sub>2</sub>, and g=w<sub>2</sub>/w<sub>1</sub>, the following conditional expression (1) is satisfied:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>0.4&#x3c;g&#x3c;0.997&#x2003;&#x2003;(1).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">The negative electrode plate includes a silicon-based material, and, when a capacity per unit volume of the negative electrode plate is a, a and g satisfy the following conditional expression (2):</p><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>420 mAh/cm<sup>3</sup><i>&#x3c;g&#xd7;a&#x3c;</i>2300 mAh/cm<sup>3</sup>&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">where, 619 mAh/cm<sup>3</sup>&#x3c;a&#x3c;3620 mAh/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">Specifically, the width w<sub>1 </sub>of the half-charged full battery means a minimum value of the width of the half-charged full battery (including the packaging film and the battery cell) obtained after the lithium-ion battery is half-charged, and is usually measured with a vernier caliper. The width w<sub>2 </sub>of half-charged cell means a maximum value of a distance between a left turning and a right turning on an outermost circle of the battery cell of the half-charged full battery stripped of the packaging film, and is usually measured with a vernier caliper. When the number of winding layers and the width of the battery cell are constant, the width of the half-charged full battery can be adjusted by adjusting a clearance between the battery cell and a punched pit of the packaging film according to the volume expansion degree of the negative electrode plate, thereby effectively alleviating volume expansion and battery cell deformation, improving cycle stability of the full battery, and increasing a product yield rate.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">In the lithium-ion battery according to the present invention, the silicon-based material preferably includes at least one of nano-silicon, oxide of silicon, a silicon-carbon composite material, or a silicon alloy material.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">In the lithium-ion battery according to the present invention, the silicon-based material is preferably granular, and an average particle diameter thereof is preferably 500 nm to 30 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0012">In the lithium-ion battery according to the present invention, the nano-silicon is preferably granular, and an average particle diameter thereof is preferably less than 100 nm.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0013">In the lithium-ion battery according to the present invention, the oxide of silicon is preferably SiO<sub>x</sub>, where 0.6&#x2264;x&#x2264;2.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0014">In the lithium-ion battery according to the present invention, a positive active material of the positive electrode plate is preferably at least one selected from combinations of lithium cobalt oxide, lithium manganese oxide, lithium iron phosphate, lithium nickel oxide, lithium nickel cobalt oxide, or lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0015">In the lithium-ion battery according to the present invention, the separator is preferably at least one selected from combinations of polyethylene, polypropylene, or polyvinylidene difluoride.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0016">In the lithium-ion battery according to the present invention, the packaging film is preferably an aluminum plastic film.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0017">In the lithium-ion battery according to the present invention, the packaging film preferably possesses a thickness of 67 to 153 &#x3bc;m and a tensile strength of 4 to 10 N/mm.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0018">The present invention further provides a method for preparing a lithium-ion battery, including the following steps:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0019">S1. mixing a positive active material with a conductive agent, a binder, and a solvent, and stirring to make a mixed slurry, coating a substrate with the mixed slurry, and performing drying, cold calendering, and slitting to obtain a positive electrode plate;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0020">S2. mixing a negative active material with a conductive agent, a binder, and a solvent, and stirring to make a mixed slurry, coating a substrate with the mixed slurry, and performing drying, cold calendering, and slitting to obtain a negative electrode plate;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0021">S3. stacking the positive electrode plate, a separator, and the negative electrode plate in sequence, and winding the stacked materials to obtain an electrode assembly; and</p><p id="p-0025" num="0022">S4. putting the electrode assembly into a packaging film, and, upon completion of drying, injecting an electrolytic solution, and performing sealing, chemical formation, degassing, and edge trimming to obtain a full battery.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0023">The full battery is half-charged to obtain a half-charged full battery.

TERMS AND DEFINITIONS</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0035">1. Wrinkling, Deformation</p><p id="p-0041" num="0036">In the present invention, wrinkling is a phenomenon of continuous warps of a separator and a positive or negative electrode plate; deformation is defined as a phenomenon in which the ripple value is greater than 2%, and severe deformation is defined as a phenomenon in which the ripple value is greater than 4%, where the ripple value is calculated by the following formula: ripple value=parallel plate gauge thickness (PPG) of a full battery/thickness at maximum material condition (MMC)&#x2212;1.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0037">2. Half Charging</p><p id="p-0043" num="0038">A full battery charged until the voltage reaches a range of 3.7 V to 4.0 V is defined as a half-charged full battery, and such a charging process is referred to as half charge.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">II. TESTING BATTERY PERFORMANCE</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0039">1. Testing the Deformation Severity of a Full Battery:</p><p id="p-0045" num="0040">With PPG defined as the parallel plate gauge thickness of a full battery, the</p><p id="p-0046" num="0041">PPG thickness of the full battery is measured with a parallel plate gauge by performing the following steps: putting the full battery in a PPG under a pressure of 700 g to measure a surface-to-surface thickness of the full battery for three consecutive times, and averaging out three thickness values to obtain a PPG thickness. With MMC defined as a point-to-point thickness of the full battery, the MMC thickness is measured by performing the following steps: sampling three points at intervals below an aluminum tab along a vertical direction of the tab, measuring the thickness of the battery with a micrometer, and averaging out three thickness values to obtain the MMC thickness. With the ripple value defined to be PPG/MMC-1, the deformation severity is determined based on the thickness data of the full battery subjected to 100 cycles. Deformation occurs if the ripple value is greater than 2%, and the deformation is severe if the ripple value is greater than 4%.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0042">2. Testing the Performance of the Full Battery:</p><p id="p-0048" num="0043">High-temperature cycle performance test: Charging the battery at a constant current of 0.7 C at 45&#xb0; C. until the voltage reaches 4.4 V; charging the battery at a constant voltage until the current reaches 0.025 C; leaving the battery to stand for 5 minutes, and then discharging the battery at a current of 0.5 C until the voltage reaches 3.0 V. Using the capacity obtained in this step as an initial capacity, and cycling the battery repeatedly by charging at 0.7 C and discharging 0.5 C. Comparing the capacity in each cycle with the initial capacity to obtain a plurality of ratios that are then plotted into a capacity fade curve. In the present invention, the cycle performance of the battery is indicated by the number of cycles completed when the capacity fades to 80% of the initial capacity.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">III.

at the end of 100 cycles. When the ripple value is greater than 2%, deformation occurs. When the ripple value is greater than 4%, the deformation is severe. The capacity a per unit volume is tested by the following method: taking a negative electrode plate (single-side region) obtained in the embodiments, measuring a thickness of a single side of electrode plate (denoted by t<sub>1</sub>) and a thickness of a corresponding copper foil (denoted by t<sub>2</sub>) with a high-precision micrometer, drying the electrode plate at 85&#xb0; C. in a vacuum oven for 12 hours, cutting the electrode plate in a dry environment into small discs 1.4 cm in diameter by using a stamping machine. Using a metallic lithium sheet as a counter electrode in a glovebox, using a Ceglard composite film as a separator, and injecting an electrolytic solution to make a button battery. Performing a charge-and-discharge test on the battery by using a LAND series battery test system to test the charge-and-discharge performance of the battery. The obtained capacity is denoted by C1 (mAh). Therefore, the capacity per unit volume is: a=C1&#xd7;coating weight per unit area/(t<sub>1</sub>-t<sub>2</sub>).</p><p id="p-0141" num="0135">First, as indicated by comparison between Embodiments 1 to 6 and Comparative Embodiments 1 to 3, on condition that the capacity per unit volume of the negative electrode plate is constant, different values of g give rise to different degrees of deformation.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0136">Specifically, as found in the grouped comparison of Embodiment 4 versus Comparative Embodiment 2 and Embodiment 6 versus Comparative Embodiment 3, on condition that the capacity per unit volume is constant, the battery cell deformation and the battery cycle stability are significantly affected by an excessive or deficient value of g.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0137">Further, as found in the grouped comparison of Embodiments 1 and 2 versus Comparative Embodiment 1, Embodiments 3 and 4 versus Comparative Embodiment 2, and Embodiments 5 and 6 versus Comparative Embodiment 3, on condition that the capacity per unit volume of the negative electrode plate is constant, the battery cell is severely deformed when the value of g is greater than 0.997 or the value of g is less than 0.4. When the value of g is greater than 0.997, it indicates that the clearance between the battery cell and the punched pit is too small to alleviate the volume expansion of the battery cell. As shown in Comparative Embodiments 1 to 2, the battery cell is severely deformed. When the value of g is less than 0.4, as in Comparative Embodiment 3, it indicates that the clearance between the battery cell and the punched pit is relatively large. On the one hand, the space available for the electrolytic solution to infiltrate the battery cell is relatively small on condition that the amount of the electrolytic solution is constant, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) deteriorates, and in turn, the cycle performance deteriorates. On the other hand, the mobility of the battery cell in the punched pit is higher, thereby impairing the safety of the battery cell. In addition, with the severely deformed battery cell, the cycle performance of the battery deteriorates significantly. That is because, when the battery cell is severely deformed, voids are formed between the electrode and the separator, micro-cracks are formed on the electrode plate, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film is ruptured and reorganized, and the electrolytic solution is consumed, thereby deteriorating the cycle performance of the battery.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0138">Second, as found in the comparison of Embodiment 12 versus Comparative Embodiments 6 and 7, on condition that the value of g is constant, a different capacity a per unit volume of the negative electrode plate makes a sharp difference in the battery cell deformation and the battery cycle stability. Therefore, for each different capacity a per unit volume of the negative electrode plate, a matching value of g needs to be set to alleviate the volume expansion, further alleviate the battery cell deformation, and improve the battery cycle stability. Moreover, as can be seen from Comparative Embodiments 6 and 7, the battery cell is severely deformed when the value of g is greater than 0.4 and less than 0.997 but g&#xd7;a is less than 420 mAh/cm<sup>3</sup>. Similarly, when the value of g is greater than 0.4 and less than 0.997 but g&#xd7;a is greater than 2300 mAh/cm<sup>3</sup>, the battery cell is also severely deformed, as shown in Comparative Embodiment 8. That is to say, a different capacity a per unit volume of the negative electrode plate gives rise to a different degree of volume expansion. Therefore, a distinct clearance (that is, an interspace between the battery cell and the punched pit of the packaging film) needs to be set according to the capacity a per unit volume, so as to minimize volume expansion and achieve highest space efficiency.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0139">To sum up, the value of g is a main factor affecting the deformation of the battery cell subjected to cycles. For each different capacity a per unit volume of the negative electrode plate, a matching value of g needs to be set to optimize the structure of the battery cell. When the capacity a per unit volume of the negative electrode plate is in the range of 619 mAh/cm<sup>3</sup>&#x3c;a&#x3c;3620 mAh/cm<sup>3</sup>, the battery cell deformation is greatly alleviated and the battery cycle stability is greatly improved by setting the value of g to be greater than 0.4 and less than 0.997 and making g&#xd7;a be greater than 420 mAh/cm<sup>3 </sup>and less than 2300 mAh/cm<sup>3</sup>. This shows that, for a purpose of optimizing the structure of the battery cell, the practice of reserving a corresponding space according to each different capacity a per unit volume can effectively alleviate the volume expansion and battery cell deformation, and in turn, improve the cycle stability of the battery and increase the product yield rate.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0140">In addition, referring to Table 1, as can be seen from Comparative Embodiments 9 to 10, the thickness and strength of the aluminum plastic film exert an impact on the battery cell deformation and the later-stage cycle performance of the battery. If the aluminum plastic film is excessively thin, the tensile strength is not enough, so that the battery cell subjected to cycles deforms to some extent. If the aluminum plastic film is excessively thick, the volumetric specific capacity of the full battery decreases to some extent because the volume of the aluminum plastic film is a part of the total volume although the battery cell is not deformed obviously and the cycle performance of the battery does not fade obviously.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0141">Understandably, a plurality of other embodiments of the present invention are conceivable. Various modifications and variations, which may be made by a person skilled in the art based on the present invention without departing from the spirit and essence of the present invention, still fall within the protection scope of the present invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
