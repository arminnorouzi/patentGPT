In order to improve utilization efficiency of spectrum resources, dedicated spectrum can be changed to be shared spectrum in a spectrum management mode. To this end, the spectrum may be divided into multiple frequency resource blocks, an effective sharing by different levels of wireless services shall be ensured while there is no impact on the original service system, to improve spectrum utilization efficiency.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed a mechanism for managing and using authorization for three-layer mobile access points and interference management in the 3.5 GHz band, which includes a dynamic database including geographic information and a spectrum access system for managing potential interference. FIG. shows an exemplary structure of the system, which includes a FCC database, a spectrum access system (SAS), Domain Proxy, an element management system (EMS) (optional), a citizens broadband radio service device (CBSD), an interface between SASs, and an interface between an SAS and a user. In addition, the schematic diagram of the system also shows processing such as informing incumbent, incumbent detection (environmental sensing capability (ESC)), and CBSD sensing (optional).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is realized by the inventor that, with the mobility of mobile access points and rapid change of traffic requirements, a large amount of overhead for the spectrum access system (SAS) will be caused. Therefore, a method used for reducing the overhead of the spectrum access system is required. In addition, the behavior characteristic and tendency of mobile access points, and the impact of the mobile access points on the overhead of the system are not taken into account in the conventional overhead control technology.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A brief description of the embodiments of the present disclosure is provided below to provide basic understanding for certain aspects of the present disclosure.

An element and a feature shown in one of the accompanying drawings or one embodiment of the present disclosure may be combined with an element and a feature shown in one or more other drawings or embodiments. It should be noted that representations and descriptions of components and processing which are irrelevant to the present disclosure and known to those skilled in the art are omitted in the accompanying drawings and the specification for clarity.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Before describing the embodiment, an application scenario of the embodiment is briefly described with reference to an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The exemplary scenario shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows wireless access points such as a citizens broadband radio service device (CBSD), a user equipment (UE) (which may include, for example, an incumbent access user, a priority access license (PAL) user and a general authorized access (GAA) user), and a spectrum management device (such as a co-existence Manager (CxM) or a spectrum access system (SAS) device) at different locations.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, a historical behavior of the mobile access points can be recorded in the system. Due to the mobility of mobile access points and a change in a spectrum requirement, the mobile access point may frequently access to different SAS databases to query an available spectrum, resulting in a large amount of overhead of the system.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an electronic device <b>100</b> for wireless communication according to an embodiment includes a processing circuitry <b>110</b>. The processing circuitry <b>110</b> may be implemented as a specific chip, a chipset or a central processing unit (CPU) or the like.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The processing circuitry <b>110</b> includes an acquiring unit <b>111</b> and a determining unit <b>113</b>. It should be noted that, although the acquiring unit <b>111</b> and the determining unit <b>113</b> are shown as functional blocks in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it should be understood that the functions of the acquiring unit <b>111</b> and the determining unit <b>113</b> may also be realized as a whole by the processing circuitry <b>110</b>, rather than being realized by discrete components of the processing circuitry <b>110</b>. In addition, although the processing circuitry <b>110</b> is shown as one block in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the electronic device <b>100</b> may include multiple processing circuitries. The functions of the acquiring unit <b>111</b> and the determining unit <b>113</b> may be realized by the multiple processing circuitries, so that the functions are realized under the cooperation of the multiple processing circuitries.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The electronic device according to the embodiment may, for example, be implemented on a spectrum management device side, or may be implemented on a mobile access point side.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, a spectrum management device may include a CxM or a device arranged on the SAS side. In addition, a mobile access point may include, for example, a CBSD or a UE.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The acquiring unit <b>111</b> is configured to acquire a parameter related to a behavior characteristic of a mobile access point.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The determining unit <b>113</b> is configured to determine a spectrum allocation manner for the mobile access point based on the parameter acquired by the acquiring unit <b>111</b>. According to an embodiment, the determining unit <b>113</b> is further configured to determine an access manner to the spectrum access system based on the parameter acquired by the acquiring unit <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The parameter acquired by the acquiring unit <b>111</b> may be determined based on one or more of the following information of the mobile access point: an identifier (ID), a position, a moving speed, a time of making a spectrum request, and data traffic within a time period between spectrum requests. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, the parameter related to the behavior characteristic of the mobile access point may include a parameter related to mobility of the mobile access point.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">More specifically, the parameter related to the mobility may include a normalized eigenvalue of a transfer matrix of the mobile access point. Elements of the transfer matrix correspond to probabilities of transferring of the mobile access point between corresponding spectrum management devices.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The parameter related to the mobility of the mobile access point and a manner of acquiring the parameter are described hereinafter with reference to specific examples.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is assumed that there are m SAS databases and n spectrum management devices (such as CxM) in an area. In a case that the mobile access point (CBSD) moves between management areas of CxMs, the mobile access point may record the spectrum management devices (the CxM and the SAS) to which it belongs at different times, and with which a location transfer probability matrix of transferring of the CBSD between CxMs and SASs may be established. The above process may be performed on the CBSD side, without increasing overhead of the SAS.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, the location transfer probability matrix may be calculated in the following manner. Probabilities of occurrence of the CBSD in corresponding CxM and SAS at this moment are calculated according to historical locations of the CBSD at the same moment, and a transfer probability is calculated according to historical locations of the CBSD at a next moment, to obtain a transfer probability matrix at this moment. The transfer probability matrix is expressed as, for example, the following formula (1).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>P</mi>       <mi>A</mi>      </msub>      <mo>(</mo>      <mi>t</mi>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <mo>[</mo>      <mtable>       <mtr>        <mtd>         <mrow>          <msub>           <mi>P</mi>           <mn>11</mn>          </msub>          <mo>&#x2062;</mo>          <mrow>           <mo>(</mo>           <mi>t</mi>           <mo>)</mo>          </mrow>         </mrow>        </mtd>        <mtd>         <mo>&#x22ef;</mo>        </mtd>        <mtd>         <mrow>          <msub>           <mi>P</mi>           <mrow>            <mi>n</mi>            <mo>&#x2062;</mo>            <mn>1</mn>           </mrow>          </msub>          <mo>&#x2062;</mo>          <mrow>           <mo>(</mo>           <mi>t</mi>           <mo>)</mo>          </mrow>         </mrow>        </mtd>       </mtr>       <mtr>        <mtd>         <mo>&#x22ee;</mo>        </mtd>        <mtd>         <mo>&#x22f1;</mo>        </mtd>        <mtd>         <mo>&#x22ee;</mo>        </mtd>       </mtr>       <mtr>        <mtd>         <mrow>          <msub>           <mi>P</mi>           <mrow>            <mi>n</mi>            <mo>&#x2062;</mo>            <mn>1</mn>           </mrow>          </msub>          <mo>&#x2062;</mo>          <mrow>           <mo>(</mo>           <mi>t</mi>           <mo>)</mo>          </mrow>         </mrow>        </mtd>        <mtd>         <mo>&#x22ef;</mo>        </mtd>        <mtd>         <mrow>          <msub>           <mi>P</mi>           <mi>nn</mi>          </msub>          <mo>&#x2062;</mo>          <mrow>           <mo>(</mo>           <mi>t</mi>           <mo>)</mo>          </mrow>         </mrow>        </mtd>       </mtr>      </mtable>      <mo>]</mo>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>Formula</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mtext>   </mtext>     <mrow>      <mo>(</mo>      <mn>1</mn>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">in which, P<sub>A</sub>(t) represents a transfer matrix, an element P<sub>ij </sub>in the matrix represents a probability of transferring of the mobile access point between a spectrum management device i and a spectrum management device j, and t represents time.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">In particular, in order to obtain the transfer probability matrix of the CBSD transferring between the SASs, transferring of CBSD between different CxMs in a same SAS may be combined as appropriate, or the probabilities of transferring of the CBSD between different CxMs in a same SAS may be placed in neighboring positions.

The parameter can reflect overhead of spectrum management implemented by the spectrum management device caused by the mobility of the mobile access point (for example, spectrum resources need to be reallocated for different locations, or an interference pattern used by the coexistence management unit changes due to a change in the location).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0077">In addition, the shape parameter in the generalized Pareto distribution may be obtained as described above in conjunction with formulas (3) and (4). If the parameter is greater than 0.5, the average of the bandwidth required by the mobile access point does not converge. If the parameter is greater than 1, the variance of the bandwidth required by the mobile access point does not converge.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0078">Next, according to actual system configuration, the mobile access point may report, for example, information on the above parameters to the spectrum management device.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0079">The spectrum management device (such as the CxM or the SAS, depending on the system configuration) can integrate the information on the parameters reported by the mobile access points (such as CBSD), and cluster mobile access points according to the integrated parameters. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows an example of a clustering result, in which, the abscissa and the ordinate respectively correspond to the sum (the parameter related to mobility) of the normalized eigenvalues of the location transfer matrix and the shape parameter (the parameter related to the changing rate of the traffic volume) in the generalized Pareto distribution. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the mobile access points denoted as four dots in the lower left corner can be classified into the same type, and the mobile access point denoted as one dot in the upper right corner can be classified into another type.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0080">For example, according to a record of CBSD (the record may include, for example, a CBSD ID, a flag bit (which is used for, for example, indicating a time period, etc.), a CBSD location, a CBSD moving speed, data traffic from a last time stamp to a present time stamp, and a time stamp, etc.), the shape parameter of the probability density function of the traffic and the sum of the normalized eigenvalues of the location transfer matrix may be calculated. Then, the characteristics of the CBSD are analyzed according to whether the shape parameter is greater than 1 and the sum of the normalized eigenvalues is greater than 2, and an analysis result indicates whether the mobility is high and whether the changing rate of the data traffic required is high. For example, four types of users can be obtained by matching the mobility and the changing rate in various cases, that is, a mobile access point with low mobility and a stable change in data traffic required, a mobile access point with high mobility and a stable change in data traffic required, a mobile access point with low mobility and a drastic change in data traffic required, and a mobile access point with high mobility and a drastic change in data traffic required. The corresponding processing can be performed for different types of users.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0081">In addition, if the mobile access points which cause large overhead are located in a management area of the same SAS, the spectrum management devices (such as the CxM) corresponding to the SAS may coordinately allocate a same or similar spectrum to avoid or reduce overhead caused by reallocation for spectrum resources, or reserve a spectrum for the mobile access points to reduce the number of making requests, thereby reducing overhead of the system. If the mobile access points which cause large overhead are located in management areas of multiple SASs, each of the spectrum management devices (such as CxM) corresponding to the multiple SASs may respectively query currently available spectrums from SASs, and determine an overlapping spectrum between the available spectrums based on information returned by the SAS. If there is an overlapping spectrum, the overlapping spectrum may be set as a public available channel, which may be allocated to the mobile access points. If there is no overlapping spectrum, for example, a channel which is currently used less frequently may be used as a public available channel. The mobile access points which cause large overhead can be set to use only the public available channel, thereby reducing information interaction with SAS during switching.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0082">On the other hand, for mobile access points which do not cause excessive overhead of the system, the spectrum can be applied more intelligently by predicting the data traffic requirements of the mobile access points, which reduces the number of applying spectrum and the number of querying the SAS database, thereby reducing overhead of the system caused by these mobile access points.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0083">In addition, since generally a spectrum is randomly allocated to a newly added mobile access point, the mobile access point may access to the SAS multiple times due to an inappropriate spectrum allocated to the mobile access point, which increases overhead of the system. Therefore, for the newly added mobile access point, similarity between the newly added mobile access point and the mobile access points corresponding to the existing scheme can be calculated based on a behavior model parameter of the newly added mobile access point, and spectrum similar to that of the mobile access point corresponding to similar behavior characteristics to the newly added mobile access point is allocated to the newly added mobile access point. For example, if the similarity between the newly added CBSD and the CBSD corresponding to the existing allocation scheme exceeds a similarity threshold, the spectrum allocation scheme can be formulated for the newly added CBSD according to the existing allocation scheme, thereby reducing the overhead caused by formulating the spectrum allocation scheme by the spectrum management device (such as SAS or CxM).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0084">In the conventional technology, the CBSD periodically access to the SAS, which results in large overhead. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, different types of mobile access points may be determined after analysis for behavior characteristic. In particular, for the CxM or the SAS to which the user with high mobility accesses frequently, a same spectrum may be allocated, to avoid the CBSD from frequently applying a spectrum when the CBSD switches frequently between different CxMs or SASs, thereby reducing overhead of the system.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0085">Accordingly, according to an embodiment, the parameters acquired by the acquiring unit <b>111</b> may further include information related to the spectrum management device accessed by the mobile access point, and the determining unit <b>113</b> may be further configured to determine spectrums which are at least partially the same, for the predetermined number of spectrum management devices to which the mobile access point accesses with a high frequency.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0086">In addition, for a CBSD with a low change rate in data traffic (traffic is stable), a future requirement of the CBSD may be predicted, a spectrum is applied, and heartbeat of the CBSD (that is, a period of accessing the SAS) is extended, thereby reducing the number of applying spectrum from the SAS by the CBSD. For a CBSD with a quick change in data traffic, for example, if there is no incumbent access user in the CBSD, the heartbeat of the CBSD can be extended, and the number of applying the spectrum may be limited, to reduce the number of applications of the CBSD received by the SAS.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0087">Accordingly, according to an embodiment, a traffic requirement of the mobile access point may be predicted, and a spectrum request is made based on the predicted traffic requirement.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0088">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an electronic device <b>200</b> for wireless communication according to an embodiment includes a processing circuitry <b>210</b>.
