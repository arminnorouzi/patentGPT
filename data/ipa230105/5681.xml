It is thereby more robust in respect of material erosion.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">The first insulating material may be a refractory material such as a ceramic, for instance a ceramic in the group of nitrides (e.g. BN, Si3N4) or oxides (e.g. Al2O3, SiO2) or a silicate such as a calcium silicate or sodium silicate, a cement, such as Portland or alumina cement, bonded mica sheets or reinforced with glass fibers, like continuous or short glass fibers.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">The second insulating material may be a polymer, for instance a thermoset or thermoplastic polymer, such as polyoxymethylene (POM), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polyimide (PI), polyamide (PA) and/or a polyolefin, such as polypropylene (PP) or polymethylpentene (PMP) and/or or another such polymer.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">The first insulating material may be provided as a coating on the second insulating material.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">Alternatively, the first insulating material may be provided in a first area of the first tubular element and the second insulating material may be provided in a second area of the first tubular element.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">The first area may cover a first part of the first tubular element comprising a first protruding end of the first tubular element and the second area may cover a second part of the first tubular element forming the rest of the first tubular element, where the first protruding end is the part of the first tubular element that first protrudes from the space when moving from the starting position to the protruding position.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">The first protruding end may be placed in a first plane that is perpendicular to the breaking axis.

The second tubular element may also have an outer surface and an inner surface, where the inner surface is closer to the breaking axis than is the outer surface.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0032">In this case the third area may extend a third length along the breaking axis on the outer surface in a direction away from the second protruding end and may extend a fourth length along the breaking axis on the inner surface in a direction away from the second protruding end, where the third length is longer than the fourth length.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0033">The breaking device may additionally comprise an arcing chamber comprising a breaker element receiving structure comprising at least one cavity, where each cavity has at least one wall and is provided for receiving a corresponding tubular element of the breaking member. The at least one cavity is thereby formed in a body of electrically insulating material. The cavity walls of the breaker element receiving structure may be of a fifth insulating material and a sixth insulating material, where the sixth insulating material has a higher wear resistance than the fifth insulating material.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0034">The sixth insulating material may additionally have a higher thermal resistance than the fifth insulating material.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0035">The fifth insulating material may be the same as the second insulating material and the sixth insulating material may be the same as the first insulating material.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0036">A first part of a cavity wall adjacent a first contact area of the electrically conducting outer member may be of the sixth insulating material.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0037">It is additionally possible that a second part of a cavity wall adjacent a second contact area of the electrically conducting inner member is of a seventh insulating material having a higher wear resistance than the fifth insulating material.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0038">The seventh insulating material may additionally have a higher thermal resistance than the fifth insulating material.

The second cavity part adjacent the second contact area may in this case be provided in the inner wall of a first or inner cavity provided for receiving the first or inner tubular element, while the first cavity part adjacent the first contact area may be provided in the outer wall of a possible outer cavity for receiving the outer tubular element, if being present, and otherwise in the outer wall of the first cavity.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0040">The space may be defined by a wall. In this case it is furthermore possible that a part of this wall located adjacent the first contact area of the electrically conducting outer member is made of an eighth insulating material that is the same as the first insulating material. The rest of the wall may be made of another insulating material, such as a polymer, like a polymer of any of the above-mentioned types.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0041">The recess between the outer tubular element and the inner tubular element may be defined between an inner surface of the outer tubular element and the outer surface of the inner tubular element.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0042">The outer tubular element may be joined to the inner tubular element at a joining area of the outer surface of the inner tubular element. The joining area may more particularly be formed as cylinder-shaped part of the outer surface of the inner tubular element around the breaking axis.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0043">A bottom of the recess may be located in a third plane that is perpendicular to the breaking axis.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0044">The inner tubular element may have a first protruding length, which may be a length between the first protruding end and the area where the outer tubular element is joined to the inner tubular element. The outer tubular element may in turn have a second protruding length that is the length between the second protruding end and the area where the outer tubular element is joined to the inner tubular element.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0045">Thereby the first protruding length of the inner tubular element may be the length of the inner tubular element along the breaking axis between the first plane and the third plane and the second protruding length of the outer tubular element may be the length of the outer tubular element along the breaking axis between the second plane and the third plane.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0046">The second protruding end may be located between the first protruding end and the joining area in relation to the breaking axis.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0047">The second protruding end may in one variation be substantially located midway between the joining area and the first protruding end in relation to the breaking axis. The second protruding end may thereby be substantially placed halfway between the first protruding end and the area where the outer tubular element is joined to the inner tubular element. Thereby the second plane with the second protruding end may be located essentially halfway between the first and the third planes. The distance between the second plane and the first plane may thereby also essentially be the same as the distance between the second plane and the third plane.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0048">The second protruding end may in another variation be located closer to the joining area than to the first protruding end in relation to the breaking axis. Thereby the second plane with the second protruding end may be placed closer to the third plane than to the first plane. The distance between the second plane and the third plane may consequently be lower than the distance between the second plane and the first plane.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0049">The second protruding end may in a further variation be located closer to the first protruding end than to the joining area in relation to the breaking axis. The second plane may thereby be located closer to the first plane with the first protruding end than to the third plane with the bottom of the recess. This also means that the distance between the second plane and the first plane may be lower than the distance between the second plane and the third plane.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0050">The inner cavity may be shaped for receiving the first protruding length of the inner tubular element and the outer cavity may be shaped for receiving the second protruding length of the outer tubular element.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0051">Through the existence of the inner and outer cavities, there is also formed a wall between them, which wall mates with the recess between the inner and outer tubular elements. A tip of the wall may more particularly be adapted to mate with the bottom of the recess.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0052">It is furthermore possible that in the protruding position the first protruding end of the inner tubular element is arranged to abut the bottom of the inner cavity, the second protruding end of the outer tubular element is arranged to abut the bottom of the outer cavity and/or the bottom of the recess being arranged to abut the tip of the wall separating the inner cavity from the outer cavity.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0053">The device may further comprise at least one vent opening for venting the arcing chamber when the breaking member has moved from the starting position, where each vent opening leads to one of the cavities. In this case it is possible that at least one first radial vent opening leads to the inner cavity. It is additionally or instead possible that at least one second radial vent opening leads to the outer cavity. Each radial vent opening may additionally lead to a cavity via a vent channel.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0054">The outer member, the inner member, the inner tubular element, and the outer tubular element may be substantially concentric with the breaking axis.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0055">The breaking device may further comprise an actuator arranged to force the breaking member from the starting position to the protruding position.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0056">The breaking device may additionally comprise a contact arrangement comprising a moveable contact element, which contact arrangement is configured to selectively electrically disconnect the outer member and the inner member. The contact arrangement may more particularly be configured to electrically disconnect the outer member and the inner member during movement of the breaking member from the starting position towards the protruding position.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0057">The breaking member provides an electrical potential barrier between the outer member and the inner member. Due to the shape of the breaking member, the arc can be effectively trapped by movement of the breaking member from the starting position to the protruding position.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0058">As the breaking member moves from the starting position, an arc path between the inner member and the outer member is lengthened. The extended length of the arc path may eventually cause the arc to be extinguished. Thereby, a circuit comprising the breaking device can be opened. The starting position and the protruding position of the breaking member may thus correspond to a closed position and an open position, respectively, of the breaking device.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0059">Since the breaking device comprises a breaking member with tubular elements, the breaking device constitutes a tubular breaker. The breaking device may be used for AC and DC applications, e.g. in low voltage and medium voltage ranges. The breaking device may be active or passive (i.e., not requiring auxiliary power other than from an applied circuit source). The breaking device according to the present disclosure may for example be implemented as a switching device, a power device, a commutation switch, a disconnector, a passive DC breaker, a passive AC breaker, a load switch, or a current limiter.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0060">The breaking member may further be arranged to move back along the breaking axis from the protruding position to the starting position. The breaking device may be configured to interrupt current multiple times.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0061">The inner member may be connected to an inner electrical contact of an electrical circuit and the outer member may be connected to an outer electrical contact of the electrical circuit. The outer member and the inner member may be of various shapes, for example tubes, bars, or rods.

The breaking member receiving structure is provided for receiving a breaking member and formed as a body of electrically insulating material. The end section <b>12</b>, wall <b>14</b> and breaking member receiving structure together forms an arcing chamber <b>16</b>. The breaking device <b>10</b> further comprises an outer electrical contact <b>18</b> and an inner electrical contact <b>20</b>.

It is thereby more robust in respect of material erosion. The first insulating material may be a refractory material, for instance a ceramic, such as a ceramic in the group of nitrides (e.g., BN, Si3N4) or oxides (e.g., Al2O3, SiO2) or a silicate such as calcium silicate or sodium silicate. As an alternative the refractory material may be a cement, such as Portland or alumina cement. As yet another alternative, the refractory material may be bonded mica sheets. As a further example, the refractory material may be reinforced with glass fibers, like continuous or short glass fibers. The second insulating material may be a polymer, for instance a thermoset or thermoplastic polymer, such as polyoxymethylene (POM), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polyimide (PI), polyamide (PA) and/or a polyolefin, such as polypropylene (PP) or polymethylpentene (PMP) and/or or another such polymer.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0082">In the version shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the first tubular element <b>28</b> comprises a first area <b>35</b> with the first insulating material and a second area <b>36</b> with the second insulating material.

The inner surface <b>40</b> of the outer tubular element <b>37</b> is closer to the breaking axis <b>25</b> than is the outer surface <b>42</b> of the outer tubular element <b>37</b>. Both tubular elements <b>28</b> and <b>37</b> may have circular cross-sections and may be centered around and be concentric with the breaking axis <b>25</b>.

Thereby a recess <b>46</b> of circular shape is defined between the inner and outer tubular elements <b>37</b> and <b>28</b>. The recess <b>46</b> is more particularly defined between the inner surface <b>40</b> of the outer tubular element <b>37</b> and the outer surface <b>34</b> of the inner tubular element <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0089">The second protruding end <b>38</b> is located between the first protruding end <b>30</b> and the joining area <b>44</b> in relation to the breaking axis <b>25</b>.

The contact arrangement is configured to selectively electrically disconnect the outer member <b>50</b> and the inner member <b>52</b>. The outer member <b>50</b> comprises an outer member tip that for this reason is equipped with a tap point <b>69</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0122">There is also a moveable contact element <b>66</b> joined to outer member <b>50</b> at the tap point <b>69</b> and being pivotable around the tap point <b>69</b>. The moveable contact element <b>66</b> comprises a first contact pad <b>67</b> and the inner member <b>52</b> comprises an inner member tip equipped with a second contact pad <b>68</b>. When the breaking member is in the starting position the moveable contact element <b>66</b> covers the space <b>59</b> and the first contact pad <b>67</b> is in contact with the second contact pad <b>68</b>. If the breaking member is moved to the protruding position, it pushes the moveable contact element <b>66</b> upwards and causes the contact element <b>66</b> to pivot in a first direction around the tap point <b>69</b>. This in turn causes the contact pads <b>67</b> and <b>68</b> to be separated from each other. There is also a closing element <b>70</b> connected to the moveable contact element, which closing element <b>70</b> can be actuated to cause the contact element <b>66</b> to pivot in an opposite second direction around the tap point <b>69</b> for connecting the contact pads <b>67</b> and <b>68</b> to each other.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0123">Each of the outer member tip and the inner member tip are positioned adjacent to the arcing chamber <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0124">The first contact area may be made up of the outer member tip, possibly together with the moveable contact element <b>66</b> and the first contact pad <b>67</b>, while the second contact area may be formed by the inner member tip with the second contact pad <b>68</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0125">The breaking device <b>10</b> further comprises an actuator. The actuator may be of various types in order to force the breaking member <b>26</b> away from the starting position. One example of an actuator is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Here the actuator <b>71</b> is exemplified as a ballistic actuator in the form of a Thomson drive. The actuator <b>71</b> comprises a Thomson coil <b>72</b>, an armature <b>74</b>, an armature relaxing cushion <b>76</b>, and an actuator tube <b>78</b> joined to the breaking member (not shown). The Thomson coil <b>72</b> and the armature <b>74</b> are arranged to provide energy to a ballistic movement of the breaking member <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0126">The operation of the breaking device according to the first embodiment will now be described with reference being made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, which shows the breaking member <b>26</b> in the process of being moved into the arcing chamber <b>16</b> when interrupting an arc</p><p id="p-0124" num="0127">A. In the figure the areas and parts with different materials have been omitted because these have no real influence on the operation.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0128">The breaking member <b>26</b> is configured to move from the starting position along the breaking axis <b>25</b> in order to reach the protruded position.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0129">The breaking member <b>26</b> thereby moves, by means of the actuator <b>71</b>, from the starting position along the breaking axis <b>25</b> to the protruding position where the breaking member <b>26</b> protrudes into the arcing chamber <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0130">Initially the breaking member <b>26</b> is in the starting position in which it is contained in the space <b>59</b> between the electrically conducting outer and inner members <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>. Then when a current interruption is desired, the breaking member <b>26</b> is moved by the actuator <b>71</b> from the starting position along the breaking axis <b>25</b>. At some point in time the first tubular element <b>28</b> will move the contacting element of the contact arrangement so that it is separated from the conducting inner member <b>52</b>, thereby creating an arc A between the conducting outer and inner members <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0131">The arc generates an overpressure within the arcing chamber <b>16</b>. The overpressure is released by means of the vent openings <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Furthermore, venting of the arcing chamber <b>16</b> through the vent openings <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> takes place immediately when the breaking member <b>26</b> starts to move.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0132">During the movement of the breaking member <b>26</b> from the starting position to the protruding position, the breaking member <b>26</b> thus pushes the moveable contact element <b>66</b> of the contact arrangement from the electrically connected state into an electrically disconnected state. The outer member <b>50</b> is thereby electrically disconnected from the inner member <b>52</b> and an arc A is ignited between the outer member <b>50</b> and the inner member <b>52</b>. It should here be realized that the use of the breaking member <b>26</b> as a &#x201c;pushing member&#x201d; is however only one of several ways to electrically disconnect the outer member <b>50</b> and the inner member <b>52</b> by means of the contact arrangement.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0133">The first tubular element <b>28</b> of the breaking member <b>26</b> will then start to enter the arcing chamber <b>16</b> and more particularly start to enter the first cavity <b>54</b> of the arcing chamber <b>16</b>, where the first protruding end <b>30</b> is the first part of the first tubular element <b>28</b> that enters the arcing chamber <b>16</b>. It is thus the part of the first tubular element <b>28</b> that first protrudes from the space <b>59</b> when moving from the starting position to the protruding position. This will extend the arc A between the inner and outer members <b>52</b> and <b>50</b> so that it also passes around the first protruding end <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0134">As the breaking member <b>26</b> is continued to be moved along the breaking axis, more of the inner tubular element <b>28</b> will enter the first cavity <b>54</b>. Thereby, the arc will go from the tip of the inner member <b>52</b>, pass along the inner surface <b>32</b> of the first tubular element <b>28</b> around the first protruding end <b>30</b> and then back along the outer surface <b>34</b> of the first tubular element <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0135">Finally, the breaking member <b>26</b> reaches the protruded position. In this case the first protruding end <b>30</b> has reached and abuts the bottom of the first cavity <b>54</b> thereby interrupting the arc. The first protruding end <b>30</b> of the first tubular element <b>28</b> thus abuts the bottom of the first cavity <b>54</b>. Thereby the arc may get chopped and the current quenched.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0136">The breaking member <b>26</b> may then be returned from the protruding position to the starting position for reuse of the breaking device <b>10</b>. The return movement may for example be made manually or by means of the actuator <b>71</b> or the closing element <b>70</b> of the contact arrangement.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0137">If operating a known breaking device through moving a breaking member with a first tubular element only comprising the second insulating material into a first cavity with walls only made of the fifth insulating material, where the second and fifth insulating materials are polymers, the generation of an arc causes material erosion of the breaking member as well as possibly also of the first cavity in the arcing chamber. The material erosion may be most prominent at the protruding end of the first tubular element but may also be significant at the entry point into the arcing chamber. This material erosion has a negative effect on the durability of the breaking device. It is in fact possible that the breaking device will fail to operate satisfactory after a relatively few numbers of operations, such as fifty.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0138">Put differently, the arcing chamber initially builds enough arc voltage before the breaking member reaches full stroke inside the arcing chamber; because arc squeezing effect into the thin cavity between the breaking member and the surrounding walls, together with polymer ablation and arc elongation help to generate high arc voltage within relatively short travel distance of the breaking member.<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0139">However, after dozens of operations (often <b>40</b> to <b>50</b> operations) the squeezing effect of electrical arc is gradually reduced, due to material loss at the polymeric parts, mainly at the top of the breaking member and also at the bottom of the arcing chamber. Therefore, the interruption time increases.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0140">As the operations continue, the performance of DC current interruption deteriorates until breaking failure occurs.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0136" num="0141">To ensure squeezing of the arc in the gap between the breaking member and the cavity side walls, the first cavity may need to remain sufficiently narrow even after hundreds of interruptions. However, also the polymeric ablation helps to increase the arc voltage.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0142">Through providing the first insulating material that has a higher wear resistance and possibly also a higher thermal resistance in at least the first area of the first tubular element of the breaking member, the reliability is considerably increased, which reliability can be further enhanced by the provision of the sixth and/or seventh insulating materials also in the receiving structure.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0143">Thus, at least at the most exposed and eroded regions the materials are exchanged from polymeric ones to robust refractory material. Those regions are the top of the first tubular element and the bottom of the arcing chamber and pepper can in the middle of the breaking member.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0144">The refractory materials need to be dielectric and mechanical robust. To avoid cracking they also should have a high thermal shock resistance. As mentioned earlier, they could be for instance ceramics from the group of nitrides (e.g., BN, Si3N4) or oxides (e.g., Al2O3, SiO2) or a silicate such as a calcium silicate or sodium silicate. As was also mentioned earlier the materials could also be cements, such as Portland or alumina cement, bonded mica sheets or reinforced with glass fibers, like continuous or short glass fibers.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0145">The joining of refractory and polymeric material can be done with different shapes and layouts of the contact surfaces together with a structural adhesive to fill potential air gaps.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0146">By sufficient reduction of the erosion rate at the critical regions, the size of the recess can be kept small enough over the lifetime of the arcing chamber. Thus, the arc will be sufficiently squeezed in the cavity, while the remaining polymeric part can still contribute to the arc quenching.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0147">It can thus be seen that the insulating member (breaking member) is made of polymer and a refractory top part/coating to withstand erosion by the arc. Additionally, refractory parts/coatings at the bottom of the arcing chamber at the first cavity entrance can also be implemented to ensure gap size stability. Thus, the arc can be squeezed and elongated into the cavity between breaking member and cavity walls and finally interrupted.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0148">The electric lifetime of the breaking device at nominal current is thereby improved. More robust, erosion resistant refractory materials are utilized on the top of the breaking member and the entrance of the arcing chamber. The erosion can be sufficiently decreased by implementation of a refractory material compared to the &#x201c;all polymer solution&#x201d;, so that the cavity size is kept stable and small enough to squeeze and elongate the arc until interruption. Therefore, the proposed design with a combination of polymeric and refractory materials in the breaking member as well as inside the arcing chamber should have a longer electrical lifetime.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0149">The first embodiment thus improves the total wear resistance of the breaking device.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0150">The operation of the breaking device according to the second embodiment when interrupting the current will now be discussed in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0151">Also here, the breaking member <b>26</b> is configured to move from the starting position along the breaking axis <b>25</b> in order to reach the protruded position.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0152">The breaking member <b>26</b> thereby moves, by means of the actuator <b>71</b>, from the starting position along the breaking axis <b>25</b> to the protruding position where the breaking member <b>26</b> protrudes into the arcing chamber <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0153">Initially the breaking member <b>26</b> is in the starting position in which it is contained in the space <b>59</b> between the electrically conducting outer and inner members <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>.

At some point in time the inner tubular element <b>28</b> will move the contacting element of the contact arrangement so that it is separated from the conducting inner member <b>52</b>, thereby creating an arc A between the conducting outer and inner members <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0154">During the movement of the breaking member <b>26</b> from the starting position to the protruding position, the breaking member <b>26</b> thus pushes the moveable contact element <b>66</b> of the contact arrangement from the electrically connected state into an electrically disconnected state, thereby electrically disconnecting the outer member <b>50</b> from the inner member <b>52</b> and an arc A is ignited between the outer member <b>50</b> and the inner member <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0155">The inner tubular element <b>28</b> of the breaking member <b>26</b> will then start to enter the arcing chamber <b>16</b> and more particularly start to enter the inner cavity <b>54</b> of the arcing chamber <b>16</b> where again the first protruding end <b>30</b> is the first part of the inner tubular element <b>28</b> that enters the arcing chamber <b>16</b>. It is thereby the part of the inner tubular element <b>28</b> that first protrudes from the space <b>59</b> when moving from the starting position to the protruding position. This will extend the arc A between the inner and outer members <b>52</b> and <b>50</b> so that it also passes around the first protruding end <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0156">As the breaking member <b>26</b> is continued to be moved along the breaking axis <b>25</b>, more of the inner tubular element <b>28</b> will enter the inner cavity <b>54</b>. Thereby, the arc will go from the tip of the inner member <b>52</b>, pass along the inner surface <b>32</b> of the inner tubular element <b>28</b> around the first protruding end <b>30</b> and then back along the outer surface <b>34</b> of the inner tubular element <b>28</b>. If the outer tubular element <b>36</b> has not yet entered the arcing chamber the arc will thereafter continue to the tip of the outer member <b>50</b>. The movement thus further extends or squeezes the arc A.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0157">When movement continues along the breaking axis, the outer tubular element <b>37</b> then starts to enter the outer cavity <b>62</b>, where the second protruding end <b>38</b> is the first part of the outer tubular element <b>37</b> that enters the arcing chamber <b>16</b>. It is thus the part of the outer tubular element <b>37</b> that first protrudes from the space <b>59</b> when moving from the starting position to the protruding position. This will cause the arc A to go from the tip of the inner member <b>52</b>, pass by the inner surface <b>32</b> of the inner tubular element <b>28</b>, around the first protruding end <b>30</b>, back along the outer surface <b>34</b> of the inner tubular element <b>28</b> into the recess <b>46</b> between the inner and outer tubular elements <b>28</b> and <b>37</b> around the tip of the wall separating the inner and outer cavities <b>54</b> and <b>62</b>, continue along the inner surface <b>40</b> of the outer tubular element <b>37</b>, turn around the second protruding end <b>38</b> and then continue along the outer surface <b>42</b> of the outer tubular element <b>37</b> and make contact with the tip of the outer member <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0158">Finally, the breaking member <b>26</b> reaches the protruded position. In this case the first protruding end <b>30</b> has reached and abuts the bottom of the inner cavity <b>54</b>, the second protruding end <b>38</b> has reached and abuts the bottom of the outer cavity <b>62</b> and the bottom of the recess <b>46</b> between the inner and outer tubular elements <b>28</b> and <b>37</b> has received and abuts the tip of the wall between the inner and outer cavity <b>54</b> and <b>62</b>, thereby interrupting the arc. The first protruding end <b>30</b> of the inner tubular element <b>28</b> thus abuts the bottom of the inner cavity <b>54</b>, the second protruding end <b>38</b> of the outer tubular element <b>37</b> abuts the bottom of the outer cavity and the bottom of the recess <b>46</b> abuts the tip of the wall separating the cavities <b>54</b> and <b>62</b>. Thereby the arc may get chopped and the current quenched. As an alternative it is possible that only one or two of the breaking member parts, the first protruding end, second protruding end and bottom of the recess, actually abuts the corresponding part of the arcing chamber in the protruded position.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0159">As is described above, the arc A is forced to move from the inner member <b>52</b>, over the first and second protruding ends <b>30</b> and <b>38</b> of the breaking member <b>26</b>, and back to the outer member <b>50</b>. The breaking member <b>26</b> thereby lengthens the arc path between the outer member <b>50</b> and the inner member <b>52</b> and forces the arc to pass over this extended length.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0160">That is, the breaking member <b>26</b> forces the arc to extend over a considerable distance, which distance corresponds to the sum of twice the first protruding length and twice the second protruding length. In some implementations, this stressing of the arc in the protruding position causes the arc to be extinguished. The protruding position thereby constitutes one position of the breaking member <b>26</b> for interrupting a current between the outer member <b>50</b> and the inner member <b>52</b> by means of the breaking member <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0161">In the same way as in the first embodiment, the use of the first, third, sixth and seventh materials has the advantage of limiting material erosion. Additionally, the provision of the second tubular element in the breaking member has the advantage of extending the arc as compared with the first embodiment, which has a further positive influence of the wear. The wear resistance is thus even further enhanced by the use of two tubular elements instead of one. This is due to the fact that the arc is elongated.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0162">Through the implementation of the breaking member as an inner and an outer second tubular element, the electric lifetime of the breaking device is improved compared with if only one tubular element is used.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0163">Furthermore, through using a breaking member with an inner tubular element and an outer tubular element, it may be possible to build up an arc voltage in the arcing chamber that is higher than if only one tubular element is used. It may as an example be in the range <b>1</b>.<b>2</b> - <b>2</b>.<b>0</b> times higher depending on the length of the outer tubular element. Alternatively, the erosion of the tubular member is lowered. This can also be achieved with a minimal increase in the size of the breaking device.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0164">The use of the breaking member with an inner tubular element and an outer tubular element thus provides an additional arc length and allows the building of a higher arc voltage, in order to allow a faster interruption of a DC current and to improve electric endurance at nominal current.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0165">The voltage withstand capability of the breaking device <b>10</b> mainly depends on the stroke length of the breaking member <b>26</b>. The current interruption capability mainly depends on the strength of the breaking member <b>26</b> to withstand the arc pressure. The length of the stroke, the speed of the breaking member <b>26</b>, the thickness and length of the breaking member <b>26</b> etc. may be varied depending on implementation.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0166">The protruding length of the outer tubular elements can be varied. The protruding length of the outer tubular element of the breaking member can be extended or reduced compared to the previously given example. Th second protruding end can be located closer to the first protruding end than to the joining area in relation to the breaking axis, i.e. the second plane with the second protruding end may be located closer to the first plane with the first protruding end than to the third plane with the bottom of the recess. Thereby the distance between the second plane and the first plane may be lower than the distance between the second plane and the third plane. Alternatively, the second protruding end can be located closer to the joining area than to the first protruding end in relation to the breaking axis, i.e. the second plane with the second protruding end may be located closer to the third plane with the bottom of the recess than to the first plane with the first protruding end.
