This can eventually lead to early damage of the actuator.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, with some pump types, the pressure of the fluid supplied to the injector is not constant, so that the metering of the fluid injected into the exhaust line is imprecise.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this context, the disclosure is to propose a fluid injector that does not have the above defects.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disclosure relates to a fluid injector in an exhaust pipe, wherein a fluid is an aqueous urea solution, the fluid injector comprising:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">a single fluid inlet;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">a fluid outlet;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">a fluid injection port in the exhaust pipe;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">an injection passage, fluidly connecting the single fluid inlet to the fluid injection port;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">a shut-off device comprising a shutter, movable between an open position, authorizing the circulation of fluid through the fluid injection port, and a closed position, prohibiting the circulation of fluid through the fluid injection port, as well as an actuator, configured to selectively move the shutter between the open and closed positions;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">a cooling passage, having an upstream portion, fluidly connected to the injection passage and a downstream portion, connected to the fluid outlet, the cooling passage being configured so that the circulation of fluid along the cooling passage cools the actuator of the shut-off device;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">a fluid pressure regulator interposed in the cooling passage.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As such, the fluid injector has a passage provided for cooling the actuator of the shut-off device. This cooling is achieved by circulating the same fluid as that which is injected into the exhaust pipe. This simplifies the injector arrangement onboard the vehicle, since it is unnecessary to connect this injector to another fluid source, such as the engine cooling circuit.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Advantageously, the injection passage and the cooling passage are served by a single fluid inlet. This also helps to simplify the mounting of the fluid injector, since it is unnecessary to have one pipe serving the injection passage and another serving the cooling passage. The injector is connected to a single pipe, which simplifies its arrangement onboard the vehicle. The injector takes up less space.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, the cooling passage is used to house a fluid pressure regulator, which makes it possible to even the pressure of the fluid supplied to the injector. The dosage of the fluid injected into the exhaust line is thus improved. This advantage is obtained without significantly increasing the size of the injector.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The fluid injector may further have one or more of the following features, considered individually or in any technically possible combination:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">the pressure regulator is configured to regulate a pressure of the fluid entering through the single fluid inlet;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">the pressure regulator comprises a base, closing a section of the cooling passage with a regulating opening for the passage of fluid, a piston, a flexible member arranged to bias the piston in a closed position of closing the regulating opening, the piston being movable under the effect of the pressure of the fluid against application of bias exerted by the flexible member from the closed position into a range of positions in which the regulating opening is open;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">the shut-off device is a solenoid valve, the actuator comprising a magnetic coil cooled by the circulation of fluid;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">the magnetic coil is arranged around an intermediate section of the injection passage, extending along a central axis, the cooling passage comprising a cooling portion arranged around the magnetic coil, an upstream chamber fluidly communicating with the cooling portion and located radially outward of the cooling portion, a downstream chamber fluidly communicating with the cooling portion and located radially outward of the cooling portion, the upstream portion connecting the upstream chamber to the injection passage;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">the fluid pressure regulator is arranged in the upstream portion;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">the upstream portion opens into an inlet section of the injection passage, located between the fluid inlet and the intermediate section;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">the injection passage comprises a fluid heating chamber and a fluid inlet port, opening into the heating chamber, the injector comprising a further shut-off device comprising a further shutter, movable between an open position, authorizing the circulation of fluid through the fluid inlet port, and a closed position, prohibiting the circulation of fluid through the fluid inlet port, and another actuator, configured to selectively move the other shutter between its open and closed positions.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to a second aspect, the disclosure relates to an assembly comprising a fluid reservoir, a pump that has suction connected to the fluid reservoir and a discharge, and an injector that has the above features, the single fluid inlet being fluidly connected to the pump discharge and the fluid outlet being fluidly connected to the reservoir.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to a third aspect, the disclosure relates to an exhaust line comprising an exhaust line and an assembly having the above features, the injector being configured to inject fluid into the exhaust pipe.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further features and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent from the detailed description given below by way of indication and not in any way limiting, with reference to the appended Figures, of which:</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a simplified schematic representation of a vehicle with an exhaust line according to the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of the injector of the exhaust line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, with a part of the cooling passage being shown, in cross-section, to reveal the pressure regulator;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of the injector of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, seen from another angle, with other parts of the injector shown in cross-section;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an enlarged view of part of the injector of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, again with other parts of the injector shown in cross-section;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of part of the injection passage and the shut-off devices;
