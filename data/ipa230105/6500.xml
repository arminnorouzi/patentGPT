Recently, due to ecological concerns and concerns over gasoline prices or shortages, many consumers and commercial operators have sought vehicles that operate on alternate power sources, such as electricity. Electric vehicles now represent a growing market and are expected to surpass internal combustion engine vehicle sales within the next five to ten years. An electric vehicle includes an electric motor that operates based on input electrical power, which is defined by an electrical voltage and an electrical current. Although electric motors are very efficient by design, the electric motors are not 100% efficient. Unfortunately, due to inherent losses in materials and other factors, a portion of the input power results in heating of the electric motor. If the heat is not properly removed, a temperature of the motor can become excessive, resulting in damage to or failure of the electric motor.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure provides a multiple-discharge rain manifold for electric motor cooling and related system and method.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a first embodiment, an apparatus includes a housing configured to receive at least a portion of an electric motor.

Those skilled in the art will understand that the principles of this disclosure may be implemented in any type of suitably arranged device or system.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As noted above, an electric vehicle includes an electric motor that operates based on input electrical power, which is defined by an electrical voltage and an electrical current. Although electric motors are very efficient by design, the electric motors are not 100% efficient. Unfortunately, due to inherent losses in materials and other factors, a portion of the input power results in heating of the electric motor. If the heat is not properly removed, a temperature of the motor can become excessive, resulting in damage to or failure of the electric motor. In some cases, for example, end turn windings of an electric motor are one place where a coolant fluid, such as an oil product, might be introduced in order to extract heat from the electric motor. However, introducing a coolant fluid to an electric motor is often difficult and can suffer from various problems. As a particular example, when an electric motor is round, the coolant fluid may not be evenly distributed, which can allow individual hot spots to form and damage to occur. Additionally, to deliver a coolant to respective portions of the electric motor, holes must be drilled through a manifold and housing of the electric motor after the manifold has been coupled to the housing. As a result, caps or freeze plugs must be placed on the manifold over each hole to seal the manifold.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">This disclosure describes various embodiments of a multiple-discharge rain manifold for electric motor cooling and related system and method. As described in more detail below, a housing is configured to receive at least a portion of an electric motor, and a manifold is disposed on an upper surface of the housing. Multiple vias extend between a cavity within the manifold and an interior portion of the housing. The cavity within the manifold is defined by at least a portion of the upper surface of the housing, one or more side walls extending from the upper surface of the housing, and a cover lid coupled to the one or more side walls and configured to cover the cavity and the vias.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the manifold can be positioned above a stator or other portion(s) of an electric motor to be cooled, and the vias can be used to create a &#x201c;rainfall&#x201d; pattern of coolant fluid over the portion(s) of the electric motor to be cooled. Each of the vias may have any suitable size and shape, and different vias may have common or different sizes and shapes. Also, the vias may have any suitable arrangement relative to the portion(s) of the electric motor to be cooled. These features of the vias can be adjusted as needed or desired to create a desired flow pattern and to provide the desired amount(s) of coolant fluid to the portion(s) of the electric motor to be cooled. In particular embodiments, a low-pressure system may create vertical jets of coolant fluid to target and hit one or more zones of the electric motor independent of pump flow and pressure. Various approaches for forming these types of structures, such as through the use of casting and friction stir welding, are also described.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The embodiments of the multiple-discharge rain manifold may provide various benefits or advantages depending on the implementation. For example, the design of the vias can be easily modified in order to provide desired amounts of coolant fluid to desired areas of an electric motor. Also, the multiple-discharge rain manifold can provide for a more even distribution of a coolant fluid over an electric motor, which can help to improve motor cooling and lead to increased performance and motor life.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example electric vehicle <b>100</b> according to embodiments of this disclosure.

The power inverter <b>335</b> may include a variable frequency drive <b>340</b> to control a frequency of the three-phase input power. Note, however, that the motor <b>305</b> may be powered in any other suitable manner.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates one example of an electric drive train <b>300</b>, various changes may be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. For example, the drive train <b>300</b> may include an internal permanent magnet (IPM) motor or other form of electric motor instead of the electric induction motor <b>305</b>. In certain embodiments, the electric motor comprises one of: coil windings, hairpin windings, or bar-wound windings. For instance, the electric motor can include hairpin wire that is shaped into a &#x201c;hairpin&#x201d; before it is inserted into the stator core slot. Thus, the actual form of the electric motor <b>305</b> that can be cooled using one or more multiple-discharge rain manifolds can vary as needed or desired. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates one example drive train <b>300</b> in which a specific electric motor <b>305</b> may be cooled using a multiple-discharge rain manifold, the multiple-discharge rain manifolds described in this disclosure may be used with any other suitable drive trains or motors.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A through <b>4</b>D</figref> illustrate an example raindrop manifold <b>400</b> for an electric motor according to embodiments of this disclosure. For ease of explanation, the raindrop manifold <b>400</b> is described as being used with the electric motor <b>305</b> in the drive train <b>300</b> within the vehicle platform <b>200</b> and in the electric vehicle <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. However, the raindrop manifold <b>400</b> may be used with any other suitable motor, drive train, platform, and vehicle.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates a top view of the raindrop manifold <b>400</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrates an isometric view of the raindrop manifold <b>400</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> illustrates an interior view of a housing <b>405</b> having the raindrop manifold <b>400</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> illustrates the raindrop manifold <b>400</b> with a cover lid <b>420</b>. In this example, the housing <b>405</b> represents a housing for an electric motor, such as the electric motor <b>305</b>. The housing <b>405</b> is configured to receive at least a portion of the electric motor <b>305</b> into an interior of the housing <b>405</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The raindrop manifold <b>400</b> is formed in an upper surface of the housing <b>405</b> and includes a cavity <b>410</b> having one or more side walls <b>415</b>. A bottom surface of the cavity <b>410</b> includes at least a portion of a top surface of the housing <b>405</b>. The cavity <b>410</b> defines a path or passage for a coolant fluid to flow through the raindrop manifold <b>400</b>. In some embodiments, the cavity <b>410</b> includes or is covered by the cover lid <b>420</b> to completely form an enclosed cavity <b>410</b>. In particular embodiments, the cover lid <b>420</b> may be permanently affixed to the one or more side walls <b>415</b>, such as by a friction stir welded <b>425</b>, to permanently seal the manifold cavity <b>410</b> without fasteners or sealant.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The raindrop manifold <b>400</b> includes a plurality of vias <b>430</b>. Each of the vias <b>430</b> is formed as a hole that extends between the cavity <b>410</b> of the raindrop manifold <b>400</b> and an interior portion of the housing <b>405</b>. The vias <b>430</b> therefore enable the coolant fluid to drop, through gravity, onto the electric motor (or portion thereof) within the housing <b>405</b>. For example, the vias <b>430</b> may be positioned to be vertically above one or more portions of the stator <b>310</b> or other portion of the electric motor, and the coolant fluid can flow through the vias <b>430</b> onto targeted portions of the stator <b>310</b> or other portion of the electric motor.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The pressure of the coolant fluid in the cavity <b>410</b> affects how much of the coolant fluid flows through the vias <b>430</b> and onto the electric motor. In some cases, however, the coolant fluid may contact the same targeted portions of the stator <b>310</b> or other portion of the electric motor to be cooled regardless of the pressure. For example, at lower pressures, the coolant fluid may flow through the vias <b>430</b> and drip or form lower-velocity streams onto the electric motor. At higher pressures, the coolant fluid may flow through the vias <b>430</b> and form higher-velocity streams of fluid that contact the electric motor. In either case, the coolant fluid can still hit the same portions of the electric motor, which is a result of the vertical positioning and orientation of the vias <b>430</b> over the electric motor.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The housing <b>405</b> and raindrop manifold <b>400</b> may each be formed from any suitable material(s), such as one or more metals. The housing <b>405</b> and raindrop manifold <b>400</b> may also each be formed using any suitable fabrication technique, such as injection molding, machining, casting, or additive manufacturing. In addition, the housing <b>405</b> and raindrop manifold <b>400</b> may each have any suitable size, shape, and dimensions. In some embodiments, the one or more side walls <b>415</b> of the raindrop manifold <b>400</b> can be integral with the housing <b>405</b>. The vias <b>430</b> may be formed in any suitable manner, such as by mechanical or laser drilling of holes in specified locations or by forming the raindrop manifold <b>400</b> to include pre-formed vias <b>430</b>. Note that the cover lid <b>420</b> can be configured to cover all of the vias <b>430</b> without the need for individual caps, freeze plugs, or other structures. Thus, any number of vias <b>430</b> in any number of configurations or patterns can be formed in the raindrop manifold <b>400</b> without changing the configuration of the cover lid <b>420</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The vias <b>430</b> here can be spaced apart to create a &#x201c;rainfall&#x201d; pattern of coolant fluid, such as over the windings or other portions of an electric motor. This type of pattern can provide an enhanced or more even distribution of coolant fluid over the portions of the electric motor to be cooled. The arrangement of vias <b>430</b> can vary depending on the design of the electric motor or other factors. In some cases, the vias <b>430</b> can be arranged in a straight line. In other cases, the vias <b>430</b> can be arranged to support cooling at targeted locations of an electric motor. A combination of some vias <b>430</b> in a straight line and other vias <b>430</b> in a non-linear pattern may also be used. As a particular example, in some embodiments, the raindrop manifold <b>400</b> may include a combination of an &#x201c;M&#x201d;-shaped pattern <b>435</b> of vias <b>430</b> on one side of the electric motor and a straight pattern <b>440</b> of vias <b>430</b> on the other side of the electric motor, such as to provide better fluid distribution for a stator having asymmetry in its windings. Note, however, that the flow of coolant fluid can vary as the motor design changes, such as to optimize the flow of coolant fluid onto the stator windings based on hole sizes, spacings, patterns, or other characteristics of the vias <b>430</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A through <b>4</b>D</figref> illustrate one example of a raindrop manifold <b>400</b> for an electric motor, various changes may be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A through <b>4</b>D</figref>.
