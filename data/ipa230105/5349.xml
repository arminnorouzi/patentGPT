Law enforcement officers are all too often involved in situations in which the officer must transmit a radio message indicating &#x201c;shots fired&#x201d;. Embodiments of the invention detect gunshots and automatically transmit an alert without the requirement for action by the officer. Gunshots originating from the firearm of a law enforcement officer can be distinguished by the system from those originating from other firearms based on information carried by the alert. This feature may provide actionable information to other police units, e.g., by allowing them to distinguish shots fired by friends from those fired by foes. Firearms including various features of embodiments of the invention may also be used as an additional listening station to aid in determining the location of any random fire that is within listening distance of the firearm. Officer locations may also be provided to emergency responders through &#x201c;on screen&#x201d; graphics, giving officers on scene a tactical advantage and providing an additional safeguard against friendly fire incidents.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an operating environment <b>10</b> including a gunshot location system <b>12</b>, a firearm location server <b>14</b>, and a firearm <b>16</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The gunshot location system <b>12</b> includes a plurality of listening stations <b>18</b> in communication with a gunshot location server <b>20</b>. Each listening station <b>18</b> has a known geographic location, and may be positioned to have an unobstructed view of the surrounding environment. By way of example, the listening stations <b>18</b> may be integrated with other devices, such as streetlights, traffic control device, etc., or otherwise attached to a utility pole or other object that places the listening station <b>18</b> at an elevated location above ground level. Each listening station <b>18</b> may include an acoustic sensor (e.g., microphone) that converts acoustic energy into electrical signals, and a transmitter that transmits information related to acoustic signals detected by the listening station <b>18</b> to the gunshot location server <b>20</b>. This information may be transmitted via communication links <b>22</b>. The communication links <b>22</b> may include one or more wired and/or wireless links, and may form part of a communication network. The information communicated from the listening stations <b>18</b> to the gunshot location server <b>20</b> may be carried by suitably encoded analog or digital signals, such as Internet Protocol (IP) packets.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A gunshot <b>24</b> generates an acoustic impulse <b>26</b> that radiates outward from the responsible firearm <b>16</b>. The acoustic impulse <b>26</b> may reach the listening stations <b>18</b> at various times related to the distance between the listening station <b>18</b> and the gunshot <b>24</b>. The gunshot location server <b>20</b> may receive information regarding one or more of a time of arrival, angle of arrival, and shape of the acoustic impulse <b>26</b> from each listening station <b>18</b>. The gunshot location server <b>20</b> may then determine whether the acoustic impulse <b>26</b> is from a gunshot <b>24</b>, and if so, further determine a location of the gunshot <b>24</b> using trilateration, triangulation, or any other suitable method of analyzing the received information. The location of the gunshot <b>24</b> may then be displayed to first responders and other emergency personnel, such as on a map. Gunshot location systems are described by U.S. Pat.

If a discharge has not been detected (&#x201c;NO&#x201d; branch of decision block <b>62</b>), the process <b>60</b> continues monitoring for a firearm discharge or other event of interest, e.g., detection of an acoustic impulse characteristic of a gunshot.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">If a discharge has been detected (&#x201c;YES&#x201d; branch of decision block <b>62</b>), the process <b>60</b> proceeds to block <b>64</b> and transmits a discharge alert. The discharge alert may include data indicative of the discharge, a location of the discharge, a time of the discharge, and an identity of the firearm <b>16</b> or the person in possession of the firearm <b>16</b>. The discharge alert may be transmitted from the firearm <b>16</b> to the firearm location server <b>14</b> directly through the wireless system <b>34</b>. The alert may also or alternatively be received from the firearm <b>16</b> by the mobile device <b>32</b>, and forwarded from the mobile device <b>32</b> to the firearm location server <b>14</b> through the wireless system <b>34</b>. For embodiments in which alerts are relayed through the mobile device <b>32</b>, the mobile device <b>32</b> may add information to the alert, such as the location of the discharge, the time of the discharge, and an identity of the mobile device <b>32</b> (e.g., a phone number) or firearm user. In an embodiment of the invention, the mobile device <b>32</b> may also detect the discharge (e.g., by receiving an acoustic signal characteristic of a discharge from the firearm <b>16</b>), in which case the alert may be initiated by the mobile device <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In response to receiving or transmitting the discharge alert, the process <b>60</b> proceeds to block <b>66</b> and compares one or more characteristics of the discharge to corresponding characteristics of gunshots detected by the gunshot location system <b>12</b>. These characteristics may include, for example, the location and time of occurrence of the discharge. This comparison may be performed, for example, by the firearm location server <b>14</b> or gunshot location server <b>20</b> in response to receiving the discharge alert. In cases where the comparison is performed by the firearm location server <b>14</b>, the firearm location server <b>14</b> may query the gunshot location server <b>20</b> for the time and location of detected gunshots in response to receiving the alert.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In block <b>68</b>, the process <b>60</b> determines if a gunshot detected by the gunshot location system <b>12</b> matches the discharge associated with the discharge alert. A match may occur, for example, if the location of the detected gunshot is within a threshold distance of the location identified by the discharge alert (e.g., within 10, 20, 50 or 100 meters), is within a threshold time window of the time of occurrence identified by the alert (e.g., within plus-or-minus 1, 2, 5, or 10 seconds), or is within both a threshold distance and a threshold time window.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">If the characteristics of the discharge do not match those of a detected gunshot (&#x201c;NO&#x201d; branch of decision block <b>68</b>), the process <b>60</b> proceeds to block <b>70</b>, adds the discharge to the shots fired data maintained by the gunshot location server <b>20</b>, and continues monitoring for discharges of firearm <b>16</b>. If the characteristics of the discharge match those of a detected gunshot (&#x201c;YES&#x201d; branch of decision block <b>68</b>), the process <b>60</b> proceeds to block <b>72</b>, identifies the matching gunshot as having been fired by firearm <b>16</b>, and returns to monitoring for discharges of firearm <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a user interface of the gunshot location system <b>12</b> including an exemplary window <b>80</b> that may be displayed to a user of the system, such as a <b>911</b> operator, a police dispatcher, or a police officer responding to the scene. In cases where the user is mobile, the window may be displayed on the mobile device <b>32</b>. Any authorized user may view the map in real-time, for example, by logging into a website provided by the gunshot location system <b>12</b> and entering their credentials, e.g., user identity and password.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The above &#x201c;on-screen&#x201d; location tracking enables the user to identify relative locations of gunshots detected by or otherwise provided to the gunshot location system <b>12</b>. The window <b>80</b> may include a map that displays one or more icons <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> each indicating the location of gunshots. If the identity of the firearm that generated the gunshot is unknown, the icon may have a shape or color indicating this fact. If, on the other hand, the identity of the firearm or the user of the firearm which generated the gunshot is known (e.g., because it matches an alert received from the firearm location server <b>14</b>), the icon may have a different shape or color indicating the gunshot is associated with the known firearm or user. The window <b>80</b> may also display a balloon or other text field with information such as the name of the officer believed to have fired the shot represented by the icon <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>. This information may allow the user to determine which gunshots are associated with police activity, and which are associated with civilian activity. This information may also enable the user to help coordinate responses to shots fired incidents.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition to enabling users of the gunshot location system <b>12</b> to identify gunshots generated by police officers responding to a crime scene, embodiments of the invention may also facilitate calibration of the listening stations <b>18</b> of gunshot location system <b>12</b>. The location of a discharge provided by a discharge alert received from the firearm <b>16</b> or mobile device <b>32</b> may, in many cases, be more accurate or precise than the location of the gunshot determined from the acoustic impulses <b>26</b> received by the listening stations <b>18</b>. This improved accuracy/precision may be due to how the location is determined, e.g., using GPS signals verses triangulation of acoustic impulses <b>26</b>. Thus, the location of a discharge matching a detected gunshot may be used to calibrate the gunshot detection algorithm used by the gunshot location server <b>20</b> to locate gunshots.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, embodiments of the invention described above, or portions thereof, may be implemented using one or more computer devices or systems, such as exemplary computer <b>100</b>.
