The layer L1 (and/or the layer L2) is shaped into a plurality of sockets defining a reservoir for one or more products such as detergents (for instance by sucking the web material of the layer L1 on the socketed surface of a roller), wherein each reservoir is processed into an enclosure (or pouch) by sealing the second layer L2 onto the first layer at the areas surrounding the sockets, wherein sealing is achieved by means of the water layer WL and the interaction thereof with the materials of the layers L1, L2. Accordingly, a layered enclosure is defined for the products which comprises the layers L1, L2 with the water layer WL in between and the products confined within reservoirs or pouches formed in the layered enclosures and sealed off by means of water bonding between layers L1 and L2.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Formation of the water layer WL is one of the crucial and most critical features of manufacturing of single unit dose products. The thickness, as well as the uniformity thereof, are susceptible of altering the features of the final products. For instance, the water layer WL may be insufficient to provide bonding of the layers L1 and L2 with the required strength to prevent leaking of the products inside the pouch. When the pouch comprises multiple compartments, each compartment must be sealed off to prevent undesired mixing of different product in other compartments: as per the above, a non-uniform water layer thickness may result in insufficient bonding with breaking of the seal between adjacent compartments and mixing of the products within the pouch.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Laying of the water layer WL is typically done by</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>: spraying the surface of the layer L1 which is intended to face the surface of the layer L2, i.e. the surface(s) which the products inside the pouch come into contact with, with water dispensed by one or more sprinklers or sprayers S;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>: water application through a soaking roller R<b>1</b> which drains water from a reservoir WT in fluid communication with a distributor hub H<b>1</b> of the roller R<b>1</b>, whereby the soaking roller attracts water from the hub through deformation&#x2014;as a sponge would do;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>: water application through a soaking roller R<b>2</b> which drains water directly from a water pan WP. The roller R<b>2</b> is rotatable around a hub H<b>2</b> which in this case does not administer any fluid.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Whatever the solution, the skilled person will readily appreciate that controlling the uniformity and thickness of the water layer is inherently difficult, especially in the absence of a feedback loop that allows corrections of the operating parameters of the water laying system (whether a roller or a sprinkler/sprayer). It may rightly be said that laying of the water layer WL may turn out to be a real weak link in the manufacturing chain of single unit dose packaged products.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The object of the present invention is to overcome the above mentioned technical problems.

The infrared camera IRC is configured to image the water layer WL laid onto the layer L1 prior to the application of the layer L2 onto the same, i.e. prior to the formation of the layered enclosure LE. The infrared camera IRC may be installed so to have an optical axis IRCZ orthogonal to a plane of the water layer WL, or lying at an angle with respect to a direction orthogonal to the plane itself, so to maximise the area of the water layer WL.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The image of the water layer WL acquired by the camera IRC is an infrared image, which is rendered into an intensity based-image (e.g. a false color image based on the intensity of infrared emission at each pixel of the image) in the visible spectrum.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">An example of the rendered image is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, where the brighter areas correspond to the layer L1, and the darker areas correspond to the water layer WL. this means that the infrared camera IRC is positioned so as to face the water layer WL directly, as the interposition of the layer L1 would otherwise alter the infrared emission of the water layer WL captured by the camera IRC. Another example of a rendered intensity based image is a greyscale image including a plurality of pixel each coded into a byte image, whereby the preferred intensity indicator is the conventional 8-bit integer byte image of the pixel featuring values ranging from 0 (black/totally dark) to 255 (white/totally bright), for a total of 256 shades of grey.

With a layered enclosure featuring layers L1, L2 with a water layer WL in between, the interaction unfolds essentially as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B</figref>: with a discontinuous or non-uniform water layer WL (e.g. with thickness variations across the interface with the layers L1 L2) such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, the light emission E is refracted at the areas where the water layer WL is thicker or in any case more uniform and reflected at the areas where the layer WL includes little or no water.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Conversely, with a uniform layer WL, or in general with a layer WL that is sufficiently thick across the interface with the layers L1, L2, essentially all of the light emission E is refracted through the layered enclosure (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>). Accordingly, the image acquired by the device IA will exhibit differently bright areas on account of the above behaviour, i.e. on account of the different intensity over the area of the layered enclosure owing to the features (thickness and distribution) of the layer WL.

In this embodiment the selected areas in the pattern comprise portions of the layered enclosure LE surrounding the reservoir enclosures/pouches SUD, i.e the areas are selected to coincide with the inter-reservoir portions which following cutting of the enclosures/pouches SUD into actual single units become a sealed perimeter of the enclosure/pouch itself, that is a critical area by definition as it bonds the layers L1, L2 following the formation of the layered enclosure LE. The area pattern in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is determined by a vision algorithm that discretizes the portions surrounding each reservoir enclosure/pouch SUD into rectangular shaped areas, each associated to a number (in the example herein: 170, 195, 180, 190) which represent the intensity information at the pixels in the area based on the byte images thereof (range 0-255).

The roller sections R<b>1</b>-R<b>12</b> are clustered together into an overall single roller unit, whereby all of the roller sections have the same outer diameter. Each of the roller sections R<b>1</b>-R<b>12</b> is provided as a soaking roller section, i.e. a roller section that can absorb and release water by soaking and squeezing, like a sponge. In preferred embodiments, the roller sections have a sponge like construction.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Additionally, the roller <b>1</b> also includes a clustered counter-roller arrangement <b>4</b> including a plurality of counter rollers CR<b>1</b>, CR<b>2</b>, CR<b>3</b>, CR<b>4</b>, Cry, CR<b>6</b>, CR<b>7</b>, CR<b>8</b>, CR<b>9</b>, CR<b>10</b>, CR<b>11</b>, CR<b>12</b>, each associated to a corresponding roller section R<b>1</b>-R<b>12</b> (the association is to be intended as number based: counter roller CR<b>12</b> is associated to roller R<b>12</b> and so on).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Each of the counter rollers CR<b>1</b>-CR<b>12</b> is made of a comparatively harder material than the roller sections R<b>1</b>-R<b>12</b> and is rotatable around an axis CD<b>2</b> parallel to the axis CD<b>1</b> and is operatively connected to a respective actuator A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, A<b>4</b>, A<b>5</b>, A<b>6</b>, A<b>7</b>, A<b>8</b>, A<b>9</b>, A<b>10</b>, A<b>11</b>, A<b>12</b> (again, the association is to be intended as number based: actuator A<b>12</b> is associated to counter roller CR<b>12</b> and so on) which is configured to displace the respective counter roller CR<b>1</b>-CR<b>12</b> in a radial direction with respect to the axis CD<b>1</b>, or more in general in a direction that allows variation of the interference condition between the roller section and the respective counter roller (in this respect, even displacement having a non-purely radial direction will do, provided they result in an overall variation of the interaxis (distance CD<b>1</b>-CD<b>2</b>) between the roller section R<b>1</b>-R<b>12</b> and the respective counter roller CR<b>1</b>-CR<b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Each of the roller sections R<b>1</b>-R<b>12</b> is rotatably supported by a clustered hub <b>6</b> which features a plurality of hub section, preferably one for each roller section R<b>1</b>-R<b>12</b>. Each of the hub sections may be provided either as a separate hub section that interconnects with adjacent hub sections or as a portion of a unitary hub whereat the respective roller section R<b>1</b>-R<b>12</b> is intended to be fitted&#x2014;which is in fluid communication with a corresponding water supply line F<b>1</b>, F<b>2</b>, F<b>3</b>, F<b>4</b>, F<b>5</b>, F<b>6</b>, F<b>7</b>, F<b>8</b>, F<b>9</b>, F<b>10</b>, F<b>11</b>, F<b>12</b> (the association is to be intended as number based: line F<b>12</b> is associated to roller R<b>12</b> and so on). The hub section-supply line communication is fully independent, whereby each hub section can be supplied with a water amount that is independent of the supply to other&#x2014;even neighbouring&#x2014;hub sections.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">This means that roller sections R<b>1</b>-R<b>12</b> are supplied with water from the inside out, i.e. from the hub <b>6</b> to the surface thereof. In this sense, displacement of the counter rollers CR<b>1</b>-CR<b>12</b>&#x2014;hence variation of the interference condition between the roller section and the respective counter roller&#x2014;results in a greater or lesser deformation of the respective roller section, which in turn results in an increased or decreased absorption of water from the hub <b>6</b>. A greater roller section-counter roller interference in fact results in the roller section being more deformed, or&#x2014;in other terms&#x2014;in more voids being collapsed and compacted.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the contact with the deformed portion of the roller section is released, the voids expand and attract water: the more they were collapsed upon interaction with the counter roller, the more will they expand back when deformation is lifted, thus attracting more water into and soaking the roller section. This, in addition to individual water supply of the hub sections, allows a precise control of the water released by each roller section when the same is brought into contact with the layer L1 during formation of the layered enclosure LE. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> in this regard shows the routing of the layer L1 through the roller <b>1</b> and the laying of the water layer WL: it may be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> that the layer L1 is routed between the clustered roller arrangement <b>2</b> and the clustered counter roller arrangement <b>4</b>, whereby the layer L1 moves between pairs of cooperating roller sections and counter rollers. In this regard, as the axis CD<b>1</b> is parallel to the cross direction CD, the water laying roller <b>1</b> spans the layer L1 cross direction wise, whereby each of the roller section/counter roller pairs is configured to lay water on a respective band-wise portion of the layer L1. The arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is exemplary of this: each of the previously described bands B<b>1</b>-B<b>12</b> (again, the association is to be intended as number based: line F<b>12</b> is associated to roller R<b>12</b> and so on) may correspond to a water laying domain for each roller section/counter roller pair, and as a selected area for comparing the intensity indicator values with the selected threshold(s).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In view of the above, adjusting water delivery of the water laying roller <b>1</b> based on the feedback&#x2014;by the diagnostic unit D<b>1</b> and/or the diagnostic unit D<b>2</b>&#x2014;of the intensity indicator values at the selected areas (for instance, with reference to the roller <b>1</b>, the bandwise areas B<b>1</b>-B<b>12</b>) comprises adjusting, at one or more of the corresponding roller sections R<b>1</b>-R<b>12</b>, hub sections, and counter rollers CR<b>1</b>-CR<b>12</b>, at least one of the interference condition between the roller section/counter roller pair, and the supply water flow through supply channels F<b>1</b>-F<b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">This comprises operating each actuator A<b>1</b>-A<b>12</b> and/or controlling the water supply through each of the supply lines F<b>1</b>-F<b>12</b> to result in the laying of a water layer WL with modified features, for instance more uniform distribution, to meet a target intensity indicator value.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Such a target value may be, for instance, simply a value that falls within the lower and upper boundaries described in the foregoing (lower threshold-upper threshold). In other embodiments, the target value may be an actual single, punctual value that has to be met at a certain area of the layered enclosure LE. In any case, a closed loop control of water layer features during formation of the layered enclosure is achieved: the water layer feature diagnosed by the method and the system according to the invention are fed back into the same system to meet predetermined design requirement.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The units D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> provide inherently different feedback information. To the extent present, the unit D<b>1</b> provides a feedback information preliminary to the forming of the layered enclosure LE, which allows correction of the water delivery to the layer L1 across separate bands B<b>1</b>-B<b>12</b> in the cross direction CD, wherein delivery into each band may be adjusted independently of the others and only if needed. In this way, the risk of over- or under-correction is avoided.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The unit D<b>2</b> instead provides a feedback information that allows correction of the features of the water layer as it results after the bonding of the layers L1, L2 together.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In either case, threshold values of the intensity indicator that trigger corrections may be selected based on experimental tests and calibration.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Note also that the water laying roller <b>1</b> is merely one of the possible embodiments of the system of the invention. In other embodiments, the roller <b>1</b> may be replaced by an array of individually controlled water sprayers or sprinklers that are controlled based on the intensity indicator information (values) retrieved from the layered enclosure LE: as per the above, the information is fed back to a control unit which governs operation of the sprayers or sprinklers, and the operation is individually adjusted based to meet a target value of the intensity indicator at the relevant, selected areas.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">More in general, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the method may further comprise feeding back the intensity indicator I<sub>i</sub>(A<sub>i</sub>) at selected areas A<sub>i </sub>of the intensity-based image of the layered enclosure LE or the layer L1 to a water laying device configured for providing the water layer WL, for instance to a control unit operatively associated to the water laying device, and adjusting water delivery of the water laying device to meet a target value of the intensity indicator at said selected areas, wherein adjusting water delivery of the water laying device comprises operating at least one actuator ACT (control signals ACT<sub>i</sub>) or water flow control device FR associated to the water laying device (control signals FR<sub>i</sub>). In the case of the roller <b>1</b>, the at least one actuator is selected from among the actuators A<b>1</b>-A<b>12</b>, and the at least one water flow control device is selected from among the water supply lines F<b>1</b>-F<b>12</b>.
