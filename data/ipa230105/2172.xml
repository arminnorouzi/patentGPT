The vacuum tool may include one or more arrays of suction devices, where each array of suction devices is connected to a single vacuum source. The vacuum tool is operable to vacuum attach to the unpackaged product on the carrier and detach from the unpackaged product when deposited in the receiving container.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In additional embodiments, the vacuum-assisted product-handling systems may include a compressed gas reservoir to supply gas to the suction devices of the vacuum tool when the vacuum tool detaches from the unpackaged product. In further embodiments, at least one of the suction devices of the vacuum tool is unattached to the unpackaged product as the actuation unit moves the unpackaged product from the carrier to the receiving container. In still further embodiments, the single vacuum source may include a vacuum pump operable to maintain a vacuum in the suction devices attached to the unpackaged product. In yet additional embodiments, the systems may further include an array of sheet holding suction devices extending from the vacuum tool. The sheet holding suction devices may be operable to place a sheet of packaging material between layers of the unpackaged product in the receiving container. In more embodiments, the array of suction devices may include greater than or about 25 suction devices. In yet more embodiments, the carrier may be a conveyor belt. In still more embodiments, the unpackaged product may be a slab of cheese having a weight greater than or about 5 pounds (lbs).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present technology also includes a vacuum tool device. The vacuum tool device may include a vacuum port operable to couple to a vacuum source. The vacuum tool device may also include a vacuum manifold that is fluidly connected to the vacuum port. The vacuum manifold may include at least a first manifold conduit and a second manifold conduit. The first and second manifold conduits may each include one or more suction orifices. The vacuum tool may further include an array of suction devices. Each of the suction devices may include a suction cup that has a first end that is reversibly connected to one of the suction orifices.

In further embodiments, the suction devices may be reversibly connected to the suction orifices through leaktight couplings formed in the vacuum manifold. Each of the leaktight couplings may include an inner surface that forms at least a portion of the suction orifice and an outer surface in contact with a connector on the suction device. The leaktight couplings prevent fluids and microbes in the suction devices from reaching the outer surface of the leaktight couplings. In still further embodiments, the array of suction devices may include a first group of suction devices connected to the first manifold conduit, and a second group of suction devices connected to the second manifold conduit. The first and the second group of suction devices may each include greater than or about ten suction devices. In more embodiments, the first manifold conduit and the second manifold conduit may each include a removable end cap that exposes an inner wall of the manifold conduit when opened. In still more embodiments, the vacuum port may be the sole vacuum port on the vacuum manifold.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present technology further includes vacuum-assisted product-handling methods. The methods may include moving one or more unpackaged products on a carrier into a contact position. The methods may further include attaching the unpackaged products in the contact position to an array of suction devices on a vacuum tool that is connected to a mechanical arm of an actuation unit. A fraction of the suction devices may remain unattached to the unpackaged products.

In yet additional embodiments, the methods may include moving a cleaning fluid out of the vacuum tool through the suction devices of the vacuum tool. In more embodiments, the unpackaged products being handled by the present methods may each be a slab of cheese having a weight greater than or about 5 lbs.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Such technology may provide numerous benefits over conventional systems, equipment, and methods of handling products. For example, embodiments of the present systems include the use of fewer vacuum sources than conventional systems. Fewer vacuum sources, including a single vacuum source, reduce the energy needed to independently power a large number of independent vacuum sources. Fewer vacuum sources also reduce maintenance requirements to keep the vacuum sources in operation. Embodiments of the present vacuum tool devices include arrays of suction devices that can be regularly cleaned with clean-in-place operations that reduce the risk of microbial contamination in the handled products. The suction devices may also be independently removed and replaced in the array of devices to reduce repair times and expenses. Embodiments of the present methods include the attachment of multiple suction devices to products that may have rough and uneven surfaces that make them difficult to attach to conventional vacuum-assisted tools.

Some products have the requisite characteristics to fall off a conveyor at the end of a production line into a container that can be boxed up and shipped to a purchaser. In many instances, these products are small, light, rigid, sturdy, non-sticky, and can be randomly oriented in the container. Nails, screws, and other metal fasteners usually meet these criteria. On the other hand, many more products cannot be conveyed from a production line directly into a container and shipped. Many kinds of food products, for example, are too soft, delicate, and sticky to be dropped off a conveyor into a container. Ingredient food products, made in large sizes for food makers and restaurants, are often too heavy and bulky to drop into a container at random orientations. Cheese slabs weighing greater than or about 5 lbs, for example, would deform and knit together if dumped at random orientations into a container. These unpackaged products need to be carefully lifted and carried from a production area and placed in a container.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Automation techniques to lift and carry unpackaged products from production to packaging areas may include mechanical forks and claws that pierce and grab the product in order to lift it off production equipment and into a receiving container. Mechanical Forks that attach the products to the fork by piercing them with one or more tines generally require that the product be rigid enough to hold the inserted tines and soft enough to close and heal the insertion after being moved. For heavy food products like cheese slabs, the products may not be rigid enough to hold the tines of the mechanical fork. They often slip off the fork or break apart around the area of insertion. Mechanical claws can also have great difficulty moving soft, heavy food products like cheese slabs. The claws often cannot secure their grippers on a heavy, deformable cheese slab that easily slips from or through the grippers.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additional automation techniques to move unpackaged products from production to packaging areas include vacuum tools with at least one suction cup that attaches to the product. The pressure differential between the higher-pressure air outside the suction cup and the lower-pressure volume inside the evacuated cup helps secure the product to the cup. Unfortunately, vacuum tools that use only a few suction cups, or a single suction cup, may have difficultly lifting a soft, heavy product without causing a permanent dome to form in the product where the cup was attached. In addition, large and heavy products like cheese slabs often have rough and uneven surfaces that make it difficult for a suction cup to form and maintain a vacuum seal. There can also be lag times to detach the product from the suction cup by shutting off the vacuum source and waiting for the pressure differential to drop to the point where gravity pulls the product off the vacuum tool.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments of the present technology address these and other problems with automated equipment, systems, and method to move unpackaged products from a production area to a packaging area. Embodiments of the present technology include vacuum tools that include an array of suction devices that reversibly attach to an unpackaged product, lift and carry the product from a production area, and place the product in a receiving container in a packaging area. In embodiments, the vacuum tools do not use mechanical forks or claws to pierce or grip the unpackaged product. In additional embodiments, the vacuum tools may include an array of suction devices operable to attach to soft and uneven surfaces of an unpackaged product. In embodiments, some of the suction devices can remain unattached while the vacuum tool moves the products. In more embodiments, the suction devices can extend by different lengths to accommodate uneven attachment surfaces on the products. In yet more embodiments, the vacuum tools may be connected to compressed gas reservoirs that supply a pressurized gas for the rapid release of the product into a receiving container.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Embodiments of the present technology also address problems with cleaning the vacuum tools to sanitary levels needed for the handling of food products. Cleaning challenges are particularly difficult for vacuum tools that can vacuum up particles of the food products being moved by the tools. These vacuumed-up particles can act as growth substrates for microbial pathogens and other contaminants that can work their way back into the handled food products. In embodiments, the present vacuum tools can periodically perform a cleaning-in-place (CIP) operation to remove food particles and kill pathogens in the tool. In additional embodiments, the CIP operation may include flowing a cleaning fluid through the tool from the vacuum manifold through the suction devices where the particle-containing cleaning fluid exits the tool. In yet additional embodiments, particles and other contaminants may be removed from the spent cleaning fluid and the decontaminated fluid may be reintroduced to the vacuum tool. In further embodiments, the vacuum tools may include vacuum manifolds that have couplings and can form leaktight seals with the connectors on the suction cups of the suction devices. The leaktight seals prevent fluids and pathogens from corroding and contaminating the connections between the vacuum manifold and the suction devices. In yet additional embodiments, the vacuum manifolds may include one or more removable endcaps that permit easy inspection and cleaning of the interiors of the manifolds.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an embodiment of a vacuum-assisted product handling system <b>100</b> according to embodiments of the present technology.

In embodiments, the unpackaged products may be detached by disconnecting a vacuum source from the vacuum tool resulting in an increase in pressure in the vacuum tool from a flow of outside air into the vacuum tool. In other embodiments, the products may be detached by switching from a vacuum source evacuating the vacuum tool to a compressed gas reservoir that provides a rapid flow of gas into the vacuum tool. The rapid flow of gas from the compressed gas reservoir causes the pressure to rapidly increase in the vacuum tool and causing the products held on the vacuum tool to rapidly detach into the receiving container. In embodiments, the time between starting the flow of the compressed gas into the vacuum tool and the detachment of the unpackaged products may be less than or about 1 second, less than or about 0.5 seconds, less than or about 0.25 second, less than or about 0.1 second, or less.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Method <b>600</b> may also optionally include placing a packaging sheet in the receiving container at operation <b>630</b>. In embodiments, a vacuum tool may attach to the packaging sheet in a packaging supply area using packaging suction devices connected to the vacuum tool. In further embodiments, the packaging suction devices may be different from the product suction devices of the vacuum tool that attach to the unpackaged products. In additional embodiments, the packaging suction devices may be fewer in number and have a lower pressure difference with the surrounding air than the product suction devices. In still further embodiments, the packaging suction devices may extend further from the center of the vacuum tool than the array of product suction devices.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In embodiments, the vacuum tool, holding the packaging sheet by vacuum attachment to the packaging suction devices, may place the packaging sheet in the receiving container and detach it onto a surface of the container or onto one or more products placed in the container. In further embodiments, method <b>600</b> may include two or more cycles of placing products and packaging sheets in the receiving container to build up alternating layers of products and packaging sheets in the container.

In embodiments, the cleaning operation may include a clean-in-place (CIP) operation that places the suction devices of the vacuum tool into a cleaning fluid that is taken up into the suction devices and the vacuum manifold of the vacuum tool. In additional embodiments, the cleaning fluid may be purged from the vacuum tool by switching from a vacuum source that maintains negative pressure in the vacuum tool to a compressed gas reservoir that applied positive pressure to the vacuum tool. In still further embodiments, a positive pressure may be maintained until the vacuum manifold and suction devices of the vacuum tool have been purged of the cleaning fluid and dried. In further embodiments, the cleaning fluid may be an aqueous solution that includes one or more cleaning agents chosen from halogen compounds, ammonium-salt compounds, organic acids, surfactants, detergents, antimicrobial agents, and antifungal agents, among other cleaning agents. In still further embodiments, the cleaning fluid may include chlorinated caustic detergents.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In embodiments, the cleaning operation <b>635</b> may be performed after each product handling cycle that moves one or more unpackaged products from a carrier to a receiving device. In additional embodiments, a cleaning operation may be performed after a number of product handling cycles such as two or more product handling cycles, three or more product handling cycles, five or more product handling cycles, ten or more product handling cycles, twenty or more product handling cycles, or more.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Embodiments of the present technology like the above-described systems, equipment, and methods provide ways to automate product handling, such as the movement of cheese slabs from a cheese production area to a receiving container where the cheese slabs are packaged. The vacuum-assisted product handling systems and methods may include an array of suction devices that reversibly attach to an unpackaged product, lift and carry the product from a production area, and place the product in a receiving container in a packaging area. The vacuum tools do not use mechanical forks or claws to pierce or grip the unpackaged product. The suction devices can attach to soft and uneven surfaces of products, such as cheese slabs, and some of the suction devices can remain unattached while the vacuum tool moves the products. The present technology also permits fast and frequent clean-in-place (CIP) operations that remove food particles and kills any contaminating pathogens when the systems and methods are handling food products.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the preceding description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous details have been set forth in order to provide an understanding of various embodiments of the present technology.
