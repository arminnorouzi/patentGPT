The position indicator is generally formed in a pen shape, and the position indicator is called an electronic pen, a stylus, or the like. In the specification, the position indicator formed in a pen shape will be referred to as an electronic pen. A central rod of the electronic pen affects the feel (or sense) of writing (what it feels like to write), and the central rod is an important constituent member of the electronic pen. An operation surface (input surface) of the electronic device touched by a pen tip of the central rod of the electronic pen is made of glass, resin, or the like. Therefore, the pen tip may get caught due to the friction between the pen tip of the central rod and the operation surface, or the pen tip may be worn out. These factors are taken into account to make various innovations for the central rod.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, an invention disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2015-26359 (hereinafter, Patent Document 1) provides a central rod including: a tip portion including an elastic member; a base portion made of a material harder than the elastic member material forming the tip portion; and a central rod portion thinner than the base portion. In the case of the central rod disclosed in Patent Document 1, the feel of writing can be changed, and the friction with the operation surface of the electronic device can be reduced. To suppress the abrasion caused by the friction with the operation surface, the applicant of the present application has studied mixing fibers formed from polyparaphenylene terephthalamide with resin to form an electronic pen central rod, and the applicant has already filed an international patent application (International Patent Application PCT/JP2021/003508) covering the discovery.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, the electronic pen is also downsized and miniaturized along with downsizing of the electronic device provided with the position detection apparatus, and the electronic pen central rod is also miniaturized accordingly. However, if the strength is reduced by miniaturizing the central rod, the central rod could be easily damaged, and a sturdy miniaturized electronic pen cannot be realized. It is desirable that the electronic pen central rod have an excellent feel of writing, the operation surface of the electronic device not be damaged, and the abrasion of the pen tip of the central rod be reduced. It is also desirable to make manufacturing of the electronic pen central rod as easy as possible. In short, there are issues to be solved in miniaturizing the electronic pen central rod, such as improvement of strength, improvement in the feel of writing, protection of the operation surface (input surface) of the electronic device, reduction in abrasion of the pen tip, and simplification of manufacturing.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the case of the invention disclosed in Patent Document 1, because so-called two-color molding (thermal welding) is used to integrally form the tip portion, the base portion, and the central rod portion together to make the electronic pen central rod, all of the portions need to be made of a resin material. Therefore, the strength may not be sufficient when the electronic pen central rod is miniaturized. In addition, the entire electronic pen central rod is also made of resin when the fibers formed from polyparaphenylene terephthalamide are mixed with the resin to form the electronic pen central rod in order to suppress the abrasion caused by the friction with the operation surface, and in this case also the strength becomes a concern when the electronic pen central rod is miniaturized. As an initial matter, it is difficult to make a miniaturized central rod portion (axis portion) using the resin mixed with fibers.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the above, an aspect of the disclosure is directed to realizing a highly reliable electronic pen that can sufficiently withstand hard use even when the electronic pen is miniaturized and that can be easily manufactured.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To solve the problems, provided is an electronic pen including a central rod including an axis portion that is a rod-shaped body and that is provided with a groove along a circumference of a side surface on one end side. The central rod also includes a pen tip portion that includes a hole into which said one end side of the axis portion is plugged and that is provided with a protrusion on an inner wall surface of the hole, the protrusion being fitted to the groove of the axis portion. The central rod also includes a casing that is a cylindrical body and that includes an opening at one end and also includes an installation portion for the central rod inside. When a rear end side of the central rod is inserted into the opening of the casing and installed on the installation portion, the groove of the axis portion of the central rod is positioned outside the opening of the casing.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the electronic pen, the axis portion and the pen tip portion are different members. A highly strong rod-shaped body can be used as the axis portion, and a material with elasticity and friction resistance can be used as the pen tip portion. When one end portion of the axis portion is inserted into the hole of the pen tip portion, the groove of the axis portion and the protrusion of the pen tip portion are fitted so that they do not easily come off from each other. When the central rod is attached inside the casing, the pen tip of the central rod sufficiently protrudes from the casing, and the protrusion of the pen tip portion is fitted to the groove of the axis portion. Therefore, the pen tip portion does not come off of the axis portion even when strong pen pressure is applied.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram for describing an example of an electronic device provided with an input apparatus including a position detection apparatus and an electronic pen;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> are diagrams describing a configuration example of the electronic pen according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>C</figref> are diagrams describing a configuration of an electronic pen central rod according to the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram describing a method of installing the electronic pen central rod on a casing of the electronic pen according to the embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> are diagrams describing another configuration example of a pen tip portion of the electronic pen central rod in the electronic pen according to the embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of an electronic pen and an electronic pen central rod of the disclosure will now be described with reference to the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Specific Example of Electronic Device</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of an electronic device that is provided with a position detection apparatus and that allows an electronic pen used for the position detection apparatus to input an instruction. Note that the following describes one embodiment of the electronic pen and the electronic pen central rod in which the invention is applied to an electronic pen and an electronic pen central rod. The electronic device of the embodiment is a tablet PC or a smartphone (high-performance mobile phone terminal) including a display apparatus, such as an LCD (liquid crystal display), and the electronic device consists of an electronic device body <b>1</b> having a position detection apparatus, and an electronic pen <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The electronic device body <b>1</b> includes an LCD, two position detection sensors with different detection systems, a motherboard, and the like that are layered (arranged on top of each other) between a casing <b>1</b>A and a front panel <b>1</b>F. In the embodiment, one of the two position detection sensors with different detection systems is a position detection sensor of an electromagnetic resonance system, and the other is a position detection sensor of a capacitance system.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An opening <b>1</b>FW is provided on the front panel <b>1</b>F. The size of the opening <b>1</b>FW is the same as the size of a display region of a display screen of the LCD and the size of an operation region for receiving an input of a user using the electronic pen <b>2</b> or the like. Note that, in the embodiment, the operation region <b>1</b>FW corresponding to the display region of the LCD may be referred to as an operation surface on which the electronic pen <b>2</b> is brought into contact to perform an input operation. A housing portion <b>11</b> described later to house the electronic pen <b>2</b> is provided on the casing <b>1</b>A of the electronic device body <b>1</b>, and the electronic pen <b>2</b> is housed in the housing portion <b>11</b> when the electronic pen <b>2</b> is not in use.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The electronic pen <b>2</b> is used for inputting information through the position detection sensor of the electromagnetic resonance system. The user takes out the electronic pen <b>2</b> housed in the housing portion <b>11</b> as necessary to perform a position indication operation on the operation region <b>1</b>FW. The electronic pen <b>2</b> is suitable for inputting detailed information, such as inputting a diagram or a drawing. The electronic device body <b>1</b> is provided with the position detection sensor of the capacitance system, and the user can bring a finger into contact with the operation region <b>1</b>FW to mainly perform an operation such as selecting an icon or a display button. Needless to say, the user can bring the finger into contact with the operation region <b>1</b>FW to input a drawing or handwritten characters through the position detection sensor of the capacitance system.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Assuming that the electronic pen <b>2</b> is operated on the operation region <b>1</b>FW of the electronic device body <b>1</b>, the position detection sensor of the electromagnetic resonance system provided inside the electronic device body <b>1</b> detects the position pointed to by the electronic pen <b>2</b> and the pen pressure. In response to this, a control circuit for display and the like (microcomputer) of the electronic device body <b>1</b> controls the display process on the display screen of the LCD. Similarly, assuming that the user uses a finger or the like to perform an operation on the operation region <b>1</b>FW of the electronic device body <b>1</b> in the electronic device, the position detection sensor of the capacitance system, which is provided inside the electronic device body <b>1</b>, detects the position indicated (pointed to) by the finger or the like. In response to this, the control circuit for display and the like of the electronic device body <b>1</b> controls the display process on the display screen of the LCD.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As described above, the electronic pen <b>2</b> functions relative to the position detection sensor of the electromagnetic resonance system. Although described in detail later, the electronic pen <b>2</b> is provided with a coil and a capacitor (capacitor element) included in a resonant circuit. In the electronic device of the embodiment, whether or not the electronic pen <b>2</b> is housed in the housing portion <b>11</b> of the electronic device body <b>1</b> can be detected by, for example, a mechanical switch or by transmission and reception of signals through electromagnetic induction with the coil of the resonant circuit of the electronic pen <b>2</b>. In this way, when the electronic pen <b>2</b> is housed in the housing portion <b>11</b>, the position detection sensor of the electromagnetic resonance system is not activated and the position indicated by the electronic pen <b>2</b> is not detected, so as to reduce the power consumption by the electronic device body <b>1</b>.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Configuration Example of Electronic Pen</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A configuration example of the electronic pen <b>2</b> that indicates the position to the position detection sensor of the electromagnetic resonance system mounted on the electronic device body <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> are diagrams describing the configuration example of the electronic pen <b>2</b> of the embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the electronic pen <b>2</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates an equivalent circuit of the electronic pen <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, various members for realizing the electronic pen function are mounted in a casing <b>23</b> to provide the electronic pen <b>2</b>. A ferrite core <b>22</b> is made, for example, by forming a through hole in a columnar ferrite material along its axial direction, wherein the through hole is formed at a position including a center line in the axial direction and has a predetermined diameter (for example, diameter=1 mm) for inserting therethrough a rod-shaped central rod <b>24</b> to be described in detail later.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The central rod <b>24</b> is inserted into the through hole of the ferrite core <b>22</b> such that the central rod <b>24</b> penetrates the ferrite core <b>22</b>. That is, the central rod <b>24</b> is longer than the length of the ferrite core <b>22</b> in the axial direction. The diameter of the portion of the central rod <b>24</b> inserted into the through hole of the ferrite core <b>22</b> is slightly shorter than the diameter of the through hole, and the central rod <b>24</b> can slide in the axial direction in the through hole. Note that the diameter of an end part (pen tip portion) that is the pen tip of the central rod <b>24</b> is longer than the diameter of the through hole of the ferrite core <b>22</b>, and a front end portion is processed into a hemispherical shape such that it can smoothly move on the operation surface (operation region) of a touch panel or the like.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, a predetermined length portion of the ferrite core <b>22</b> including its center point along the axial direction is a coil winding section around which a coil <b>21</b> is wound in the axial direction, and parts on both sides of the coil winding section are coil non-winding sections around which the coil is not wound. That is, when the ferrite core <b>22</b> is viewed in the axial direction, a part from an end portion on the pen tip side to an end portion of the coil winding section on the pen tip side is a first coil non-winding section around which the coil is not wound. A part from the other end of the coil winding section to an end portion of the ferrite core <b>22</b> opposite from the pen tip side is a second coil non-winding section around which the coil <b>21</b> is not wound.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Extension lines (conductor lines) <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>from both ends of the coil <b>21</b> wound around the ferrite core <b>22</b> are extended inside the casing <b>23</b>, up to a printed board <b>26</b> described later. The extension lines <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>are connected to a capacitor Cf provided on the printed board <b>26</b>. In this way, the coil <b>21</b> and the capacitor Cf on the printed board <b>26</b> form a resonant circuit, and signals can be transmitted and received to and from the position detection apparatus of the electromagnetic resonance system through electromagnetic induction.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">On the opposite side from the pen tip of the central rod <b>24</b>, a connection portion <b>25</b> is provided that includes a mold portion <b>25</b>A, a pen pressure detection portion <b>25</b>B, a fitting portion <b>25</b>C, and a connection terminal portion <b>25</b>D. The connection portion <b>25</b> is a part that integrally connects a part of the pen tip side including the coil <b>21</b>, the ferrite core <b>22</b>, and the central rod <b>24</b> with the printed board <b>26</b> and a board protection pipe <b>27</b> described later. The mold portion <b>25</b>A is a cylindrical part made of resin or the like, and an outer circumference of an end surface of the mold portion <b>25</b>A on the ferrite core <b>22</b> side is slightly larger than an outer circumference of the coil winding section of the ferrite core <b>22</b>. A recessed portion for fitting the second coil non-winding section of the ferrite core <b>22</b> is provided on the end surface side of the mold portion <b>25</b>A facing the ferrite core <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Additionally, a central rod holding portion A<b>1</b>, a conductive rubber A<b>2</b>, a ring spacer A<b>3</b>, a dielectric A<b>4</b>, and a terminal member A<b>5</b> are provided inside the mold portion <b>25</b>A as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. These portions are placed between the mold portion <b>25</b>A and the fitting portion <b>25</b>C described later to provide the pen pressure detection portion <b>25</b>B that detects the pen pressure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Specifically, the central rod holding portion A<b>1</b> is formed in a cup shape from, for example, hard rubber. An end part of the central rod <b>24</b> on the opposite side from the pen tip side is plugged in, and the central rod holding portion A<b>1</b> holds the end part. A bottom portion of the central rod holding portion A<b>1</b> on the opposite side from the central rod <b>24</b> is formed in a spherical shape. The central rod holding portion A<b>1</b> functions as a pressing portion that presses the conductive rubber A<b>2</b> according to the pen pressure applied to the central rod <b>24</b>. The conductive rubber A<b>2</b> has a predetermined thickness, and the shape and the size of the conductive rubber A<b>2</b> are the same as those of the opposing surface of the dielectric A<b>4</b>. The surface of the conductive rubber A<b>2</b> on the pen tip side faces the spherical bottom portion of the central rod holding portion A<b>1</b>, and the other surface faces one surface of the dielectric A<b>4</b> through the ring spacer A<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The ring spacer A<b>3</b> is a member formed in a ring shape, and an air gap corresponding to the thickness of the ring spacer A<b>3</b> is provided between the conductive rubber A<b>2</b> and the surface of the dielectric A<b>4</b> on the pen tip side to isolate (separate) them from each other. The dielectric A<b>4</b> is formed from a substance, such as ceramic, in which the dielectric properties are dominant over the conductivity, and the dielectric A<b>4</b> acts as an insulator that does not conduct electricity with DC voltage. On the other surface of the dielectric A<b>4</b>, the terminal member A<b>5</b> having a predetermined area is pasted. In this way, the dielectric A<b>4</b> is placed between the conductive rubber (first electrode) A<b>2</b> and the terminal member (second electrode) A<b>5</b>, to thereby form a variable capacitor.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">That is, the central rod <b>24</b> slides up and down in the axial direction according to the pen pressure applied to the pen tip of the central rod <b>24</b>. In conjunction with this, the central rod holding portion A<b>1</b> pushes up and down the conductive rubber A<b>2</b>. An air gap is provided by the ring spacer A<b>3</b> between the conductive rubber A<b>2</b> and the dielectric A<b>4</b>. Therefore, the conductive rubber A<b>2</b> approaches and comes into contact with the dielectric A<b>4</b> according to the pressure applied to the central rod <b>24</b>, and the contact area of the conductive rubber A<b>2</b> changes. In this way, the capacitance between the conductive rubber A<b>2</b> and the terminal member A<b>5</b> sandwiching the dielectric A<b>4</b> changes according to the pen pressure. Note that, when the pen pressure is not applied, the conductive rubber A<b>2</b> is separated from the dielectric A<b>4</b> due to the existence of the ring spacer A<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A conductive line connected to the conductive rubber A<b>2</b> and a conductive line connected to the terminal member A<b>5</b> extend outside of the mold portion <b>25</b>A and the fitting portion <b>25</b>C, for example, to be connected to a terminal of the connection terminal portion <b>25</b>D described later, and to be connected to an electronic circuit of the printed board <b>26</b> through the terminal of the connection terminal portion <b>25</b>D. In this way, the electronic circuit section of the printed board <b>26</b> can detect, as a change in capacitance of the variable capacitor configured as described above, the pen pressure applied to the central rod <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the example, the pen pressure detection portion <b>25</b>B including the central rod holding portion A<b>1</b>, the conductive rubber A<b>2</b>, the ring spacer A<b>3</b>, the dielectric A<b>4</b>, and the terminal member A<b>5</b> is similar to a pen pressure detection section with a well-known configuration described in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 5-275283. The configuration of the pen pressure detection portion <b>25</b>B can also be similar to a pen pressure detection section with a well-known configuration described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2011-186803. A semiconductor element disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2013-161307 can also be used, in which the capacitance is variable according to the pen pressure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The fitting portion <b>25</b>C is a part fitted to the board protection pipe <b>27</b> described later. The fitting portion <b>25</b>C is formed in, for example, a substantially cylindrical shape from resin, hard rubber, or the like, and the fitting portion <b>25</b>C is firmly fitted and integrated with the mold portion <b>25</b>A.

However, for the overall strength of the pen tip portion <b>242</b>, it may be preferable to provide the grooves Gv<b>1</b> and Gv<b>2</b> on the axis portion <b>241</b> and provide the protrusions Pr<b>1</b> and Pr<b>2</b> on the pen tip portion <b>242</b> as in the embodiment described above.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the embodiment described above, the pen tip portion <b>242</b> is formed from a polyacetal resin, or formed by mixing polyparaphenylene terephthalamide fibers with a polyacetal resin, or formed by two-color molding of an elastomer and a polyacetal resin. However, the material is not limited to these. Various resins other than the polyacetal resin, such as a PA resin, a PET resin, a PC resin, and an ABS resin, can be used as resin materials as also described above.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The fibrous material may be a material other than the polyparaphenylene terephthalamide fibers. For example, various other fibers, such as carbon fibers and glass fibers, can be used. However, both reduction of abrasion of the pen tip portion and reduction of the load on the operation surface can be achieved by using the highly strong flexible polyparaphenylene terephthalamide fibers. In addition, various materials, such as synthetic rubber and silicone rubber, can be used as elastomers.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">It is to be noted that the embodiment of the present disclosure is not limited to the foregoing embodiment, and that various changes can be made without departing from the spirit of the present disclosure.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
