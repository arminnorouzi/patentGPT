Breasts pumps are generally mechanical devices that can be manually powered (e.g., hand powered) or automatic devices powered by electricity.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Breast pumps are used for many reasons. For example, parents use breast pumps so they can continue to breastfeed after returning to work. That is, a parent can express breast milk at work and then later bottle-feed the breast milk to their child. A breast pump may also be used to stimulate lactation for women with a low milk supply or those who have not just given birth. A breast pump may be also used to address challenges parents may encounter breast feeding, including difficulty latching, separation from an infant in intensive care, to feed an infant who cannot extract sufficient milk itself from the breast, to avoid passing medication through breast milk to the baby, or to relieve engorgement, a painful condition whereby the breasts are overfull. Pumping is often used to continue lactation and its associated hormones to aid in recovery from pregnancy even if the pumped milk is not later fed to a child.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Most breast pumps direct the pumped milk into a container (i.e., bottle) that can be used for storage and feeding. Thus, the expressed breast milk may be stored and later fed to a baby by bottle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, breast pumps are configured to threadably engage an opening of a bottle. Typical baby bottles have a threaded opening, which, when filled, are configured to threadably receive a milk dispensing cap or artificial nipple. Thus, in operation, after the expressed milk has been collected in the bottle, the user must disengage the breast pump from the bottle and then secure the cap to the bottle. During this exchange the bottle is left open and subject to spilling of the expressed breast milk contained in the bottle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, during pumping, if there is a lot of milk being expressed, there may be more milk than the bottle can hold. The pump needs to be turned off, the bottle switched or emptied, and then the pump turned back on. It can be difficult for a lactating parent to have another letdown after stopping mid pumping.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the foregoing and other exemplary problems, drawbacks, and disadvantages of the conventional methods and structures, an exemplary feature of the present invention is to provide.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a first, exemplary, non-limiting aspect of the present invention, a breast pump adapter includes a main body and a lower portion configured to be rotatably attached to the main body. The main body includes an upper cylindrical portion, including a first end, a second end opposite to the first end, an opening formed in the first end, a cylindrical sidewall connecting the first end to the second end and a threading formed within the cylindrical sidewall, a lower cup-shaped portion extending from the second end of the upper cylindrical portion, the lower cup-shaped portion having multiple openings, and a pair of opposed flanges extending from the second end of the upper cylindrical portion, each of the flanges having a projection formed at a distal end thereof. The lower portion includes a first end, a second end opposite to the first end, an opening formed in the first end, a cylindrical sidewall connecting the first end to the second end, a lip extending around an outer circumference of the second end of the lower portion and configured to engage the projection of each of the flanges and a guard member disposed within the opening of the lower portion. The upper portion is configured to rotate with respect to the lower portion to move the guard member from an open position in which the guard member does not block the multiple openings to a closed position in which the guard member blocks the multiple openings.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a second, exemplary, non-limiting aspect of the present invention, a breast pump assembly including a breast pump adapter and a breast pump configured to be attached to the breast bump adapter. The breast pump adapter includes a main body and a lower portion configured to be rotatably attached to the main body. The main body includes an upper cylindrical portion, including a first end, a second end opposite to the first end, an opening formed in the first end, a cylindrical sidewall connecting the first end to the second end and a threading formed within the cylindrical sidewall, a lower cup-shaped portion extending from the second end of the upper cylindrical portion, the lower cup-shaped portion having multiple openings, and a pair of opposed flanges extending from the second end of the upper cylindrical portion, each of the flanges having a projection formed at a distal end thereof. The lower portion includes a first end, a second end opposite to the first end, an opening formed in the first end, a cylindrical sidewall connecting the first end to the second end, a lip extending around an outer circumference of the second end of the lower portion and configured to engage the projection of each of the flanges and a guard member disposed within the opening of the lower portion. The upper portion is configured to rotate with respect to the lower portion to move the guard member from an open position in which the guard member does not block the multiple openings to a closed position in which the guard member blocks the multiple openings.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a third, exemplary, non-limiting aspect of the present invention, a system includes an adapter, a breast pump configured to be attached to the breast bump adapter by threadable engagement and a bottle configured to be attached to the adapter. The breast pump adapter includes a main body and a lower portion configured to be rotatably attached to the main body. The main body includes an upper cylindrical portion, including a first end, a second end opposite to the first end, an opening formed in the first end, a cylindrical sidewall connecting the first end to the second end and a threading formed within the cylindrical sidewall, a lower cup-shaped portion extending from the second end of the upper cylindrical portion, the lower cup-shaped portion having multiple openings, and a pair of opposed flanges extending from the second end of the upper cylindrical portion, each of the flanges having a projection formed at a distal end thereof. The lower portion includes a first end, a second end opposite to the first end, an opening formed in the first end, a cylindrical sidewall connecting the first end to the second end, a lip extending around an outer circumference of the second end of the lower portion and configured to engage the projection of each of the flanges and a guard member disposed within the opening of the lower portion. The upper portion is configured to rotate with respect to the lower portion to move the guard member from an open position in which the guard member does not block the multiple openings to a closed position in which the guard member blocks the multiple openings.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with the above, exemplary aspects of the present invention, the adapter is configured to be secured at a first end to a breast pump and at a second end to a bottle. Accordingly, the openings in the adapter are configured to be arranged in an open position while the breast pump is pumping milk into the bottle. This allows milk to freely flow from the pump through the adapter and into the bottle. When the pumping is complete and the bottle is filled or partially filled, the adapter is configured to close the openings in the adapter. Thus, the opening of the bottle is closed, and milk cannot flow out of the bottle while the breast pump is removed from the bottle. Accordingly, the adapter prevents the contents of the bottle from spilling while and after the breast pump is removed from the bottle. Furthermore, the adapter will all for a bottle to be swapped while pumping without spilling milk.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The foregoing and other exemplary purposes, aspects and advantages will be better understood from the following detailed description of an exemplary embodiment of the invention with reference to the drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of a breast bump adapter <b>100</b> in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the adapter illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a bottom exploded perspective view of the adapter illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional plan view of the adapter <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional plan view of the adapter <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> connected to a bottle B;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a top perspective view of the adapter <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> rotated into a closed position;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates the adapter <b>100</b> connected to a breast pump P;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a bottom perspective view of the adapter <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> rotated into an open position;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a top perspective view of the adapter <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> rotated into a closed position;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an exploded top perspective view of an adapter <b>200</b> according to a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the adapter <b>200</b>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a top view of a lower portion of the adapter <b>200</b>;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a bottom perspective view of the upper portion of the adapter; and</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref> are side views of the adapter.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>15</b></figref>, there are shown exemplary embodiments of the breast pump adapter and corresponding breast pump system according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a breast pump adapter <b>100</b> in accordance with a non-limiting, exemplary embodiment of the present invention.

That is, the end faces <b>159</b><i>a </i>prevent the projection <b>176</b> from being rotated beyond the cut-out portions <b>157</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The upper portion <b>110</b> is configured to rotate with respect to the lower portion <b>150</b> to move the guard member <b>151</b> from an open position in which the guard member <b>151</b> does not block the multiple openings <b>166</b> of the upper portion <b>110</b> to a closed position in which the guard member <b>151</b> blocks the multiple openings <b>166</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In use, the adapter <b>110</b> is configured to be secured at a first end to a breast pump P and at a second end to a bottle B. Specifically, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the threads <b>120</b> along the upper portion <b>110</b> of the adapter <b>100</b> are configured to threadably engage corresponding threads on a breast pump P, while, as detailed above, internal threading <b>155</b> is configured to threadably engage external threading T on the opening O of the bottle B such that the breast pump adapter <b>100</b> is removably fixed to the opening O in the bottle B.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Accordingly, the openings <b>166</b> in the upper portion <b>110</b> are configured to be arranged in an open position while the breast pump P is pumping milk into the bottle B. This allows milk to freely flow from the pump through the adapter and into the bottle. The open position is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. That is, during pumping, the upper portion <b>110</b> is rotated to an open position in which the openings <b>166</b> of the upper portion are aligned with the openings <b>153</b> in the guard member <b>151</b>. This allows milk to freely flow from the pump P, through the openings <b>166</b>/<b>151</b> and into the bottle B.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the pumping is complete and the bottle B is filled, the adapter <b>100</b> is configured to close the openings in the adapter. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates the adapter <b>100</b> in the closed position. In the closed position, the upper portion <b>110</b> is rotated such that the openings <b>166</b> are blocked by the guard member. Thus, the opening O of the bottle B is closed and milk cannot flow out of the bottle B while the breast pump P is removed from the bottle B. Accordingly, the adapter <b>100</b> prevents the contents of the bottle B from spilling while and after the breast pump P is removed from the bottle B.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Finally, the adapter <b>100</b> includes a status indicator <b>180</b>, which indicates whether the adapter <b>100</b> is in the open or closed position.
