These and other considerations are discussed herein.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is to be understood that both the following general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive. Methods, systems, and apparatuses for user engagement analysis are described herein. A presentation platform may comprise a system of computing devices, servers, software, etc. that is configured to provide a plurality of media assets (e.g., content) at a plurality of user devices. Users of the plurality of user devices may engage with (e.g., interact with) the plurality of media assets may via a client application, resulting in a plurality of activity data. The presentation platform may comprise an analytics subsystem that is configured to receive and analyze the plurality of activity data.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one example embodiment, the analytics subsystem may use the plurality of activity data to generate a plurality of user profiles, corresponding user interest clouds for each user device of a plurality of user devices, and a first interest cloud associated with a particular client identifier. For example, the analytics subsystem may generate the first interest cloud based on a plurality of content features that meet or exceed an interest threshold. In another example embodiment, the analytics subsystem may generate a second interest cloud associated with the particular client identifier. For example, the analytics subsystem may generate the second interest cloud based on a subset of the plurality of media assets associated with a threshold quantity of engagements. In a further example embodiment, the analytics subsystem may determine (e.g., identify) a plurality of clusters of the plurality of media assets and may generate a content interest cloud for each of the plurality of clusters. Each of the content interest clouds may comprise, for example, one or more of a second plurality of content features meeting or exceeding a second interest threshold. Additional advantages will be set forth in part in the description which follows or may be learned by practice. The advantages will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

A presentation platform may comprise a system of computing devices, servers, software, etc. that is configured to provide a plurality of media assets (e.g., content) at a plurality of user devices. Users of the plurality of user devices may engage with (e.g., interact with) the plurality of media assets may via a client application, resulting in a plurality of activity data. The presentation platform may comprise an analytics subsystem that is configured to receive and analyze the plurality of activity data.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one example embodiment, the analytics subsystem may receive the plurality of activity data, which may be associated with a plurality of engagements of the plurality of user devices with the plurality media assets. The plurality of engagements may comprise or be indicative of, as an example, several user interactions with a user interface of the client application; a quantity of time(s) that each media asset was output; a quantity of mute actions; a level of volume; a duration(s) of inactivity of the client application; etc. The analytics subsystem may analyze the plurality of activity data to generate a plurality of user profiles and corresponding user interest clouds for each user device of the plurality of user devices. The corresponding user interest clouds may each comprise, as an example, at least one content feature associated with each media asset of the plurality media assets. Additionally, the corresponding user interest clouds may each comprise, as an example, an interest attribute associated with each media asset of the plurality media assets. An interest attribute may comprise, for example, a numerical indication of a level of interest (e.g., a percentage, rating, etc.) or a textual indication of a level of interest (e.g., &#x201c;high,&#x201d; &#x201c;low,&#x201d; etc.) associated with the corresponding media asset.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The analytics subsystem may determine (e.g., identify) a plurality of content features associated with interest attributes that meet or exceed an interest threshold. For example, the analytics subsystem may determine the plurality of content features that meet or exceed the interest threshold based on the at least one content feature and the associated interest attribute of each of the corresponding user interest clouds. The plurality of activity data may be associated with a client identifier. For example, the presentation platform may provide/distribute media assets for several different clients (e.g., third-party subsystems as described herein), and each client may be associated with a unique client identifier. The analytics subsystem may generate a first interest cloud associated with the particular client identifier. For example, the analytics subsystem may generate the first interest cloud based on the plurality of content features that meet or exceed the interest threshold.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In another example embodiment, the analytics subsystem may determine (e.g., identify) a subset of the plurality of media assets associated with a threshold quantity of engagements. Each media asset of the subset may be associated with an average quantity of engagements by one or more users of one or more of the plurality of user devices. The threshold quantity of engagements for a particular media asset of the subset may, as an example, be several engagements that is greater than or equal to the corresponding average quantity of engagements for that particular media asset. The analytics subsystem may generate a second interest cloud associated with the particular client identifier. For example, the analytics subsystem may generate the second interest cloud based on the subset of the plurality of media assets associated with the threshold quantity of engagements.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a further example embodiment, the analytics subsystem may determine a plurality of clusters of the plurality of user profiles (referred to herein as the &#x201c;user profile clusters&#x201d;). For example, the analytics subsystem may use a machine learning model to determine the user profile clusters. The machine learning model may be comprised of one or more unsupervised models. The analytics subsystem may use the machine learning model to determine the user profile clusters based on the plurality of activity data and the plurality of engagements. The analytics subsystem may generate a cluster interest cloud for each of the user profile clusters. Each of the cluster interest clouds may comprise a first plurality of content features meeting or exceeding a first interest threshold. The first plurality of content features may be associated with the plurality media assets. For example, the first plurality of content features may comprise at least one of: a content type, a content rating, content metadata, a date of creation, a content tag, a content category, a content filter, a language, or one or more words of a content description associated with or more of the plurality media assets meeting or exceeding the first interest threshold.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The analytics subsystem may use the machine learning model to determine (e.g., identify) a plurality of clusters of the plurality of media assets (referred to herein as the &#x201c;media asset clusters&#x201d;). The machine learning model may determine the media asset clusters based on, for example, the plurality of activity data and the plurality of engagements. The analytics subsystem may use the machine learning model to generate a content interest cloud for each of the media asset clusters. Each of the content interest clouds may comprise, for example, one or more of a second plurality of content features meeting or exceeding a second interest threshold. For example, the second plurality of content features may comprise at least one of: a content type, a content rating, content metadata, a date of creation, a content tag, a content category, a content filter, a language, or one or more words of a content description associated with or more of the plurality media assets meeting or exceeding the second interest threshold.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The first interest threshold and the second interest threshold may each comprise a threshold level of interest associated with each media asset. For example, a first media asset may comprise a first content type of &#x201c;webinar&#x201d; and a first content category of &#x201c;training material.&#x201d; The first content type (e.g., a content feature) may be associated with a first interest attribute comprising a numerical indication of a level of interest (e.g., a percentage), and the first content category (e.g., a content feature) may be associated with a second interest attribute comprising a textual indication of a level of interest (e.g., &#x201c;high,&#x201d; &#x201c;low,&#x201d; etc.) associated with the first media asset. For example, the first interest attribute may be indicative of a &#x201c;90%&#x201d; numerical level of interest, and the second interest attribute may be indicative of a &#x201c;medium&#x201d; textual level of interest.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The first interest threshold may include, for example, numerical levels of interest greater than 75% and textual levels of interest including &#x201c;high&#x201d; and &#x201c;medium.&#x201d; In such a case, the first media asset may satisfy the first interest threshold. The second interest threshold may include, for example, numerical levels of interest greater than 80% and textual levels of interest including &#x201c;high&#x201d; only. In such a case, the first media asset may not satisfy the second interest threshold, since the second interest attribute is indicative of a &#x201c;medium&#x201d; textual level of interest.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of an operational environment <b>100</b> that includes a presentation platform for presentation of digital content, in accordance with one or more embodiments of this disclosure. The presentation platform can include backend platform devices <b>130</b> and, in some cases, presentation platform devices <b>160</b>. In other cases, the presentation platform devices <b>160</b> can pertain to a third-party provider. Regardless of its type, the backend platform devices <b>130</b> and the presentation platform devices <b>160</b> can be functionally coupled by a network architecture <b>155</b>. The network architecture <b>155</b> can include one or a combination of networks (wireless or wireline) that permit one-way and/or two-way communication of data and/or signaling. The digital content can include, for example, 2D content, 3D content, or 4D content or another type of immersive content. Besides digital content that is static and, thus, can be consumed in time-shifted fashion, digital content that can be created and consumed contemporaneously also is contemplated.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The digital content can be consumed by a user device of a group of user devices <b>102</b>. The user device can consume the content as part of a presentation that is individual or as part of a presentation involving multiple parties. Regardless of its type a presentation can take place within a session to consume content. Such a session can include, for example, a call session, videoconference, a downstream lecture (a seminar, a class, a tutorial, or the like, for example).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The group of user devices <b>102</b> can include various types of user devices, each having a particular amount of computing resources (e.g., processing resources, memory resources, networking resources, and I/O elements) to consume digital content via a presentation. In some cases, the group of user devices <b>102</b> can be homogeneous, including devices of a particular type, such as high-end to medium-end mobile devices, IoT devices <b>120</b>, or wearable devices <b>122</b>. A mobile device can be embodied in, for example, a handheld portable device <b>112</b> (e.g., a smartphone, a tablet, or a gaming console); a non-handheld portable device <b>118</b> (e.g., a laptop); a tethered device <b>116</b> (such as a personal computer); or an automobile <b>114</b> having an in-car infotainment system (IVS) having wireless connectivity. A wearable device can be embodied in goggles (such as augmented-reality (AR) goggles) or a helmet mounted display device, for example. An IoT device can include an appliance having wireline connectivity and/or wireless connectivity. In other cases, the group of user device <b>102</b> can be heterogeneous, including devices of a various types, such as a combination of high-end to medium-end mobile devices, wearable devices, and IoT devices.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">To consume digital content, a user device of the group of user devices <b>102</b> can execute a client application <b>106</b> retained in a memory device <b>104</b> that can be present in the user device. A processor (not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) integrated into the user device can execute the application <b>106</b>. The client application <b>106</b> can include a mobile application or a web browser, for example. Execution of the client application <b>106</b> can cause initiation of a presentation session. Accordingly, execution of the client application <b>106</b> can result in the exchange of data and/or signaling with a user gateway <b>132</b> included in the backend platform devices <b>130</b>. The user device and the user gateways <b>132</b> can be functionally coupled by a network architecture <b>125</b> that can include one or a combination of networks (wireless or wireline) that permit one-way and/or two-way communication of data and/or signaling. Specifically, the user device can receive data defining the digital content. Such data can be embodied in one or multiple streams defining respective elements of the digital content. For instance, a first stream can define imaging data corresponding to video content, and a second stream can define audio data corresponding to an audio channel of the digital content. In some cases, a third stream defining haptic data also can be received. The haptic data can dictate elements of 4D content or another type of immersive content.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The user gateway <b>132</b> can provide data defining the digital content by identifying a particular deliver server of multiple delivery servers <b>162</b> included in the presentation platform devices <b>160</b>, and then supplying a request for content to that particular delivery server. That particular delivery server can be embodied in an edge server in cases in which the distributed platform devices <b>160</b> include a content delivery network (CDN). In some configurations, the particular delivery server can have a local instance of digital content to be provided to a user device. The local instance of digital content can be obtained from one or several media repositories <b>164</b>, where each one of the media repositories <b>164</b> contain media assets <b>166</b>. Such assets can be static and can be consumed in time-shifted fashion. At least some of the media assets <b>166</b> can be specific to a media repository or can be replicated across two or more media repositories. The media assets <b>166</b> can include, for example, a video segment, a webcast, an RSS feed, or another type of digital content that can be streamed by the user gateway <b>132</b> and/or other devices of the backend platform devices <b>130</b>. The media assets <b>166</b> are not limited to digital content that can be streamed. In some cases, at least some of the media assets <b>166</b> can include static digital content, such as an image or a document.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The particular delivery server can provide digital content to the user gateway <b>132</b> in response to the request for content. The user gateway <b>132</b> can then send the digital content to a user device. The user gateway <b>132</b> can send the digital content according to one of several communication protocols (e.g., IPv4 or IPv6, for example).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the digital content that is available to a user device or set of multiple user devices (e.g., a virtual classroom or a recital) can be configured by content management subsystem <b>140</b>. To that end, the content management subsystem <b>140</b> can identify corpora of digital content applicable to the user device(s). Execution of the client application <b>106</b> can result in access to a specific corpus of digital content based on attributes of the user device or a combination of the set of multiple devices.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The subsystems <b>136</b> also include an analytics subsystem <b>142</b> that can generate intelligence and/or knowledge about content consumption behavior of a user device (e.g., one of the user devices <b>102</b>). The analytics subsystem <b>142</b> can retain the intelligence and/or knowledge in a storage subsystem <b>144</b>. Both the intelligence and knowledge can be generated using historical data identifying one or different types of activities of the user device. The activities can be related to consumption of digital content. In some configurations, the client application <b>106</b> can send activity data during consumption of digital content. The activity data can identify an interaction or a combination of interactions of the user device with the digital content. An example of an interaction is trick play (e.g., fast-forward or rewind) of the digital content. Another example of an interaction is reiterated playback of the digital content. Another example of an interaction is aborted playback, e.g., playback that is terminated before the endpoint of the digital content. Yet another example of the interaction is submission (or &#x201c;share&#x201d;) of the digital content to a user account in a social media platform. Thus, the activity data can characterize engagement with the digital content.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The analytics subsystem <b>142</b> can then utilize the activity data to assess a degree of interest of the user device on the digital content (e.g., media assets). To that end, in some embodiments, the analytics subsystem <b>142</b> can train a machine learning model to discern a degree of interest on digital content among multiple interest levels. The machine learning model can be trained using unsupervised training, for example, and multiple features determined using digital content and the activity data. By applying the trained machine learning model to new activity data, an interest attribute can be generated. An interest attribute may represent one of the multiple interest levels and, thus, quantifies interest on the digital content on part of the user device.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">By evaluating interest of a user device on different types of digital content, the analytics subsystem <b>142</b> can generate a user profile for the user device. Such an evaluation can be implemented for multiple user devices and therefore multiple user profiles can be generated. A user profile may comprise a user interest cloud (UIC). A UIC can identify types of digital content&#x2014;and/or features thereof&#x2014;likely to be of interest to a user corresponding to a UIC and therefore likely to be consumed by the user via their user device. For example, a UIC may comprise a tag cloud that includes interest tags, which correspond to respective interests of a user. An interest of a user may be derived from user activity data. For example, the analytics subsystem <b>142</b> may receive activity data indicative of a plurality of engagements of a user device with a plurality of media assets (e.g., digital content). The analytics subsystem <b>142</b> may receive the activity data via the client application <b>106</b> executing on the user device. Each of the plurality of media assets may comprise a plurality of content features, as further described herein. The analytics subsystem <b>142</b> may generate a UIC associated with that particular user and/or user device. The UIC may include at least one content feature of the plurality of content features (e.g., representing content features associated with content with which the user has engaged). The UIC may also include, as further described herein, at least one interest attribute representing a level of interest for each of the media assets consumed by the user/user device. As further described herein, the UIC can be used by a machine learning model to identify one or more of the media assets <b>166</b> that are likely to be of interest to a user corresponding to the UIC.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the analytics subsystem <b>142</b> can include multiple units that permit generating a user profile. The analytics subsystem <b>142</b> can include a feature extraction unit <b>210</b> that can receive media asset data <b>204</b> defining a media asset of the media assets <b>166</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). As mentioned, the media asset can be a webinar, a video, a document, a webpage, a promotional webpage, or similar asset. The feature extraction unit <b>210</b> can then determine one or several content features for the media asset. Examples of content features that can be determined for the media asset include, content type (video, webinar, pdf, web page, etc.), content rating; author information (e.g., academic biography of a lecturer); date of creation; content tag; content category; content filter; language of the content; content description.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Simply as an example, the content description can include an abstract or a summary, such as a promotional summary, a social media summary, and an on-demand summary. The feature extraction unit <b>210</b> can determine the content feature(s) for the media asset prior to consumption of the media asset. In this way, the determination of a user profile can be more efficient. The feature extraction unit <b>210</b> can retain data indicative of the determined content feature(s) in storage <b>240</b>, within memory elements <b>246</b> (represented features <b>246</b>).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition, the analytics subsystem <b>142</b> can include an activity monitoring unit <b>220</b> that can receive user activity data <b>224</b> for a user device. As mentioned, the client application <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) includes in the user device can send the user activity data <b>224</b>. The user activity data <b>224</b> can identify an interaction or a combination of interactions of the user device with the media asset. Again, an interaction can include one of trick play, reiterated playback, aborted play, social media share, or similar. The activity monitoring unit <b>220</b> can then generate one or several engagement features using the user activity data <b>224</b>. In some configurations, an engagement feature can quantify the engagement of the user device with the media asset. For instance, the engagement feature can be a numerical weight ascribed to a particular type of user activity data <b>224</b>. For example, aborted playback can be ascribed a first numerical weight and social media share can be ascribed a second numerical weight, where the first numerical weight is less than the second numerical weight. Other numerical weights can be ascribed to reiterated playback and trick-play. For such interactions, the number of reiterations and the time spent consuming the media asset due to trick-play can determine the magnitude of respective numerical weights. The feature extraction unit <b>210</b> can retain data indicative of the determined engagement feature(s) in the storage <b>240</b>, within the features <b>244</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The analytics subsystem <b>142</b> also can include a scoring unit <b>230</b> that can determine an interest level for the media asset corresponding to the determined content feature(s) and engagement feature(s). To that end, the scoring unit can apply a scoring model <b>248</b> to those features, where the scoring model <b>248</b> can be a trained machine learning model that resolves a multi-class classification task. Specifically, in some embodiments, the scoring unit <b>230</b> can generate a feature vector including determined content feature(s) and engagement feature(s) for the media asset. A feature vector may be associated with a particular user device(s). A feature vector may comprise a quantification of a level/amount of engagement with each media asset and/or a numerical weight associated with an engagement feature as described herein. The number and arrangement of items in such a feature vector may be the same as those of features vectors used during training of the scoring model <b>248</b>. The scoring unit <b>230</b> can then apply the scoring model <b>248</b> to the feature vector to generate an interest attribute representing a level of interest on the media asset. The interest attribute can be a numerical value (e.g., an integer number) or textual label that indicates the level of interest (e.g., &#x201c;high,&#x201d; &#x201c;moderate,&#x201d; &#x201c;low&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A profile generation unit <b>250</b> can determine, in some instances, that an interest attribute for a media asset meets or exceeds a defined level of interest. In those instances, the profile generation unit <b>250</b> can select words or phrases, or both, from content features determined for the media asset. Simply for purposes of illustrations, the profile generation unit <b>250</b> can select one or more categories of the media asset and a title of the media asset as is defined within a description of the media asset. A selected word or phrase may, for example, represent an interest of the user device on the media asset. The profile generation unit <b>250</b> can then generate a user profile <b>270</b> that includes multiple entries <b>276</b>, each one corresponding to a selected word or phrase. The profile generation unit <b>250</b> can then retain the user profile <b>270</b> in the storage subsystem <b>144</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">By receiving user activity data <b>224</b> from different user devices, the analytics subsystem <b>142</b> can generate respective user profiles for those user devices. Thus, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the storage subsystem <b>144</b> can include user profiles <b>310</b>. In addition, or in some embodiments, the content management subsystem <b>140</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) can then configure digital content (e.g., media assets) that are of interest to the user device. As a result, a particular group of the media assets <b>166</b> can be made available to a particular user device. Such a group may define a corpus of digital content.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, a user profile and a corpus of digital content for a user device also can comprise a UIC for the user device. In addition, or in other embodiments, the content management subsystem <b>140</b> can configure one or more functions to interact with digital content. Those function(s) can include, for example, one or a combination of translation functionality (automated or otherwise), social-media distribution, formatting functionality, or the like. The content management subsystem <b>140</b> can include at least one of the function(s) in the user interest cloud.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The content management subsystem <b>140</b> can retain data defining a UIC within the storage subsystem <b>144</b>.

The selection of features according to filter methods are independent of any machine learning algorithms used by the system <b>1600</b>. Instead, features may be selected on the basis of scores in various statistical tests for their correlation with the outcome variable (e.g., a prediction).</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">As another example, one or more candidate feature groups may be selected according to a wrapper method. A wrapper method may be configured to use a subset of features and train the machine learning model <b>1630</b> using the subset of features. Based on the inferences that may be drawn from a previous model, features may be added and/or deleted from the subset. Wrapper methods include, for example, forward feature selection, backward feature elimination, recursive feature elimination, combinations thereof, and the like. For example, forward feature selection may be used to identify one or more candidate feature groups. Forward feature selection is an iterative method that begins with no features. In each iteration, the feature which best improves the model is added until an addition of a new variable does not improve the performance of the model. As another example, backward elimination may be used to identify one or more candidate feature groups. Backward elimination is an iterative method that begins with all features in the model. In each iteration, the least significant feature is removed until no improvement is observed on removal of features. Recursive feature elimination may be used to identify one or more candidate feature groups. Recursive feature elimination is a greedy optimization algorithm which aims to find the best performing feature subset. Recursive feature elimination repeatedly creates models and keeps aside the best or the worst performing feature at each iteration. Recursive feature elimination constructs the next model with the features remaining until all the features are exhausted. Recursive feature elimination then ranks the features based on the order of their elimination.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">As a further example, one or more candidate feature groups may be selected according to an embedded method. Embedded methods combine the qualities of filter and wrapper methods. Embedded methods include, for example, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and ridge regression which implement penalization functions to reduce overfitting. For example, LASSO regression performs L1 regularization which adds a penalty equivalent to absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients and ridge regression performs L2 regularization which adds a penalty equivalent to square of the magnitude of coefficients.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">After the training module <b>1620</b> has generated a feature set(s), the training module <b>1620</b> may generate the one or more machine learning models <b>1640</b>A-<b>1640</b>N based on the feature set(s). A machine learning model (e.g., any of the one or more machine learning models <b>1640</b>A-<b>1640</b>N) may refer to a complex mathematical model for data classification that is generated using machine-learning techniques as described herein. In one example, a machine learning model may include a map of support vectors that represent boundary features. By way of example, boundary features may be selected from, and/or represent the highest-ranked features in, a feature set.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">The training module <b>1620</b> may use the feature sets extracted from the training dataset <b>1610</b>A and/or the training dataset <b>1610</b>B to build the one or more machine learning models <b>1640</b>A-<b>1640</b>N for each classification category (e.g., &#x201c;of interest to a particular user media asset&#x201d; and &#x201c;not of interest to the particular user media asset&#x201d;). In some examples, the one or more machine learning models <b>1640</b>A-<b>340</b>N may be combined into a single machine learning model <b>1640</b> (e.g., an ensemble model). Similarly, the machine learning model <b>1630</b> may represent a single classifier containing a single or a plurality of machine learning models <b>1640</b> and/or multiple classifiers containing a single or a plurality of machine learning models <b>1640</b> (e.g., an ensemble classifier).</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">The extracted features (e.g., one or more candidate features) may be combined in the one or more machine learning models <b>1640</b>A-<b>1640</b>N that are trained using a machine learning approach such as discriminant analysis; decision tree; a nearest neighbor (NN) algorithm (e.g., k-NN models, replicator NN models, etc.); statistical algorithm (e.g., Bayesian networks, etc.); clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means, mean-shift, etc.); neural networks (e.g., reservoir networks, artificial neural networks, etc.); support vector machines (SVMs); logistic regression algorithms; linear regression algorithms; Markov models or chains; principal component analysis (PCA) (e.g., for linear models); multi-layer perceptron (MLP) ANNs (e.g., for non-linear models); replicating reservoir networks (e.g., for non-linear models, typically for time series); random forest classification; a combination thereof and/or the like. The resulting machine learning model <b>1630</b> may comprise a decision rule or a mapping for each candidate feature in order to assign a prediction to a class (e.g., of interest to a particular user vs. not of interest to the particular user). As described herein, the machine learning model <b>1630</b> may be used to determine predictions for media assets.

The training method <b>1700</b> may generate, at step <b>1720</b>, a training dataset and a testing dataset. The training dataset and the testing dataset may be generated by randomly assigning media assets from the first media assets and/or the second media assets to either the training dataset or the testing dataset. In some implementations, the assignment of media assets as training or test samples may not be completely random. As an example, only the media assets for a specific feature(s) and/or range(s) of predetermined predictions may be used to generate the training dataset and the testing dataset. As another example, a majority of the media assets for the specific feature(s) and/or range(s) of predetermined predictions may be used to generate the training dataset. For example, 75% of the media assets for the specific feature(s) and/or range(s) of predetermined predictions may be used to generate the training dataset and 25% may be used to generate the testing dataset.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">The training method <b>1700</b> may determine (e.g., extract, select, etc.), at step <b>1730</b>, one or more features that may be used by, for example, a classifier to differentiate among different classifications (e.g., predictions/recommendations).

In other words, the other media assets (e.g., the third portion) may be used for feature determination/selection, rather than for training.

In another example, other machine learning techniques may be used, including unsupervised learning and semi-supervised. The machine learning models trained at step <b>1740</b> may be selected based on different criteria depending on the problem to be solved and/or data available in the training dataset.

The machine learning model <b>1630</b> may analyze the testing dataset and generate classification values and/or predicted values (e.g., predictions) at step <b>1770</b>. Classification and/or prediction values may be evaluated at step <b>1780</b> to determine whether such values have achieved a desired accuracy level. Performance of the machine learning model <b>1630</b> may be evaluated in a number of ways based on a number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and/or false negatives classifications of the plurality of data points indicated by the machine learning model <b>1630</b>.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">For example, the false positives of the machine learning model <b>1630</b> may refer to a number of times the machine learning model <b>1630</b> incorrectly assigned a high prediction to a media asset associated with a low predetermined prediction. Conversely, the false negatives of the machine learning model <b>1630</b> may refer to a number of times the machine learning model assigned a low prediction to a media asset associated with a high predetermined prediction. True negatives and true positives may refer to a number of times the machine learning model <b>1630</b> correctly assigned predictions to media assets based on the known, predetermined prediction for each media asset. Related to these measurements are the concepts of recall and precision. Generally, recall refers to a ratio of true positives to a sum of true positives and false negatives, which quantifies a sensitivity of the machine learning model <b>1630</b>.
