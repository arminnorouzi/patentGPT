The disclosure is merely an example, and proper changes in keeping with the spirit of the invention, which are easily conceivable by a person of ordinary skill in the art, come within the scope of the invention as a matter of course. In addition, in some cases, in order to make the description clearer, the widths, thicknesses, shapes, and the like of the respective parts are illustrated schematically in the drawings, rather than as an accurate representation of what is implemented, but such schematic illustration is merely exemplary, and in no way restricts the interpretation of the invention. In addition, in the specification and drawings, constituent elements which function in the same or a similar manner to those described in connection with preceding drawings are denoted by the same reference numbers, and detailed explanations of them that are considered redundant may be appropriately omitted.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the present embodiment, a liquid crystal display device is explained as an example of a display device DSP. The main configuration disclosed in the present embodiment can be applied to a self-luminous display device including an organic electroluminescent display element or the like, an electronic paper display device including an electrophoretic element or the like, a display device employing micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), a display device employing electrochromism, and the like.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a plan view showing the external appearance of the display device DSP of the present embodiment. A first direction X, a second direction Y and a third direction Z are, for example, orthogonal to one another but may cross at an angle other than 90 degrees. The first direction X and the second direction Y correspond to directions parallel to the main surface of a substrate constituting the display device DSP, and the third direction Z corresponds to the thickness direction of the display device DSP. In the present specification, a position on the pointing end side of an arrow indicating the third direction Z is referred to as above, and a position on a side opposite to the pointing end of the arrow is referred to as below. In addition, an observation position at which the display device DSP is observed is assumed to be located on the pointing end side of the arrow indicating the third direction Z, and viewing from this observation position toward an X-Y plane defined by the first direction X and the second direction Y is referred to as planar view.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A plan view of the display device DSP in the X-Y plane is shown here. The display device DSP includes a display panel PNL, a flexible printed circuit board <b>1</b> and an IC chip <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The display panel PNL is a liquid crystal display panel, and includes a first substrate SUB<b>1</b>, a second substrate SUB<b>2</b>, a liquid crystal layer LC which will be described later, a sealant SE and a light-shielding layer LS. The display panel PNL includes a display portion DA which displays an image, and a frame-shaped non-display portion NDA which surrounds the display portion DA. The second substrate SUB<b>2</b> is opposed to the first substrate SUB<b>1</b> in the third direction Z. The first substrate SUB<b>1</b> has a mounting portion MA extending in the second direction Y more than the second substrate SUB<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The sealant SE is located in the non-display portion NDA, bonds the first substrate SUB<b>1</b> and the second substrate SUB<b>2</b> together, and seals in the liquid crystal layer LC. The light-shielding layer LS is located in the non-display portion NDA. The sealant SE is disposed at a position overlapping the light-shielding layer LS in planar view. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an area where the sealant SE is disposed and an area where the light-shielding layer LS is disposed are shown by different hatch lines, and an area where the sealant SE and the light-shielding layer LS overlap is shown by crosshatching. The light-shielding layer LS is disposed in the second substrate SUB<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The display portion DA is located on an inner side surrounded by the light-shielding layer LS. The display portion DA includes a plurality of pixels PX arranged in a matrix in the first direction X and the second direction Y. The display portion DA has a pair of edge portions E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b> extending along the first direction X, a pair of edge portions E<b>3</b> and E<b>4</b> extending along the second direction Y, and four round portions R<b>1</b> to R<b>4</b>. The display panel PNL has a pair of straight portions E<b>11</b> and E<b>12</b> extending along the first direction X, a pair of straight portions E<b>13</b> and E<b>14</b> extending along the second direction Y, and two round portions R<b>11</b> and R<b>12</b>. The round portions R<b>11</b> and R<b>12</b> are located on the outer sides of the round portions R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>, respectively. The radius of curvature of the round portion R<b>11</b> may be the same as or different from the radius of curvature of the round portion R<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The flexible printed circuit board <b>1</b> and the IC chip <b>2</b> are mounted on the mounting portion MA. Note that the IC chip <b>2</b> may be mounted on the flexible printed circuit board <b>1</b>. The IC chip <b>2</b> includes a built-in display driver DD which outputs a signal required for displaying an image in a display mode of displaying an image. In the illustrated example, the IC chip <b>2</b> includes a built-in touch controller TC which controls a touch sensing mode of detecting approach or contact of an object to or with the display device DSP.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The display panel PNL of the present embodiment may be a transmissive type having a transmissive display function of displaying an image by selectively transmitting light from the rear surface side of the first substrate SUB<b>1</b>, a reflective type having a reflective display function of displaying an image by selectively reflecting light from the front surface side of the second substrate SUB<b>2</b>, or a transflective type having the transmissive display function and the reflective display function.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, although the explanation of the detailed configuration of the display panel PNL is omitted here, the display panel PNL may have a configuration conforming to any one of a display mode using a lateral electric field along a substrate main surface, a display mode using a longitudinal electric field along a normal to a substrate main surface, a display mode using an inclined electric field inclined in an direction inclined with respect to a substrate main surface, and an appropriate combination of the lateral electric field, the longitudinal electric field and the inclined electric field. The substrate main surface here is a surface parallel to the X-Y plane defined by the first direction X and the second direction Y.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a plan view showing a configuration example of a touch sensor TS. Although the touch sensor TS of a self-capacitance method is explained here, the touch sensor TS may be of a mutual-capacitance method. The touch sensor TS includes a plurality of sensor electrodes Rx (Rx<b>1</b>, Rx<b>2</b>, etc.) and a plurality of sensor lines L (L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b>, etc.). The sensor electrodes Rx are located in the display portion DA and are arranged in a matrix in the first direction X and the second direction Y. One sensor electrode Rx constitutes a sensor block which is the smallest unit which can perform touch sensing. The sensor lines L extend along the second direction Y and are arranged in the first direction X in the display portion DA. Each sensor line L is disposed at, for example, a position overlapping a signal line S which will be described later. In addition, each sensor line L is drawn to the non-display portion NDA and is electrically connected to the IC chip <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Here, attention will be focused on the relationship between the sensor lines L<b>1</b> to L<b>3</b> arranged in the first direction X and the sensor electrodes Rx<b>1</b> to Rx<b>3</b> arranged in the second direction Y. The sensor line L<b>1</b> overlaps the sensor electrodes Rx<b>1</b> to Rx<b>3</b> and is electrically connected to the sensor electrode Rx<b>1</b>. The sensor line L<b>2</b> overlaps the sensor electrodes Rx<b>2</b> and Rx<b>3</b> and is electrically connected to the sensor electrode Rx<b>2</b>. A dummy line D<b>20</b> is apart from the sensor line L<b>2</b>. The dummy line D<b>20</b> overlaps the sensor electrode Rx<b>1</b> and is electrically connected to the sensor electrode Rx<b>1</b>. The sensor line L<b>2</b> and the dummy line D<b>20</b> are located on the same signal line. The sensor line L<b>3</b> overlaps the sensor electrode Rx<b>3</b> and is electrically connected to the sensor electrode Rx<b>3</b>. A dummy line D<b>31</b> overlaps the sensor electrode Rx<b>1</b> and is electrically connected to the sensor electrode Rx<b>1</b>. A dummy line D<b>32</b> is apart from the dummy line D<b>31</b> and the sensor line L<b>3</b>. The dummy line D<b>32</b> overlaps the sensor electrode Rx<b>2</b> and is electrically connected to the sensor electrode Rx<b>2</b>. The sensor line L<b>3</b> and the dummy lines D<b>31</b> and D<b>32</b> are located on the same signal line.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the touch sensing mode, the touch controller TC applies a touch drive voltage to the sensor lines L. Accordingly, the touch drive voltage is applied to the sensor electrodes Rx, and sensing is performed in the sensor electrodes Rx. Sensor signals corresponding to the sensing results in the sensor electrodes Rx are output to the touch controller TC via the sensor lines L. The touch controller TC or an external host detects the presence or absence of the approach or contact of an object to or with the display device DSP and the coordinates of the position of an object based on the sensor signals.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Note that, in the display mode, the sensor electrodes Rx function as common electrodes CE to which a common voltage (Vcom) is applied. The common voltage is a voltage different from the touch drive voltage, and is applied from, for example, a voltage supply unit included in the display driver DD via the sensor lines L.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the non-display portion NDA, the wiring lines WL<b>1</b> to WL<b>3</b> are disposed. In the illustrated example, the wiring lines WL<b>1</b> to WL<b>3</b> are disposed along the straight portion E<b>13</b>, the round portion R<b>11</b>, the straight line E<b>11</b>, the round portion R<b>12</b> and the straight line E<b>14</b>.
