Compared to carbon black fillers, silica fillers provide better cut and flex resistance and heat buildup. However, silica filler has a very low compatibility with rubber because rubbers are hydrophobic and the surface of silica particles are intrinsically hydrophilic due to the presence of silanol groups. Accordingly, silica fillers do not readily disperse in the hydrophobic rubbers and ultimately reduce the modulus and abrasion resistance of the resultant rubber compound.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure relates to improving the incorporation of silica fillers in tire rubber compounds.

For example, when a copolymer, is said to have a &#x201c;cyclopentene&#x201d; content of 35 wt % to 55 wt %, it is understood that the mer unit in the copolymer is derived from cyclopentene in the polymerization reaction and the derived units are present at 35 wt % to 55 wt %, based upon the weight of the copolymer. A &#x201c;polymer&#x201d; has two or more of the same or different mer units. A &#x201c;homopolymer&#x201d; is a polymer having mer units that are the same. A &#x201c;copolymer&#x201d; is a polymer having two or more mer units that are different from each other.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As used herein, polypentenamer rubber (CPR) is defined as a polymer rubber compound containing a C<sub>5 </sub>repetitive unit structure derived from cyclopentene ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), shown below, where n is an integer number greater than one.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="12.70mm" wi="69.51mm" file="US20230002545A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">Each pentene mer may have a cis or trans configuration. The terms &#x201c;cis&#x201d; and &#x201c;(Z)&#x201d; as used herein are used interchangeably and refers to the cis configuration of carbon-carbon double bonds of a polymer backbone. The terms &#x201c;trans&#x201d; and &#x201c;(E)&#x201d; as used herein are used interchangeably and refers to the trans configuration of carbon-carbon double bonds of a polymer backbone. As used herein &#x201c;cis content&#x201d; refers to a mole percent (mol %) of pentene mer units having a cis configuration. For example, when a polymer, is said to have a cis content of 35% to 55%, it is understood that 35 wt % to 55 wt % of pentene mer units have a cis configuration. Similarly, &#x201c;trans content&#x201d; refers to a mol % of pentene mer units having a trans configuration. A cis to trans (cis/trans) ratio refers to the ratio of cis content to trans content. For example, if 35% of the pentene mers in a polymer have a cis configuration and 65% of the pentene mers have a trans configuration, the cis/trans ratio would be 35:65.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">Polypentenamer rubber may be prepared by any suitable ROMP methods and catalysts, for example, those disclosed in ACS Macro Lett. 2019, 8, 1, 46-59 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2019/0040186, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">For example, polymerization of cyclopentene monomers can be performed by contacting a cyclopentene monomer and optional one or more comonomers with an olefin metathesis catalyst under ROMP conditions. Examples of suitable optional comonomers include norbomene, tetracyclodecene, vinyl norbomene, dicyclopentadiene, ethylidene norbomene, norbomadiene, dicyclopentadiene, cyclopentene, cycloheptene, cyclooctene, cyclooctadiene, cyclododecene, 7-oxanorbornene, 7-oxanorbomadiene, cyclopropene, cyclobutene, cyclohexene, methylcyclohexene, cyclobutadiene, cyclohexadiene, cycloheptadiene, cyclooctatetraene, 1,5-dimethyl-1,5-cyclooctadiene, and their substituted derivatives.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">Suitable olefin metathesis catalyst rubber compounds may include a metal, for example, tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo), rhenium (Re), ruthenium (Ru), titanium (Ti), and/or osmium (Os). For example, a Grubbs catalyst may be used as the olefin metathesis catalyst rubber compound. Optionally, the olefin metathesis catalyst may be a heterogeneous catalyst comprising the olefin metathesis catalyst rubber compounds immobilized on a support material (e.g., silica).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">Polymerization reactions may be performed in an inert atmosphere by dissolving a catalytically effective amount of a catalyst in a solvent, and adding the cyclopentene monomer and optionally comonomers, optionally dissolved in a solvent, to the catalyst solution to form a reaction solution. The reaction solution can be agitated (e.g., stirred). The progress of the polymerization occurring in the reaction solution can be monitored by, for example, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">Solvents useful herein include any suitable organic solvent that is inert under the polymerization conditions. A suitable solvent may include one or more of the following solvents: aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, ethers, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and alcohols. Preferred solvents include benzene, toluene, p-xylene, methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, diethylether, pentane, methanol, or ethanol. For example, the solvent can be toluene and/or 1,2-dichloroethane.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">Alternatively, polymerization is performed &#x2018;neat&#x2019; (i.e., without the presence of a solvent in a reaction mixture). In neat reactions, the reaction mixture may contain catalyst, cyclopentene monomers, and optional comonomers. Cyclopentene and optional comonomers may act as a diluent for the catalyst and polymer product.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">The temperature of the reaction mixture (with solvent or neat) during polymerization may be maintained at any suitable temperature using a standard heating and/or cooling device. Reaction temperatures may range from about 0&#xb0; C. to about 100&#xb0; C., such as from about room temperature (23&#xb0; C.) to about 75&#xb0; C. A reaction may be facilitated by various well-known techniques (e.g., stirring and/or heating of the reaction mixture) for any suitable amount of time (e.g., until completion of the reaction). For example, the reaction time may be from about 12 hours to about 48 hours, or from about 15 hours to about 24 hours.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">The molar ratio of cyclopentene monomers and any comonomers to the catalyst can be selected based on the desired molecular weight of the polymer, desired polydispersity index, and the activity of a particular catalyst.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">A resulting CPR comprises pentene and, if included in the reaction mixture, comonomers as described above. The methods and compositions of the present disclosure use an epoxidized CPR or hydrolyzed version thereof (a hydrolyzed epoxidized CPR). Because CPR contains unsaturation, epoxidation of CPR may be carried out by contacting a CPR with an oxidant to produce an epoxidized CPR, for example, as shown below where n=x+y. The epoxide functional group is distributed along the chain (not block) and x and y are the bulk average numbers.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="25.32mm" wi="75.78mm" file="US20230002545A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0035" num="0032">Examples of oxidants include, but are not limited to, potassium hydrogen monopersulfate (e.g., OXONE&#xae;, available from Sigma-Aldrich), hydrogen peroxide, dioxiranes, peracetic acid (prepared by mixing acetic acid and/or acetic anhydride with hydrogen peroxide), performic acid (e.g., prepared by mixing formic acid with hydrogen peroxide), ozone, molecular oxygen, and the like, and any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0033">The epoxidation reaction may be carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent.

Three high temperature TSK gel column (Tosoh GMHHR-H(20)HT2) are used. The nominal flow rate is 1.0 mL/min, and the nominal injection volume is 300 &#x3bc;L. The various transfer lines, columns, and dual flow differential refractometer (the DRI detector) are contained in an oven maintained at 160&#xb0; C. Solvent for the experiment is prepared by dissolving 1.2 grams of butylated hydroxytoluene as an antioxidant in 4 liters of Aldrich reagent grade 1, 2, 4 trichlorobenzene (TCB). The TCB mixture is then filtered through a 0.1 &#x3bc;m Teflon filter. The TCB is then degassed with an online degasser before entering the GPC instrument. Polymer solutions are prepared by placing dry polymer with about 1015 wt % anti-oxidants of Irganox 1076 and Irgafos 168 in glass vials, adding the desired amount of TCB, and then heating the mixture at 160&#xb0; C. with continuous shaking for about 1 hour.

This affinity advantageously will provide better dispersion of silica particles in rubber compounds. It has also been observed that epoxidized CPRs and hydrolyzed epoxidized CPRs have greater miscibility with styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), natural rubber (NR), and butadiene rubber (BR). This is surprising because said rubbers are hydrophobic and the epoxidation of CPR increases the hydrophilicity of CPR. The improved dispersion of silica particles and improved miscibility with SBR, NR, and BR make rubber compounds epoxidized CPRs and hydrolyzed epoxidized CPRs attractive for use in tire treads.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0047">As used herein, &#x201c;phr&#x201d; means &#x201c;parts per hundred parts rubber,&#x201d; where the &#x201c;rubber&#x201d; is the total rubber content of the composition. Herein, epoxidized CPR, hydrolyzed epoxidized CPR, and other rubbers (including those described herein) are considered to contribute to the total rubber content, such that in compositions where both are present, the &#x201c;total rubber&#x201d; is the combined weight of all rubbers in the rubber compound.

Other components added to the composition are calculated on a phr basis. For example, addition of 50 phr of silica to a composition means that 50 g of silica are present in the composition for every 100 g of the SBR, NR, BR, epoxidized CPR, and hydrolyzed epoxidized CPR combined. Unless specified otherwise, phr should be taken as phr on a weight basis.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0048">Rubber compounds described herein comprise epoxidized CPRs and/or hydrolyzed epoxidized CPRs of the present disclosure and filler particles (also referred to herein simply as filler).

Physical properties, performance characteristics, and durability of vulcanized rubber compounds are known to be related to the number (crosslink density) and type of crosslinks formed during the vulcanization reaction. The rubber compounds of the present disclosure may be crosslinked by adding curative agents, for example, sulfur, metals, metal oxides, such as zinc oxide, peroxides, organometallic rubber compounds, radical initiators, fatty acids, and other agents common in the art. Other known methods of curing that may be used include, peroxide cure systems, resin cure systems, and heat or radiation-induced crosslinking of polymers. Accelerators, activators, and retarders may also be used in the curing process.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0061">The compositions may be vulcanized (cured) by any suitable means, such as subjecting them to heat or radiation according to any conventional vulcanization process. The amount of heat or radiation needed is that which is required to affect a cure in the composition, and the disclosure is not herein limited by the method and amount of heat required to cure the composition. Typically, the vulcanization is conducted at a temperature ranging from 100&#xb0; C. to about 250&#xb0; C., or 150&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C., for 1 to 150 minutes.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0062">Halogen-containing rubbers may be crosslinked by their reaction with metal oxides. Examples of useful metal oxides include, but are not limited to, ZnO, CaO, and PbO. The metal oxide can be used alone or in conjunction with its corresponding metal fatty acid complex (e.g., zinc stearate, calcium stearate, etc.), or with the organic and fatty acids added alone, such as stearic acid, and optionally other curatives, such as sulfur or a sulfur rubber compound, an alkylperoxide rubber compound, diamines, or derivatives thereof.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0063">Sulfur is the most common chemical vulcanizing agent for diene-containing rubbers. The sulfur vulcanization system may consist of an activator to activate the sulfur, an accelerator, and a retarder to help control the rate of vulcanization.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0064">Activators are chemicals that increase the rate of vulcanization by reacting first with the accelerators to form rubber-soluble complexes that then react with the sulfur to form sulfurating agents. General classes of accelerators include amines, diamines, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles, thiurams, sulfenamides, sulfenimides, thiocarbamates, xanthates, and the like.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0065">Accelerators help control the onset and rate of vulcanization, and the number and type of crosslinks that are formed. Retarders may be used to delay the initial onset of cure in order to allow sufficient time to process the unvulcanized rubber.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0066">The acceleration of the vulcanization process may be controlled by regulating the amount of the acceleration accelerant, often an organic rubber compound. The mechanism for accelerated vulcanization of SBR, NR, and BR involves complex interactions between the curative, accelerator, activators, and polymers. Ideally, the entire available curative is consumed in the formation of effective crosslinks that join together two polymer chains and enhance the overall strength of the polymer matrix. Numerous accelerators are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, the following: stearic acid, diphenyl guanidine (DPG), tetramethylthiuram disulfide (TMTD), benzothiazyl disulfide (MBTS), N-t-butyl-2-benzothiazole sulfenamide (TBBS), N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazole-sulfenamide (CBS), and thioureas.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0067">Curing agents may be present in the rubber compounds of the present disclosure at 0.2 phr to 10 phr, or 0.5 phr to 5 phr, or 0.75 phr to 2 phr.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0068">The rubber compounds of the present disclosure may be rubber compounded (mixed) by any conventional means known to those skilled in the art. The mixing may occur in a single step or in multiple stages. For example, the ingredients are typically mixed in at least two stages, namely at least one non-productive stage followed by a productive mixing stage. The final curatives are typically mixed in the final stage, which is conventionally called the &#x201c;productive&#x201d; mix stage. In the productive mix stage, the mixing typically occurs at a temperature, or ultimate temperature, lower than the mix temperature(s) of the preceding non-productive mix stage(s). The rubbers, polymer additives, silica and silica coupler, and carbon black, if used, are generally mixed in one or more non-productive mix stages. The terms &#x201c;non-productive&#x201d; and &#x201c;productive&#x201d; mix stages are well known to those having skill in the rubber mixing art.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0069">The carbon black can be added in a different stage from zinc oxide and other cure activators and accelerators. For example, antioxidants, antiozonants, and processing materials are added in a stage after the carbon black has been processed with the rubbers, and zinc oxide is added at a final stage to maximize the rubber compound modulus. In another example, mixing with the clays is performed by techniques known to those skilled in the art, wherein the clay is added to the polymer at the same time as the carbon black. Further, additional stages may involve incremental additions of one or more fillers.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0070">An example of a commercially available zinc oxide is KADOX&#xae; 911 (zinc oxide, available from Cary Company).

Mixing should generally be conducted under conditions of shear sufficient to allow the clay to exfoliate and become uniformly dispersed within the rubber(s).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0072">Typically, from 70% to 100% of the rubber is first mixed for 20 to 90 seconds, or until the temperature reaches from 40&#xb0; C. to 75&#xb0; C. Then, approximately 75% of the filler, and the remaining amount of rubber, if any, are typically added to the mixer, and mixing continues until the temperature reaches from 90&#xb0; C. to 150&#xb0; C. Next, the remaining filler is added, as well as the processing aids, and mixing continues until the temperature reaches from 140&#xb0; C. to 190&#xb0; C. The masterbatch mixture is then finished by sheeting on an open mill and allowed to cool, for example, to from 60&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. when curatives may be added.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0073">Processing aids include isoparaffins, polyalphaolefins (&#x201c;PAOs&#x201d;) and polybutenes (a subgroup of PAOs).

The complex modulus, G*, is computed as G*=sqrt(G&#x2032;{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}2+G&#x2033;{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}2).
