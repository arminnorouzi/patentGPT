Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As seasonal or environmental factors limit outdoor activities, more time may be spent indoors. The increased time spent indoors may limit meaningful effects achievable from sunlight, such as a sense of time or melatonin control. Accordingly, indoor lighting devices that simulate sunlight indoors have been attracting more attention. A lighting device simulating sunlight indoors may provide lighting, colors, or images (e.g., the sky or the sun) similar to an outdoor environment or actual weather by adjusting the color or illuminance of the lighting. It is possible to provide an environment in which a biorhythm may be maintained according to a timeline by providing light simulating sunlight indoors through such a lighting device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, even though it is possible to output light that simulates sunlight, there may be limitations in providing various user experiences beyond simply providing lighting. For example, after light sources are installed, areas radiated with light may be substantially fixed. Although current sky information may be implemented as lighting through control of the individual light sources, it may be substantially impossible to select a position of the sun and a radiation area according to a user-intended time or trajectory.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure has been made to address the above-mentioned problems and disadvantages, and to provide at least the advantages described below.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a lighting device includes a first lighting unit including a plurality of first light sources arranged on a first flat or curved surface, and configured to implement lighting of a first illuminance and of a first color, a second lighting unit including a plurality of second light sources arranged on a second flat or curved surface at least partially inclined with respect to the first lighting unit, the second lighting unit surrounding at least a part of the first lighting unit, and configured to implement lighting of a second illuminance at least partially different from the first illuminance and of a second color, at least one opening formed to penetrate through the first lighting unit, and at least one third lighting unit including a plurality of third light sources arranged on a third flat or curved surface, and configured to implement lighting of a third illuminance higher than the first illuminance and of a third color through the opening.
