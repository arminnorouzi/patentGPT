Hydrogenated tackifiers are derived from petroleum feedstock and can therefore be in tight supply as petroleum feedstock supply tightens. Rosin-based tackifiers (tackifiers derived from rosin) are naturally occurring and their supply is not impacted by petroleum feedstock, in contrast to hydrogenated tackifiers. A need exists to expand polyolefin elastomers use with rosin-based tackifiers in HMA formulations offering suitable adhesive performance.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The instant disclosure provides a composition suitable for adhesive applications, and further for holt-melt adhesive applications.

The sample composition was heated to 177&#xb0; C. and a strip of sample composition (about 5 mm wide) (about 0.12-0.13 gram) was applied on to a cardboard coupon (25.4 mm&#xd7;76.2 mm) by drawing the sample composition lengthwise down the cardboard coupon with a spatula or hot melt applicator, and a second coupon was quickly placed (within 2 seconds) on top of the sample composition. Light finger pressure, for about 5 seconds, was applied to hold the bond in place. Samples were conditioned for 24 hours at room temperature and 54% relative humidity. Immediately after conditioning, samples (n=5) were pulled apart by inserting the blade of a spatula under one corner to fold up the corner. The sample was then placed on a horizontal surface, with the side having the folded corner facing up. With the sample held as near as possible to a heating or cooling source set at the test temperature, the folded corner is manually pulled as rapidly as possible at approximately a 45-90&#xb0; angle, relative to each coupon's lengthwise axis, to tear the adhesive bond. The percent of torn fiber (fiber tear) was estimated in 25% increments (that is, 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%), and the average was recorded.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0082">Heat stress resistance (heat stress) was measured according to the &#x201c;Suggested Test Method for Determining the Heat Stress Resistance of Hot Melt Adhesives,&#x201d; method T-3006, prepared by the Institute of Packaging Professions (IoPP). To prepare one sample, two cardboard coupons (cut with flutes running in the long direction) having dimensions of 2 inches (50.8 mm)&#xd7;3 3/16 in (81 mm) and 2 in (50.8 mm)&#xd7;5&#xbd; in (139.7 mm) were bonded by applying 0.000141b/in of the composition (about 0.12-0.13 gram) using an Olinger Bond Tester (application temperature 177&#xb0; C.), and this tester was used to compress the coupons at a constant pressure, and without a further application of heat. The composition was applied perpendicular to the flutes in the center of the shorter coupon and the coupons were bonded such that the composition was &#xbe; in (19 mm) from one end of the long coupon. Five replicates were made for each composition. Each coupon was stored for 24 hours, at 22&#xb0; C.-23&#xb0; C., and 50% relative humidity. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, samples (<b>10</b>) were then loaded into a sample holder (<b>12</b>), with the short coupon end aligned with the edge of the sample holder (<b>12</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The samples (<b>10</b>) were held in place with a wide plate (<b>14</b>) of the sample holder (<b>10</b>), and the plate (<b>14</b>) was secured by wingnuts (<b>16</b>) to the sample holder (<b>12</b>). A &#x201c;200 g&#x201d; weight (<b>18</b>) was attached to the coupon (<b>20</b>), at a distance of 3.94 in (100 mm) from the bond. The weight (<b>18</b>) was secured by placing the peg attached to the weight into a hole made in the end of the longer coupon. The sample holder (<b>12</b>), containing the coupon (<b>20</b>) and the attached weight (<b>18</b>), was then placed into a convection oven (not shown), equilibrated at a set temperature, and remained in the oven for 24 hours. At the end of the 24 hours, if at least 80% of the bonds (i.e., 4 bonds) do not fail, then the sample is considered to have passed heat resistance testing at the test temperature. The oven temperature was varied, until the maximum passing heat stress resistance (temperature) was determined. All new bonded coupon samples were used for each test temperature. Results are reported as heat stress temperature (&#xb0; C.).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0083">Melt viscosity was measured in accordance with ASTM D 3236 using a Brookfield Viscometer (Model DV0III, version 3), and a SC-31 hot-melt viscometer spindle, at 177&#xb0; C. for the ethylene-based interpolymer, and further the ethylene/&#x3b1;-olefin copolymer; at 177&#xb0; C. for the composition; at 135&#xb0; C. for the ethylene-based polymer wax; and at 170&#xb0; C. for the propylene-based polymer wax. The sample was poured into an aluminum disposable tube-shaped chamber, which was, in turn, inserted into a Brookfield Thermosel, and locked into place. The sample chamber has a notch on the bottom that fits the bottom of the Brookfield Thermosel, to ensure that the chamber is not allowed to turn, when the spindle is inserted and spinning. The sample (approximately 8-10 grams) was heated to the required temperature until the melted sample was one inch below the top of the sample chamber. The viscometer apparatus was lowered, and the spindle submerged into the middle of the sample chamber, wherein the spindle did not touch the sides of the chamber. Lowering was continued, until the brackets on the viscometer align on the Thermosel. The viscometer was turned on, and set to operate at a steady shear rate, which leads to a torque reading in the range of 40 to 60 percent of the total torque capacity, based on the rpm output of the viscometer. Readings were taken every minute for 15 minutes, or until the values stabilize, at which point, a final reading was recorded.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0084">Ring-and-ball softening point was measured using a Mettler Toledo FP900 Thermosystem according to ASTM E28.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0000">Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC)</p><p id="p-0090" num="0085">Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC) can be used to measure the melting, crystallization, and glass transition behavior of a polymer over a wide range of temperature. For example, the TA Instruments Q1000 DSC, equipped with an RCS (refrigerated cooling system) and an autosampler was used to perform this analysis. During testing, a nitrogen purge gas flow of 50 ml/min was used. Each sample was melt pressed into a thin film at 190&#xb0; C.; the melted sample was then air-cooled to room temperature (25&#xb0; C.).

The tests were started at room temperature (25&#xb0; C./77&#xb0; F.) and the temperature was increased at an average rate of 0.5&#xb0; C./minute.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0096">Shear Adhesion Failure Temperature (SAFT) was measured according to ASTM D 4498 with a 500 gram weight in the shear mode. The tests were started at room temperature (25&#xb0; C./77&#xb0; F.) and the oven temperature was ramped at an average rate of 0.5&#xb0; C./minute. The temperature at which the specimen failed is recorded.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0097">Samples for PAFT and SAFT testing were prepared using two sheets of 40 pound Kraft paper, each of 6&#xd7;12 in (152&#xd7;305 mm) dimensions. On the bottom sheet, lengthwise and separated by a gap of 1 in (25 mm), were adhered in parallel fashion two 1.75 in or 2 in (45 mm or 51 mm) wide strips of a one sided, pressure-sensitive tape such as masking tape. The composition sample to be tested was heated to 177&#xb0; C. (350&#xb0; F.) and drizzled in an even manner down the center of the gap formed between the tape strips. Then, before the composition can unduly thicken, two glass rods, one rod riding immediately upon the tapes and shimmed on each side of the gap with a strip of the same tape followed by the second rod and (between the two rods) the second sheet of paper, were slid down the length of the sheets. This was done in a fashion such that the first rod evenly spreads the composition in the gap between the tape strips and the second rod evenly compress the second sheet over the top of the gap and on top of the tape strips. Thus, a single 1 inch (25.4 mm) wide strip of sample composition was created between the two tape strips, and bonding the paper sheets. The sheets so bonded were cut crosswise into strips of width 1 inch (25.4 mm) and length of 3 inches (76.2 mm), each strip having a 1&#xd7;1 in (25&#xd7;25 mm) adhesive sample bond in the center. The strips were conditioned for 24 hours at room temperature (23&#xb0; C.) and 54% relative humidity. The strips were then be employed in the PAFT and SAFT testing, as desired. Two specimens from each compositions sample were tested, and the average failure temperature for PAFT and SAFT was recorded.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Open Time and Set Time</heading><p id="p-0110" num="0098">Set Time and Open Time properties were determined using the Olinger Bond Tester, a mechanical testing device used to form and tear test bonds. The Olinger Bond Tester was heated to 350&#xb0; C. (177&#xb0; C.). The bottom substrate, 2.5&#x2033; (63.5 mm)&#xd7;2&#x2033; (50.8 mm) corrugated board, moved on a track under the adhesive pot which delivered a bead of polymer approximately 1/16&#x2033; (1.6 mm) to &#x215b;&#x2033; (3.2 mm) wide, and 1&#x2033; (25.4 mm) long. The adhesive pot pressure was increased, or decreased, in order to maintain consistent bead size. A top substrate, 2.5&#x2033; (63.5 mm)&#xd7;2&#x2033; (50.8 mm), was applied to the bottom substrate, with a pressure of 2 bars. The Olinger has 2 timers, capable of measuring set-time and open-time potential to the nearest second.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0099">Open Time measurement&#x2014;is the longest time period between adhesive application to one substrate, and the bonding with a second substrate, that results in a 50% fiber-tearing bond. For testing, compression time (or set time) was set to the time determined by set time measurement to achieve 100% fiber tear. Open time was set at 10 seconds and increased in 10 second intervals until less than 50% fiber tear was achieved. The open time was decreased by 5 sec and % fiber tear was determined. Finally, open time was changed by 1 second interval to determine the maximum allowable time to achieve 50% or greater fiber tear.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0100">Set Time measurement&#x2014;is the minimum compression time required to achieve a fiber-tearing bond. For testing, open time was set at 2 seconds (sec). A bond was formed as the top substrate was compressed onto the bottom substrate. After a preset compression time, a tear test was executed as the top substrate was pulled from the bottom substrate. A visual assessment was then made to determine the percentage of fiber tear achieved under the preset test conditions. The set time was changed in one second intervals, determining the time to achieve 100% fiber tear and less than 50% fiber tear. The set time was recorded as the shortest time, to the nearest second, at which a minimum of 50% fiber tear was obtained.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2"><sup>13</sup>C NMR Experimental Procedure for Rosin Ester</heading><p id="p-0113" num="0101"><sup>13</sup>C NMR was used for aliphatic carbon content, oxygenates content, aromatic carbon content, unsaturated carbon content, ester group content, aldehyde group content, and ketone group content, and is performed as follows:</p><p id="p-0114" num="0102">Sample Preparation (rosin ester)&#x2014;The samples were prepared in tetrachloroethane-d<sub>2 </sub>by adding approximately 2.7 g of tetrachloroethane-d<sub>2 </sub>containing 0.025 M Cr(AcAc)<sub>3 </sub>to 0.20-0.30 g sample in a Norell 1001-7 10 mm NMR tube.
