These generators may be driven by the engines of the aircraft. Often, separate combustion engines are provided for driving the generators. Preferably, however, the power supply of aircraft on the ground is not provided by the own generators of the aircraft to avoid operation of the engines or the separate combustion engines and the emissions associated therewith. Instead, often special systems are used for ground power supply of aircraft on airports, which stand out because of low emissions with regard to both materials and acoustics,</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Known systems for ground power supply of aircraft comprise mobile units which each include a combustion engine and a generator driven by the combustion engine and, if needed, also a voltage converter for adapting a voltage output by the generator to the needs of the respective aircraft, wherein these components are arranged on a common vehicle chassis. These units are brought into the neighborhood of the aircraft to be supplied with power on the ground by means of towing vehicles which are also used for other purposes on the respective airport, and then connected to the aircraft to be supplied via supply cables. As a rule, a fuel reservoir for supplying the combustion engine is also arranged on the respective vehicle chassis. In modern embodiments, these known systems produce lower emissions than the own power supplies of the aircraft. However, it is of interest to even reduce these emissions or to completely avoid them.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In further known systems for ground power supply of aircraft, mobile units are provided which comprise a battery as an energy store and a voltage converter on a common vehicle chassis. These mobile units are also brought into the neighborhood of the aircraft to be supplied with power on the ground by means of towing vehicles, and connected to the aircraft via connection cables. If the battery of such a mobile unit is exhausted, the mobile unit is exchanged for a mobile unit with a sufficiently charged battery, and moved to a charging station. The re-charging of the battery takes some time. This time is often clearly longer than the time which is needed to refill a fuel reservoir for supplying a combustion engine. Thus, typically twice as many mobile units with energy storages in form of batteries than aircraft to be supplied with power on the ground have to be provided with this known system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">At least as a concept, systems for ground power supply of aircraft by means of hydrogen fed fuel cells are also known. In mobile units comprising hydrogen fed fuel cells, the provision of the hydrogen is not without problem. For example, the provision of the hydrogen in pressure tanks is forbidden on airports for security reasons. Known metal hydride stores for low pressure storage of hydrogen for mobile units comprising hydrogen fed fuel cells are associated with the drawbacks that metal hydride stores have a comparatively long filing time for refilling them with fresh hydrogen.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a known system for ground power supply of aircraft comprising a mobile converter unit which includes a vehicle chassis and a voltage converter mounted on the vehicle chassis, two separate batteries are provided as energy stores on the same vehicle chassis, which are alternately, particularly one after the other, connectable to an input of the voltage converter. In operation of this known system for ground power supply, a supply cable from the mobile converter unit leads from an output of the voltage converter to the respective aircraft.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There still is a need of a system for ground power supply of aircraft which is at least essentially free of emissions in operation and which can nevertheless be realized at more favorable cost than known low emission systems for ground power supply of aircraft</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention relates to a system for ground power supply of aircraft.

Thus, the voltage converter of the converter unit may be supplied with electric energy out of energy stores of different storage units. Particularly, one of the at least two mobile storage units may be removed from the converter unit and replaced by another of the at least two mobile storage units, if its energy store is exhausted. The exhausted energy store of the one storage unit may then be moved using the second vehicle chassis of this storage unit to a location remote from the converter unit and be recharged there, whereas the converter unit is supplied out of the not yet exhausted energy store of the other storage unit. If this energy store is exhausted, a further exchange of the storage units may take place, because, typically, this is only the case when the energy store of the one storage unit has already been recharged even if this takes a certain period of time. With very long periods of time for recharging the energy store, three or more storage units may be provided instead of the at least two storage units so that the energy stores of two or more of these storage units may simultaneously be recharged, whereas one further storage unit ensures the supply of the voltage converter of the converter unit with electric energy by means of its energy store.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The investment needed for realizing the system according to the present disclosure is thus restricted to what is technically practically necessary, i.e. to one converter unit per aircraft to be supplied at the same time and to so many storage units as alternately needed for a permanent supply of the voltage converters of the converter units with electric energy. Particularly, in the operation of the system according to the present disclosure, no voltage converters that are not needed in charging the energy stores are moved around with the storage units for charging the energy stores of the storage units. Each of the mobile units of the system according to the present disclosure is completely focused to its respective task of storing energy or converting voltage and thus of limited overall complexity. In practice, one converter unit and one energy supply unit of the system according to the present disclosure may often be provided at even lower cost than a known mobile unit comprising a voltage converter and an energy store. Particular high savings result from the system according to the present disclosure if only one converter unit and two energy storage units are used in the system according to the present disclosure instead of two known mobile units with voltage converter and energy store.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Typically, in the system according to the present disclosure, the energy stores are each connectable to the input of the voltage converter via a connection cable leading from the respective storage unit to the converter unit. Such a connection cable provides for a certain flexibility with respect to relative positioning of the storage unit with respect to the converter unit.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It will be understood that, as a rule, at least one charging unit is present in the system according to the present disclosure, to which the energy stores are alternately connectable. As a general rule, this charging unit is stationary, in contrast to the at least one converter unit and the at least two storage units.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The energy stores of the at least two storage units may either include an electric battery, or a fuel cell and a fuel reservoir. In other words, the respective energy store may either be an electric battery or a so called fuel cell battery. In both cases, the energy store, as a whole, is an electrochemical energy store.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Independently on the design of the energy stores of the storage units as electric batteries or fuel cell batteries, the converter unit may be the same, i.e. suitable both for usage with storage units comprising electric batteries and for usage with storage units comprising hydrogen batteries.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The fuel reservoir of the fuel cell batteries is preferably a metal hydride store to be able to store hydrogen as fuel for the low-emission operation of the fuel cell at as little pressure as possible. In the system for ground power supply of aircraft according to the present disclosure, the long filling times of a metal hydride store are no problem due to the higher number of storage units as compared to the number of converter units.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">If the energy stores of the at least two storage units each comprise an electric battery, the energy stores may each be connectable to the charging unit via the first connection cable via which the energy stores are also connectable to the voltage converter, or via a second connection cable, wherein the respective connection cable leads from the storage unit to the charging unit. Further, the at least one charging unit may be configured for an input side connection to a local or public power grid.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">If, on the other hand, the energy stores of the at least two storage units each comprise a fuel cell and a fuel reservoir, it is preferred if the charging unit is not only provided for refilling the fuel reservoir but also for regenerating the fuel cell. Often, fuel cells can be regenerated with respect to their efficiency by subjecting them to a certain sequence of voltages. Correspondingly, the charging unit is preferably configured for applying such a sequence of voltages to the respective fuel cell. It will be understood that the storage units of the system for ground power supply of aircraft according to the present disclosure, as a rule, do not only comprise a single but several fuel cells, typically a so-called fuel cell stack such that they can provide sufficient electric power.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Independently on whether the storage units include electric batteries or full cell batteries, the at least two mobile storage units of the system according to the present disclosure may each be devoid of voltage converters, particularly devoid of voltage converters for electric power output by the energy stores and, in case of an electric battery as an energy store, also for electric power to be fed into the battery for charging it.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Storage units of the system for ground power supply of aircraft according to the present disclosure, which are suitable for application in a commercial airport, have storage capacities in the range from 20 kWh to 300 kWh. More particular, storage units with storage capacities between 80 kWh and 100 kWh are usable without permanent exchange but nevertheless quickly rechargeable and available at acceptable cost.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The at least one converter unit of the system according to the present disclosure may be completely devoid of energy sources for the ground power supply of one of the aircraft. This does, however, not exclude that the converter unit has a buffer store at the input of the voltage converter, like for example a dc voltage link having a high electric capacity to bridge an exchange of a storage unit with exhausted energy store for a storage unit with a fresh energy store. However, as a rule, the converter unit does not comprise an electrochemical energy store for the ground power supply of one of the aircraft. On the other hand, also as a rule, the converter unit will comprise an electrochemical energy store for supplying a controller of the converter unit and the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In order to allow for a trouble-free change between different storage units during ground power supply of an aircraft by means of the converter unit, the at least one converter unit of the system according to the present disclosure may comprise a alternating switch which alternately connects two connectors, which are each provided for one of the at least two storage units, to the input of the voltage converter of the at least one converter unit. Herein, the connection of the respective aircraft via the supply cable to the converter unit persists which is at any time connected to one of the storage units via a respective first connection cable and temporarily even to both of the least two storage units.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Because commercial aircraft typically have an onboard grid of an alternating voltage of 400 Hz, the voltage converter of the at least one converter unit typically has an inverter which outputs a supply alternating voltage of typically 400 Hz for the ground power supply of one of the aircraft.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The absolute number of the converter units and the storage units of a system according to the present disclosure will typically be higher than 1 and 2, respectively. This means that the at least one mobile converter unit, as a rule, is one of several equal or even identical mobile converter units of the system, and the at least two mobile storage units, as a rule, are two of many equal or even identical mobile storage units of the system, wherein per each converter unit of the several equal or even identical mobile converter units, as a rule, two of the storage units of the many equal or even identical mobile converter units are provided. In a same way, the at least one charging unit may be one of several equal or even identical charging units of the system, wherein per each converter unit of the several equal or even identical mobile converter units one of the charging units of the several equal or even identical charging units may be provided.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">With respect to their first and second vehicle chassis, the converter units and the storage units may comply with a local standard of vehicle chassis of units which are movable in the surroundings of the aircraft on the ground. In any case, the first and second vehicle chassis of the converter units and the storage units may generally be equal or even identical.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now in greater detail to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an aircraft <b>1</b> at a ground <b>2</b> which is supplied with power via a supply cable <b>3</b>.
