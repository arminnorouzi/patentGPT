2021-109245, filed on Jun. 30, 2021, the disclosure of which including the specification, drawings and abstract is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a rotary reciprocating driving actuator.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the related art, a rotary reciprocating driving actuator is used as an actuator used for a scanner such as a multifunctional device and a laser beam printer. To be more specific, rotary reciprocating driving actuators perform optical scanning of an object by changing the reflection angle of laser light by rotating the mirror of the scanner back and forth.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">PTL 1 discloses a rotary reciprocating driving actuator of this type using a galvano motor. Various types of galvano motors are known, including the type with the structure disclosed in PTL 1 and the coil movable type in which the coil is attached to the mirror.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">PTL 1 discloses a beam scanner in which four permanent magnets are provided on a rotating shaft to which a mirror is attached, so as to be magnetized in the radial direction of the rotating shaft, and a core with magnetic poles around which coils are wound is positioned across the rotating shaft.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">PTL 1</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Patent Publication No. 4727509</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In coil-movable rotary reciprocating driving actuators, heat generated by the coil during drive may adversely affect the surface condition of the mirror, the mirror's connection to the axis of rotation, and the mirror's shape, including warpage. In addition, in coil-movable rotary reciprocating driving actuators, it is difficult to increase the input current to the coil in consideration of the heat generated by the coil when energized, making it difficult to increase the size and amplitude of the mirror, which is the movable object. In addition, the wiring to the coil needs to be drawn out to the fixed body of the mirror, which is a movable object, making assembly difficult.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In PTL 1, the magnet is positioned on the movable body side. Although this eliminates the problem with the coil movable type described above, in order to keep the magnet stationary in a neutral position with respect to the core, i.e., to position the switching portion of the magnet's poles in the center of the core, two magnets per pole of the core, for a total of four poles, are required.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, compared to a similar rotary reciprocating driving actuator using, for example, two magnets, the amplitude of the movable body becomes smaller, i.e., the swing range is reduced. In addition, since at least four magnets are used, the number of parts is large and the configuration is complex, making assembly difficult.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In recent years, there has been a growing demand for rotary reciprocating driving actuators for scanners that are rigid, shock- and vibration-resistant, easy to assemble, and can achieve higher amplitudes, in anticipation of larger mirrors, which are moving parts.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In PTL 1, in the core, a protruding pole-type yoke, a plurality of slots, which are magnetic poles, are arranged parallel with each other and protrude from each of the tips of the coil-wound portion, bent in a direction facing each other, so as to sandwich a magnet on the rotating shaft. In the case of a core with a complex shape such as a protruding pole-type yoke, machining is time-consuming and the cost of the device itself is high.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An object of the present invention is to provide a rotary reciprocating driving actuator that can drive the movable object at a high amplitude and is easy to assemble while ensuring the rigidity of the core and reducing production cost.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">To achieve the above-mentioned object, a rotary reciprocating driving actuator of an embodiment of the present invention includes: a movable member including a shaft part to which a movable object is connected and a magnet fixed to the shaft part; and a fixing body including a core assembly including a magnetic pole core with an integral structure including a plurality of magnetic poles, a plurality of coils disposed next to the plurality of magnetic poles, and a magnetic path core to which the magnetic pole core is assembled, wherein the core assembly is disposed such that the plurality of magnetic poles faces an outer periphery of the magnet, wherein a magnetic flux that passes through a magnetic path configured of the magnetic path core and the magnetic pole core of the integral structure is generated through energization of the plurality of coils, and the movable member is rotated back and forth around an axis of the shaft part through electromagnetic interaction of the magnetic flux and the magnet.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the present invention, it is possible to drive the movable object at a high amplitude and is easy to assemble while ensuring the rigidity of the core and reducing production cost.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0010" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating an external appearance of a rotary reciprocating driving actuator of an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the rotary reciprocating driving actuator;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a left side view illustrating a configuration of a main part of a driving part of the rotary reciprocating driving actuator;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a configuration of a core assembly;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a left perspective view illustrating a configuration of a core part of a core member;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an exploded view of the core part illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an operation of a magnetic circuit of the rotary reciprocating driving actuator;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an operation of the magnetic circuit of the rotary reciprocating driving actuator;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a main part of a scanner system using the rotary reciprocating driving actuator;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a configuration of a core assembly of Modification <b>1</b>;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a state where is a first case is detached from a coil member in Modification <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a perspective view of the first case of Modification <b>1</b>;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a configuration of a core assembly of Modification <b>2</b>;

In addition, it suffices that the coil is configured to favorably generate a magnetic flux from one side to the other of the magnetic pole part of the core when it is energized.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0121">Further, while rotation angle position holding part <b>48</b> provided at fixing body <b>20</b> is attached to bridge part <b>423</b> of magnetic path core <b>42</b> in core assembly <b>4</b>, this is not limitative, and it may be provided to other components of fixing body <b>20</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>.
