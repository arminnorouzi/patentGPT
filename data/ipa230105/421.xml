No. 62/938,061, filed Nov. 20, 2019, and entitled &#x201c;ELECTRODE FOR ELECTROENCAPHALOGRAPHY&#x201d;, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to electrodes used in the acquisition of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Surface electroencephalography makes it possible to measure the variations of diffuse electric potentials on the surface of the skull of a subject. These variations of electrical potentials are commonly referred to as electroencephalographic signals or EEG signals.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Extracting a reliable EEG signal, given the very small amplitude of the electrical potential variations to be measured (i.e. of the order of a few microvolts), drives development of surface EEG equipment that improves conductivity between sensors and the scalp. One obstacle to that improved contact can be condition (i.e. length, thickness and style) of the hair of the subject, which can significantly affect the impedance experienced by the measured electrical potentials.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To address the issue of signal reliability, some surface EEG devices are equipped with gel electrodes, in which contact is made through a gel or conductive liquid, which easily seeps through the user's hair to reach the scalp. The electrode itself is generally made of metal. The gel makes it possible to reduce the electrical impedance and thus the interference with surrounding signals without requiring physical contact between the electrode and the scalp. This solution provides good conductivity at any point of the scalp. Technical assistance is however required to ensure appropriate electrode placement, which in turn is time-consuming (since the gel must be applied and the conductance checked individually for each electrode).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In certain cases, the electrode includes circuitry (in addition to the metal &#x201c;sensor&#x201d; itself). This circuitry may process the analog signal coming from the sensor to amplify the electrical potentials captured at the sensor before that signal is routed to other electronic components. Such electrodes are termed the &#x201c;active&#x201d; wet electrodes. Amplification, in this context, means that a component strongly drives the voltage on a line to the level coming from the sensor. After amplification, the signal is less susceptible to interference as it is conveyed to the other components, before conversion (from analog to digital). The greater the impedance (due to hair condition, for example), the weaker the signal (in terms of driving voltage on the line) so this amplification circuitry can be essential for proper functioning even with gel.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The use of gel limits the duration of use of the device to a few hours (since the contact is no longer assured as the gel dries). In many cases, the conductive liquid or gel leaves a residue in the hair after the use of the EEG system, this can be difficult to remove.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">More recently, surface electroencephalographs equipped with so-called &#x201c;active dry&#x201d; electrodes have been introduced: the electrodes being termed &#x201c;dry&#x201d; because they require no gel or other conductive liquid. Active dry electrodes operate by capturing the variations of electrical potential signals on the surface of the scalp, and then amplifying those signals (in some cases also filtering the signals). The analog signals thus obtained are then converted into digital signals by means of one or more analog-to-digital converters controlled by a microcontroller. The microcontroller receives the data for analysis, storage and/or onward transmission to another device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In active dry electrodes, the contact with the scalp is through solid conducting elements or &#x201c;sensors&#x201d; connected to an electronic circuit to overcome the increase in impedance (compared to impedance in the presence of gel). The active dry electrode facilitates signal capture comparable to that of a gel electrode but also allows filtering and/or amplification of the captured signals, and thus an improved signal-to-noise ratio.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Stable access to the scalp limits the reliability of the signal capture. The shape of the sensors is restricted by the need for contact that extends through the hair of the subject.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is known to provide pin-style active dry sensors (in a conductive polymer material) that require the application of significant pressure to reach the user's scalp. Such sensors are, due to the application of pressure at the interface of scalp and sensor pin, very uncomfortable, especially for prolonged use.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Known systems in the medical or related research fields generally include an unflattering cap, often of elastic or waterproof fabric, with attachment locations for receiving individual sensors/electrodes. Electronic circuits are then connected to the electrodes and to the housing of an acquisition chain (i.e. an assembly of connected components used in acquiring the EEG signals). The EEG device is thus typically formed of three distinct elements that the operator/exhibitor must assemble at each use. Again, the nature of the EEG device is such that technical assistance is desirable if not essential.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, user acceptability of the EEG device (and its electrodes) places aesthetic constraints, as well as constraints in comfort and ease of use. In many cases, these constraints are an effective significant barrier to the adoption of EEG technology. Examples of applications where comfort over prolonged use and the need for technical assistance prevent adoption include applications such as video games, training (e.g. for health and safety or flight simulation), sleep aids, etc.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is therefore desirable to provide electrodes for EEG devices that address the above challenges.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present disclosure relates to active dry electrodes that provide a balance of excellent signal quality, ease of use, comfort for the user and design freedom.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a first aspect, the present disclosure relates to a sensor of an EEG device for measuring electrical signals generated by the neuronal activity of a subject, the sensor having at least one blade-like (i.e. lamellar) contact surface, the contact surface having a curved profile in a plane transecting the scalp, the curved profile being convex locally normal to the scalp.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The electrode arrangement of the present disclosure passes through the hair (deflecting or parting the strands of hair) to expose the scalp to the linear contact surface, while improving the comfort. Rather than creating very localized pressure points on the scalp, the comb-like electrode arrangement enables the distribution of pressure over one or more linear patches, while naturally parting the hair to reduce the depth of hair between the sensor and the scalp and increasing the contact surface.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Conveniently, the blades of the sensor are arranged in parallel so that the act of settling the electrode arrangement over the correct portion of the head of the subject with a natural combing action along the axis of the ridges of the sensor blades (preferably in the same direction as the local hair implantation) rakes the hairs apart without significant discomfort.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to one or more embodiments, the edge-to-edge spacing between neighboring sensor blades is greater than 2 mm, to allow the hair to pass. Advantageously, said spacing is less than 50 mm, advantageously less than 10 mm in order not to lose precision. For example, said spacing is between 2 mm and 6 mm.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a second aspect, the present disclosure relates to an active dry electrode including an electronic circuit and a sensor as described above, the electronic circuit being arranged to filter and amplify the electrical signals detected by the sensor.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a third aspect, the present disclosure relates to an EEG device incorporating at least one active dry electrode as described above.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to one or more embodiments, the EEG device further including: an electronic signal processing chain, the chain comprising one or more analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) configured to transform the signals received from the electronic filtering and amplification circuits into digital signals; and a microcontroller for transmitting to an external processing unit and/or storing said digital signals.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">To easily identify the discussion of any particular element or act, the most significant digit or digits in a reference number refer to the figure number in which that element is first introduced.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an electronic architecture for receiving and processing EEG signals according to the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrate side and end views of an example of a sensor according to the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a further view of an exemplary sensor within a resiliently deformable support mount assembly according to the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a schematic arrangement of an active dry electrode according to the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of an electronic architecture for the reception and processing of EEG signals by means of an EEG device <b>100</b> according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">To measure diffuse electric potentials on the surface of the skull of a subject <b>110</b>, the EEG device <b>100</b> includes a portable device <b>102</b> (i.e. a cap or headpiece), analog-digital conversion (ADC) circuitry <b>104</b> and a microcontroller <b>106</b>. The portable device <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes one or more active dry electrodes <b>108</b>, typically between 1 and 128 electrodes, advantageously between 2 and 64, advantageously between 4 and 16.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each active electrode <b>108</b> comprises a sensor for detecting the electrical signals generated by the neuronal activity of the subject and an electronic filtering and amplifying circuit.

The reference electrode or electrodes are preferably positioned in contact with the user's head in a region remote from that of the other active electrodes.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The converters <b>104</b> are controlled by the microcontroller <b>106</b> and communicate with it for example by the protocol SPI (&#x201c;Serial Peripheral Interface&#x201d;). The microcontroller <b>106</b> packages the received data for transmission to an external processing unit (not shown), for example a computer, a mobile phone, a virtual reality headset, an automotive or aeronautical computer system, for example a car computer or a computer system. airplane, for example by Bluetooth, Wi-Fi (&#x201c;Wireless Fidelity&#x201d;) or Li-Fi (&#x201c;Light Fidelity&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In certain embodiments, each active electrode <b>108</b> is powered by a battery (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The battery is conveniently provided in a housing of the portable device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In certain embodiments, each active electrode <b>108</b> measures a respective electric potential value from which the potential measured by the reference electrode (Ei=Vi&#x2212;Vref) is subtracted, and this difference value is digitized by means of the ADC <b>104</b> then transmitted by the microcontroller <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> respectively illustrate a side view and a cross-section of a sensor (i.e. a solid conducting element of an active dry electrode) in accordance with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The sensor is formed in an electrically conductive material (such as a conductive polymer). Conveniently, the sensor includes an embedded metal plate <b>204</b>, the metal plate providing additional mechanical reinforcement. The sensor is shaped to include a curved contact surface <b>202</b>: in use, the contact surface establishes a physical contact with the scalp of the subject <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As may be seen from the side views <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the contact surface has a curved profile, the curved profile being convex, bowing away from the body of the sensor with a radius of curvature, R (a typical value for R is of the order of tens of millimeters).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> represents a vertical cross-section through the center of the sensor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the sensor has two parallel lobes (or &#x201c;blades&#x201d;) each having the same convex curved profile. In cross-section, each blade is also rounded (with a typical radius of curvature R&#x2032; of around a millimeter, say).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the blades are arranged substantially in parallel, so as to form contacts with the scalp of the subject along a substantially parallel lines when the device is worn. While the conductive blades may be formed of a rigid material, they may also be resiliently deformable by pressure on the scalp of the subject.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">When brought into contact with the scalp, the contact surfaces <b>202</b> of each blade bow towards the head (i.e. they are convex in the direction locally normal to the surface of the scalp). This means that the curvature of each blade does not conform to the curvature of the scalp. While a concave blade shape would intuitively facilitate more effective contact along a greater portion of the linear contact surface, empirical study determined that the opposite was true. Two factors appear to determine how effective the contact may be established in reality: the combing effect and the blade tips.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">While a concave blade shape provides tips at each end of the blade which might be imagined to help the sensor blade to part strands of hair, the convex form of blade is observed to part hair effectively with less resistance. Furthermore, the blade tips of a concave sensor blade appear to lift the blade from the scalp at points that are not at the tips, so that rather than distribute pressure along the blade more evenly (i.e. for better comfort) and maximizing the surface where the blade is in contact with the user's scalp (i.e. for better signals), the concave blade design actually performs worse for user comfort and signal reliability than a convex shape.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A further benefit of a convex sensor blade shape is that it is well-suited to injection molding production using well-known injection techniques (meaning that it is adapted to mass production), provided the sensor blades are formed of a suitably moldable material (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> the sensor blade is manufactured from a conductive polymer: one example being a thermoplastic charged with conductive particles, such as carbon material (fiber, powder or nanotubes)). No additional electrically conductive coating is needed where the whole sensor is made of a conductive polymer.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The sensor in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> is provided with a metal insert <b>204</b>. A metal insert may not always be essential, depending upon the choice of material for the sensor blades and the degree of robustness required. Where present, the metal insert may serve a mechanical function reinforcing the material of the blade. The hardness of the conductive polymer may not be sufficient to provide a robust EEG device alone given the specific size constraints placed on the frame around the electrodes. If needed, the metal insert may also be used for its electrical properties to provide a conductive path from the user's scalp to the electronic circuit.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a sensor mount arrangement <b>300</b> in which a sensor <b>200</b>, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, is mounted within a frame <b>302</b> (or cage). The sensor <b>200</b> is mounted on one or more coil springs <b>304</b> (here, two). The coil spring(s) <b>304</b> and a portion <b>206</b> of the sensor are restricted within the frame <b>302</b>. A further portion of the sensor extends beyond the frame, the sensor blades being provided on the further portion. The coil spring <b>304</b> is compressed within the frame so that the sensor <b>200</b> is urged against a stop in the frame <b>302</b>. The frame <b>302</b> (which may conveniently be made of metal) therefore fastens the sensor <b>200</b> inside the frame <b>302</b> while allowing the sensor <b>200</b> to retract, at least partially, into a recess within the frame when pressure is applied to the sensor blade (i.e. as the sensor blade is brought into contact with the surface of the subject's scalp).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Optionally, the frame <b>302</b> comprises an inner metal cage and an outer plastic frame thereby facilitating the assembly of the electrodes inside the frame. A subsystem comprising the sensor <b>200</b>, the coil springs <b>304</b> and the metal cage can be preassembled and then clipped (e.g. snap-fitted) to the plastic frame. A spring finger may then be soldered onto electrical circuitry of an EEG device to make electrical contact with the metal cage.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In certain arrangements of electrodes for EEG devices, it may be convenient to provide electrodes serving as &#x201c;reference&#x201d; electrodes (which assist in providing a reference level of electrical activity against which measurement may occur).
