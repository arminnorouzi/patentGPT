The two-wheeled motor vehicle <b>100</b> is a vehicle capable of traveling along a corner (curve) of a road by tilting a vehicle body in a turning direction. The vehicle of the present embodiment may be a vehicle such as the two-wheeled motor vehicle <b>100</b>, which can travel around the corner by tilting the vehicle body in the turning direction, and the number of wheels is not limited. Therefore, for example, even a three-wheeled motor vehicle, a four-wheeled motor vehicle or the like is included in the vehicle of the present embodiment, as long as it can travel in the same manner as the two-wheeled motor vehicle <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in FIG.<b>1</b>, a headlamp <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment is mounted on a front part of the two-wheeled motor vehicle <b>100</b>. The headlamp <b>1</b> is a lamp that can irradiate the front of the vehicle with light. The headlamp <b>1</b> includes a low beam lamp unit <b>2</b>, a high beam lamp unit <b>3</b>, and cornering lamps <b>4</b>. In the present embodiment, a pair of cornering lamps <b>4</b> is provided in the right and left direction of the vehicle body, but the present invention is not limited to this configuration. The headlamp <b>1</b> is an example of the vehicle lamp. The high beam lamp unit <b>3</b> is an example of the first lamp. The cornering lamp <b>4</b> is an example of the sub-lamp.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in FIG.<b>2</b>, the headlamp <b>1</b> includes a lamp control unit <b>5</b>. The lamp control unit <b>5</b> is connected to the low beam lamp unit <b>2</b>, the high beam lamp unit <b>3</b>, and the cornering lamps <b>4</b>. The lamp control unit <b>5</b> is configured to control the low beam lamp unit <b>2</b>, the high beam lamp unit <b>3</b>, and the cornering lamps <b>4</b>. The lamp control unit <b>5</b> is also electrically connected to a bank angle sensor <b>6</b>, an external sensor <b>7</b>, a speed sensor <b>8</b>, and the like.

Specifically, the bank angle sensor <b>6</b> is a sensor capable of detecting a tilt angle when the vehicle body of the two-wheeled motor vehicle <b>100</b> is tilted to the left or right with respect to a vertical line. The bank angle sensor <b>6</b> is configured by, for example, a gyro sensor. Note that, the tilt angle of the vehicle body may also be calculated based on an image captured by a camera mounted on the vehicle body, for example.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The external sensor <b>7</b> is configured to detect environmental information outside the vehicle, such as a target object. Specifically, the external sensor <b>7</b> is a sensor that can acquire information on an outside of the own vehicle, including surrounding environment of the two-wheeled motor vehicle <b>100</b> (for example, obstacles, other vehicles (preceding vehicle, oncoming vehicle), pedestrians, road shapes, traffic signs, and the like). The external sensor <b>7</b> is configured by, for example, at least one of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ringing or Laser Imaging Detection and Ranking), a camera, a radar, and the like.

The lamp control unit <b>5</b> is configured to control the low beam lamp unit <b>2</b>, the high beam lamp unit <b>3</b>, and the cornering lamps <b>4</b>, based on the information transmitted from each of the bank angle sensor <b>6</b>, the external sensor <b>7</b>, and the speed sensor <b>8</b>. For example, the lamp control unit <b>5</b> can control the headlamp <b>1</b>, based on the detection results of the bank angle sensor <b>6</b>, the external sensor <b>7</b>, and the speed sensor <b>8</b>, to adjust a light distribution pattern that is formed ahead of the vehicle. That is, the lamp control unit <b>5</b> can control the low beam lamp unit <b>2</b>, the high beam lamp unit <b>3</b>, and the cornering lamps <b>4</b>, based on the detection results of the bank angle sensor <b>6</b>, the external sensor <b>7</b>, and the speed sensor <b>8</b>, to adjust a low beam light distribution pattern, a high beam light distribution pattern and a side light distribution pattern.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">FIG.<b>3</b> is a vertical cross-sectional view showing a schematic configuration of the high beam lamp unit <b>3</b> of the headlamp <b>1</b>.

The lamp control unit <b>5</b> detects a status of the oncoming vehicle CV including presence or absence of the oncoming vehicle CV and an existing position of the oncoming vehicle CV, based on the environmental information acquired by the external sensor <b>7</b>, for example. The existing position of the oncoming vehicle CV includes a distance from the two-wheeled motor vehicle <b>100</b> to the oncoming vehicle, position coordinates of the oncoming vehicle on the virtual vertical screen, and the like.

However, when the external sensor <b>7</b> detects the oncoming vehicle CV, the lamp control unit <b>5</b> may adjust the side light distribution patterns PC by turning off all the individual light sources <b>40</b> of the cornering lamps <b>4</b>.

These window glasses are not limited to glass and may be made of other materials such as resin and vinyl. When the target object is the oncoming vehicle CV, the reference line L is preferably lower than a front window or windshield WS of the oncoming vehicle CV.
