(Control, C. f D. &#x26; Prevention.) Present treatments for CDI consist of oral metronidazole, vancomycin, and fidaxomicin, which is only partly effective as &#x2dc;1 in 6 patients will relapse within two month. The recurrence and spread of CDI is attributed to the spore, which is a robust, metabolically inert form of the bacterium that can withstand various environmental stressors and persist on surfaces for months. The spore is the primary vector for transmission and reinfection. (Paredes-Sabja et al.) There is a need for effective therapeutics that can kill <i>C. difficile </i>and/or prevent formation of the spore. There are no drugs that prevent sporulation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The spore-cortex is a unique layer of peptidoglycan that is assembled through the action of D,D peptidase enzymes known as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). These PBPs are classified as either transpeptidases (TPases), which cross-link peptidoglycan, endopeptidases, and carboxypeptidases (CPases), which hydrolytically shorten the peptidoglycan stem and regulate the degree of cross-linking. Previous studies have found that deleting any of the TPase genes: CDR20291_2544 and CDR20291_1067 or the Cpase genes CDR20291_3056, CDR20291_2048, and CDR20291_1131 disrupts sporulation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). (Dembek et al.) It has previously been shown that &#x3b2;-lactam antibiotics, which bind strongly and irreversibly to PBPs, have potent anti-sporulation properties (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). However, the use of &#x3b2;-lactams for this purpose is not practical as they are causative agents of CDI.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the mid-1990s a novel diazabicyclooctane (DBO) scaffold was discovered that inhibits serine &#x3b2;-lactamases. This scaffold was developed into avibactam, an FDA-approved drug. Because serine &#x3b2;-lactamases are evolutionary descendants of PBPs, the structural arrangement of the active site and catalytic motifs are highly conserved. However, while DBOs possess the covalent machinery to react with PBPs, they are relatively weak inhibitors against most TPases, and are non-bactericidal. Yet, this characteristic makes DBO compounds uniquely suited for targeting PBPs involved in sporogenesis, as it will not disrupt the gut microbiome and can withstand degradation from &#x3b2;-lactamases secreted by enteric bacteria.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure relates to compositions, preparations, and uses of therapeutic agents against bacterial infection.

Moreover, each of the terms &#x201c;by&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprises&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprised of,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; &#x201c;included,&#x201d; &#x201c;involving,&#x201d; &#x201c;involves,&#x201d; &#x201c;involved,&#x201d; and &#x201c;such as&#x201d; are used in their open, non-limiting sense and may be used interchangeably. Further, the term &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; is intended to include examples and aspects encompassed by the terms &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; and &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; Similarly, the term &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; is intended to include examples encompassed by the term &#x201c;consisting of.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to &#x201c;a compound&#x201d;, &#x201c;a composition&#x201d;, or &#x201c;a disorder&#x201d;, includes, but is not limited to, two or more such compounds, compositions, or disorders, and the like.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">It should be noted that ratios, concentrations, amounts, and other numerical data can be expressed herein in a range format. It can be further understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">The term &#x201c;patient&#x201d; refers to a human in need of treatment for any purpose. However, the term &#x201c;patient&#x201d; can also refer to non-human animals, preferably mammals such as dogs, cats, horses, cows, pigs, sheep and non-human primates, among others, that are in need of treatment.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">By &#x201c;prevent&#x201d; or other forms of the word, such as &#x201c;preventing&#x201d; or &#x201c;prevention,&#x201d; is meant to stop a particular event or characteristic, to stabilize or delay the development or progression of a particular event or characteristic, or to minimize the chances that a particular event or characteristic will occur. Prevent does not require comparison to a control as it is typically more absolute than, for example, reduce. As used herein, something could be reduced but not prevented, but something that is reduced could also be prevented. Likewise, something could be prevented but not reduced, but something that is prevented could also be reduced. It is understood that where reduce or prevent are used, unless specifically indicated otherwise, the use of the other word is also expressly disclosed. For example, the terms &#x201c;prevent&#x201d; or &#x201c;suppress&#x201d; can refer to a treatment that forestalls or slows the onset of a disease or condition or reduced the severity of the disease or condition. Thus, if a treatment can treat a disease in a subject having symptoms of the disease, it can also prevent or suppress that disease in a subject who has yet to suffer some or all of the symptoms.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">The term &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; refers to the medical management of a patient with the intent to cure, ameliorate, stabilize, or prevent a disease, pathological condition, or disorder. This term includes active treatment, that is, treatment directed specifically toward the improvement of a disease, pathological condition, or disorder, and also includes causal treatment, that is, treatment directed toward removal of the cause of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder. In addition, this term includes palliative treatment, that is, treatment designed for the relief of symptoms rather than the curing of the disease, pathological condition, or disorder; preventative treatment, that is, treatment directed to minimizing or partially or completely inhibiting the development of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder; and supportive treatment, that is, treatment employed to supplement another specific therapy directed toward the improvement of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">The term &#x201c;therapeutically effective&#x201d; refers to the amount of the composition used is of sufficient quantity to ameliorate one or more causes or symptoms of a disease or disorder. Such amelioration only requires a reduction or alteration, not necessarily elimination.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">The term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; refers to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problems or complications commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">A residue of a chemical species, as used herein, refers to a derivative of a moiety that is present in a particular product. To form the product, at least one atom of the moiety is replaced by a bond to a second moiety, such that the product contains a derivative of a moiety.
