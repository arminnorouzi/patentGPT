For example, in a case where there is a sell order having an order count &#x201c;N&#x201d; with a condition of a minimum contract count &#x201c;M&#x201d;, and there is a buy order having an order count equal to or greater than the order count &#x201c;M&#x201d;, trading is established.

For this reason, in the related art, for example, when the error is included in the order status, matching is performed as it is, and thus there is a problem that a correct contract result may not be obtained.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to one aspect, an object is to provide a non-transitory computer-readable recording medium storing a contract program, a contract method, and an information processing apparatus capable of supporting acquisition of an accurate contract result.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Hereinafter, a non-transitory computer-readable recording medium storing a contract program, a contract method, and an information processing apparatus according to embodiments will be described below with reference to the drawings. In the embodiments, components having the same functions will be denoted by the same reference signs, and redundant description thereof will be omitted. The non-transitory computer-readable recording medium storing the contract program, the contract method, and the information processing apparatus to be described in the embodiments below are merely examples, and are not intended to limit the embodiment. Each embodiment below may be appropriately combined to the degree with which no inconsistency is caused.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">First, a process of obtaining a contract by matching a sell order and a buy order with which the minimum contract count is set by dynamic programming will be described. In a process of specifying an order as a contract target by using dynamic programming, a Bool (T, F) array a is prepared for managing each of the sell order and the buy order, and an order as a contract target that maximizes a contract count is specified.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The Bool (T, F) array a is referred to as an &#x201c;array a&#x201d;. An index i equal to or greater than 0 is set for the array a, and &#x2018;T&#x2019; or &#x201c;F&#x201d; is set for an element corresponding to the index i of the array a. A case where the element corresponding to the index i in the array a is &#x201c;T&#x201d; means that there is an order of an order count i. A case where the element corresponding to the index i in the array a is &#x201c;F&#x201d; means that there is no order of the order count i. &#x201c;T&#x201d; is an example of a registration symbol.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The case where the element of the index i in the array a is &#x201c;T&#x201d; is indicated by a [i]=T. The case where the element of the index i in the array a is &#x201c;F&#x201d; is indicated by a [i]=F.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">An array a storing information on a sell order is referred to as a &#x201c;first array a&#x201d;, and an array a storing information on a buy order is referred to as a &#x201c;second array a&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an explanatory diagram describing a process in a case where a sell order is accepted in dynamic programming, and illustrates a state of the first array a in a case where the sell order is accepted. An information processing apparatus sets a [i+x]=T in a case where a [i]=T and a sell order of an order count x is accepted.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">An initial state of the first array a is illustrated in step S<b>10</b>. In the initial state of the first array a, a [<b>0</b>]=T, and all other elements are &#x201c;F&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a case where a sell order having an order count 3 is accepted, a state of the first array a is as illustrated in step S<b>11</b>. Since the first array a is a [0]=T, the information processing apparatus sets a [0+3]=T.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a case where an order having an order count 5 is accepted, the state of the first array a is as illustrated in step S<b>12</b>. Since the first array a is a [0]=T, the information processing apparatus sets a [0+5]=T. Since the first array a is a [3]=T, the information processing apparatus sets a [3+5]=T.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">An index in which an element of the first array a is T indicates a matchable contract quantity. For example, in the state of the first array a in step S<b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the element of the index i=8 is &#x2018;T&#x2019;, and &#x201c;8&#x201d; is a quantity for which contracts of a total amount of the order count &#x201c;3&#x201d; and the order count &#x201c;5&#x201d; are made.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an explanatory diagram describing a process in a case where a buy order is accepted in dynamic programming, and illustrates a state of the second array a in a case where the buy order is accepted. In the same manner as the process for the first array a in a case where the sell order is accepted described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the information processing apparatus sets a [i+x]=T in a case where a [i]=T and a buy order of the order count x is accepted. In an initial state of the second array a, a [0]=T, and all other elements are &#x201c;F&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, in a case where a buy order having an order count 2, a buy order having an order count 3, and a buy order having an order count 6 are accepted in this order, the state of the second array a is as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For example, a [0]=T, a [2]=T, a [3]=T, a [5]=T, a [6]=T, a [8]=T, a [9]=T, and a [11]=T, and the other elements are &#x201c;F&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The information processing apparatus compares the first array a of the sell orders described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and the second array a described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and specifies a maximum matchable contract quantity.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an explanatory diagram describing a process of calculating a contract count in dynamic programming.

Therefore, with the information processing apparatus <b>100</b>, it is possible to detect an error in a polynomial on a finite field representing an order status, after the update, after the specific order is removed by the division.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">In a case where the error is detected, the information processing apparatus <b>100</b> replaces a specific prime number with another prime number, and then recalculates a polynomial on a finite field. In this manner, with the information processing apparatus <b>100</b>, in a case where the error is detected, by performing recalculation by changing the prime number, it is possible to avoid a case where a coefficient is a false positive in the polynomial on the finite field.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142">It is noted that each component of each apparatus illustrated in the drawings may not be physically configured as illustrated in the drawings.
