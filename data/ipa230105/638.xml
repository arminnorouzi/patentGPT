id="p-0128" num="0127">The disclosure herein is related to SI joint stabilizing implants (&#x201c;implants&#x201d;) and methods of implanting SI joint stabilizing implants across an SI joint from a dorsal approach. Methods herein include implanting an implant from a dorsal approach across the SI joint with a first portion of the implant positioned in the ilium, a second portion of the implant positioned in the sacrum, and a third portion (e.g., a central portion) placed across the SI joint. The implants herein may be sized and configured to be implanted utilizing any of the suitable methods of implantation and delivery tools herein, unless indicated herein to the contrary. Similarly, method of implantation and delivery tools herein may be used to deliver any or all of the suitably configured implants across an SI joint, unless indicated herein to the contrary.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">A region or portion of the ilium into which a first portion of the implant is positioned from a dorsal approach may have greater density than a region or portion of the sacrum into which a second portion or region of the implant is positioned. When positioning a SI joint implant across a SI joint from a dorsal approach, the implant may thus tend to deflect away from denser cortical iliac bone and migrate towards and into the less dense sacrum, which can prevent proper positioning of the implant across the SI joint. Implantation methods, delivery tools and implants are described herein that can maintain proper implant trajectory when advancing the SI joint implant across the SI joint from a dorsal approach described herein. The methods and approaches herein can account for the differences in bone density between the ilium and sacrum and prevent the implant from migrating away from denser iliac bone during implantation. Additionally, implants herein are sized and configured to be safely implanted into a target anatomical region when implanted from the dorsal approaches herein.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Methods of implanting the implants herein may include advancing one or more positioning guides, any of which may be referred to herein as a &#x201c;guide,&#x201d; into an ilium from a dorsal approach, and in some embodiments between lateral and medial cortical walls of the ilium, which is described and shown herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>A</figref> illustrates a posterior view and a general dorsal approach for implanting the SI joint implants herein across an SI joint. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>B</figref> illustrates an exemplary implant <b>1106</b> that has been implanted across an SI joint <b>1114</b>&#x2032; with a first region or portion of the implant disposed in the ilium <b>1110</b>, a second region or portion of the implant disposed in the sacrum <b>1112</b>, and a central region or portion extending across the SI joint <b>1114</b>&#x2032;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>32</b>A and <b>32</b>B</figref>, which are described in more detail below, illustrate ilium <b>1110</b>, sacrum <b>1112</b>, the SI joints <b>1114</b> and <b>1114</b>&#x2032;, and lumbar vertebrae <b>1116</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>A</figref> also illustrates an optional anatomical region <b>1120</b> that is a starting point for advancing an ilium positioning guide into the ilium, and an optional exemplary anatomical region <b>1130</b> for a starting point for advancing a sacrum positioning guide into the ilium. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>A</figref> further illustrates an exemplary and optional ilium starting point <b>1122</b> for an ilium positioning guide, as well as an exemplary and optional sacrum starting point <b>1132</b> for a sacrum positioning guide. Any of the ilium positioning guides herein may have a starting point in ilium region <b>1120</b>, such as ilium starting point <b>1122</b>. Any of the sacrum positioning guides herein may have a starting point in sacrum region <b>1130</b>, such as sacrum starting point <b>1132</b>. A radiographic view image may be obtained and utilized to help guide the positioning guide into the ilium between lateral and medial cortical walls of the ilium, which are illustrated generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>32</b>A and <b>32</b>B</figref>. Methods herein may optionally include interfacing an ilium positioning guide herein with an ilium portion or region of the SI joint implant, such as an interface member of the implant, to guide the implant across the SI joint while maintaining a proper trajectory and achieving a desired implantation location. By positioning an ilium positioning guide in the relatively dense region of the ilium, and by interfacing and engaging the positioning guide with the ilium portion of the implant, the guide can help ensure a portion of or the entire implant will stay on course with a desired trajectory during advancement during implantation in the dorsal approach, rather than migrating away from the relatively dense cortical ilium bone and towards the sacrum. The optional positioning guides herein thus interface directly with the implant, and are sized and configured to act as a guide for the implant to ensure that an ilium portion or region of the implant is properly positioned in the ilium and that a joint region (which may be referred herein as a central region or portion) of the implant is properly implanted across the SI joint.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The positioning guides are sized and configured to, when engaged with the implant, generally restrict movement of the implant with respect to the positioning guide in at least one direction. The implant may be free to move relative to the positioning guide in other ways or directions. For example, once interfaced, the implant may still be able to rotate relative to the guide, such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, but the guide can still maintain the desired trajectory (relative axial movement) of the implant when the implant is advanced in the dorsal trajectory with respect to the engaged guide.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The methods herein include advancing the implant across the SI joint, while the optional guide(s) helps guide an ilium portion of the implant into the ilium. The methods may also include removing the positioning guide from the ilium after the implant has been positioned across the SI joint.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The methods herein may include positioning more than one positioning guide, optionally more than one ilium guide in the ilium, and optionally one or more guides into sacral bone. Any of the one or more guides herein may be sized and configured to function as a positioning guide to help guide a portion of the implant into ilium bone or sacral bone.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In some alternative methods and implants described herein, the method of implantation may not require a position guide. For example, an implant may be advanced across an SI joint from a dorsal approach without using a positioning guide. For example, these methods may include radiographically visualizing a teardrop view of the ilium and advancing the implant while visualizing the teardrop view to ensure a portion of the implant stays sufficiently on course into the teardrop region of the ilium. Any of the methods herein may thus optionally exclude an ilium positioning guide, and may rely on a radiographic image, such as a teardrop view, to help maintain a desired implant trajectory into a teardrop region of the ilium. Implants implanted according to these methods may be implanted with or without a broach (described in more detail below), and if implanted without the use of a broach, the implants may have distal end regions that are configured to penetrate into bone, optionally having sharpened distal ends.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Some of the implants herein, such as any of those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>31</b></figref>, are generally sized and configured to be able to interface with an elongate ilium positioning guide, and may be sized and configured to interface with one or more additional positioning guides, which may be ilium or sacrum guides.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Exemplary implants are described below. Even if the textual description of an exemplary implant does not expressly include it, it is understood that features shown with respect to different exemplary implants may be incorporated into other exemplary implants. For example, the implants shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> each have an interface member with an annular inner surface that defines a lumen, even if the text does not expressly include a description thereof. Additionally, similar components may be similarly labeled in different embodiments. For example, it is understood that references to elements <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, etc., in some of the figures may illustrate systems, even if the text related to any particular embodiment is silent with reference to a reference number shown in the figure.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is an end dorsal view (showing the proximal portion) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a perspective view of exemplary system <b>10</b> that includes SI joint stabilizing implant <b>14</b> and elongate ilium guide <b>12</b>. Implant <b>14</b> includes an ilium guide interface member <b>18</b> interfacing, which may be also referred to herein as engaging, with ilium guide <b>12</b>. Implant <b>14</b> includes main body or implant body <b>16</b>, a central portion or region of which is disposed across the SI joint when the implant is implanted. The interface member <b>18</b> includes a surface <b>19</b> that has a configuration, in this example annular, that is sized and configured to interface with the corresponding configuration of ilium guide <b>12</b> to allow implant <b>14</b> to be axially advanced relative to guide <b>12</b>. In these figures, the guide may or may not already be positioned in an ilium, such as at the exemplary general location shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>A</figref>. The interface between the guide and the interface member of the implant restricts the movement of the implant interface guide member with respect to the ilium guide in one or more directions. In this example, implant <b>14</b> may still be rotated relative to guide <b>12</b>, but the interface restricts, for example, side-to-side (lateral) movement of <b>14</b> implant relative to guide <b>12</b>. In this embodiment, the guide has a cylindrical configuration, with an annular outer profile in cross section along almost all of its length (except for the distal tip region, which may be configured to penetrate and/or anchor (temporarily) into bone). Any of the guides herein may have a cylindrical configuration along all or substantially all of its length. Any of the guides herein may also include a sharpened or pointed distal end (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B, <b>2</b>B, <b>3</b>B</figref>), which may be configured to help penetrate and/or anchor into bone (temporarily), such as iliac bone and/or sacral bone.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In figures herein, including <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>10</b></figref>, &#x201c;S&#x201d; refers to a sacrum and &#x201c;I&#x201d; refers to an ilium.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A</figref> (end view) and <b>2</b>B (perspective) illustrate exemplary system <b>20</b>, which includes implant <b>24</b>, ilium or iliac guide <b>22</b>, and an optional elongate sacrum or sacral guide <b>21</b>. In the figures shown, ilium guide <b>22</b> and the sacrum guide <b>21</b> may or may not yet be positioned within the ilium and sacrum, respectively. In some methods, the one or more guides may be inserted into bone, and then the implant may be advanced over the guides. In some embodiments, the implant is interfaced with the one or more guides, and subsequently the one or more guides can be inserted into bone. Interfacing the implant to a plurality of guides (in examples with more than one guide) before guide insertion may help prevent the guides from being inserted into bone and spaced apart at positions that prevent the implant from then be interfaced with the guides and successfully advanced along the guides and across the SI joint. Interfacing the implant with the guides first may help the guides being properly spaced apart to accommodate the implant during implantation. In merely exemplary embodiments herein, a method may include inserting an ilium guide into iliac bone, interfacing the guide with the implant, interfacing the implant with a sacrum guide, and inserting the sacrum guide into a sacrum. The implant may subsequently be advanced across the SI joint.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Any of the dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>2</b>A, <b>3</b>A and <b>4</b>A</figref> in an implant body indicates an optional axially extending bore or opening within a body portion of the implant, which may extend through distal and proximal implant body surfaces.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A</figref> (end view) and <b>3</b>B (perspective view) illustrate an exemplary system <b>30</b> that includes implant <b>34</b>, which is configured to interface with ilium guide <b>32</b>. Implant <b>34</b> includes guide interface member <b>33</b> that has a surface <b>35</b> sized and configured to interface with guide <b>32</b>, which may be an ilium guide.

Members <b>43</b> and <b>45</b> in this embodiment extend upward and downward from the main body region further than the guide interface members in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, for example.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A</figref> (end view) and <b>5</b>B (perspective view) illustrate an exemplary system <b>50</b> that includes exemplary implant <b>54</b>, and exemplary ilium guides <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> and sacral guides <b>53</b> and <b>55</b>. Implant <b>54</b> includes four guide members <b>56</b>, <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> and <b>59</b>, each configured to interface with and be axially moveable relative to a separate guide. The implant body has a general &#x201c;X&#x201d; or crossing configuration in an end view, but could have other configurations, such as square, rectangular, oval, etc., and may still have four (or more) guide interface members.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A</figref> (end view) and <b>6</b>B (perspective view) illustrate an exemplary system <b>60</b> that includes implant <b>64</b> configured to interface with guide <b>62</b>.

The interface members are generally sized and configured to accommodate relative movement of one or more guides (such as an ilium guide), which are positioned in an ilium or a sacrum. In this way, implants may be moved axially relative to and guided by the positioning guides to the intended implantation location across the SI joint without migrating (or at least minimizing migration) away from the denser iliac bone.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">In some embodiments, the implant may include interface members that are in opposing lateral side regions of the implant, an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>.

Implant <b>1300</b> may include any of the suitable features of other implants herein, such as interfacing members configured to interface with a positioning guide. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref> illustrate implant <b>1300</b>, which is sized and configured for implantation across a SI joint from a dorsal approach. Implant <b>1300</b> includes implant body <b>1302</b> that includes an ilium region or portion <b>1304</b> that is sized and configured for implanting into an ilium when the implant is implanted across a SI joint from the dorsal approach. Implant body <b>1302</b> also includes a sacrum region or portion <b>1306</b> that is sized and configured for implanting into a sacrum when the implant is implanted across the SI joint from the dorsal approach.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">Height, Width and Length directions of the implant are also labeled to provide the relative dimensions of the implant body that are described herein. When the description herein refers to a general dimension (e.g., height, length) of the implant body, it refers to the greatest dimension of the implant body. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, if the disclosure refers to a Height of implant body <b>1302</b>, it refers to the greatest height dimension of the implant body, which in this embodiment is in lateral regions of the implant body. The disclosure herein may also, however, refer to dimension in a particular region of the implant (e.g., central region Height). The relative Distal and Proximal directions are also labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">As shown, ilium region <b>1304</b> includes and defines elongate ilium lumen <b>1305</b> therein that extends from a distal opening to a proximal opening, and is sized and configured to receive therein an ilium positioning guide. In this example, sacrum region <b>1306</b> extends further proximally than the ilium region <b>1304</b> with reference to the Length direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref> illustrates an illustrative SI joint <b>1800</b>, ilium <b>1802</b>, and sacrum <b>1804</b>. Implants herein may be advanced from a dorsal approach and into position across the SI joint, with the ilium region or portion of the implant in the ilium and the sacrum region or portion in the sacrum. The overall implant dimensions and configuration of exemplary implant <b>1300</b> (which may also be referred to herein as the implant outer profile) may provide one or more advantages when implanting the implant across the SI joint from the dorsal approaches described herein. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>38</b>, <b>39</b>A and <b>39</b>B</figref>, the sacrum may extend further proximally than the ilium, relative to the delivery trajectory. With implants that have an ilium region that extends as far proximally as a sacrum region, the ilium region of the implants may extend too far posteriorly when implanted, such that they are extending out of the ilium. Ilium region <b>1304</b> does not extend as far proximally as sacrum region <b>1306</b>, such that when implanted there is less risk that the ilium region <b>1304</b> will extend outside of the ilium. The proximal end of the implant body in this example includes optional stepped region or portion <b>1308</b> between a sacral side and an ilium side of the implant body <b>1302</b>, and in this example optionally includes three flat surfaces (shown in the top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>), the central of which is tapered and extends further distally in the ilium portion of implant body. The tapered surface in this example extends between proximal sacrum and ilium surfaces that are orthogonal to a long axis of the implant (as shown), and are described in more detail with respect to an impactor, an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b> and <b>36</b></figref>. In alternative implants, the proximal end may be a combination of one or more flat or curved surfaces, additional examples of which are described below.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">Alternatively, implant <b>1300</b> may have a distal end in which ilium region <b>1304</b> extends further distally than sacrum region <b>1306</b>, some examples of which are described below. For example, the configuration of implant body <b>1302</b> may approximate a general parallelogram shape that does not comprise four right angles, such as a rhomboid or rhombus configuration (in a top view of the implant). Implants for which sacrum regions do not extend as far distally as the ilium region may provide an advantage of preventing the sacrum region <b>1306</b> from being advanced too far distally in the patient, which may mitigate a risk of damaging tissue distal to the desired implantation location. Some implants herein thus may have ilium and sacrum regions that do not extend as far proximally or as far distally as one another, which may provide the exemplary advantages set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">Implant body <b>1302</b> is an example of an implant body that has a height dimension that is less than a width dimension, as shown. Implant body <b>1302</b> also includes a sacrum region <b>1306</b> that includes an optional elongate sacrum lumen <b>1307</b> therein that extends from a distal opening to a proximal opening and is sized and configured to receive therein a sacrum positioning guide (such as any of the sacrum guides herein). In this example, sacrum lumen <b>1307</b> has a length that is greater than a length of ilium lumen <b>1305</b>, but in alternatives in which the sacrum region does not extend as far distally as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, the lumens may have lengths that are the same or substantially the same. In this example, sacrum lumen <b>1307</b> is parallel to the ilium lumen <b>1305</b>. The term parallel in this disclosure can include a very minor deviation from being strictly parallel, such as lumens or sides with corresponding axes that intersect at an angle that is five degrees or less, for example. Ilium lumen <b>1305</b> is also parallel to a longitudinal (&#x201c;long&#x201d;) axis of the implant body, with the long axis in this example extending in the length direction.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">As is set forth herein, the outer profile of the implant body is important to ensure the implant is positioned at a target implant location and generally within a patient's target anatomical envelope. A target envelope refers generally to an anatomical volume that is the target location for the implant, which may vary from patient to patient due to anatomical variability. For example, some implant configurations mitigate a risk of extending too far proximally out of the ilium, as described above. Additionally, some implant outer profiles may mitigate a risk of extending too far distally, such as too far distally in the sacrum and potentially damaging sensitive tissue. As such, the implant body generally has dimensions and profiles sized and configured to avoid these potential problems. The target envelope may optionally be characterized by two dimensional (2D) spaces and/or a three dimensional (3D) space. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>39</b>A, <b>39</b>B, <b>39</b>C and <b>39</b>D</figref> illustrate exemplary views that illustrate exemplary 2D spaces with exemplary dimensions that partially characterize exemplary target envelopes. As shown, there can be some patient-to-patient variability in sacral bone shape, iliac bone shape, and SI joint shape. While some implant shapes herein may be able to treat a wide range of patients, it may optionally be beneficial to customize an SI joint implant for a particular patient, such as by customization of one or more dimensions (e.g. angles), and/or the outer profile of the implant. A customization process can include characterizing the target envelope, such as obtaining one or more 2D views (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>39</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref>) and/or constructing a 3D image of the target envelope, and designing or selecting an implant (optionally from a kit of implants with at least some different dimensions and/or outer profiles, for example) based on the target envelope characterization. For example, a patient from which the image in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b>D</figref> is obtained may optionally be treated with an implant herein where ilium regions and sacrum regions extend to the same distal extent (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> or <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B</figref>), whereas a patient from which the image in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b>B</figref> is obtained may optionally be treated with an implant with a configuration that more closely approximates the general rhomboid 2D space annotated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b>D</figref>, such as (without limitation) any of the implants in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>A, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>A</figref>, or <b>23</b>A).</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">The implant bodies herein may have a length from 15 mm to 80 mm (an example length of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, as &#x201c;Length (implant body)&#x201d;). For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, the greatest proximal extent of implant body <b>1302</b> is in sacrum region <b>1306</b>, and the greatest distal extent of implant body <b>1302</b> is in both sacrum region <b>1306</b> and ilium region <b>1304</b>.

In any of the embodiments herein, the implant body may have a height from 4 mm to 15 mm in at least a portion of the implant (such as one or both of an ilium region or a sacrum region), and the height may also vary across the width of the implant body, an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> illustrates an approximated shape of the implant body in a top view, including angles beta (the angle between the proximal end and the sacrum side of the approximated shape) and alpha (the angle between the ilium side and the distal or front end of the approximated shape). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>39</b>A-<b>39</b>D</figref> also include exemplary angles alpha and beta for exemplary envelopes for particular patients. In some embodiments, the implant and/or the approximated shape (an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>) may have an angle beta from 30 degrees to 85 degrees, including any subrange therein. In some more particular embodiments, the angle beta may be from 35 degrees to 80 degrees. In some embodiments, the angle alpha may be from 30 degrees to 90 degrees. The angle alpha may be slightly greater than 90 degrees (e.g., 90.2 degrees) and still be considered to be within the range from 30 degrees to 90 degrees, including any subrange therein. In some particular embodiments, angle alpha may be from 40 degrees to 90 degrees. It is understood that implants herein may have one or more right angles, such as having a rectangular shape in the top view (e.g., square).

In any of the embodiments herein, a surface area of a top portion and/or a bottom portion of the implant body may be from 400 to 3,000 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">As mentioned above, in some non-limiting embodiments the implant body have a quadrilateral configuration, such as a parallelogram configuration without right angles (e.g., rhomboid or rhombus), with the ilium portion extending further distally than the sacrum portion, and the sacrum portion extending further proximally than the ilium portion, many examples of which are shown and described herein.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">In some embodiments, the implant body may have a quadrilateral shape (in a top view) with one or more right angles, such as a rectangle or square. For example, an implant body herein may have a rectangular shape with a sharpened distal region, an example of which is shown with implant <b>70</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>-<b>26</b></figref> illustrate exemplary implant bodies with a quadrilateral shape or configuration, without any right angles.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, implant body <b>1302</b> optionally has a height that is not constant across a width of the implant. In this example, the height is greater in at least a portion of the ilium and sacrum portions than in the central portion.

Implant body <b>1302</b> is an example of an implant body that has a wafer or wafer-like configuration. The height dimension of any implant body herein may be not more than 70% of a width dimension of the implant body, not more than 65%, not more than 60%, not more than 55%, not more than 50%, not more than 45%, not more than 40%, not more than 35%, not more than 30%, not more than 25%, not more than 20%, not more than 15%, or not more than 10% of the implant body width. Implants herein are implanted across an SI joint from a dorsal approach, and if the implant body height is too great, the implant body may undesirably extend outside of the joint when implanted.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">Wafer implants herein, may however, have relatively larger heights than those described in the ranges herein (absolute and/or relative) and may be able to safely stabilize and/or fuse an SI joint. For example, the implant bodies herein may be able to safely stabilize the SI Joint even if the height dimension is, for example, not more than 80% of the width dimension.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">Implant body <b>1302</b> is also an example of a SI joint implant body wherein the ilium lateral side of the implant body has a length that is different than a length of the sacrum lateral side of the implant body. In this example, the ilium lateral side is shorter than the length of the sacrum lateral side, as shown. The lengths of the lateral sides in this context refers to the lengths of the lateral sides of the implant body, example of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> as &#x201c;Length (ilium lateral side,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Length (sacrum lateral side&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">Implant body <b>1302</b> also includes a distal end region <b>1310</b> (which in this example is not the furthest distal extent of the entire implant body) that is sized and configured for one or more of penetrating through bony tissue as the implant is advanced or reducing the likelihood that the implant deviates from the intended trajectory. For example, distal end region <b>1310</b> is an example of a sharpened distal end at least a portion of which extends laterally inward or centrally relative to lateral sides of the implant, the sharpened distal end configured to help penetrate or cut through bony tissue as the implant is advanced. Additionally, end region <b>1310</b> has an optional concave curved configuration that can reduce the likelihood that the implant deviates from its intended trajectory when being distally advanced during implantation. A concave curved configuration (an example of which is shown in the top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>) may be thought of as helping self-center the implant across the SI joint as the implant is being advanced. The degree of curvature may vary along the curve, as is shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>. The curve may be symmetrical about a long axis of the implant (even if the degree of curvature varies), of the curve may be asymmetrical about a long axis of the implant (such as if the ilium and sacrum regions have distal ends that do not extend distally to the same point, examples of which are described below). The sharpened distal end in this example has a tapered configuration, as shown, with a first surface tapering downward and distally from a top portion or surface of the implant body, and a second surface tapering upward and distally from a bottom portion or surface of the implant body, as shown. A sharpened region as that phrase is used herein does not require a configuration with a knife's edge, but rather may be a region with surfaces that taper towards one another or other configurations that facilitate cut or penetrating through bony tissue.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">In this example, the sacrum and ilium lateral sides of the implant body extend further distally than distal region <b>1310</b> (distal region <b>1310</b> includes a central region of implant body), but in other embodiments the sacrum lateral side may not extend further distally than distal region <b>1310</b>. The curvature of region <b>1310</b>, in a top view, may optionally be symmetrical about a long axis of the implant body (such as is shown in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>), which may help maintaining the implant trajectory. Distal end region <b>1310</b> also extends laterally across a central region of the implant, wherein the central region is laterally inward relative to lateral sides of the implant body. A long axis of the implant body may extend through sharpened distal end region <b>1310</b>.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">Implant distal region <b>1310</b> is an example of a front region of the implant that has at least one surface sized and configured to at least help maintain the implant trajectory when implanted across the SI joint from a dorsal approach. In this example the region has an inwardly curved configuration. In this context, the term front, or forward, refers to the portion of the implant body that will typically engage tissue when the implant is advanced along a direction of implantation. The &#x201c;front&#x201d; of the implant body thus may extend laterally across the entire distal end of the implant body, and thus some front portions of the implant body (e.g., a central front portion) may be disposed proximally relative to other front regions of the implant. Distal region <b>1310</b> is an example of a front portion of implant body, at least a portion of which is proximal relative to distal ends of the ilium lateral side and the sacrum lateral side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">Alternatively, any of the implant bodies may have sacrum and ilium portions that have distal ends with surfaces that are configured to compress the SI joint as the implant is advanced, such as by having larger diameter regions, or one or more fins.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">The central portion of implant bodies herein refers to a portion or region of the implant body that, in a top view of the implant, is laterally central or inward relative to lateral sides of the implant body, at least a portion of which is adapted or intended to be disposed in the SI joint when implanted. A long axis of the implant body may pass through central portions of implants herein. A central portion generally includes a lateral midpoint of the implant body, as measured laterally across one or both of distal and proximal ends of the implant body. Implant bodies herein do not necessarily have exact or definitive demarcations or delineations between an ilium portion and a central portion, or between a sacrum portion and central portion, but rather a central portion may include the portion or region of the implant that will be or is intended to be positioned across an SI joint when the implant body is implanted. In this regard, the use of the phrases ilium portion and sacrum portion herein refers generally to a lateral position of the portion relative to the central portion. For some or any of the implant bodies herein, it is understood that there may be some degree of lateral overlap between a central portion and at least one of the ilium portion and the sacrum portion. The phrase central portion or central region herein can thus refer to a lateral position relative to ilium and sacrum lateral sides of the implant body.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates a proximal and top perspective view of implant <b>1200</b>, which is sized and configured for implantation across an SI joint from the dorsal approaches described herein.

The guide lumens in implant body <b>1202</b> are examples of lumens that have axes that are parallel with each other, which again includes slight deviations from perfectly parallel (e.g., lumen axes intersecting with an angle of five degrees or less therebetween).

Top porous network of interconnected struts <b>1201</b> forms at least a portion of a top portion of the implant body, and lateral side porous network of interconnected struts <b>1209</b> form at least part of the lateral sides of the implant body. In the embodiment, implant body <b>1202</b> includes frame <b>1213</b>, portions of which are connected or coupled by one or more discrete porous network of interconnected struts.

The top and bottom porous networks of interconnected struts each form most of the top and bottom portions, respectively, that, in an end view of the implant, define at least partially curved configurations for the top and bottom portions of the implant. In this example, each of the lateral side porous networks of interconnected struts <b>1209</b> partially define the ilium and sacrum lumens, as shown, and in particular, define a lateral section of each of the lumens, even though the lateral sides of the lumen have openings therein in between the struts.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">Body <b>1202</b> is also an example of an implant body that has a quadrilateral configuration, and in this example has a parallelogram configuration that does not include four right angles.

The disclosure that follows provides merely exemplary and illustrative additional steps that may be incorporated into any of these methods. It is fully understood that these steps are illustrative, may be optional, and are not limiting the general methods set forth herein. It is also fully understood that the order of one or more of the steps set forth herein may be changed. The method steps that follow may refer to one or more delivery devices, examples of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> (e.g., impactor, positioning template, pin guide, guide pins, trephines, etc.). It is understood that the names of these delivery devices are not necessarily limiting, and they instead may be described or characterized by the one or functions they provide during the procedure. For example, a guide pin may instead be considered more generally as a positioning guide or simply a guide for the implant. A parallel pin guide herein may also be referred to as a pin guide herein.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">Methods herein may include one or more steps to ensure a proper trajectory for the implant. The one or more positioning guides (e.g., guide pins) herein may help facilitate the desired trajectory from the dorsal approach. Methods herein may also include one or more steps to properly determine a starting point or location for the one or more positioning guides. The methods herein may further include one or more steps to advance the positioning guides along a proper trajectory, which may help maintain a desired or proper trajectory for the implant when advanced distally relative to the positioning guide(s). Merely exemplary steps that may be performed to position one or more positioning guides and advance an implant in a dorsal approach are set forth below, and are made in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>34</b>A-<b>38</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243">A patient may be positioned in a prone position to facilitate the dorsal approach and dorsal entry. Radiograph imaging may be performed to obtain an A/P (anteroposterior) view of the SI joint region, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b>A</figref>. The inferior joint aspect of the SI joint may be localized. A visual marking may be made on the skin (e.g., with a marker), optionally about 1 cm proximal to the end of the joint, which can generally indicate an implant insertion location, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b>B</figref>. A second visual skin marking may be made, which may be 3 cm long or about 3 cm long, in line with the SI joint bifurcating the transverse skin mark, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b>B</figref>. A skin incision may then be made along the second visual skin marking. An inlet oblique view may then be obtained, which may provide a view of the inferior limb of the articular joint, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b>C</figref>. A positioning template, such as the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>, may be placed in line with the transverse skin visual marking, and as represented in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b>D</figref>. It is of note that the methods herein may use only one positioning guide (e.g., pin), and the methods herein that use three are exemplary. The center hole or aperture in the positioning template may be positioned over the SI joint. The positioning template may be used to properly position one or more guide pins at one or more desired entry or starting point locations, and is illustrated in place in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b>E</figref> (to illustrate the position relative to the view that is shown). Any of the methods herein may further include positioning a guide pin through the positioning template into the Ilium, optionally through an ilium aperture in the template, which may be one or one, two, or three apertures in the template. The guide pin may have a sharpened distal end to help advance the guide pin. A sharp ilium guide pin may be replaced with a blunt ilium pin. The methods herein may further include aligning the pin, optionally in the inlet oblique view, so that it is parallel to the inferior aspect of the SI joint. The pin may be seated in the ilium and advanced, optionally 1 cm or about 1 cm. A lateral view may then be obtained, such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b>F</figref>, and the ilium guide pin may be advanced, such as, for example only, 4 cm or about 4 cm.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">The following steps are understood to be optional, and not all steps may need to be performed depending on the implant and the particulars of the procedure. For example, one or all of the following steps may not be performed if the method does not utilize more than a single guide pin (e.g., an ilium guide pin). The description that follows is made in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>35</b>A-<b>35</b>C</figref>, but it is fully understood that one or more of these steps may occur in combination with one or more of the steps described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>34</b>A-<b>34</b>F</figref>. The methods may further include obtaining an Inlet Oblique View, and the positioning template may be removed from the patient. A pin guide, an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> and labeled parallel pin guide (which can also be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>35</b>A-<b>35</b>C</figref>), may be advanced over the guide pin that is in the ilium. In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>, the longer of the tubes of the pin guide may be advanced over the ilium pin, which can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>A</figref>. The methods herein may include advancing a guide pin (such as a stepped guide pin) into the sacrum through a sacrum guide tube of the pin guide, which can be seen in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>A</figref>. The methods herein may include preparing a hole in the joint through a central lumen of the parallel pin guide, such as by drilling with a trephine through the center hole to a stop, such as into the joint approximately 30 mm, which can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>B</figref>. A broach may be used instead of a drill, for example, and it is understood that any of the methods herein may be performed completely without electrical power (e.g., without power tools). If a trephine is used, the trephine may be removed, a guide pin may be advanced through the central lumen of the pin guide. Performing this optional step may help prevent the pin guide from rotating while placing a sacral trephine. The optional sacral guide pin may be removed and a hole may be prepared in the sacrum, such as by drilling into the sacrum with the trephine, such as about 30 mm, and example of which can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>C</figref>. The methods herein may include removing an optional sacral trephine and placing a blunt pin in the sacrum through the sacrum tube of the pin guide (not shown). The pin guide may be removed, and a central guide pin, if utilized, may be removed. A hole may optionally be prepared in the ilium, such as by drilling with a trephine over the iliac pin, such as up a line (e.g., 30 cm) on the trephine. A broach may alternatively be used without power to prepare an ilium hole. A trephine may be removed from the ilium, and in this merely exemplary embodiment, iliac and sacral guide pins are left behind in the patient to help guide the implant during implantation. It is again noted that any of the methods herein may utilize only one positioning guide (e.g., one guide pin), such as an ilium positioning guide.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">With specific but not limiting reference to exemplary implant <b>1300</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref>, the implant may then be engaged with the guides (e.g., pins) by advancing the lumens <b>1305</b> and <b>1307</b> over the respective guide pins. The ilium portion, which in this example does not extend as far proximally as the sacrum portion, is engaged with the ilium positioning guide and the implant <b>3610</b> is advanced over the pin guides, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref>. An impactor <b>3600</b> (or other similar tool that can be used to advance the implant) can be advanced over the guide pins behind implant <b>3610</b> until it engages the implant at location <b>3620</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b> and <b>36</b></figref>, the distal end of the impactor can have a configuration that is shaped to mate with the configuration of the proximal end of implant <b>3610</b>, and also to allow the impactor to apply a distally directed force to the implant. In this example, the impactor distal end is also stepped to match the configuration of the proximal end of implant <b>3610</b>. Implant <b>3610</b> may include any of the features of any of the implants herein. Impactor <b>3600</b> includes a plurality of pin guides <b>3602</b> as well, sized and configured to receive therein the guide pins <b>3640</b>, which in this embodiment are lumens extending axially along lateral portions of the impactor, as shown. This allows the impactor <b>3600</b> to be advanced over the guide pins and to be aligned with implant <b>3610</b> to facilitate distal advancement of the implant <b>3610</b> by applying a distally directed force on impactor <b>3600</b> (directly or indirectly applying the force). The implant may be advanced to the desired depth by applying the force on the impactor (e.g., with a mallet). The impactor and guide pins may be removed, leaving the implant behind implanted in the patient across the SI joint. A proper implant position may be confirmed, such as shown in the views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>37</b>A, and <b>37</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">It is understood and stated again that the methods of implantation herein may include using as few as one, and optionally two, three or more guide pins.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247">Any of the methods of implantation herein may be performed solely under an inlet radiographic view. Any of the methods of implantation herein may be performed solely under an inlet or inlet oblique radiographic view.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248">Any of the methods of implantation herein may be performed without electric power (e.g., manual power only). Any of the methods of implantation herein may be performed with electric power (e.g., including use of an electric drill for one or more steps, examples of which are set forth herein).</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249">Any of the methods steps herein that include preparing a hole may be performed by drilling a hole. Any of the methods steps herein that include preparing a hole may be performed by manually creating a hole, such as with a broach. Broaches herein may also be used to create a channel within the bones from one guide pin to the other to accept the entire implant.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250">Any of the methods herein may include a removable pin that threads into the sacral tube of the pin guide. This may provide an added advantage of not risking distal advancement beyond a desired location, which may reduce the risk of damaging sensitive tissue.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0251">The disclosure that follows provides additional and exemplary methods and steps that may be included when preparing for the implantation and implanting any of the SI joint implants herein from a dorsal approach. The disclosure that follows describes a merely exemplary method, not all steps of which are necessarily required (and the order of some steps may be changed), and refers generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>40</b>-<b>55</b>B</figref>. Suitable method steps below may, however, be incorporated into alternative methods described herein, and vice versa. An exemplary method of placing a plurality of guide pins may include, in an inlet oblique view such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>, optionally placing a needle in the SI joint, as may occur in an SI joint injection. The method may optionally include injecting a contrast media such as Omnipaque with the needle to ensure the needle is in the SI joint, which can be viewed in, for example, an inlet oblique view and/or a lateral view as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>41</b>A and <b>41</b>B</figref>. As shown in the radiographic view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>A</figref>, the method may include placing an exchange pin along the skin over the sacral promontory. The method may include creating a linear skin marking along the exchange pin, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>B</figref>. Additional skin markings may be made on either side of the SI joint, such as about 2 cm on either side of the SI joint, which may be used for creating an incision, which is described below. The method may include removing the back end of the needle, including the luer lock, and placing a Jamshidi&#x2122; needle over the needle, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b></figref>. The method may include removing the original needle and replacing it with a nitinol wire through the Jamshidi&#x2122; needle and into the SI joint. The Jamshidi&#x2122; may then be removed, leaving the nitinol wire in the SI joint, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0252">The method may also include making an incision along the linear marking between the additional markings that were made on either side of the SI joint, such as an incision about 4 cm in total length (e.g., 2 cm on either side of the joint). The method may also include placing a pin guide over the nitinol wire. Exemplary pin guides are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b> and <b>45</b></figref>, both of which are examples of pin guides that include a plurality of tubes or channels as shown, and are also examples of pin guides that include three tubes, channels, or lumens. In an exemplary method, the center of three channels may be placed over the nitinol wire, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b>A</figref> and the radiographic image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b>B</figref>. Pin guide adjustment may be made under radiographic imaging such as fluoroscopy to obtain the appropriate pin guide positioning. The exemplary pin guide shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref> includes actuators that in this example include knobs that can individually be tightened against one of the three channels or tubes to prevent them from moving axially relative to the pin guide main body. Releasing the engagement can be performed to allow any of the tubes to be individually moved axially relative to the main body, after which time their relative axial positions can again be fixed by rotating the knobs until the threaded element engages the particular tube/channel. A variety of alternative mechanisms to both maintain axial position in a first configuration yet allow for axial movement in a second configuration may also be used. As used herein, any of the pin guide tubes may also be referred to herein as pin guide channels, both of which are understood to define a pin guide lumen therethrough.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0253">The method may also include placing a sacral tube of the pin guide down to sacral bone. The sacral-side knob may then be tightened to secure the sacral tube of the pin guide on the sacrum. The method may include placing a pin (e.g., a 3.2 mm pin) through the sacral tube of the pin guide through sacral cortex, but not to depth. The pin may be positioned through the sacral cortex with a mallet, for example, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0254">The method may also include distally advancing an ilium tube of the pin guide down and into contact with iliac bone, which may be performed before or after the sacral tube is advanced distally to sacral bone. The ilium-side knob on the pin guide may then be tightened to secure the ilium tube of the pin guide on the ilium. The method may include placing a pin (e.g., a 3.2 mm pin) through the ilium tube of the pin guide through ilial cortex, but not to depth, which may be performed before or after the sacrum pin is advanced through sacral cortex. The ilium pin may be positioned through the ilial cortex with a mallet, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b>A</figref> and the radiographic image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b>B</figref>. At this exemplary embodiment, guide pins are positioned in both the sacrum and ilium (which may be positioned therein in either order).</p><p id="p-0256" num="0255">The method may include providing or taking a lateral image, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>49</b>A and <b>49</b>B</figref>, and distally driving the sacrum and ilium pins (in either order, or only one pin if the procedure utilizes only a single pin) to depth in the lateral view. The method may preferably include not distally advancing the guide pins passed the alar line, as shown. At this time, the elongate guiding wire (e.g., nitinol wire) may be removed from the optionally center channel of the pin guide.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0256">A hole may optionally then be drilled through a center channel of the pin guide, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>. The pin guide may then be removed from the patient, leaving the ilium and sacrum pins in place in the ilium and sacrum, respectively. Ilium and sacrum bone may then be cut or removed using a cutting instrument such as a trephine placed over the ilium and sacrum pins, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>51</b></figref>. Preferably only cortex bone is cut with the cutting instrument.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0257">With guide pins in place in the ilium and sacrum, the SI joint implant can be engaged with the guide pins, details of which are described herein, an exemplary step of which is shown in the radiographic image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>52</b></figref>. The implant is then impacted to depth (e.g., using an impactor such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> or other similar impactor) across the SI joint while being guided by the guide pins, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>53</b>A and <b>53</b>B</figref>, and additional details of which are set forth above. After the implant is delivered to the desired position across the SI joint, the impactor and the guide pins may then be removed, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref> when the guide pins are being removed. An additional lateral view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b>A</figref>) and an outlet view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b>B</figref>) may be obtained to visualize the implant position across the joint.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0258">This exemplary method includes implanting an SI joint implant that comprises larger and fewer fenestrations than the implant in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, which can be seen in the radiographic image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b>B</figref>. This method also includes implanting an implant that includes a proximal region that does not include a sacrum region that extends further proximally than an ilium region, in comparison to the implant in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b>B</figref>, the implant in this embodiment also includes a distal central region with at least some degree of curvature, which is described in more detail above with respect to the implant in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref>.

By allowing more relative movement between the pin <b>6470</b> and body <b>6402</b> in a first state, yet allowing the orientation of the pin <b>6470</b> to be secured relative to the body <b>6402</b> in a second state, the pin <b>6470</b> can first be placed into the joint, and then the orientation of the pin guide body <b>6402</b> can be fine-tuned as desired by moving it relative to the already placed pin. The pin guide body <b>6402</b> can thus be moved relative to the set pin until the body lumens <b>6405</b> and <b>6407</b> are aligned with the desired trajectories for the ilium pin and the sacrum pin, which are subsequently placed as is set forth herein. When the pin guide body <b>6402</b> has been moved to the desired orientation relative to the joint and bones, stabilizer can then be actuated to cause the position of the pin guide body <b>6402</b> to be set in place (or least more secured) relative to the pin and the joint in which the pin is placed. This arrangement thus allows for fine tuning the position and orientation of the guide body relative to the pin and joint after the pin has already been placed in the joint, yet further allows the guide body position to be set once it's been moved into the desired orientation.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0267">In this exemplary embodiment, distal pin <b>6470</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b></figref> may be fastened or coupled to pin guide <b>6400</b> via a spherical ball-and-socket that allows the user to place the pin <b>6470</b> in the joint, and then fine tune the positioning of the sacrum guide portion <b>6406</b> and ilium guide portion <b>6404</b> over the respective bones as described above.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0268">In use, the mounting pin <b>6470</b> may first be placed in the joint in approximately the correct location. The pin guide <b>6402</b> positioning can be further refined by decoupling the mounting pin <b>6470</b> from the pin guide <b>6402</b> by pulling the most proximal knob <b>6460</b> further proximally. The resistance of the ball-and-socket joint can be increased and decreased by turning the threaded stabilizer <b>6465</b> just distal to the proximal knob <b>6460</b>. The sacrum and ilium guide portions <b>6406</b> and <b>6404</b> can be aligned over the respective bones, and the ball-and-socket joint resistance can be increased by turning threaded stabilizer <b>6465</b> clockwise, which limits movement between pin <b>6470</b> and body <b>6402</b>.

In use, pin <b>5860</b> can be rotated (by rotating cap <b>5850</b>) and oriented so that the flat beveled surface is facing laterally and the pointed surface is facing medially. The bevel causes the pin the better engage in the ilium and not skive along the lateral wall of the ilium without engaging the bone. Pin <b>5860</b> can then be docked into ilium bone with a mallet, about 1 cm.
