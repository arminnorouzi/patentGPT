They are widely used because of their advantages of, for example, large capacity, small size and light weight. Lithium-ion batteries cause electrons to flow through an external circuit during a discharge process or a charge process, by means of an electrochemical reaction, so as to allow electrical energy to flow from or into the battery, respectively.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The current collector refers to a structure for collecting current, which mainly refers to a base metal of the positive electrode or negative electrode of the battery for attaching active materials in the lithium-ion batteries, such as copper foil and aluminum foil. Its function is mainly to collect the current generated by the active material of the battery to form a larger current for external output. The current collector is generally fabricated by forming a thick metal plating layer on a conductive substrate film in manner of electroplating, so as to ensure the conductive performance of the current collector. Specifically, a film plating machine can be configured to electroplate the conductive substrate film.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When electroplating the conductive substrate film with a film plating machine, an anode plate can be used as the anode, and the anode plate is generally an insoluble anode. The current anode plate is of an integral structure, and the length of the anode plate is adapted to a breadth specification of the film plating machine, so when the breadth specification of the film plating machine is larger, the length of the anode plate will be longer. However, in such case, the current at both ends of the anode plate is greater than the current in the middle thereof, since the anode plate is connected with the power supply through power access terminals at two ends of the anode plate, which results in a poor consistency of the plating layer on the surface of the conductive substrate film.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The embodiments of the present disclosure disclose an anode plate for a film plating machine and a film plating machine. The anode plate can be applied to film plating machines with different breadths, and can improve the uniformity of the plating layer and meet the consistency requirements of the conductive substrate film.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to achieve the above purpose, in a first aspect, an embodiment of the present disclosure discloses an anode plate for a film plating machine. The anode plate is formed by splicing a plurality of anode plate splicing units, and two adjacent anode plate splicing units are separated by an insulating medium. Each anode plate splicing unit is configured to be connected with the power supply.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The anode plate for the film plating machine provided by the embodiment of the present disclosure can be formed by splicing a plurality of the anode plate splicing units according to the breadth of the film plating machine, so that the length of the anode plate can be flexibly adjusted. In addition, two adjacent anode plate splicing units are separated by an insulating medium, and each anode plate splicing unit is configured to be connected to the power supply, so that a parallel connection can be formed between the plurality of the anode plate splicing units, which causes the currents brought by the power supply into each anode plate splicing unit to be similar in magnitude, thereby ensuring the consistency of the plating layer on the surface of the conductive substrate film.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an optional implementation of the first aspect, the plurality of anode plate splicing units are sequentially spliced along a first linear direction.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In actual use, a plurality of anode plate splicing units may be spliced along the breadth direction of the film plating machine. When the breadth is fixed, a small number of anode plate splicing units can be used to meet the breadth requirements.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an optional implementation of the first aspect, the anode plate is a rectangular plate, and the first linear direction is a length direction of the rectangular plate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The rectangular plate has a shape adapted to the shape of the conductive substrate film, and has a neat appearance which is easy to manufacture.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an optional implementation of the first aspect, a splicing seam between two adjacent anode plate splicing units is inclined with respect to the first linear direction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, in the electroplating process, a thinner plating layer produced by the splicing seam will not form a whole strip of thinner plating layer on the conductive substrate film, during the movement of the conductive substrate film along the film feeding direction, thereby eliminating the problem of uneven thickness of the plating layer, and improving the uniformity of the plating layer on the surface of the conductive substrate film.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an optional implementation of the first aspect, the anode plate splicing unit is a trapezoidal plate, the plurality of trapezoidal plates have equal heights, and two adjacent trapezoidal plates are spliced together with one of non-parallel sides of one trapezoidal plate adjacent to one of non-parallel sides of the other trapezoidal plate.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The shape of the trapezoidal plate allows to manufacture trapezoidal plates with only two sizes, and an anode plate with a rectangular plate structure can be formed by splicing such two sizes of trapezoidal plates, so that the interchangeability of the anode plate splicing units is perfect, thereby improving the assembly efficiency, simplifying the manufacturing method and facilitating the implementation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an optional implementation of the first aspect, a middle part of the upper line and a middle part of the lower line of the trapezoidal plate are configured to be connected with the power supply respectively.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Therefore, the currents flowing through respective parts of the anode plate splicing unit can be basically consistent, so that the consistency of the plating layer on the surface of the conductive substrate film can be further improved.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an optional implementation of the first aspect, the anode plate splicing units are rectangular plates, and a splicing seam between two adjacent anode plate splicing units extends along the width direction of the rectangular plate.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Therefore, all anode plate splicing units are rectangular plates, which are easy to manufacture.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an optional implementation of the first aspect, a maximum length value of each anode plate splicing unit in the first linear direction is in a range of 300 mm to 350 mm</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The anode plate splicing unit selected in this value range not only can effectively reduce the resistance of the anode plate splicing unit, improve the uniformity of the current density, thereby improving the consistency of the plating layer on the surface of the conductive substrate film, but also can reduce the quality of the anode plate splicing unit, which causes the anode plate splicing unit to be easy to take and manufacture.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an optional implementation of the first aspect, the anode plate splicing unit is provided with a through hole.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Therefore, the anode plate splicing unit not only has light weight and easy to take, but also can reduce the resistance of the anode plate splicing unit, increase the contacting area between the anode plate splicing unit and the plating solution, and effectively improve the uniformity of the plating layer on the surface of the conductive substrate film.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an optional implementation of the first aspect, the anode plate for the film plating machine further includes a supporting frame. The supporting frame includes a border and a plurality of separating ribs arranged within the border, the border and the separating ribs are both made of insulating materials. A space enclosed by the border is divided into a plurality of subspaces by the plurality of the separating ribs, and in each subspace, an anode plate splicing unit which has a shape matching the shape of the subspace is fixed therein.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The above-mentioned supporting frame makes the splicing structure of the anode plate splicing unit more stable, and improves the reliability of the film plating machine.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an optional implementation of the first aspect, each of the anode plate splicing units is connected with a conductive metal strip. The conductive metal strip extends along a direction perpendicular to the anode plate, and the conductive metal strip is configured to be connected with a power supply.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The conductive metal strip not only facilitates the connection with the power supply, but also facilitates the removal of the anode plate splicing unit from the plating solution.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an optional implementation of the first aspect, a conductive metal frame is attached to the surface of each anode plate splicing unit, and the conductive metal frame is electrically connected to the conductive metal strip.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Therefore, the resistance of the anode plate splicing unit can be reduced, the currents through respective parts of the anode plate splicing unit are basically consistent, the uniformity of the current density is improved, and the consistency requirement of the plating layer on surface of the conductive substrate film can be more easily fulfilled.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an optional implementation of the first aspect, the conductive metal frame is a cross-shaped metal frame, and the cross-shaped metal frame includes a first metal strip and a second metal strip that are cross-fixed. The first metal strip and the second metal strip are both attached to the surface of the anode plate splicing unit.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The above-mentioned structure of the cross-shaped metal frame makes the area of the metal frame attached to the anode plate splicing unit larger, which further improves the uniformity of the current density, thereby further improving the consistency of the plating layer on surface of the conductive substrate film.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the second aspect, an embodiment of the present disclosure further discloses a film plating machine, which includes at least one power supply, a plating solution tank and a conductive substrate film conveying device disposed on both sides of the plating solution tank. The conductive substrate film conveying device is configured to drive the horizontally arranged conductive substrate film to move along a film feeding direction. The plating solution tank is sequentially provided therein with a plurality of anode plate groups at intervals along the film feeding direction, an anode plate group comprises an upper anode plate and a lower anode plate located on upper and lower sides of the conductive substrate film respectively, the upper anode plate and the lower anode plate each are the anode plate according to the first aspect. Each anode plate splicing unit in the anode plate is connected to the power supply</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the film plating machine provided by the embodiment of the present disclosure, the conductive substrate film conveying device is configured to drive the horizontally arranged conductive substrate film to move along the film feeding direction, so as to bring the conductive substrate film enter and leave the plating solution tank. Within the plating solution tank, a plurality of upper anode plates and lower anode plates are provided at intervals on upper and lower sides of the conductive substrate film, respectively. The upper anode plate is configured for plating the upper surface of the conductive substrate film, the lower anode plate is configured for plating the lower surface of the conductive substrate film, and both the upper anode plate and the lower anode plate adopt the spliced anode plate, so that the plating layers on both the upper and lower surfaces of the conductive substrate film can be uniform.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an optional implementation of the second aspect, the film plating machine includes a plurality of power supplies, and the plurality of anode plate splicing units are connected to the plurality of power supplies in one-to-one correspondence.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Therefore, not only the currents applied on each anode plate splicing unit can be ensured to be similar in magnitude, but also the currents applied on the corresponding anode plate splicing units can be adjusted respectively according to the uniformity of the plating layer on the surface of the conductive substrate film, so as to further ensure the consistency of the plating layer on the surface of the conductive substrate film.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an optional implementation of the second aspect, the upper anode plate and the lower anode plate are both rectangular plates, and the upper anode plate and the lower anode plate are respectively formed by splicing a plurality of anode plate splicing units along a length direction of the rectangular plate. The width direction of the rectangular plate is parallel to the film feeding direction, the splicing seam between the adjacent two anode plate splicing units extends along the film feeding direction, and the splicing seams in the upper anode plates in adjacent two anode plate groups are staggered in the film feeding direction, and the splicing seams in the lower anode plates in adjacent two anode plate groups are staggered in the film feeding direction.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Therefore, by means of providing the splicing seams in the upper anode plate and the lower anode plate in the adjacent two anode plate groups in a staggered manner, it can effectively avoid the situation that part of the plating layer on the surface of the conductive substrate film is thin due to the splicing seams, which ensures that the plating layers on the upper surface and lower surface of the conductive substrate film are uniform, so that the conductive substrate film meets the requirement of consistency.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In order to illustrate the technical solutions in the embodiments of the present disclosure more clearly, the accompanying drawings used in the embodiments will be briefly described below.

Specifically, a plating metal or other insoluble material is used as the anode, the workpiece to be plated is used as the cathode, and the liquid containing the plating metal ions is used as the plating solution. During the electroplating process, the anode and cathode are energized, and the current forms a loop among the anode, the plating solution and the cathode. During the electroplating process, the cations of the plating metal are reduced on the surface of the workpiece to be plated to form a plating layer.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the electroplating industry, the anode is generally made into a plate, so it is referred to as an anode plate. The anode plate can be a soluble anode plate or an insoluble anode plate. The soluble anode plate is an anode plate made of plating metal, such as an anode plate made of zinc and copper and similar materials, which can provide plating metal ions to the solution; and the insoluble anode plate is an anode plate that cannot be electrolyzed, such as an anode plate made of titanium and similar materials, in which case a manner of additionally adding salt will be adopted to supplement the metal ions in the plating solution.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a structural schematic diagram of an anode plate, which is an integral anode plate <b>01</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The integral anode plate <b>01</b> has a length adapted to the breadth specification of a film plating machine. When the breadth specification of the film plating machine is smaller, the length of the anode plate is smaller accordingly, and thus the currents flowing through parts of the anode plate are similar to each other, which can ensure consistency of a plating layer on the surface of the conductive substrate film; when the breadth specification of the film plating machine is larger, the length of the anode plate will be longer, which will causes that the currents at both ends of the anode plate will be larger, and the current in the middle part of the anode plate will be too small, since the current is usually introduced from two ends of the anode plate. As the magnitude of the current will directly affect thickness of the conductive substrate film, that is, the thickness of the plating layer on an area of the conductive substrate film corresponding to an area with higher current of the anode plate will be larger, and the thickness of the plating layer on an area of the conductive substrate film corresponding to an area with lower current of the anode plate will be smaller. As a result, the consistency of the plating layer on the surface of the conductive substrate film is poor.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In view of the above, embodiments of the present disclosure provide an anode plate for a film plating machine and a film plating machine. The anode plate provided by embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied to film plating machines with different breadth specifications, but also can improve the uniformity of the plating layer and meet the consistency requirements of the plating layer on surface of the conductive substrate film.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The anode plate for the film plating machine and the film plating machine are described in detail below by means of exemplary embodiments.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, an anode plate for a film plating machine is provided. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the anode plate <b>1</b> is formed by splicing a plurality of anode plate splicing units <b>11</b>, and two adjacent anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> are separated by an insulating medium <b>12</b> there-between. Each anode plate splicing unit <b>11</b> is configured to be connected with the power supply <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In order to improve the yield of the conductive substrate film <b>5</b>, the lengths of the anode plates <b>1</b> suitable for the film plating machines with different breadth specifications are different. In addition, within the allowable length range of the anode plate <b>1</b>, the smaller the resistance of anode plate <b>1</b> is, the better the uniformity of current density is, and thus the better the uniformity of formed plating layer is.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Hence, according to the breadth specification of the film plating machine, the anode plate <b>1</b> can be formed by splicing a plurality of anode plate splicing units <b>11</b>, so the length of the anode plate <b>1</b> can be flexibly adjusted to be suitable for the film plating machines with different breadth specifications. In addition, the two adjacent anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> are separated by the insulating medium <b>12</b>, and each anode plate splicing unit <b>11</b> is configured to be connected with at least one power supply <b>2</b>, so that the plurality of anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> are connected in parallel. The magnitude of the currents passing from the power supply <b>2</b> into respective anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> are similar to each other, thereby ensuring the consistency of the plating layer on the surface of the conductive substrate film <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">It should be noted that the above-mentioned insulating medium <b>12</b> may be insulating materials such as rubber and plastic. Alternatively, a gap may be formed between two adjacent anode plate splicing units <b>11</b>, and the air at the gap can form the insulating medium <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> are sequentially spliced and arranged along the first linear direction, i.e., along the Y direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. In actual use, the plurality of anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> may be spliced along the breadth direction of the film plating machine, so that the anode plate <b>1</b> can be formed into a rectangular plate. Therefore, when the width of the film plating machine is fixed, the anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> may be spliced in a single row or multiple rows along the breadth direction, so that the anode plate <b>1</b> not only can change in a length direction (i.e. the breadth direction), but also can change in a width direction. If the width of the anode plate <b>1</b> is large, the area of the anode plate <b>1</b> is likely to be too large, which will not only increase the weight of the anode plate <b>1</b>, causing the anode plate <b>1</b> to be inconvenient to take, but will also cause the utilization rate of the anode plate <b>1</b> to be low, increasing the cost. Therefore, it is a preferable solution to splicing the anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> in a single row along the breadth direction. In addition, the rectangular plate has a shape compatible with that of the conductive substrate film <b>5</b>, and has a neat appearance which is easy to manufacture.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">During the electroplating process, since splicing seams of the anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> are provided with the insulating medium <b>12</b> and there is no current passing through, the plating layer on the surface of the conductive substrate film <b>5</b> corresponding to the splicing seams may be thin. In order to solve the above problem, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the splicing seam of two adjacent anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> may be inclined with respect to the Y direction. When the splicing seam is inclined with respect to (excluding perpendicular to) the Y direction, since the extension direction of the seams are inconsistent with the film feeding direction, during the movement of the conductive substrate film <b>5</b> along the film feeding direction, the conductive substrate film <b>5</b> will not be formed with a whole strip of thinner plating layer, which can eliminate the problem of uneven thickness of the plating layer. When the splicing seams are perpendicular to the Y direction, at least two anode plates <b>1</b> arranged along the film feeding direction can be designed to participate in the electroplating process, and the seams on two adjacent anode plates <b>1</b> are staggered to each other, so that a part with thinner plating layer of the conductive substrate film <b>5</b> formed after passing through a first anode plate <b>1</b> can correspond to a non-splicing seam part of a second anode plate <b>1</b> when passing through the second anode plate <b>1</b>, so that the thinner plating layer is supplemented, thereby improving the uniformity of the plating layer on surface of the conductive substrate film <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">It should be noted that the anode plate splicing unit <b>11</b> may be a plate with any shape, such as a triangular plate, a trapezoidal plate, a rectangular plate, an irregular pattern plate, and the like.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an anode plate <b>1</b> spliced by anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> with a trapezoidal plate structure, wherein the plurality of trapezoidal plates have equal heights h, and two adjacent trapezoidal plates are spliced together with one of non-parallel sides a of one trapezoidal plate adjacent to one of non-parallel sides a of the other trapezoidal plate. For example, in order to form an anode plate <b>1</b> of a rectangular plate with regular shape by means of splicing a plurality of trapezoidal plates, two right-angled trapezoidal plates can be provided as trapezoidal plates at two ends of the plurality of trapezoidal plates respectively, and each trapezoidal plate in the middle part can be set as isosceles trapezoidal plates. Furthermore, in order to improve the interchangeability of components, the dimensions of each isosceles trapezoid plate may be the same, and the dimensions of the right-angled trapezoid plates at two ends are also the same. Therefore, during an assembling process, the positions of the isosceles trapezoidal plates can be interchanged, and the positions of the right-angled trapezoidal plates at both ends can also be interchanged. As a result, the wrong assembly of components can be effectively prevented, and the assembly efficiency can be improved.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows an anode plate <b>1</b> spliced by anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> with a rectangular plate structure, wherein the splicing seam between two adjacent rectangular plates extends along the film feeding direction.

In this way, the connection areas to the power supply <b>2</b> on both sides of the anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> can be basically the same, then the voltages and resistances on both sides are basically the same, so that the currents flowing through each part of the anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> are similar in magnitude, which makes it easier to improve the uniformity of plating layer on surface of the conductive substrate film <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, each anode plate splicing unit <b>11</b> is connected with a conductive metal strip <b>13</b>, the surface of the conductive metal strip <b>13</b> is an inert titanium layer, and the interior of the conductive metal strip is a conductive material (copper, gold, etc.).

The arrangement of the conductive metal frame <b>14</b> is equivalent to providing a connecting conductive wire on the surface of the anode plate splicing unit <b>11</b>, thereby reducing the resistance, making the currents through respective parts of the anode plate splicing unit <b>11</b> basically the same, which improves the uniformity of the current density and thus makes it easy to fulfill the uniformity requirement of the plating layer on surface of the conductive substrate film <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Furthermore, the conductive metal frame <b>14</b> is a cross-shaped metal frame, and the cross-shaped metal frame includes a first metal strip <b>141</b> and a second metal strip <b>142</b> that are cross-fixed, and both the first metal strip <b>141</b> and the second metal strip <b>142</b> are attached to the surface of the anode plate splicing unit <b>11</b>.

It should be noted that the upper anode plate and the lower anode plate use the anode plate <b>1</b> provided by the previous embodiment with respect to the anode plate, and each anode plate splicing unit <b>11</b> in the anode plate <b>1</b> is connected to the power supply <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The conductive substrate film conveying device <b>4</b> is configured to drive the horizontally arranged conductive substrate film <b>5</b> to move along the X direction, so as to bring the conductive substrate film <b>5</b> enter and leave the plating solution tank <b>3</b>. Within the plating solution tank <b>3</b>, the plurality of upper anode plates and lower anode plates are provided at intervals on upper and lower sides of the conductive substrate film <b>5</b> respectively. The upper anode plate is configured for plating the upper surface of the conductive substrate film <b>5</b>, the lower anode plate is configured for plating the lower surface of the conductive substrate film <b>5</b>, and both the upper anode plate and the lower anode plate adopt the spliced anode plate <b>1</b>, so that the plating layers on both the upper and lower surfaces of the conductive substrate film <b>5</b> can be uniform.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Furthermore, a plurality of power supplies <b>2</b> may be provided, and the plurality of anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> are connected to a plurality of power supplies <b>2</b> in one-to-one correspondence. Therefore, not only the currents applied on each anode plate splicing unit <b>11</b> can be ensured to be similar in magnitude, but also the currents applied on the corresponding anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> can be adjusted respectively according to the uniformity of the plating layer on the surface of the conductive substrate film <b>5</b>, so as to further ensure the consistency of the plating layer on the surface of the conductive substrate film <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the upper anode plate and the lower anode plate are both rectangular plates, and the upper anode plate and the lower anode plate are respectively formed by splicing the plurality of anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> along the length direction of the rectangular plate. The width direction of the rectangular plate is parallel to the X direction, the splicing seams between the adjacent two anode plate splicing units <b>11</b> extend along the X direction, and the splicing seams in the upper anode plates in adjacent two anode plate groups <b>6</b> are staggered in the X direction, and the splicing seams in the lower anode plates in adjacent two anode plate groups <b>6</b> are staggered in the X direction.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Because both the upper anode plate and the lower anode plate use the anode plate <b>1</b> provided by the previous embodiment with respect to the anode plate, and the splicing seams of the upper anode plate and the lower anode plate in the adjacent two anode plate groups <b>6</b> are staggered, it can effectively avoid the situation that part of the plating layer on the surface of the conductive substrate film <b>5</b> is thin due to the splicing seams, which ensures that the plating layers on the upper surface and lower surface of the conductive substrate film <b>5</b> are uniform, so that the conductive substrate film <b>5</b> meets the requirement of consistency.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Finally, it should be noted that the above embodiments are only used to illustrate the technical solutions of the present disclosure, but not intend to limit them.
