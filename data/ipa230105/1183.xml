BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The embodiments described herein relate generally to medical devices that provide heart pacemaking function, and more particularly to a temporary easily insertable transvenous dual-chamber sequential pacing catheter, and systems and methods for atrio-ventricular pacing to achieve AV synchrony.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The heart requires to be paced temporarily during or after certain medical procedures or conditions like open heart surgery, heart attack, some infections, electrolyte disturbances, cardiac trauma or other issues. The only available temporary pacing catheters will not pace the heart in atrio-ventricular (AV) synchrony (only the right ventricle is paced).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Establishing and maintaining atrio-ventricular (AV) synchrony in a patient is important for achieving optimal cardiovascular hemodynamics. AV synchrony is estimated to increase stroke volume by as much as 50% in a normal heart and increase cardiac index by as much as 25% to 30%. 5. After open heart surgery, pacing is performed using epicardial wires that are lightly sutured to the epicardium before the thorax is closed. Once these epicardial wires are no longer needed, these pacing wires are pulled through the skin. Pulling the pacing wires represents a risk of a cardiac tamponade that can lead to death, and can also pose a risk of infection, myocardial damage, ventricular arrhythmias and perforation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Existing temporary pacing catheters are also difficult to position correctly and often add complications including, in the case of balloon positioning, having the catheter move to and block the right ventricle outflow tract and the pulmonary artery.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Existing pacing catheter leads can also move (dislodge) either while pacing or at a critical point during a specific procedure like rapid pacing. For this reason, the mobility of the patient (ambulation) is limited when being temporary paced. Limited ambulation is known to increase the length of stay in certain scenarios and lead to higher healthcare costs.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a need for an AV sequential pacing catheter that is easy to insert and position on the right chambers of the heart to replace the current available temporary catheters/leads.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The embodiments described herein are directed to an insertable atrio-ventricular sequential pacing catheter that is easy to insert and position on the right chambers of the heart.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure relates to an improved transvenous intracardiac pacing catheter, and particularly to devices, methods, and systems for establishing and maintaining atrio-ventricular (AV) synchrony in a patient by providing an insertable atrio-ventricular sequential pacing catheter system having an inner catheter, outer catheter and connector assembly.

The invention provides an emergency pacemaker that will pace and sense both atrial and ventricular chambers and provide &#x201c;dual chamber&#x201d; control of the heart using a lead that can be safely and easily inserted into the heart in an emergency situation. &#x201c;Dual chamber&#x201d; pacing refers to continuous monitoring of the spontaneous activity of the heart both in the atria and in the ventricles, interpreting the detected events according certain accepted algorithms and providing stimuli to the chambers as needed to maintain a physiologically appropriate rhythm. Importantly, the device can be deployed with and without fluoroscopic guidance. In one embodiment, a self-positioning feature allows the device to be used without the extensive training and specialist experience that has been historically required for pacing devices.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments of the invention, the device comprises three (3) ventricular leads and four (4) atrial leads, made from shape memory material. Two of the three ventricular leads are bent at 90 degrees from the central axial lead and are 180 degrees from each other. The four atrial leads are bent at 90 degrees from the central axis (x-axis), and are each separated 90 degrees from the adjacent leads, in the y-axis plane.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments of the invention, both sets of leads are mounted and contained inside a slender e.g. 8Fr (1 mm), tubular, flexible elongated e.g. 35 cm retaining sheath that serves as a guide and delivery system during insertion and removal of the electrode system. Each of the wires is surrounded individually by electrical insulation.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments of the invention, the bundle of insulated wires can be arranged in either a parallel or helical configuration. In order to conform to heart chambers of different sizes, the leads will be produced in different lengths and appropriate distances between the electrodes.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments of the invention, the electrode system is constructed by assembling a plurality of insulated superelastic electrically conductive wires. The insulation material separates each of the wires from each other, but the wires are mounted in a bundle as a single cable-like structure. At the proximal end, the electrodes are connected to an external pacemaker. At the distal end, the individual wires once inserted into the heart will make contact with either atrial or ventricular tissue. The distal ends of the individual wires may include spherical electrode contacts that will make contact with atrial tissue or ventricular tissue.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments of the invention, each of the wires has memory and is pre-formed in a specific curvature but also is resilient enough to be contained in the sheath prior to being positioned within the heart chambers. Since both sets of leads for the ventricle and the atrium are contained inside a single slender flexible retaining sheath that is the guide and delivery system during insertion and removal of the electrode system, the ventricular electrode or electrodes which can be pacemaker sensors or stimulators are released first after the retaining sheath has been successfully inserted into the right ventricle. At this point, the sheath is retracted allowing the ventricle wire leads to escape from the sheath and because of each wire's pre-formed shape which has memory, spread out to individually contact the endocardial surfaces. The leads expand outwardly, engaging the tissue and chamber wall of the ventricle. If a mechanical parallel wire configuration is chosen in the sheath, the wires can be released and make contact in the same plane. Otherwise, the wires can be staggered within the ventricular chamber. If a helical configuration of the wires is chosen in the sheath, the wires are staggered upon release to cover different points of a chamber wall. Ideal wires for this configuration are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,137,060 and 3,699,886.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Continued retraction of the sheath will then allow the escape of the atrial wires and electrodes which also have memory and which, upon escape from the sheath, will proceed outwardly towards the atrial tissue for engagement.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As discussed above, in some embodiments of the invention, the distal ends of the individual wires may have spherical conductive ball tips to provide high current density and sensitivity. For the physician to effectively introduce the device transvenously, the sheath will have to be extended all the way forward initially such that it covers all the wires with the possible exception of the distal electrodes, which may protrude beyond the sheath during the introduction of the sheath with the conducting leads into the heart. The path of the sheath with the leads during insertion is into the subclavian or jugular vein past the atrium and into the ventricle. Once the electrode system reaches the apex of the right ventricle, the operator begins to pull back slowly on the sheath, thus releasing each wire individually until all necessary contact points are made.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments of the invention, each wire is made of a superelastic or memory shape retention material such as Nitinol&#x2122;, as the sheath is slowly pulled back the wires are released. Each wire will be pre-shaped with the proper orientation so that as the medical personnel, e.g. cardiac interventionalists, emergency medical technicians, surgical staff, outpatient staff, etc., pulls the sheath back, the wire fans outwardly until the wire tips rest against the interior wall of each chamber, thus making electrical contact. The memory in the wire will hold it in place within the chamber. The ball tip ending of each wire as well as the highly flexible chosen material will minimize trauma to the endocardium while allowing a sufficiently large surface area for electrical conduction.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Polymers</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Any of the devices and/or components thereof may be fabricated from any suitable biocompatible material or combination of materials. For example, an outer chassis, and/or components thereof may be fabricated from biocompatible materials, metals, metal alloys, polymer coated metals, and/or the like. Suitable biocompatible materials, metals and/or metal alloys can include polymers, co-polymers, ceramics, glasses, aluminum, aluminum alloys, stainless steel (e.g., 316 L stainless steel), cobalt chromium (Co&#x2014;Cr) alloys, nickel-titanium alloys (e.g., Nitinol&#xae;), and/or the like. Moreover, any of the chassis or components may be covered with a suitable polymer coating, and can include natural or synthetic rubber, polyethylene vinyl acetate (PEVA), poly-butyl methacrylate (PBMA), translute Styrene Isoprene Butadiene (SIBS) copolymer, polylactic acid, polyester, polylactide, D-lactic polylactic acid (DLPLA), polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In order for the electrode system within the sheath to freely navigate through the blood vessels, it must have a very smooth surface. Adequate flexibility must be achieved with materials that do not fracture or fail prematurely. The insulation material used to insulate each individual wire will be of the type used in the production of existing pacing leads. Furthermore, the sheath material used will be a thermoplastic elastomer similar to those used in the manufacture of catheters and for added strength it can be braided.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one non-limiting embodiment, the electrode system in accordance with this invention may be designed primarily for emergency temporary use such that the leads described have passive fixation. However, in another non-limiting example, it is possible that the present invention can be utilized as part of a permanently implanted pacemaker system such that the electrode would become embedded in the heart tissue or actively attached to the endocardium by one of many means available for active fixation.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Some biocompatible synthetic material(s) can include, for example, polyesters, polyurethanes, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (e.g., Teflon), and/or the like. Where a thin, durable synthetic material is contemplated (e.g., for a covering), synthetic polymer materials such expanded PTFE or polyester may optionally be used. Other suitable materials may optionally include elastomers, thermoplastics, polyurethanes, thermoplastic polycarbonate urethane, polyether urethane, segmented polyether urethane, silicone polyether urethane, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), silicone-polycarbonate urethane, polypropylene, polyethylene, low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), ultra-high density polyethylene (UHDPE), polyolefins, polyethylene-glycols, polyethersulphones, polysulphones, polyvinylpyrrolidones, polyvinylchlorides, other fluoropolymers, polyesters, polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) (e.g., Dacron), Poly-L-lactic acids (PLLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), poly(D, L-lactide/glycolide) copolymer (PDLA), silicone polyesters, polyamides (Nylon), PTFE, elongated PTFE, expanded PTFE, siloxane polymers and/or oligomers, and/or polylactones, and block co-polymers using the same.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Radiopaque Materials</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Barium Sulfate. Barium sulfate (BaSO4) is a radiopaque material widely compounded in medical formulations and a common filler used with medical-grade polymers. It is an inexpensive material, costing approximately $2/lb; and its white color can be changed with the addition of colorants.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">With a specific gravity of 4.5, barium sulfate is generally used at loadings of 20 to 40% by weight. While a 20% barium sulfate compound is typical for general-purpose medical device applications, some practitioners prefer a higher degree of radiopacity than can be provided by that loading. With striped tubing, for example, a 40% compound is standard.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A loading of 20% barium sulfate by weight is equivalent to about 5.8% by volume; 40% by weight equals 14% by volume. As the barium content moves beyond about 20% by volume, compounds begin to show losses of the base polymer's tensile strength and other mechanical properties. It is therefore best to formulate radiopacifiers at the minimum level for each application; excessive use of these fillers is not recommended.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Bismuth. Considerably more expensive than barium at $20 to $30/lb (depending on the chemical salt selected), bismuth compounds are also twice as dense. Bismuth trioxide (Bi2O3), which is yellow in color, has a specific gravity of 8.9; bismuth subcarbonate (Bi2O2CO3) has a specific gravity of 8.0; and bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) has a specific gravity of 7.7. Because of the density, a 40% bismuth compound contains only about half the volume ratio as a 40% barium sulfate compound. Since bismuth produces a brighter, sharper, higher-contrast image on an x-ray film or fluoroscope than does barium, it is commonly used whenever a high level of radiopacity is required.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Compared with barium, higher loadings are also possible: even a 60% bismuth compound can maintain the same base polymer mechanical properties as a 40% barium sulfate compound. A 20% bismuth loading by weight equals 3% by volume; a 40% loading by weight equals 7.6% by volume. Bismuth is sensitive to compounding and must be treated gently, with low-shear mixing recommended for optimum results. Bismuth provides high levels of radiopacity.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Tungsten. A fine metal powder with a specific gravity of 19.35, tungsten (W) is more than twice as dense as bismuth and can provide a high attenuation coefficient at a cost of approximately $20/lb. A loading of 60% tungsten has approximately the same volume ratio as a 40% bismuth compound. Devices can be made highly radiopaque with relatively low loadings of tungsten, enabling good mechanical properties to be maintained. Because of its density, tungsten is typically selected as a filler for very-thin-walled devices.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A 50% tungsten loading by weight equals only 5.4% by volume; an 80% loading by weight represents 18.5% by volume. Tungsten is black in color, which cannot be changed with colorants. It is abrasive and can cause accelerated wear in extruders and other processing equipment. Devices filled with high loadings of tungsten will exhibit surface roughness. Because the material invites oxidation in the presence of oxygen and heat and is highly flammable, care should be taken while drying it. With elastomers, barium sulfate mixes better than do tungsten or bismuth compounds.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Compounding Considerations</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Newer x-ray machines generally operate at higher energy levels than older ones&#x2014;typically at 80 to 125 kVp as compared with 60 to 80 kVp for older machines. Higher energy radiation increases the transmission of photons and can require higher levels of radiopacity to provide the desired attenuation. Therefore, devices produced with barium sulfate compounds might not appear as bright on newer machines, for which bismuth compounds would be a better choice of radiopaque filler. Blending these materials, however, can often be the best solution, especially for multipurpose formulations used over a broad range of energy levels. A blend of barium, easily attenuated at low energy levels, and bismuth, attenuated at higher levels, often works well.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Compounding radiopaque materials includes factoring in the degree of attenuation of the device, the tensile strength, elongation, and other mechanical properties of the polymers. Fillers, antioxidants, stabilizers, and colorants may also be included with metallic fillers.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The present invention can be used in emergency rooms, after open heart surgery, during or after minimally invasive heart surgery or implant procedures such as valve repair or replacement, in intensive care units, at the bedsides, cardiac catheterization labs, ambulances, battle fields and other emergency settings where patients with heart block or other life threatening arrhythmias may be found.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Independent Claims</heading><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a self-positioning, quick-deployment low profile transvenous electrode system for pacing of a heart, comprising:</p><p id="p-0054" num="0000">a pacemaker including a pulse generator that can provide sensing and stimuli for a ventricle or an atrium;<br/>a plurality of insulated electrical wires bundled together to form a distal set of three (3) ventricle leads disposed within a first inner sheath, and a proximal set of four (4) atrium leads disposed within a second inner sheath, the first inner sheath and the second inner sheath disposed within an outer steerable catheter sheath,<br/>said outer steerable catheter sheath being movable from said first inner sheath and said second inner sheath once inserted into the heart for deploying the first inner sheath to the ventricle and the second inner sheath to the atrium, said outer steerable catheter sheath being entirely removed from the atrium and ventricle when the transvenous electrode system is engaged,<br/>said first inner sheath being movable to expose the distal set of three (3) ventricle leads to the ventricle, and said second inner sheath being movable to expose the four (4) atrium leads to the atrium,<br/>the first inner sheath and the second inner sheath each made from a polymer, wherein the polymer is doped with a radiopaque material to form a radiopaque polymer sheath or is labelled with at least one radiopaque marker element,<br/>each of the ventricular and atrial leads have a proximal body portion, a distal end portion, and a tip portion,<br/>the proximal body portion made from a radiopaque polymer-covered copper wire,<br/>the distal end portion made from shape memory material, the shape memory material selected from stainless steel, spring steel, cobalt-chromium alloy, nickel-titanium alloy, and mixtures thereof,<br/>the tip portion made from shape memory material and a radiopaque material, the radiopaque material selected from a barium-containing compound, a bismuth-containing compound, a steel compound, a tungsten-containing compound, and mixtures thereof,<br/>two of the three ventricle leads are shape-set at a 90 degree angle in an expanded configuration, and the two ventricle leads are offset 180 degrees from each other, one of the three ventricle leads is a central axial lead,<br/>each of the four atrium leads are shape-set at a 90 degree angle in an expanded configuration, and each of the four atrium leads are separated 90 degrees from each other,<br/>the steerable catheter sheath is comprised of a distal portion and a proximal portion, and has a distance marker every 10 cm along its entire length,<br/>the distal portion of the steerable catheter sheath is 5 cm in length and has a 0.010&#x2033;

The SA node is composed of nodal cells. In a normal resting adult heart, the SA node initiates firing at 60 to 100 impulses/minute, the impulses causing electrical stimulation and subsequent contraction of the atria. Located at the upper end of the septum, the sinus node creates the synchronized neurally-mediated signal for cardiac pacing.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0081">These signals then travel across the atrium to the atrioventricular node, located close to the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. The AV node is also made up of nodal cells and coordinates these incoming electrical impulses.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0082">After a slight delay so the atria can contract and complete ventricular filling, the AV node relays the impulse to Purkinje cells in the ventricle, initially conducted through the Bundle of His which extends along the septum, and which is then divided into the right bundle branch to conduct impulses to the right ventricle and the left bundle branch to conduct impulses to the left ventricle, causing ventricular contraction.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0083">In a healthy heart, the signal flow from the A-V node to the free wall of the left ventricle is rapid to insure the free wall and septum contract in synchrony. For example, a stimulating signal may flow to the free wall in about 70-90 milli-seconds. In patients with conduction abnormalities, this timing may be significantly delayed (to 150 milli-seconds or more) resulting in asynchronous contraction.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0084">In some patients, the conduction path through the Purkinje fibers may be blocked. The location of the block may be highly localized (as in the case of so-called &#x201c;left bundle branch block&#x201d; or LBBB) or may include an enlarged area of dysfunctional tissue (which can result from infarction). In such cases, all or a portion of the free wall of the left ventricle is flaccid while the septum is contracting. In addition to contributing to asynchronous contraction, the contraction force of the free wall is weakened.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0085">To address asynchronous contraction, CHF patients can be treated with cardiac pacing of the left ventricle. Such pacing includes applying a stimulus to the septal muscles in synchrony with stimulation applied to the muscles of the free wall of the left ventricle. While infracted tissue will not respond to such stimulus, non-infarcted tissue will contract thereby heightening the output of the left ventricle.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0090" num="0086">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view of one embodiment of the device, illustrating the atrial leads, the ventricular leads, the retractable sheath, the combined hub and terminal connection, and steerable deployment mechanism, and the external lead terminals, according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0087">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a distal central radio-opaque lead <b>101</b> is shown as one of a three-part set of ventricle leads.

The sheath is configured to provide a 90 degree curve over a 2.5&#x2033; diameter bend, and is also configured to provide a hockey-stick bend at a 45 degree angle+/&#x2212;5 degrees. Sheath has OS markers <b>110</b>, <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> located every 10 cm along its length from the distal tip <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0090">At a proximal end, sheath has a glued hub <b>114</b>, a Touhy-Borst access connector with a side port <b>115</b>. Actuator dial <b>116</b> is located at the proximal end of the sheath and allows the sheath to be shaped and controlled. Red deployment stop <b>117</b> connects the last 20 cm of the sheath to the cable junction housing <b>119</b>.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="2">Programmable Leads</heading><p id="p-0095" num="0091">Atrium lead terminals <b>120</b>, <b>121</b> and ventricle lead terminals <b>122</b>, <b>123</b> allow the device to be connected to and operated from an external unit such as a ICD, pacer, diagnostic, or other unit that can provide sensor operation, stimulation signal, programming for individual leads to improve sensing, avoid over-sensing of the ventricular lead by T-waves or other noise or attenuating or interfering signals, avoid over-sensing of the atrium leads by the R-wave, avoid cross-talk, or customize sensing and stimulation on a lead-by-lead basis.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0092">Also contemplated as within the scope of the invention is the use digital signal processing in conjunction with the use of multiple leads. Multiple input, multiple output (MIMO), single input multiple output (SIMO), single input single output (SISO), and multiple input single output (MISO) can be programmed in the control unit to take advantage of the multiple lead architecture. For example, decreasing sensitivity of certain leads and increasing sensitivity of other leads during a depolarization cycle (PQRST) allows the invention to increase SNR in the sensing function. Similarly, decreasing or increasing stimulatory signals to one or more leads allows the invention to more accurately provide stimulation to the AV node, the SA node, the ventricular apex, or other cardiac tissue to provide a level of granularity to the stimulation function not previously available to practitioners. Likewise, unlike previous devices, the availability of multiple, programmable leads means that sensing leads are not required to share the function of a shocking/stimulation leads. Further, damaged or degraded leads can be bypassed allowing continued functioning without requiring the entire device to be removed from a patient, this increasing the longevity of implanted devices using the inventive technology.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0093">As is customary with implantable pulse generators, the device may be programmable to achieve either conventional bipolar or unipolar stimulation or to achieve the stimulation of the present invention through an external programmer or controlled automatically by the device. The selection can be based on user preference or be driven by physiological factors such as widths of the patient's QRS complex or the conduction interval between the stimulus to a far away region in the heart. In addition switching between the pacing of the present invention and conventional pacing can also be determined by the percentage of pacing with a preference for a higher percentage with the pacing of the present invention. Further, the switching from the conventional pacing to the present invention pacing can be used when there exists an exit block or the pacing electrode is located in infracted myocardium when conventional pacing can not effect the depolarization of the myocardium at the high output level. The automatic determination can be effected through the deployment of any automatic capture detection technology that exists in the prior art. Additionally, wireless network enabled switching function for therapy optimization can also be implemented with the present invention. In such case, certain patient physiologic data are gathered by the implantable device and sent to a remote server/monitor through a wireless communication network.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0094">The present invention can also be extended to the defibrillation therapy where high-energy pulses with various waveforms are delivered through electrode systems to treat tachycardia and fibrillation (both atrium and ventricle). The present invention is believed to be able to achieve lower defibrillation threshold due to better distribution of the electrical field, causing higher voltage gradient at least in certain parts of the heart compared to that by the conventional defibrillation configuration. Additionally, the present invention can be used to perform anti-tachy pacing where faster than conventional pacing pulse sequences are used to stop certain tachyarrhythmia. The present invention is believed to be advantageous due to the wider coverage of the electrical field and the capability of capturing special conductions system in the heart (both atrium and ventricle).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic view another embodiment of the device, illustrating the atrial leads <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>107</b>, the ventricular leads <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, the retractable sheath <b>109</b>, <b>113</b>, the hub <b>114</b>, the independent terminal connection <b>119</b>, and steerable deployment mechanism <b>116</b>, and the external lead terminals <b>120</b>, <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, according to the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> also shows a 20 cm segment <b>118</b> from the deployment stop <b>117</b> and the terminal connection <b>119</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic of the two-inner sheath embodiment illustrating the outer steerable catheter sheath <b>301</b> housing the two inner sheaths <b>302</b>, <b>303</b>, with one inner sheath <b>303</b> having the ventricle leads and the other inner sheath <b>302</b> having the atrium leads, according to the invention.
