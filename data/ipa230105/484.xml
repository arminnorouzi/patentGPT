The knotless anchor constructs may be employed for any remplissage techniques such as Hill Sach's repairs and for any soft tissue repairs including PASTA, labral, rotator cuff, Achilles tendon, biceps and hip repairs, among many others.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The knotless suture constructs disclosed below use a mechanism similar to that of knotless SutureTak&#xae; but provide improvements in the design of the anchor constructs. As detailed below, novel anchor constructs in the form of (1) a combined knotless/knotted Corkscrew&#xae; anchor with a recessed eyelet; (2) a knotless Corkscrew&#xae; anchor; (3) a knotless SwiveLock&#xae; anchor with a recessed eyelet; and/or (4) a knotless PushLock&#xae; anchor may be used alone or in any combination to aid in suture management and tensioning.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Knotless suture anchors are provided for both PASTA and remplissage applications. These anchors have specific application to the humeral bone and have increased pullout strength.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The surgical devices (constructs) detailed below include fixation devices (tensionable knotless anchors) having various configurations that are inserted into a bone defect (such as a Hill Sach's lesion, for example) with a flexible strand (for example, a suture) provided within the fixation device and optionally a shuttle/pull device (a suture passing instrument) attached to the flexible strand. The flexible strand and the shuttle/pull device attached to it allow the formation of a splice within the body of the anchor, or outside the body of the anchor, and during the tissue repair procedure to finalize the construct. The shuttle/pull device is provided within the strand (inside of the strand) and forms the splice subsequent to the insertion of the fixation device within the bone (and subsequent to attachment to soft tissue to be repaired or fixated) to allow formation of the final fixation device with a knotless self-locking mechanism including a continuous, flexible loop having an adjustable perimeter that allows the user (for example, the surgeon) to control the tension of the strand on the soft tissue to be attached to bone.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Details of the formation of an exemplary knotless suture anchor employed in the embodiments of the present invention and with the splice- and loop-forming mechanism detailed above are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 9,107,653, entitled &#x201c;Tensionable Knotless Anchors with Splice and Methods of Tissue Repair,&#x201d; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2013/0165972, entitled &#x201c;Tensionable Knotless Anchor Systems and Methods of Tissue Repair,&#x201d; and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2013/0345749, entitled &#x201c;Knotless Suture Anchors and Methods of Tissue Repairs,&#x201d; the disclosures of all of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety herewith.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention also provides remplissage techniques and methods of soft tissue repairs which do not require tying of knots and allow adjustment of both the tension of the suture and the location of the tissue with respect to the bone defect or lesion. In the exemplary methods detailed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>25</b></figref>, the tensionable knotless anchors may be used by themselves or in combination with additional constructs (which may have a similar or different configuration, i.e., modified according to the specific repair) and with the flexible strand provided through tissue, around tissue, or through and around tissue to be fixated within the bone defect. The tensionable knotless anchors may be used to achieve simple stitch repairs, mattress stitch repairs or interlocked looped mattress repairs, among others, at the bone defect, preferably within the bone defect. The tensionable knotless anchors may be also provided in a daisy chain configuration, i.e., with the suture from one anchor passed through the eyelet/loop of the shuttle/pull device of another anchor and repeated in a pattern (to allow the formation of a splice within each anchor with a shuttle/pull device of another anchor).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The methods and devices (constructs) of the present invention will be detailed below with reference to exemplary knotless, self-cinching suture anchors <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b</i>, <b>50</b><i>c</i>, <b>50</b><i>d</i>, <b>50</b><i>e</i>, <b>50</b><i>f</i>, <b>50</b><i>g</i>.

Openings/channels <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> allow threading suture(s) and/or suture passing device(s) around post <b>20</b>, as detailed below. Cannulation <b>11</b><i>b </i>extends along the body <b>11</b> to allow passage of flexible strands and of suture passing devices, as detailed below. Cylindrical portion <b>14</b> is provided at the proximal end <b>13</b> of the anchor <b>50</b> and contains a socket <b>19</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>) configured to securely engage a tip of a driver. Openings/channels <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> are positioned opposite to each other relative to the post <b>20</b> and also symmetrically located relative to the post <b>20</b>, to allow flexible strand <b>30</b> (suture <b>30</b>) and shuttle/pull device <b>40</b> (suture passing instrument <b>40</b> or shuttle <b>40</b>) provided with eyelet or loop <b>44</b> to pass and slide therethrough.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Tensionable knotless anchor <b>50</b> is loaded with tensionable construct <b>99</b> formed of suture <b>30</b> attached to the shuttle/pull device <b>40</b>. To assemble anchor <b>50</b>, suture <b>30</b>, which is typically braided or multi-filament, is preloaded onto the anchor by tying static knot <b>31</b>, which prevents suture <b>30</b> from passing through distal blind hole <b>12</b><i>a</i>. The suture may also be preloaded by insert molding or by any other means known in the art. Suture <b>30</b> passes around post <b>20</b>, which is large enough to allow suture <b>30</b> to take gradual turns instead of sharp turns. Suture <b>30</b> then passes through cannulation <b>11</b><i>b </i>and proximal blind hole <b>13</b><i>a</i>. Tensionable knotless anchor <b>50</b> is loaded onto a driver (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b> and <b>27</b></figref>), and suture <b>30</b> is tied to the driver (for example, wrapped around a cleft of the driver) to fasten tensionable knotless anchor <b>50</b> securely to the driver.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Prior to the fastening of the anchor <b>50</b> to the driver, suture passing device <b>40</b> (for example, a FiberLink&#x2122; or a nitinol loop) is threaded through suture <b>30</b> (i.e., attached to the suture <b>30</b> through splice region <b>39</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>. Suture passing device <b>40</b> includes an eyelet/loop <b>44</b> for passing suture and, optionally, a pull-ring (not shown). Suture passing device <b>40</b> passes through an aperture of suture <b>30</b>, located either proximal or distal to distal blind hole <b>12</b><i>a</i>. It then exits an aperture of suture <b>30</b>, within the tensionable knotless anchor <b>50</b>, traverses around post <b>20</b>, and through proximal blind hole <b>13</b><i>a</i>. Tensionable knotless anchor <b>50</b> loaded with tensionable construct <b>99</b> (formed of suture <b>30</b> attached to the suture passing device <b>40</b>) is then secured into bone (for example, into a hole/socket/tunnel formed in the bone) by using the driver. Suture <b>30</b> is then passed through or around the tissue which is to be reattached to bone. Suture <b>30</b> is subsequently passed through eyelet/loop <b>44</b> of the suture passing device <b>40</b>. Suture passing device <b>40</b> is then pulled, thereby pulling suture <b>30</b> towards tensionable knotless anchor <b>50</b> so that it doubles on itself inside the body of the tensionable knotless anchor. The suture passing device <b>40</b> has also been further pulled through the splice region <b>38</b> of suture <b>30</b>, to form a splice within the strand <b>30</b> and within the body of the anchor <b>50</b>, and a continuous, flexible loop <b>55</b> (not shown) having an adjustable perimeter.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Anchor <b>50</b> may be a screw-in anchor or a push-in style anchor.
