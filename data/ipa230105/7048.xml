In general, network slicing can be used by a single network operator for operational purposes, such as to differentiate characteristics and resources for different broad classes of services, such as communication services, support services, security services, and so forth.

In general, quantum communications utilizes laws of quantum physics for transfers of data in a manner that is particularly well-suited to protect the data. The laws of quantum physics that are used allow particles (typically photons of light for transferring data across optical cables, although it will be appreciated that other types of particles may be used) to be used as quantum bits (qubits). The qubits may assume states of superposition, which means that the qubits can represent multiple combinations of &#x201c;0&#x201d; and &#x201c;1&#x201d; at the same time. The data transferred based on quantum communications is secure due to the fact that an entity attempting to observe the data is unable to observe the data without leaving an indication that the data has been observed (e.g., since the quantum state of a qubit that is observed will collapse to either a &#x201c;0&#x201d; or a &#x201c;1&#x201d; as a result of the tampering by the entity). These laws of quantum physics may be utilized to create various applications which may support various aspects of quantum communications, including quantum security applications for securing transfers of data based on quantum communications (e.g., applications such as QKD quantum teleportation applications, and so forth).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The communication system <b>100</b>, as indicated above, may be configured to support quantum communications based on support for various aspects of quantum communications.

For example, QKD protocols may establish a symmetric key between two parties who are generally known in the cryptographic community as Alice and Bob. To begin the process of establishing a private key, Alice uses quantum or classical means to generate a random sequence of classical bit values (a random subset of which becomes the final private key). Here, Alice randomly encodes each bit of this sequence in the polarization state of a photon by randomly choosing, for each bit, one of the following two agreed-upon bases in which to encode the bit: the standard basis or the Hadamard basis. Alice then sends this sequence of photons to Bob through the quantum channel. Bob measures the state of each photon that he receives by randomly picking either basis. Over the classical channel, Alice and Bob check that Bob has received a photon for every photon that Alice has sent and then Alice and Bob tell each other the bases that they used for encoding and decoding (measuring) each bit. When the choice of bases agrees, the bit value measured by Bob agrees with the bit value sent by Alice. In one example, this QKD application for symmetric key establishment may be adapted, based on quantum event detection and management techniques, to provide failure monitoring and recovery for monitoring for a failure of the QKD application and initiating a recovery process when failure of the QKD application is detected. In the absence of any particular protocol for quantum system error handling (which might otherwise put additional constraints on the application of such techniques for supporting security for and recovery of the QKD application for symmetric key establishment), security for and recovery of the QKD application for symmetric key establishment may be supported by using timers at the source end and the destination end of the quantum channel. For example, Alice starts a timer when she sends her sequence of photons to Bob through the quantum channel and Bob starts a timer after receiving a photon from Alice through the quantum channel and, in response to either of the two timers expiring, the owner of the timer that expires (i.e., Alice or Bob) will notify an agent configured to initiate a disaster recovery process (e.g., SDN controller <b>130</b>, either directly or indirectly via master vQMEC node <b>121</b>-<b>0</b>). For example, the agent configured to initiate the disaster recovery process may perform monitoring for such notifications (e.g., the agent may keep a counter and take action, such as initiating a disaster recovery process, upon crossing a specified predefined security threshold or QoS value) and may take appropriate action based on various events or conditions (e.g., initiating a disaster recovery process, such as initiating a process for providing additional resources to support the quantum channel and associated quantum communications). It will be appreciated that such techniques may support protection of the QKD application for symmetric key establishment from various events which may compromise security (e.g., photon tampering, photon delay, photon loss, or any other anomalies, degradations, failures, or other conditions related to the quantum channel). It will be appreciated that various aspects of providing event detection and management for quantum communications may be applied in various other ways for supporting event detection and management for various aspects of quantum communications (e.g., various aspects of the quantum channel such as degradation and failure of the quantum channel, various aspects of quantum information transfers via quantum channels such as corruption or loss of qubits, various other types of quantum applications such as quantum teleportation applications and quantum de-coherence applications, and so forth).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">It will be appreciated that various aspects of the foregoing example may be further understood when the example is considered in additional detail within the specific context of the communication system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In this example, a sending vQMEC node (e.g., one of the vQMEC nodes <b>121</b>, which also may correspond to Alice in the example above) starts sending a sequence of photons to a remote vQMEC node (e.g., one of the vQMEC nodes <b>121</b>, which also may correspond to Bob in the example above) via a quantum channel <b>120</b>. The sending vQMEC node <b>121</b> starts a timer when it begins sending the sequence of photons (e.g., upon sending the first photon) and the remote vQMEC node <b>121</b> starts a time when it begins receiving the sequence of photons (e.g., upon receiving the first photon). As soon as either of the timers expires, the vQMEC node <b>121</b> that detects the expired timer will send a notification indicative of the expiration of the timer. The notification is intended for delivery to the SDN controller <b>130</b> and may be routed to the SDN controller <b>130</b> in various ways (e.g., directly such as where the detecting vQMEC node <b>121</b> is the master vQMEC node <b>121</b>-<b>0</b> or a master vQMEC node is not employed, indirectly via the master vQMEC node <b>121</b>-<b>0</b>, and so forth). The SDN controller <b>130</b> may keep a counter for controlling initiation of a disaster recovery process based on detection of an event associated with the QKD application for symmetric key establishment between the two vQMEC nodes <b>121</b>. The SDN controller <b>130</b> may initiate a disaster recovery process upon detecting a predefined threshold or QoS value. The initiation of the disaster recovery process may include initiating deployment of additional resources which may support the vQMEC nodes <b>121</b> for which the event associated with the QKD application was detected (e.g., notifying a VM deployment controller to initiate on-demand VM deployment for either or both of the vQMEC nodes <b>121</b> for which the event associated with the QKD application was detected). It will be appreciated that, since the vQMEC nodes <b>121</b> may be operating within network slices <b>111</b>, this may be considered to be per-slice VM deployment. The deployment of additional resources, such as deployment of VMs by a VM deployment controller (or VM orchestrator) may be performed based on SDN (e.g., using SDN instructions which may be provided to the vQMEC nodes <b>121</b> for which the event associated with the QKD application was detected over various communication channels, such as via fiber optics, quantum satellite, and so forth). The SDN controller <b>130</b> also may be configured to support monitoring for the quantum communication after initiation of the disaster recovery process (e.g., based on reporting by either or both of the vQMEC nodes <b>121</b> for which the event associated with the QKD application was detected, based on reporting by the master vQMEC node <b>121</b>-<b>0</b> on behalf of either or both of the vQMEC nodes <b>121</b> for which the event associated with the QKD application was detected, and so forth) such that the SDN controller <b>130</b> may initiate any other actions which may be required (e.g., deployment of additional resources if the original deployment of additional resources was insufficient, termination of the additional resources after the detected event has been handled, and so forth). The SDN controller <b>130</b> also may create rules (e.g., predictive policy rules or other suitable types of rules) which are used by the vQMEC nodes <b>121</b> for event detection and reporting for quantum communications and may provide the rules to the vQMEC nodes <b>121</b> for use in performing event detection and reporting for quantum communications. The SDN controller <b>130</b> may create the rules which are used by the vQMEC nodes <b>121</b> for event detection and reporting for quantum communications based on data analytics performed by the SDN controller <b>130</b> using various types of data reported by vQMEC nodes <b>121</b>. It will be appreciated that various functions discussed above within the context of the examples for supporting the QKD application for symmetric key establishment may be applied for providing event detection and management for various other aspects of quantum communications (e.g., various aspects of the quantum channel such as degradation and failure of the quantum channel, various aspects of quantum information transfers via quantum channels such as corruption or loss of qubits, various other types of quantum applications such as quantum teleportation applications and quantum de-coherence applications, and so forth).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It will be appreciated that the communication system <b>100</b> is configured to support various event detection and management capabilities within the context of a quantum 5G network using a MEC environment based on SDN-supported 5G RAN network slicing.
