In particular, the prostheses and delivery systems relate in some embodiments to replacement heart valves, such as replacement mitral heart valves or replacement tricuspid heart valves.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Human heart valves, which include the aortic, pulmonary, mitral and tricuspid valves, function essentially as one-way valves operating in synchronization with the pumping heart. The valves allow blood to flow downstream, but block blood from flowing upstream. Diseased heart valves exhibit impairments such as narrowing of the valve or regurgitation, which inhibit the valves' ability to control blood flow. Such impairments reduce the heart's blood-pumping efficiency and can be a debilitating and life-threatening condition. For example, valve insufficiency can lead to conditions such as heart hypertrophy and dilation of the ventricle. Thus, extensive efforts have been made to develop methods and apparatuses to repair or replace impaired heart valves.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Prostheses exist to correct problems associated with impaired heart valves. For example, mechanical and tissue-based heart valve prostheses can be used to replace impaired native heart valves. More recently, substantial effort has been dedicated to developing replacement heart valves, particularly tissue-based replacement heart valves that can be delivered with less trauma to the patient than through open heart surgery. Replacement valves are being designed to be delivered through minimally invasive procedures and even percutaneous procedures. Such replacement valves often include a tissue-based valve body that is connected to an expandable frame that is then delivered to the native valve's annulus.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Development of prostheses including but not limited to replacement heart valves that can be compacted for delivery and then controllably expanded for controlled placement has proven to be particularly challenging. An additional challenge relates to the ability of such prostheses to be secured relative to intralumenal tissue, e.g., tissue within any body lumen or cavity, in an atraumatic manner.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Delivering a prosthesis to a desired location in the human body, for example delivering a replacement heart valve to the mitral valve, can also be challenging. Obtaining access to perform procedures in the heart or in other anatomical locations may require delivery of devices percutaneously through tortuous vasculature or through open or semi-open surgical procedures. The ability to control the deployment of the prosthesis at the desired location can also be challenging.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to a delivery system, such as but not limited to a delivery system for a replacement heart valve.

of several embodiments of replacement heart valves, delivery systems and methods that are configured for use in the vasculature of a patient, such as for replacement of natural heart valves in a patient. These embodiments may be discussed in connection with replacing specific valves such as the patient's aortic, tricuspid, or mitral valve. However, it is to be understood that the features and concepts discussed herein can be applied to products other than heart valve implants. For example, the controlled positioning, deployment, and securing features described herein can be applied to medical implants, for example other types of expandable prostheses, for use elsewhere in the body, such as within an artery, a vein, or other body cavities or locations. In addition, particular features of a valve, delivery system, etc. should not be taken as limiting, and features of any one embodiment discussed herein can be combined with features of other embodiments as desired and when appropriate. While certain of the embodiments described herein are described in connection with a transfemoral delivery approach, it should be understood that these embodiments can be used for other delivery approaches such as, for example, transapical or transjugular approaches. Moreover, it should be understood that certain of the features described in connection with some embodiments can be incorporated with other embodiments, including those which are described in connection with different delivery approaches.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Delivery System</heading><p id="p-0119" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of a delivery device, system, or assembly <b>10</b>. The delivery system <b>10</b> can be used to deploy a prosthesis, such as a replacement heart valve, within the body. In some embodiments, the delivery system <b>10</b> can use a dual plane deflection approach to properly delivery the prosthesis. Replacement heart valves can be delivered to a patient's heart mitral or tricuspid valve annulus or other heart valve location in various manners, such as by open surgery, minimally-invasive surgery, and percutaneous or transcatheter delivery through the patient's vasculature. Example transfemoral approaches may be found in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2015/0238315, filed Feb. 20, 2015, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. While the delivery system <b>10</b> is described in connection with a percutaneous delivery approach, and more specifically a transfemoral delivery approach, it should be understood that features of delivery system <b>10</b> can be applied to other delivery system, including delivery systems for a transapical delivery approach.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0158">The delivery system <b>10</b> can be used to deploy a prosthesis, such as a replacement heart valve as described elsewhere in this specification, within the body. The delivery system <b>10</b> can receive and/or cover portions of the prosthesis such as a first end <b>301</b> and second end <b>303</b> of the prosthesis <b>70</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> below. For example, the delivery system <b>10</b> may be used to deliver an expandable implant or prosthesis <b>70</b>, where the prosthesis <b>70</b> includes the first end <b>301</b> and the second end <b>303</b>, and wherein the second <b>303</b> end is configured to be deployed or expanded before the first end <b>301</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0159"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> further shows an example of the prosthesis <b>70</b> that can be inserted into the delivery system <b>10</b>, specifically into the implant retention area <b>16</b>. For ease of understanding, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the prosthesis is shown with only the bare metal frame illustrated. The implant or prosthesis <b>70</b> can take any number of different forms. A particular example of frame for a prosthesis is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, though it will be understood that other designs can also be used. The prosthesis <b>70</b> can include one or more sets of anchors, such as distal (or ventricular) anchors <b>80</b> extending proximally when the prosthesis frame is in an expanded configuration and proximal (or atrial) anchors <b>82</b> extending distally when the prosthesis frame is in an expanded configuration. The prosthesis can further include struts <b>72</b> which may end in mushroom-shaped tabs <b>74</b> at the first end <b>301</b>. Further discussion can be found in U.S. Publication No. 2015/0328000A1, published Nov. 19, 2015, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0160">In some embodiments, the delivery system <b>10</b> can be used in conjunction with a replacement aortic valve, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. In some embodiments the delivery system <b>10</b> can be modified to support and delivery the replacement aortic valve. However, the procedures and structures discussed below can similarly be used for a replacement mitral, tricuspid, or aortic valve.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0161">Additional details and example designs for a prosthesis are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,403,983, 8,414,644, 8,652,203 and U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2011/0313515, 2012/0215303, 2014/0277390, 2014/0277422, 2014/0277427, 2018/0021129, and 2018/0055629, the entirety of these patents and publications are hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of this specification. Further details and embodiments of a replacement heart valve or prosthesis and its method of implantation are described in U.S. Publication Nos. 2015/0328000 and 2016/0317301 the entirety of each of which is hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of this specification.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0162">The delivery system <b>10</b> can be relatively flexible. In some embodiments, the delivery system <b>10</b> is particularly suitable for delivering a replacement heart valve to a mitral valve location through a transseptal approach (e.g., between the right atrium and left atrium via a transseptal puncture).</p><p id="p-0125" num="0163">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the delivery system <b>10</b> can include a shaft assembly <b>12</b> comprising a proximal end <b>11</b> and a distal end <b>13</b>, wherein a handle <b>14</b> is coupled to the proximal end of the assembly <b>12</b>. The shaft assembly <b>12</b> can be used to hold the prosthesis for advancement of the same through the vasculature to a treatment location. The delivery system <b>10</b> can further comprise a relatively rigid live-on (or integrated) sheath <b>51</b> surrounding the shaft assembly <b>12</b> that can prevent unwanted motion of the shaft assembly <b>12</b>. The live-on sheath <b>51</b> can be attached at a proximal end of the shaft assembly <b>12</b> proximal to the handle <b>14</b>, for example at a sheath hub. The shaft assembly <b>12</b> can include an implant retention area <b>16</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-B</figref> with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> showing the prosthesis <b>70</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> with the prosthesis <b>70</b> removed) at its distal end that can be used for this purpose. In some embodiments, the shaft assembly <b>12</b> can hold an expandable prosthesis in a compressed state at implant retention area <b>16</b> for advancement of the prosthesis <b>70</b> within the body. The shaft assembly <b>12</b> may then be used to allow controlled expansion of the prosthesis <b>70</b> at the treatment location. In some embodiments, the shaft assembly <b>12</b> may be used to allow for sequential controlled expansion of the prosthesis <b>70</b> as discussed in detail below. The implant retention area <b>16</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-B</figref> at the distal end of the delivery system <b>10</b>, but may also be at other locations. In some embodiments, the prosthesis <b>70</b> may be rotated in the implant retention area <b>16</b>, such as through the rotation of the inner shaft assembly <b>18</b> discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0164">As shown in cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-B</figref>, the distal end of the delivery system <b>10</b> can include one or more subassemblies such as an outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, a mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, a rail assembly <b>20</b>, an inner shaft assembly <b>18</b>, and a nose cone assembly <b>31</b> as will be described in more detail below. In some embodiments, the delivery system <b>10</b> may not have all of the assemblies disclosed herein. For example, in some embodiments a full mid shaft assembly may not be incorporated into the delivery system <b>10</b>, such as described in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>-<b>36</b></figref> below. In some embodiments, the assemblies disclosed below may be in a different radial order than is discussed.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0165">In particular, embodiments of the disclosed delivery system <b>10</b> can utilize a steerable rail in the rail assembly <b>20</b> for steering the distal end of the delivery system <b>10</b>, allowing the implant to be properly located in a patient's body. As discussed in detail below, the steerable rail can be, for example, a rail shaft that extends through the delivery system <b>10</b> from the handle <b>14</b> generally to the distal end. In some embodiments, the steerable rail has a distal end that ends proximal to the implant retention area <b>16</b>. A user can manipulate the bending of the distal end of the rail, thereby bending the rail in a particular direction. In preferred embodiments, the rail has more than one bend along its length, thereby providing multiple directions of bending. As the rail is bent, it presses against the other assemblies to bend them as well, and thus the other assemblies of the delivery system <b>10</b> can be configured to steer along with the rail as a cooperating single unit, thus providing for full steerability of the distal end of the delivery system.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0166">Once the rail is steered into a particular location in a patient's body, the prosthesis <b>70</b> can be advanced along or relative to the rail through the movement of the other sheaths/shafts relative to the rail and released into the body. For example, the rail can be bent into a desired position within the body, such as to direct the prosthesis <b>70</b> towards the native mitral valve. The other assemblies (e.g., the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, the mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, the inner assembly <b>18</b>, and the nose cone assembly <b>31</b>) can passively follow the bends of the rail. Further, the other assemblies (e.g., the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, the mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, the inner assembly <b>18</b>, and the nose cone assembly <b>31</b>) can be advanced together (e.g., relatively together, sequentially with one actuator, simultaneously, almost simultaneously, at the same time, closely at the same time) relative to the rail while maintaining the prosthesis <b>70</b> in the compressed position without releasing or expanding the prosthesis <b>70</b> (e.g., within the implant retention area <b>16</b>). The other assemblies (e.g., the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, the mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, the inner assembly <b>18</b>, and the nose cone assembly <b>31</b>) can be advanced distally or proximally together relative to the rail. In some embodiments, only the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, and inner assembly <b>18</b> are advanced together over the rail. Thus, the nose cone assembly <b>31</b> may remain in the same position. The assemblies can be individually, sequentially, or simultaneously, translated relative to the inner assembly <b>18</b> in order to release the implant <b>70</b> from the implant retention area <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0167"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates the sheath assemblies, specifically the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, the mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, the inner shaft assembly <b>18</b>, and the nose cone assembly <b>31</b> having translated distally together along the rail assembly <b>20</b>, further details on the assemblies are below. In some embodiments, the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, the mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, the inner shaft assembly <b>18</b>, and the nose cone assembly <b>31</b> translate together (e.g., relatively together, sequentially with one actuator, simultaneously, almost simultaneously, at the same time, closely at the same time). This distal translation can occur while the implant <b>70</b> remains in a compressed configuration within the implant retention area <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0168">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> and as further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, starting with the outermost assembly, the delivery system can include an outer sheath assembly <b>22</b> forming a radially outer covering, or sheath, to surround an implant retention area <b>16</b> and prevent the implant from radially expanding. Specifically, the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b> can prevent radial expansion of the distal end of the implant from radially expanding. Moving radially inward, the mid shaft assembly <b>21</b> can be composed of a mid shaft hypotube <b>43</b> with its distal end attached to an outer retention member or outer retention ring <b>42</b> for radially retaining a portion of the prosthesis in a compacted configuration, such as a proximal end of the prosthesis <b>70</b>. The mid shaft assembly <b>21</b> can be located within a lumen of the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>. Moving further inwards, the rail assembly <b>20</b> can be configured for steerability, as mentioned above and further described below. The rail assembly <b>20</b> can be located within a lumen of the mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>. Moving further inwards, the inner shaft assembly <b>18</b> can be composed of an inner shaft with its distal end attached to inner retention member or inner retention ring <b>40</b> (such as a PEEK ring) for axially retaining the prosthesis, for example the proximal end of the prosthesis. The inner shaft assembly <b>18</b> can be located within a lumen of the rail assembly <b>20</b>. Further, the most radially-inward assembly is the nose cone assembly <b>31</b> which includes the nose cone shaft <b>27</b> having its distal end connected to the nose cone <b>28</b>. The nose cone <b>28</b> can have a tapered tip. The nose cone assembly <b>31</b> is preferably located within a lumen of the inner shaft assembly <b>18</b>. The nose cone assembly <b>31</b> can include a lumen for a guide wire to pass therethrough.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0169">The shaft assembly <b>12</b>, and more specifically the nose cone assembly <b>31</b>, inner assembly <b>18</b>, rail assembly <b>20</b>, mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, and outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, can be collectively configured to deliver a prosthesis <b>70</b> positioned within the implant retention area <b>16</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) to a treatment location. One or more of the subassemblies can then be moved to allow the prosthesis <b>70</b> to be released at the treatment location. For example, one or more of the subassemblies may be movable with respect to one or more of the other subassemblies. The handle <b>14</b> can include various control mechanisms that can be used to control the movement of the various subassemblies as will also be described in more detail below. In this way, the prosthesis <b>70</b> can be controllably loaded onto the delivery system <b>10</b> and then later deployed within the body. Further, the handle <b>14</b> can provide steering to the rail assembly <b>20</b>, providing for bending/flexing/steering of the distal end of the delivery system <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0170">As will be discussed below, the inner retention member <b>40</b>, the outer retention ring <b>42</b>, and the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b> can cooperate to hold the prosthesis <b>70</b> in a compacted configuration. The inner retention member <b>40</b> is shown engaging struts <b>72</b> at the proximal end <b>301</b> of the prosthesis <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. For example, slots located between radially extending teeth on the inner retention member <b>40</b> can receive and engage the struts <b>72</b> which may end in mushroom-shaped tabs <b>74</b> on the proximal end of the prosthesis <b>70</b>. The mid shaft assembly <b>21</b> can be positioned over the inner retention member <b>40</b> so that the first end <b>301</b> of the prosthesis <b>70</b> is trapped between the inner retention member <b>40</b> and the outer retention ring <b>42</b>, thereby securely attaching it to the delivery system <b>10</b> between the mid shaft assembly <b>21</b> and the inner retention member <b>40</b>. The outer sheath assembly <b>22</b> can be positioned to cover the second end <b>303</b> of the prosthesis <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0171">The outer retention member <b>42</b> may be attached to a distal end of the mid shaft hypotube <b>43</b> which can in turn be attached to a proximal tube <b>44</b> at a proximal end, which in turn can be attached at a proximal end to the handle <b>14</b>. The outer retention member <b>42</b> can provide further stability to the prosthesis <b>70</b> when in the compressed position. The outer retention member <b>42</b> can be positioned over the inner retention member <b>40</b> so that the proximal end of the prosthesis <b>70</b> is trapped therebetween, securely attaching it to the delivery system <b>10</b>. The outer retention member <b>42</b> can encircle a portion of the prosthesis <b>70</b>, in particular the first end <b>301</b>, thus preventing the prosthesis <b>70</b> from expanding. Further, the mid shaft assembly <b>21</b> can be translated proximally with respect to the inner assembly <b>18</b> into the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, thus exposing a first end <b>301</b> of the prosthesis <b>70</b> held within the outer retention member <b>42</b>. In this way the outer retention member <b>42</b> can be used to help secure a prosthesis <b>70</b> to or release it from the delivery system <b>10</b>. The outer retention member <b>42</b> can have a cylindrical or elongate tubular shape, and may be referred to as an outer retention ring, though the particular shape is not limiting.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0172">The mid shaft hypotube <b>43</b> itself can be made of, for example, high density polyethylene (HDPE), as well as other appropriate materials as described herein. The mid shaft hypotube <b>43</b> can be formed of a longitudinally pre-compressed HDPE tube, which can provide certain benefits. For example, the pre-compressed HDPE tube can apply a force distally onto the outer retention member <b>42</b>, thus preventing accidental, inadvertent, and/or premature release of the prosthesis <b>70</b>. Specifically, the distal force by the mid shaft hypotube <b>43</b> keeps the distal end of the outer retention member <b>42</b> distal to the inner retention member <b>40</b>, thus preventing the outer retention member <b>42</b> from moving proximal to the inner retention member <b>40</b> before it is desired by a user to release the prosthesis <b>70</b>. This can remain true even when the delivery system <b>10</b> is bent/deflected at a sharp angle.

The spacer sleeves can be used in any of the above positions.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0205">The spacer sleeve can be made of a polymer material such as braided Pebax&#xae; and can be lined, for example with PTFE, on the inner diameter, though the particular material is not limiting. The spacer sleeve can advantageously reduce friction between the steerable rail assembly <b>20</b> and its surrounding assemblies. Thus, the spacer sleeves can act as a buffer between the rail assembly <b>20</b> and the inner/nose cone assembly <b>18</b>/<b>30</b>. Further, the spacer sleeve can take up any gap in radius between the assemblies, preventing compressing or snaking of the assemblies during steering. In some embodiments, the spacer sleeve may include cuts or slots to facilitate bending of the spacer sleeve. In some embodiments, the spacer sleeve may not include any slots, and may be a smooth cylindrical feature.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0206">The spacer sleeve can be mechanically contained by the other lumens and components, and is thus not physically attached to any of the other components, allowing the spacer sleeve to be &#x201c;floating&#x201d; in that area. The floating aspect of the spacer sleeve allows it to move where needed during deflection and provide a support and/or lubricious bear surface/surfaces. Accordingly, the floating aspect allows the delivery system <b>10</b> to maintain flex forces. However, in some embodiments, the spacer sleeve can be connected to other components.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Hypotube/Shaft Construction</heading><p id="p-0169" num="0207">As discussed above, the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, the mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, the inner assembly <b>18</b>, and the rail assembly <b>20</b> can contain an outer hypotube <b>104</b>, a mid shaft hypotube <b>43</b>, a distal section <b>126</b>, and a rail hypotube <b>136</b>, respectively.

The second slot <b>228</b> can be narrower at its ends and longitudinally thicker in its middle portion, thereby forming a curved slot. Moving longitudinally along the second section <b>220</b>, each slot pair <b>222</b> can be offset approximately 45 or 90 degrees as compared to longitudinally adjacent slot pairs <b>222</b>.

This can allow it to bend over curves, especially tight curves. In some embodiments, the distal end of the strengthener <b>240</b> includes a number of generally circular/elliptical holes <b>242</b>. This can last for approximately half of the length of the strengthener <b>240</b>. On the proximal half, one circumferential half of the strengthener <b>240</b> can include repeating thin slots <b>244</b> spaced by elongate ovoid holes <b>246</b>.

In some embodiments, the liner can <b>240</b> be a polymer, such as PTFE, though the type of polymer or material is not limiting. In some embodiments, the strengthener <b>240</b> can be a metal. In some embodiments, the strengthener <b>240</b> can further include an outer polymer layer/jacket, such as a Pebax&#xae; jacket. This prevents the strengthener <b>240</b> from catching on the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0215">In certain embodiments, the outer retention ring <b>42</b> can further include an inner liner for smoothly transitioning over the prosthesis <b>70</b>. The inner liner can be PTFE or etched PTFE, though the particular material is not limiting and other reduced friction polymers can be used. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>, to prevent delamination during loading of the implant <b>70</b>, the liner <b>251</b> may not be flush at the distal end of the outer retention ring <b>42</b>. Instead, the liner <b>251</b> can be extended and inverted at the distal end in order to cover the distal end of the outer retention ring <b>42</b>. In some embodiments, the liner <b>251</b> can cover an outer surface of the strengthener <b>240</b> as well. This can create a seamless rolled reinforced tip of the liner <b>251</b>. The liner <b>251</b> can fully or partially cover an outer surface of the outer retention ring <b>42</b>, for example &#xbc;, &#x2153;, &#xbd;, &#x2154;, &#xbe; (or greater than &#xbc;, &#x2153;, &#xbd;, &#xbe;), or all of the outer retention ring <b>42</b>. This solution is advantageous over previously known methods, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,622,367, incorporated by reference in its entirety, as PTFE lined applications do not adhere particularly well to reinforcements or the outer jacket. By inverting the liner <b>251</b> and fusing it to the outer retention ring <b>42</b> and/or the strengthener <b>240</b> and/or an outer polymer jacket on the strengthener <b>240</b>/outer retention ring <b>42</b>, this creates a seamless reinforced tip that can mitigate delamination. Delamination is a serious concern because the delaminated liner can tear and embolize during deployment, and the delaminated layer can cause extremely high loading and deployment forces. Delaminated layers can also cause lumen translation problems by locking up shafts thereby adding translational force requirements.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0216">Next, again moving radially inward, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows an embodiment of the rail hypotube <b>136</b> (distal end towards the right). The rail hypotube <b>136</b> can also contain a number of circumferential slots. The rail hypotube <b>136</b> can generally be broken into a number of different sections. At the most proximal end is an uncut (or unslotted) hypotube section <b>231</b>. Moving distally, the next section is the proximal slotted hypotube section <b>133</b>. This section includes a number of circumferential slots cut into the rail hypotube <b>136</b>. Generally, two slots are cut around each circumferential location forming almost half of the circumference. Accordingly, two backbones are formed between the slots extending up the length of the hypotube <b>136</b>. This is the section that can be guided by the proximal pull wires <b>140</b>. Moving further distally is the location <b>237</b> where the proximal pull wires <b>140</b> connect, and thus slots can be avoided. Thus section is just distal of the proximally slotted section.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0217">Distally following the proximal pull wire connection area is the distal slotted hypotube section <b>235</b>. This section is similar to the proximal slotted hypotube section <b>233</b>, but has significantly more slots cut out in an equivalent length. Thus, the distally slotted hypotube section <b>235</b> provides easier bending than the proximally slotted hypotube section <b>233</b>. In some embodiments, the proximal slotted section <b>233</b> can be configured to experience a bend of approximately 90 degrees with a half inch radius whereas the distal slotted section <b>135</b> can bend at approximately 180 degrees within a half inch. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the spines of the distally slotted hypotube section <b>235</b> are offset from the spines of the proximally slotted hypotube section <b>233</b>. Accordingly, the two sections will achieve different bend patterns, allowing for three-dimensional steering of the rail assembly <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, the spines can be offset 30, 45, or 90 degrees, though the particular offset is not limiting. In some embodiments, the proximally slotted hypotube section <b>233</b> can include compression coils. This allows for the proximally slotted hypotube section <b>233</b> to retain rigidity for specific bending of the distally slotted hypotube section <b>235</b>.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0218">At the distalmost end of the distal slotted hypotube section <b>235</b> is the distal pull wire connection area <b>241</b> which is again a non-slotted section of the rail hypotube <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0219">Moving radially inwardly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the inner assembly <b>18</b> is composed generally of two sections. The proximal section is a hypotube <b>129</b>, either slotted or non-slotted. The distal section <b>126</b>, which at least partially overlaps an outer surface of the proximal hypotube <b>129</b>, can be designed to be particularly flexible. For example, the distal section <b>126</b> can be more flexible than any of the other shafts discussed herein. In some embodiments, the distal section <b>126</b> can be more flexible than any shaft discussed herein other than the nose cone shaft <b>27</b>. In some embodiments, the distal section <b>126</b> can be a flexible tube or hypotube. In some embodiments, the distal section <b>126</b> can be a cable, such as a flexible cable. For example, the cable can several strands of wire, such as metal, plastic, polymer, ceramic, etc., wound together to form a rope or cable. Because the cable is so flexible, it can more easily bend with the rail assembly <b>20</b>. Further, the cable can be smooth, which allows the rail assembly <b>20</b> to track over a smooth surface, eliminating the need for any inner liner on the rail assembly <b>20</b>.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Capsule Construction</heading><p id="p-0182" num="0220">The capsule <b>106</b> can be formed from one or more materials, such as PTFE, ePTFE, polyether block amide (Pebax&#xae;), polyetherimide (Ultem&#xae;), PEEK, urethane, Nitinol, stainless steel, and/or any other biocompatible material. The capsule <b>106</b> is preferably compliant and flexible while still maintaining a sufficient degree of radial strength to maintain a replacement valve <b>70</b> within the capsule <b>106</b> without substantial radial deformation, which could increase friction between the capsule <b>106</b> and a replacement valve <b>70</b> contained therein. The capsule <b>106</b> also preferably has sufficient column strength to resist buckling of the capsule <b>106</b>, and sufficient tear resistance to reduce or eliminate the possibility of the replacement valve <b>70</b> tearing and/or damaging the capsule <b>106</b>. Flexibility of the capsule <b>106</b> can be advantageous, particularly for a transseptal approach. For example, while being retracted along a curved member, for example while tracking over a rail assembly as described herein, the capsule <b>106</b> can flex to follow the curved member without applying significant forces upon the curved member, which may cause the curved member to decrease in radius. More specifically, the capsule <b>106</b> can bend and/or kink as it is being retracted along such a curved member such that the radius of the curved member is substantially unaffected.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0221"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows embodiments of a capsule <b>106</b> that can be used with embodiments of the delivery system <b>10</b>. The capsule <b>106</b> may include any of the materials and properties discussed above. With many implant capsules, compression resistance and flexibility are typically balanced together, as improved flexibility can lead to worse compression resistance. Thus, there tends to be a choice made between compression resistance and flexibility. However, disclosed are embodiments of a capsule <b>106</b> that can achieve both high compression resistance as well as high flexibility. Specifically, the capsule <b>106</b> can bend in multiple directions.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0222">In particular, a metal hypotube can provide radial strength and compression resistance, while specific slots/cuts in the hypotube can enable the flexibility of the capsule <b>106</b>.

This metal layer <b>404</b> can include the coils discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, or could be one or more hypotubes. The capsule <b>106</b> is then covered on an outer surface by a polymer layer and on an inner surface by a liner. All of these features are discussed in detail below.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0225">As mentioned, the metal layer <b>404</b> can be, for example, a metal hypotube or laser cut hypotube. In some embodiments, the metal layer <b>404</b> can be a metal coil or helix, as discussed in detail above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Though not limiting, the metal layer <b>404</b> can have a thickness of 0.007 inches (or about 0.007 inches).</p><p id="p-0188" num="0226">If a metal coil, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, is used, the coil dimensions can stay the same throughout a length of the metal layer <b>404</b>.

For example, the coils can vary between coils having a 0.014-inch gap with a 0.021-inch pitch (e.g., small coils), coils having a 0.020 inch-gap with a 0.02-inch pitch (e.g., large coils), and coils having a 0.020-inch gap with a 0.027-inch pitch (e.g., spaced large coils).

In some embodiments, the outer polymer 402 layer is an elastomer, though the particular material is not limiting. In some embodiments, the outer polymer layer <b>402</b> can comprise polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). The ePTFE can have very different mechanical properties that PTFE. For example, ePTFE can be much more flexible while still maintaining good tensile/elongation properties. In some embodiments, the outer polymer layer <b>402</b> can comprise a thermoplastic elastomer, such as PEBAX&#xae;. In some embodiments, the outer polymer layer <b>402</b> can be pre-axially stressed before applying to the capsule.

In some embodiments, the outer polymer layer <b>402</b> can be directly applied to the metal layer <b>404</b>. In some embodiments, an adhesive layer <b>406</b> can be disposed between the metal layer <b>404</b> and the outer polymer layer <b>402</b> to promote attachment of the outer polymer layer to the metal layer. For example, a fluoropolymer, or other soft durometer fluoroelastomer, can be applied between the metal layer <b>404</b> and the outer layer <b>402</b> in order to attach the two layers together and prevent delamination. In some embodiments, the adhesive layer <b>406</b> is not used.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0230">In some implementations, other materials can be included between the metal layer <b>404</b> and the outer polymer layer <b>402</b> in order to improve properties.

The liner <b>410</b> can be formed of a low friction and/or high lubricity material that allows for the capsule <b>106</b> to be translated over the prosthesis <b>70</b> without catching or damaging portions of the prosthesis <b>70</b>. In some embodiments, the liner <b>410</b> can be PTFE, which can resist radial expansion and decrease friction with the prosthesis <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0234">In some embodiments, the liner <b>410</b> is made from ePTFE. However, it can be difficult to reflow a standard ePTFE liner <b>410</b> on the inner layer of the capsule <b>106</b>. Accordingly, the ePTFE liner layer <b>410</b> can be pre-compressed before applying onto the inner layer of the capsule <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, portions of the outer polymer layer <b>402</b> and the liner <b>410</b> can be in contact with one another. Thus, prior to bonding the two layers together, the ePTFE liner <b>410</b> and/or outer polymer layer <b>402</b> can be axially compressed. Then, the layers can be bonded together with reflow techniques during manufacturing. For example, the ePTFE liner <b>410</b> can be axially compressed, such as over a mandrel, while the outer polymer layer <b>402</b> can be placed over it. These two layers can then be reflowed (e.g., melting under pressure) to connect. The combined layers can be slid into and/or around the metal layer <b>404</b> discussed herein, and can be melted under pressure again to form the final capsule <b>106</b>. This technique can allow for the capsule <b>106</b> to maintain flexibility and prevent breakage/tearing.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0235">As mentioned above, the inner liner <b>410</b> can be ePTFE in some embodiments. The surface friction of ePTFE can be about 15% less than standard PTFE, and can be about 40% less than standard extruded thermoplastics that are used in the art.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0236">In certain embodiments, the liner layer <b>410</b> can extend only along an inner surface of the capsule <b>106</b> and terminate at a distal end. However, to prevent delamination during loading of the implant <b>70</b>, the liner <b>410</b> may not be flush at the distal end of the capsule <b>106</b>. Instead, the liner <b>410</b> can be extended and inverted at the distal end in order to cover the distal end of the capsule <b>106</b> as well as an outer diameter of a portion of the outer polymer layer <b>402</b>. This can create a seamless rolled reinforced tip of the liner <b>410</b>. This solution is advantageous over previously known methods, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,622,367, incorporated by reference in its entirety, as PTFE lined applications do not adhere particularly well to reinforcements or the outer jacket. By inverting the liner <b>410</b> and fusing it with the outer polymer layer <b>402</b>, this creates a seamless reinforced capsule tip that can mitigate delamination. Delamination is a serious concern because the delaminated liner can tear and embolize during deployment, and the delaminated layer can cause extremely high loading and deployment forces. Delaminated layers can also cause lumen translation problems by locking up shafts thereby adding translational force requirements.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0237">In some embodiments, another FEP section <b>412</b> can be included between the liner <b>410</b> and the metal layer <b>404</b>. The FEP section <b>412</b> can be located on distal metal coil <b>108</b>, as well as the tube <b>110</b> transitioning between the distal metal coil <b>108</b> and the proximal metal coil <b>107</b>. In some embodiments, the FEP section <b>412</b> may continue partially or fully into the proximal metal coil <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0238">In some embodiments, an FEP section <b>412</b> can be included in the proximalmost portion of the proximal metal coil <b>107</b>. This FEP section <b>412</b> be approximately 0.5 inches in length. In some embodiments, there is a longitudinal gap between the proximalmost FEP section <b>412</b> and the FEP section <b>412</b> that extends over the distal metal coil <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, the previously mentioned FEP sections <b>412</b> are continuous.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0239">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the metal layer <b>404</b> may stop proximal to the edges of the outer polymer layer <b>402</b>, liner <b>410</b>, and FEP section <b>412</b>. If so, a thicker portion of an adhesive layer <b>409</b> can be applied at the distal end of the metal layer <b>404</b> to match the distal end of the other layers. However, this section can be removed during manufacture, so the distal end of the metal layer <b>404</b> is the distal end of the capsule <b>106</b>, which can then be covered by the liner <b>410</b>. In some embodiments, the extended sections distal to the metal layer <b>404</b> are not used.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Handle</heading><p id="p-0202" num="0240">The handle <b>14</b> is located at the proximal end of the delivery system <b>10</b> and is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>. A cross-section of the handle <b>14</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. The handle <b>14</b> can include a number of actuators, such as rotatable knobs, that can manipulate different components of the delivery system <b>10</b>. The operation of the handle <b>10</b> is described with reference to delivery of a replacement mitral valve prosthesis <b>70</b>, though the handle <b>10</b> and delivery system <b>10</b> can be used to deliver other devices as well.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0241">The handle <b>14</b> is generally composed of two housings, a rail housing <b>202</b> and a delivery housing <b>204</b>, the rail housing <b>202</b> being circumferentially disposed around the delivery housing <b>204</b>. The inner surface of the rail housing <b>202</b> can include a screwable section configured to mate with an outer surface of the delivery housing <b>204</b>. Thus, the delivery housing <b>204</b> is configured to slide (e.g., screw) within the rail housing <b>202</b>, as detailed below. The rail housing <b>202</b> generally surrounds about one half the length of the delivery housing <b>204</b>, and thus the delivery housing <b>204</b> extends both proximally and distally outside of the rail housing <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0242">The rail housing <b>202</b> can contain two rotatable knobs, a distal pull wire knob <b>206</b> and a proximal pull wire knob <b>208</b>. However, the number of rotatable knobs on the rail housing <b>202</b> can vary depending on the number of pull wires used. Rotation of the distal pull wire knob <b>206</b> can provide a proximal force, thereby providing axial tension on the distal pull wires <b>138</b> and causing the distal slotted section <b>135</b> of the rail hypotube <b>136</b> to bend. The distal pull wire knob <b>206</b> can be rotated in either direction, allowing for bending in either direction, which can control anterior-posterior angles. Rotation of the proximal pull wire knob <b>208</b> can provide a proximal force, and thus axial tension, on the proximal pull wires <b>140</b>, thereby causing the proximal slotted section <b>133</b> of the rail hypotube <b>136</b> to bend, which can control the medial-lateral angle. The proximal pull wire knob <b>108</b> can be rotated in either direction, allowing for bending in either direction. Thus, when both knobs are actuated, there can be two bends in the rail hypotube <b>136</b>, thereby allowing for three-dimensional steering of the rail shaft <b>132</b>, and thus the distal end of the delivery system <b>10</b>. Further, the proximal end of the rail shaft <b>132</b> is connected on an internal surface of the rail housing <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0243">The bending of the rail shaft <b>132</b> can be used to position the system, in particular the distal end, at the desired patient location, such as at the native mitral valve. In some embodiments, rotation of the pull wire knobs <b>206</b>/<b>208</b> can help steer the distal end of the delivery system <b>10</b> through the septum and left atrium and into the left ventricle so that the prosthesis <b>70</b> is located at the native mitral valve.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0244">Moving to the delivery housing <b>204</b>, the proximal ends of the inner shaft assembly <b>19</b>, outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, and nose cone shaft assembly <b>30</b> can be connected to an inner surface of the delivery housing <b>204</b> of the handle <b>14</b>. Thus, they can move axially relative to the rail assembly <b>20</b> and rail housing <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0245">A rotatable outer sheath knob <b>210</b> can be located on the distal end of the delivery housing <b>204</b>, being distal to the rail housing <b>202</b>. Rotation of the outer sheath knob <b>210</b> will pull the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b> in an axial direction proximally, thus pulling the capsule <b>106</b> away from the implant <b>70</b> and releasing the distal end <b>301</b> of implant <b>70</b>. Thus the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b> is individually translated with respect to the other shafts in the delivery system <b>10</b>. The distal end <b>303</b> of the implant <b>70</b> can be released first, while the proximal end <b>301</b> of the implant <b>70</b> can remain radially compressed between the inner retention member <b>40</b> and the outer retention member <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0246">A rotatable mid shaft knob <b>214</b> can be located on the delivery housing <b>204</b>, in some embodiments proximal to the rotatable outer sheath knob <b>210</b>, being distal to the rail housing <b>202</b>. Rotation of the mid shaft knob <b>214</b> will pull the mid shaft assembly <b>21</b> in an axial direction proximally, thus pulling the outer retention ring <b>42</b> away from the implant <b>70</b> and uncovering the inner retention member <b>40</b> and the proximal end <b>301</b> of the implant <b>70</b>, thereby releasing the implant <b>70</b>. Thus, the mid shaft assembly <b>21</b> is individually translated with respect to the other shafts in the delivery system <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0247">Located on the proximal end of the delivery housing <b>204</b>, and thus proximal to the rail housing <b>202</b>, can be a rotatable depth knob <b>212</b>. As the depth knob <b>212</b> is rotated, the entirety of the delivery housing <b>204</b> moves distally or proximally with respect to the rail housing <b>202</b> which will remain in the same location. Thus, at the distal end of the delivery system <b>10</b>, the inner shaft assembly <b>18</b>, outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, and nose cone shaft assembly <b>31</b> together (e.g., simultaneously) move proximally or distally with respect to the rail assembly <b>20</b> while the implant <b>70</b> remains in the compressed configuration. In some embodiments, actuation of the depth knob <b>212</b> can sequentially move the inner shaft assembly <b>18</b>, outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, and nose cone shaft assembly <b>31</b> relative to the rail assembly <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, actuation of the depth knob <b>212</b> can together move the inner shaft assembly <b>18</b>, outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, and mid shaft assembly <b>21</b> relative to the rail assembly <b>20</b>. Accordingly, the rail shaft <b>132</b> can be aligned at a particular direction, and the other assemblies can move distally or proximally with respect to the rail shaft <b>132</b> for final positioning while not releasing the implant <b>70</b>. The components can be advanced approximately 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 cm along the rail shaft <b>132</b>. The components can be advanced more than approximately 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 cm along the rail shaft <b>132</b>. An example of this is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>. The capsule <b>106</b> and outer retention ring <b>42</b> can then be individually withdrawn with respect to the inner assembly <b>18</b> as discussed above, in some embodiments sequentially, releasing the implant <b>70</b>. The assemblies other than the rail assembly <b>20</b> can then be withdrawn back over the rail shaft <b>132</b> by rotating the depth knob <b>212</b> in the opposite direction.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0248">The handle <b>14</b> can further include a mechanism (knob, button, handle) <b>216</b> for moving the nose cone shaft <b>27</b>, and thus the nose cone <b>28</b>. For example, a knob <b>216</b> can be a portion of the nose cone assembly <b>31</b> that extends from a proximal end of the handle <b>14</b>. Thus, a user can pull or push on the knob <b>216</b> to translate the nose cone shaft <b>27</b> distally or proximally individually with respect to the other shafts. This can be advantageous for proximally translating the nose cone <b>28</b> into the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>/capsule <b>106</b>, thus facilitating withdraw of the delivery system <b>10</b> from the patient.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0249">In some embodiments, the handle <b>14</b> can provide a lock <b>218</b>, such as a spring lock, for preventing translation of the nose cone shaft <b>27</b> by the knob <b>216</b> discussed above. In some embodiments, the lock <b>218</b> can be always active, and thus the nose cone shaft <b>27</b> will not move without a user disengaging the lock <b>218</b>. The lock can be, for example, a spring lock that is always engaged until a button <b>218</b> on the handle <b>14</b> is pressed, thereby releasing the spring lock and allowing the nose cone shaft <b>27</b> to translate proximally/distally. In some embodiments, the spring lock <b>218</b> allows one-way motion, either proximal or distal motion, of the nose cone shaft <b>27</b> but prevents motion in the opposite direction.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0250">The handle <b>14</b> can further include a communicative flush port for flushing out different lumens of the delivery system <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, a single flush port on the handle <b>14</b> can provide fluid connection to multiple assemblies. In some embodiments, the flush port can provide fluid connection to the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, the flush port can provide fluid connection to the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b> and the mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>. In some embodiments, the flush port can provide fluid connection to the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, the mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, and the rail assembly <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, the flush port can provide fluid connection to the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, the mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, the rail assembly <b>20</b>, and the inner assembly <b>18</b>. Thus, in some embodiments, the rail shaft <b>132</b>, the outer retention ring <b>42</b>, and the capsule <b>406</b> can all be flushed by a single flush port.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Valve Delivery Positioning</heading><p id="p-0213" num="0251">Methods of using the delivery system <b>10</b> in connection with a replacement mitral valve will now be described. In particular, the delivery system <b>10</b> can be used in a method for percutaneous delivery of a replacement mitral valve to treat patients with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. The below methods are merely examples of the how the delivery system may be used. It will be understood that the delivery systems described herein can be used as part of other methods as well.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0252">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, in one embodiment the delivery system <b>10</b> can be placed in the ipsilateral femoral vein <b>1074</b> and advanced toward the right atrium <b>1076</b>. A transseptal puncture using known techniques can then be performed to obtain access to the left atrium <b>1078</b>. The delivery system <b>10</b> can then be advanced in to the left atrium <b>1078</b> and then to the left ventricle <b>1080</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> shows the delivery system <b>10</b> extending from the ipsilateral femoral vein <b>1074</b> to the left atrium <b>1078</b>. In embodiments of the disclosure, a guide wire is not necessary to position the delivery system <b>10</b> in the proper position, although in other embodiments, one or more guide wires may be used.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0253">Accordingly, it can be advantageous for a user to be able to steer the delivery system <b>10</b> through the complex areas of the heart in order to position a replacement mitral valve in line with the native mitral valve. This task can be performed with or without the use of a guide wire with the above disclosed system. The distal end of the delivery system can be advanced into the left atrium <b>1078</b>. A user can then manipulate the rail assembly <b>20</b> to target the distal end of the delivery system <b>10</b> to the appropriate area. A user can then continue to pass the bent delivery system <b>10</b> through the transseptal puncture and into the left atrium <b>1078</b>. A user can then further manipulate the delivery system <b>10</b> to create an even greater bend in the rail assembly <b>20</b>. Further, a user can torque the entire delivery system <b>10</b> to further manipulate and control the position of the delivery system <b>10</b>. In the fully bent configuration, a user can then place the replacement mitral valve in the proper location. This can advantageously allow delivery of a replacement valve to an in-situ implantation site, such as a native mitral valve, via a wider variety of approaches, such as a transseptal approach.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0254">The rail assembly <b>20</b> can be particularly advantageous for entering into the native mitral valve. As discussed above, the rail assembly <b>20</b> can form two bends, both of which can be located in the left atrium <b>1078</b>. The bends in the rail assembly <b>20</b> can position the prosthesis <b>70</b>, located in the implant retention area <b>16</b>, so that it is coaxial with the native mitral valve. Once the prosthesis <b>70</b> is coaxial, the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, inner assembly <b>18</b>, and nose cone assembly <b>31</b> can together be advanced (e.g., using the depth knob <b>212</b> of the handle <b>14</b>) distally relative to the rail assembly <b>20</b>. These assemblies advance straight off of the rail assembly <b>20</b>, thus advancing them coaxial with the native mitral valve until the prosthesis <b>70</b> is to be released while maintain the prosthesis <b>70</b> in the compressed configuration, as discussed below. Thus, the rail assembly <b>20</b> provides the ability for a user to lock the angular position in place, so that the user then has to just longitudinally advance the other assemblies over the rail assembly <b>20</b> while not needed to make any angular changes, greatly simplifying the procedure. The rail assembly <b>20</b> acts as an independent steering assembly, where all the assembly does is provide steerability and no further prosthesis release functionality. Further, the construction of the rail assembly <b>20</b> as described above is sufficiently rigid so that when the rail assembly is actuated to its bent shape, movement of the other components, e.g., the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, inner assembly <b>18</b>, and/or nose cone assembly <b>31</b>, the rail assembly <b>20</b> maintains its shape. Thus, the rail assembly <b>20</b> can remain in the desired bent position during the sliding of the other assemblies relative to the rail assembly <b>20</b>, and the rail assembly <b>20</b> can help direct the other assemblies to the final position. The proximal/distal translation of the other assemblies over the rail assembly <b>20</b> allows for ventricular-atrial motion. In addition, once the distal anchors <b>80</b> of the prosthesis <b>70</b> have been released in the left ventricle <b>1080</b>, but prior to full release, the other assemblies can be proximally retracted over the rail assembly <b>20</b> to capture any leaflets or chordae.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0255">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> which illustrates a schematic representation of a portion of an embodiment of a replacement heart valve (prosthesis <b>70</b>) positioned within a native mitral valve of a heart <b>83</b>.

A portion of the native mitral valve is shown schematically and represents typical anatomy, including a left atrium <b>1078</b> positioned above an annulus <b>1106</b> and a left ventricle <b>1080</b> positioned below the annulus <b>1106</b>. The left atrium <b>1078</b> and left ventricle <b>1080</b> communicate with one another through a mitral annulus <b>1106</b>.

The portion of the prosthesis <b>70</b> disposed upstream of the annulus <b>1106</b> (toward the left atrium <b>1078</b>) can be referred to as being positioned supra-annularly. The portion generally within the annulus <b>1106</b> is referred to as positioned intra-annularly. The portion downstream of the annulus <b>1106</b> is referred to as being positioned sub-annularly (toward the left ventricle <b>1080</b>).</p><p id="p-0218" num="0256">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, the replacement heart valve (e.g., prosthesis <b>70</b>) can be positioned so that the mitral annulus <b>1106</b> is located the distal anchors <b>80</b> and the proximal anchors <b>82</b>.

The distal anchors <b>80</b> can be positioned such that the ends or tips of the distal anchors <b>80</b> are on a ventricular side of the native leaflets beyond a location where chordae tendineae <b>1110</b> connect to free ends of the native leaflets. The distal anchors <b>80</b> may extend between at least some of the chordae tendineae <b>1110</b> and, in some situations such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, can contact or engage a ventricular side of the annulus <b>1106</b>. It is also contemplated that in some situations, the distal anchors <b>80</b> may not contact the annulus <b>1106</b>, though the distal anchors <b>80</b> may still contact the native leaflet <b>1108</b>.

The degree of tension provided on the chordae tendineae <b>1110</b> can differ. For example, little to no tension may be present in the chordae tendineae <b>1110</b> where the leaflet <b>1108</b> is shorter than or similar in size to the distal anchors <b>80</b>. A greater degree of tension may be present in the chordae tendineae <b>1110</b> where the leaflet <b>1108</b> is longer than the distal anchors <b>80</b> and, as such, takes on a compacted form and is pulled proximally. An even greater degree of tension may be present in the chordae tendineae <b>1110</b> where the leaflets <b>1108</b> are even longer relative to the distal anchors <b>80</b>. The leaflet <b>1108</b> can be sufficiently long such that the distal anchors <b>80</b> do not contact the annulus <b>1106</b>.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0259">The proximal anchors <b>82</b>, if present, can be positioned such that the ends or tips of the proximal anchors <b>82</b> are adjacent the atrial side of the annulus <b>1106</b> and/or tissue of the left atrium <b>1078</b> beyond the annulus <b>1106</b>. In some situations, some or all of the proximal anchors <b>82</b> may only occasionally contact or engage atrial side of the annulus <b>1106</b> and/or tissue of the left atrium <b>1078</b> beyond the annulus <b>1106</b>. For example, as illustrate in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, the proximal anchors <b>82</b> may be spaced from the atrial side of the annulus <b>1106</b> and/or tissue of the left atrium <b>1078</b> beyond the annulus <b>1106</b>. The proximal anchors <b>82</b> could provide axial stability for the prosthesis <b>70</b>. It is also contemplated that some or all of the proximal anchors <b>82</b> may contact the atrial side of the annulus <b>1106</b> and/or tissue of the left atrium <b>1078</b> beyond the annulus <b>1106</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> illustrates the prosthesis <b>70</b> implanted in the heart. Although the illustrated replacement heart valve includes both proximal and distal anchors, it will be appreciated that proximal and distal anchors are not required in all cases. For example, a replacement heart valve with only distal anchors may be capable of securely maintaining the replacement heart valve in the annulus. This is because the largest forces on the replacement heart valve are directed toward the left atrium during systole. As such, the distal anchors are most important for anchoring the replacement heart valve in the annulus and preventing migration.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Delivery Method</heading><p id="p-0222" num="0260"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>23</b></figref> illustrate the release mechanism of the delivery system <b>10</b>.

As discussed above, the user can provide multiple bends in the rail assembly <b>20</b> to direct the delivery system <b>10</b> towards the mitral valve. In particular, the bends of the rail assembly <b>20</b> can direct a distal end of the delivery system <b>10</b>, and thus the capsule <b>106</b>, along the center axis passing through the native mitral valve. Thus, when the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, inner assembly <b>18</b>, and nose cone assembly <b>31</b> are together advanced over the rail assembly <b>20</b> with the compressed prosthesis <b>70</b>, the capsule <b>106</b> proceed directly in line with the axis for proper release of the prosthesis <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0264">The user can also rotate and/or move the handle <b>14</b> itself in a stand for further fine tuning of the distal end of the delivery system <b>10</b>. The user can continually turn the proximal and/or distal pull wire knobs <b>208</b>/<b>206</b>, as well as moving the handle <b>14</b> itself, to orient the delivery system <b>10</b> for release of the prosthesis <b>70</b> in the body. The user can also further move the other assemblies relative to the rail assembly <b>20</b>, such as proximally or distally.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0265">In a next step, the user can rotate the depth knob <b>212</b>. As discussed, rotation of this knob <b>212</b> together advances the inner shaft assembly <b>18</b>, mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, and nose cone assembly <b>31</b> over/through the rail assembly <b>20</b> while the prosthesis <b>70</b> remains in the compressed configuration within the implant retention area <b>16</b>. Due to the rigidity of, for example, either the inner shaft assembly <b>18</b>, the mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, and/or the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, these assemblies proceed straight forward in the direction aligned by the rail assembly <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0266">Once in the release position, the user can rotate the outer sheath knob <b>210</b>, which individually translates the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b> (and thus the capsule <b>106</b>) with respect to the other assemblies, in particular the inner assembly <b>18</b>, in a proximal direction towards the handle <b>14</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>. By doing so, the distal end <b>303</b> of prosthesis <b>70</b> is uncovered in the body, allowing for the beginning of expansion. At this point, the distal anchors <b>80</b> can flip proximally and the distal end <b>303</b> begins to expand radially outwardly. For example, if the system <b>10</b> has been delivered to a native mitral valve location through a transseptal approach, the nose cone is positioned in the left ventricle, preferably aligning the prosthesis <b>70</b> such that it is generally perpendicular to the plane of the mitral annulus. The distal anchors <b>80</b> expand radially outwardly within the left ventricle. The distal anchors <b>80</b> can be located above the papillary heads, but below the mitral annulus and mitral leaflets. In some embodiments, the distal anchors <b>80</b> may contact and/or extend between the chordae in the left ventricle, as well as contact the leaflets, as they expand radially. In some embodiments, the distal anchors <b>80</b> may not contact and/or extend between the chordae or contact the leaflets. Depending on the position of the prosthesis <b>70</b>, the distal ends of the distal anchors <b>80</b> may be at or below where the chordae connect to the free edge of the native leaflets.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0267">As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the distal end <b>303</b> of the prosthesis <b>70</b> is expanded outwardly. It should be noted that the proximal end <b>301</b> of the prosthesis <b>70</b> can remain covered by the outer retention ring during this step such that the proximal end <b>301</b> remains in a radially compacted state. At this time, the system <b>10</b> may be withdrawn proximally so that the distal anchors <b>80</b> capture and engage the leaflets of the mitral valve, or may be moved proximally to reposition the prosthesis <b>70</b>. For example, the assemblies may be proximally moved relative to the rail assembly <b>20</b>. Further, the system <b>10</b> may be torqued, which may cause the distal anchors <b>80</b> to put tension on the chordae through which at least some of the distal anchors may extend between. However, in some embodiments the distal anchors <b>80</b> may not put tension on the chordae. In some embodiments, the distal anchors <b>80</b> may capture the native leaflet and be between the chordae without any further movement of the system <b>10</b> after withdrawing the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0268">During this step, the system <b>10</b> may be moved proximally or distally to cause the distal or ventricular anchors <b>80</b> to properly capture the native mitral valve leaflets. This can be done by moving the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, inner assembly <b>18</b>, and nose cone assembly <b>31</b> with respect to the rail assembly <b>20</b>. In particular, the tips of the ventricular anchors <b>80</b> may be moved proximally to engage a ventricular side of the native annulus, so that the native leaflets are positioned between the anchors <b>80</b> and the body of the prosthesis <b>70</b>. When the prosthesis <b>70</b> is in its final position, there may or may not be tension on the chordae, though the distal anchors <b>80</b> can be located between at least some of the chordae.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0269">The proximal end <b>301</b> of the prosthesis <b>70</b> will remain in the outer retention ring <b>42</b> after retraction of the capsule <b>106</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, once the distal end <b>303</b> of the prosthesis <b>70</b> is fully expanded (or as fully expanded as possible at this point), the outer retention ring <b>42</b> can be individually withdrawn proximally with respect to the other assemblies, in particular relative to the inner assembly <b>18</b>, to expose the inner retention member <b>40</b>, thus beginning the expansion of the proximal end <b>301</b> of the prosthesis <b>70</b>. For example, in a mitral valve replacement procedure, after the distal or ventricular anchors <b>80</b> are positioned between at least some of the chordae tendineae and/or engage the native mitral valve annulus, the proximal end <b>301</b> of the prosthesis <b>70</b> may be expanded within the left atrium.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0270">The outer retention ring <b>42</b> can be moved proximally such that the proximal end <b>310</b> of the prosthesis <b>70</b> can radially expand to its fully expanded configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>. After expansion and release of the prosthesis <b>70</b>, the inner assembly <b>18</b>, nose cone assembly <b>31</b>, mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, and outer sheath assembly <b>22</b> can be simultaneously withdrawn proximally along or relative to the rail assembly <b>20</b> back to their original position. In some embodiments, they are not withdrawn relative to the rail assembly <b>20</b> and remain in the extended position. Further, the nose cone <b>28</b> can be withdrawn through the center of the expanded prosthesis <b>70</b> and into the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, such as by proximally translating the knob <b>216</b>. The system <b>10</b> can then be removed from the patient.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0271"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-B</figref> illustrate the advancement of the different assemblies over the rail assembly <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>A</figref> illustrates the assemblies in their proximalmost position over the rail assembly <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>B</figref> illustrates the assemblies in their distalmost position as compared to the rail assembly <b>20</b>, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>.

Further, echocardiography can be used for proper positioning of the prosthesis <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0273">Following is a discussion of an alternative implantation method for delivering a replacement mitral valve to a mitral valve location. Elements of the below can be incorporated into the above discussion and vice versa. Prior to insertion of the delivery system <b>10</b>, the access site into the patient can be dilated. Further, a dilator can be flushed with, for example, heparinized saline prior to use. The delivery system <b>10</b> can then be inserted over a guide wire. In some embodiments, any flush ports on the delivery system <b>10</b> can be pointed vertically. Further, if an introducer tube is used, integrated or otherwise, this can be stabilized. The delivery system <b>10</b> can be advanced through the septum until a distal end of the delivery system <b>10</b> is positioned across the septum into the left atrium <b>1078</b>. Thus, the distal end of the delivery system <b>10</b> can be located in the left atrium <b>1078</b>. In some embodiments, the delivery system <b>10</b> can be rotated, such as under fluoroscopy, into a desired position. The rail can be flex so that direct a distal end of the delivery system <b>10</b> towards the septum and mitral valve. The position of the delivery system <b>10</b>, and the prosthesis <b>70</b> inside, can be verified using echocardiography and fluoroscopic guidance.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0274">In some embodiments, the prosthesis <b>70</b> can be located, prior to release, above the mitral annulus <b>1106</b>, in line with the mitral annulus <b>1106</b>, or below the mitral annulus <b>1106</b>. In some embodiments, the prosthesis <b>70</b> can be located, prior to expansion, fully above the mitral annulus <b>1106</b>, in line with the mitral annulus <b>1106</b>, just below the mitral annulus <b>1106</b>, or fully below the mitral annulus <b>1106</b>. In some embodiments, the prosthesis <b>70</b> can be located, prior to expansion, partially above the mitral annulus <b>1106</b>, in line with the mitral annulus <b>1106</b>, or partially below the mitral annulus <b>1106</b>. In some embodiments, a pigtail catheter can be introduced into the heart to perform a ventriculogram for proper viewing.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0275">In some embodiments, the position of the mitral plane and the height of any papillary muscles on the fluoroscopy monitor can be marked to indicate an example target landing zone. If needed, the delivery system <b>10</b> can be unflexed, reduced in rotation, and retracted to reduce tension on the delivery system <b>10</b> as well as reduce contact with the left ventricular wall, the left atrial wall, and/or the mitral annulus <b>1106</b>.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0276">Further, the delivery system <b>10</b> can be positioned to be coaxial to the mitral annulus <b>1106</b>, or at least as much as possible, while still reducing contact with the left ventricular wall, the left atrial wall, and/or the mitral annulus <b>1106</b> and reducing delivery system tension. An echo probe can be positioned to view the anterior mitral leaflet (AML), the posterior mitral leaflet (PML) (leaflets <b>1108</b>), mitral annulus <b>1106</b>, and outflow tract. Using fluoroscopy and echo imaging, the prosthesis <b>1010</b> can be confirmed to be positioned at a particular depth and coaxiality with the mitral annulus <b>1106</b>.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0277">Afterwards, the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b> can be retracted to expose the ventricular anchors <b>80</b>, thereby releasing them. In some embodiments, once exposed, the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b> can be reversed in direction to relieve tension on the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, reversing the direction could also serve to partially or fully capture the prosthesis <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0278">The distal anchors <b>80</b> can be released in the left atrium <b>1078</b>. Further, the proximal anchors <b>82</b>, if included in the prosthesis <b>70</b>, are not yet exposed. Moreover, the body of the prosthesis <b>70</b> has not undergone any expansion at this point. However, in some embodiments, one or more of the distal anchors <b>80</b> can be released in either the left atrium <b>1078</b> (e.g., super-annular release) or generally aligned with the mitral valve annulus <b>1106</b> (e.g., intra-annular release), or just below the mitral valve annulus <b>1106</b> (e.g., sub-annular release).

This may allow the distal anchors <b>80</b> to snake through the chordae upon release. This can advantageously allow the prosthesis <b>70</b> to slightly contract when making the sharp turn down toward the mitral valve. In some embodiments, this may eliminate the need for a guide wire assisting to cross the mitral valve.

The proximal anchors <b>82</b>, if any, can remain within the delivery system <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, all of the distal anchors <b>80</b> can be flipped together. In other embodiments, a subset of the distal anchors <b>80</b> can be flipped while at a first position and another subset of the distal anchors <b>80</b> can be released while at a second position. For example, some of the distal anchors <b>80</b> can be flipped in the left atrium <b>1078</b> and some of the distal anchors <b>80</b> can be flipped while generally aligned with the mitral valve annulus <b>1106</b> or just below the mitral valve annulus <b>1106</b>.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0282">In some embodiments, the distal anchors <b>80</b> may be positioned in line with the annulus <b>1106</b> or just below the annulus <b>1106</b> in the non-flipped position. In some embodiments, the distal anchors <b>80</b> may be position in line with the annulus <b>1106</b> or just below the annulus <b>1106</b> in the flipped position. In some embodiments, prior to flipping the distalmost portion of the prosthesis <b>70</b> can be located within or below the mitral valve annulus <b>1106</b>, such as just below the mitral valve annulus <b>1106</b>.

In some embodiments, the proximal anchors <b>82</b> could be released when the distal anchors <b>80</b> are sub-annular and the entire prosthesis <b>70</b> can be pulled up into the left atrium <b>1078</b> such that the proximal anchors <b>82</b> are supra-annular prior to release. In some embodiments, the proximal anchors <b>82</b> could be intra-annular prior to release and the systolic pressure could push the prosthesis <b>70</b> atrially such that the proximal anchors <b>82</b> end up supra-annular.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0298">After, the leaflet capture and positioning of the prosthesis <b>70</b> can be confirmed, along with the relatively perpendicular position with respect to the mitral annular plane. In some embodiments, the nosecone <b>28</b> can then be withdrawn until it is within the prosthesis <b>70</b>. The mid shaft assembly <b>21</b> can be further retracted until the prosthesis <b>70</b> is released from the delivery system <b>10</b>. Proper positioning of the prosthesis <b>70</b> can be confirmed using TEE and fluoroscopic imaging.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0299">Following, the delivery system <b>10</b> can be centralized within the prosthesis <b>70</b>. The nosecone <b>28</b> and delivery system <b>10</b> can then be retracted into the left atrium <b>1078</b> and removed.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0300">This intra-super annulus release can have a number of advantages. For example, this allows the distal anchors <b>82</b> to be properly aligned when contacting the chordae <b>1110</b>. If the distal anchors <b>82</b> were released in the left ventricle <b>1080</b>, this could cause misalignment or damage to heart tissue, such as the leaflets <b>1108</b> or chordae <b>1110</b>.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0301">In an alternate delivery approach, the delivery system <b>10</b> can be translated into the left ventricle <b>1080</b> prior to release of the prosthesis <b>70</b>. Thus, the distal end of the prosthesis <b>70</b>, and thus the distal anchors <b>82</b>, can be released and flipped partially, or fully within the left ventricle <b>1080</b>. Accordingly, in some embodiments the anchors <b>70</b> can be released/flipped below the mitral annulus <b>1106</b>, just below the mitral annulus <b>1106</b>, and/or below the free edges of the leaflets <b>1108</b>. Further, the anchors <b>70</b> can be released above the papillary heads. Similar methodology as discussed above can then be used to properly position the prosthesis <b>70</b> and remove the delivery system <b>10</b> to deliver the prosthesis <b>1010</b>. Further, in some embodiments the distal anchors <b>82</b> can be released without expanding the prosthesis initially in the ventricle <b>1080</b>.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Planetary Handle Gear</heading><p id="p-0264" num="0302">As discussed above, the delivery system <b>10</b> can include multiple shafts and one or more pull wires, some or all of which may be translated longitudinally/axially with respect to one another. However, having more movable components requires some sort of axial translation, which means that the handle <b>14</b> tends to become longer. This occurs because the different components within the handle <b>14</b> are generally moving in series, and thus there must be sufficient longitudinal space between handle components.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0303">In order to prevent further lengthening of the handle <b>14</b>, or even to provide a reduction in size of the handle <b>14</b>, a planetary gear system can be used in the handle <b>14</b>. This planetary handle gear system can be used in conjunction with, or instead of, the current linear screws in the delivery system <b>10</b>. Embodiments of the planetary gears are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A and <b>25</b>B</figref>, wherein the components can be located within a handle housing, such as handle <b>14</b>. By incorporating the disclosed planetary gears, rotary motion can be converted into linear motion in such a way that it allows room for multiple linear translation members to occupy the same area in the handle <b>14</b>, thereby shortening the handle design. Thus, instead of the different components being in series, they are in parallel. The disclosed planetary gear system can allow knobs or other rotatable actuating mechanisms on the handle <b>14</b> that control axial movement or bending of various shafts or lumens of the delivery system <b>10</b> to be placed much closer to one another.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0304">In some embodiments, the handle <b>14</b> may include one or more outermost gears (e.g., ring gear <b>2502</b>), which can be connected to a rotatable knob on the handle <b>14</b> such as disclosed above. The ring gear <b>2502</b> can encompass an entire circumference or substantially an entire circumference of the handle <b>14</b> and thus be connected directly to a knob. Alternatively, the ring gear <b>2502</b> may be smaller than the handle <b>14</b> and connected to a knob by one or more intermediate components.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0305">Further, the handle <b>14</b> can include one or more planet gears <b>2504</b> within the ring gear <b>2502</b>. The planet gears <b>2504</b> can be smaller in circumference/diameter than the ring gear <b>2502</b> and may be interlocked within an inner surface of the ring gear <b>2504</b>. The planet gear <b>2504</b> can be axially and circumferentially fixed in place, though in some embodiments it may not be. If fixed in place, the planet gear <b>2504</b> is only allowed to rotate in place by rotation of the ring gear <b>2504</b>, and thus does not translate around a circumference of the ring gear <b>2502</b>. This can prevent any components attached to the gear system from circumferentially moving around the ring gear <b>2504</b>.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0306">Additionally, the planet gear <b>2504</b> can have an internal thread which can mate with a linear travel screw <b>2506</b>, which can be attached to any of the axially translating components (e.g., shaft assemblies such as the outer sheath assembly <b>22</b>, the mid shaft assembly <b>21</b>, the inner assembly <b>18</b>, and/or the nose cone assembly <b>31</b>) discussed above. Thus, as the ring gear <b>2502</b> is rotated by the handle <b>14</b>, the ring gear <b>2502</b> will rotate the planet gear <b>2504</b> in place, which will each in turn translate the linear travel screw <b>2506</b> in an axial direction. Thus, the rotational motion of the ring gear <b>2502</b> can be converted into linear translation of the travel screw <b>2506</b>, providing the linear translation discussed above.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0307">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A and <b>25</b>B</figref>, the planetary gear system could control multiple planet gears <b>2504</b> of the ring gear <b>2502</b>. In some embodiments, the handle <b>14</b> can contain multiple planetary gear systems, such as a 2, 3, 4, or 5 gear system. In some embodiments, each ring gear <b>2502</b> can include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 planet gears <b>2504</b>.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Valve Deployment Simulation Catheter</heading><p id="p-0270" num="0308">As discussed above, the delivery system <b>10</b> (or other delivery system) can include a rigid component attached to the prosthesis <b>70</b> prior to full implant deployment. For example, the prosthesis <b>70</b> generally surrounds nose cone shaft <b>27</b>, which can be a generally rigid shaft. When still partially or fully within the delivery system <b>10</b>, the prosthesis <b>70</b> may be forced into the proper position by the delivery system <b>10</b>, which may be against the natural anatomy of the valve area. However, the prosthesis <b>70</b> can jump or move inside the patient's anatomy once detached from the delivery system <b>10</b>, such as when uncovered by the outer retention ring <b>42</b> or capsule <b>106</b>. This can occur because when the prosthesis <b>70</b> is removed from the delivery system <b>10</b>, it loses the support of the delivery system <b>10</b> and moves to a non-resistant position inside the natural valve anatomy.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0309">Thus, if the prosthesis <b>70</b> is not co-axial with the native anatomy, or perpendicular to the native annulus, when the prosthesis <b>70</b> is deployed, the prosthesis <b>70</b> loses the rigid support the delivery system <b>10</b> is exerting. If the prosthesis <b>70</b> does not capture the leaflets, then the valve can move into a position where a paravalvular leak forms around the prosthetic valve leaflets.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0310">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>A-<b>26</b>B</figref>, the delivery system <b>10</b> can include both a rigid shaft <b>2602</b> and a bendable (e.g., flexible) shaft <b>2604</b> for connection to the nosecone <b>2606</b>. These components can replace the nose cone shaft <b>27</b> discussed above. The rigid shaft <b>2602</b> can still be somewhat flexible but is just less bendable than the bendable shaft <b>2604</b>.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0311">As shown, the rigid shaft <b>2602</b> can surround the bendable shaft <b>2604</b> so that the bendable shaft <b>2604</b> extends within a lumen of the rigid shaft <b>2602</b>. Thus, the rigid shaft <b>2602</b> prevents significant bending of the bendable shaft <b>2604</b>. The rigid shaft <b>2602</b> can extend all the way to the nosecone <b>2606</b>, or may extend only partially over the bendable shaft <b>2604</b>. The bendable shaft <b>2604</b> may attach to the nosecone <b>2606</b> as discussed in conjunction with the nose cone shaft <b>27</b>. The bendable shaft <b>2604</b> may be, for example, wires, cut shafts, a bendable polymer, or other materials and the particular material is not limiting.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0312">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>A</figref>, while delivering the prosthesis <b>70</b>, the rigid shaft <b>2602</b> may be in a fully distal position covering the bendable shaft <b>2604</b>. Once in the desired position, the rigid shaft <b>2602</b> can be proximally withdrawn as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>B</figref> and the prosthesis <b>70</b> may be partially released from the delivery system <b>10</b>. Thus, the bendable shaft <b>2604</b> will allow the prosthesis <b>70</b> to conform with the natural patient anatomy while the prosthesis <b>70</b> is still attached to the delivery system <b>10</b>. If the positioning is not proper, an operator can cover the prosthesis <b>70</b> and/or distally translate the rigid shaft <b>2602</b> and try another position. The bendable shaft <b>2604</b> can eliminate most of the rigid support the delivery system exerts on the prosthesis <b>70</b> once uncovered by the rigid shaft <b>2602</b>.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0313">In some embodiments, instead of using a rigid shaft <b>2602</b>, the bendable shaft <b>2604</b> can transition from a &#x201c;rigid&#x201d; structure to a less rigid &#x201c;bendable&#x201d; structure.

In order to engage/disengage with one another, the layers can be rotated relative to one another.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0315">Specifically, the inner retention member <b>40</b> and the outer retention member <b>42</b> can be locked together until any motion is desired. In some embodiments, the members <b>40</b>/<b>42</b> can be threaded together. In some embodiments, the components can have additional locking features, which an operator can unlock when the operator wants to move the outer retention member <b>42</b> axially with respect to the inner retention member <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0316">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>, the inner retention member <b>40</b> can include an outward (or outer or external) threading <b>2702</b> on its proximal end. Alternatively, or in conjunction with, the inner shaft <b>126</b> can include an outer threading. The outer retention member <b>42</b> can include an inner threading for attachment to the inner retention member <b>40</b>. Alternatively, or in conjunction with any of the above configurations, the mid shaft <b>43</b> may include an inner threading.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0317">Thus, an operator can translate the prosthesis <b>70</b> within the delivery system <b>10</b> to a location while the inner retention member <b>40</b> and the outer retention member <b>42</b> are locked together (e.g., threaded together). The operator can torque or rotate either one of the inner retention member <b>40</b> and the outer retention member <b>42</b>, or both in some embodiments, in order to unlock the members <b>40</b>/<b>42</b> from one another. The operator can then axially withdraw the outer retention ring <b>42</b> to release the prosthesis <b>70</b>. By connecting the two components at their distal ends, the risk of unintentional release is mitigated as the members <b>40</b>/<b>42</b> cannot move with respect to one another when locked together.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0318">While the inner retention member <b>40</b> and the outer retention member <b>42</b> are disclosed with the torqueing features discussed herein, other components such as the rail assembly <b>20</b>, nose cone assembly <b>31</b>, or outer sheath assembly <b>22</b> may additionally include such features to connect different shaft assemblies.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Spine Alignment Deflection Stabilization</heading><p id="p-0281" num="0319">In some embodiments, it can be advantageous to further include additional structural elements that can be configured to reduce deflection about a flex plane of certain shafts in the delivery system <b>10</b>.

This can cause incidental (e.g., undesired) rotation of the shafts while using the delivery system <b>10</b> as an inner shaft <b>3004</b> can freely rotate within an outer shaft <b>3002</b> without constraint. To avoid this rotation, the handle <b>14</b> may utilize different connectors to prevent rotation. However, as the handle is at a proximal end of the shafts or lumens, this type of delivery system does not ensure that the two shafts are clocked or keyed along the lengths of the shafts all the way to the distal ends, or at least at the distal ends.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0324">Accordingly, in some embodiments, the shafts or lumens (e.g., pull wire lumens <b>139</b> of the rail assembly <b>20</b>) disclosed herein may be &#x201c;keyed&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b>, <b>31</b>A and <b>31</b>B</figref>.

For example, the outer shaft member <b>3510</b> can have a single radial aperture <b>3506</b> extending around all or a portion of a circumference of the distal end portion of the outer shaft member <b>3510</b> and the inner manifold <b>3504</b> can have multiple circumferentially-spaced apart radial apertures <b>3505</b>. As another example, the outer shaft member <b>3510</b> can include the same number of apertures as the inner manifold <b>3504</b> and corresponding apertures may be configured to align with each other circumferentially. The at least one aperture <b>3505</b> of the inner manifold <b>3504</b> includes a proximally- and/or radially outward-facing tooth <b>3508</b> extending from a distal edge of the aperture <b>3505</b> toward a proximal edge of the aperture <b>3505</b>. The tether <b>3502</b> (e.g., one loop end of the tether <b>3502</b>) can wrap around the tooth <b>3508</b>. The outer shaft member <b>3510</b> of the manifold assembly can cover at least the proximal portion of the aperture <b>3505</b> in the locked position, or configuration, thereby preventing the tether <b>3502</b> (e.g., looped end of the tether <b>3502</b>) from releasing (e.g., from being able to come off or be released from the tooth <b>3508</b>) when in the locked position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>A</figref>. The outer shaft member <b>3510</b> and/or the inner shaft manifold <b>3504</b> can be translated axially relative to each other. When the outer shaft member <b>3510</b> is proximally withdrawn or the inner manifold <b>3504</b> is distally advanced, to an unlocked configuration, the proximal end of tooth <b>3508</b> is exposed and the tether <b>3502</b> (e.g., looped end of the tether <b>3502</b>) can be released from the tooth <b>3508</b>, thereby facilitating decoupling of the prosthesis <b>70</b> from the manifold assembly of the delivery system while the tether <b>3502</b> remains attached to the inner manifold <b>3504</b>. As the delivery system is withdrawn or removed from a desired implantation location (e.g., mitral valve annulus such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b> or <b>20</b></figref>, tricuspid valve annulus, atrioventricular valve annulus), the tether <b>3502</b> is pulled through the eyelet or other retention member of the prosthesis <b>70</b> such that the prosthesis <b>70</b> is no longer tethered, as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>B</figref> by the eyelet of the prosthesis <b>70</b> without a tether <b>3502</b>.

The sutures <b>3602</b> can extend through the lumen of a middle shaft <b>3606</b> and out a distal end of the middle shaft <b>3606</b>. The middle shaft <b>3606</b> can have a release disc <b>3608</b> on or within a distal end of the middle shaft <b>3606</b>. The sutures <b>3602</b> can loop proximally (e.g., from a distal side of the release disc <b>3608</b>) through apertures <b>3613</b> in the release disc <b>3608</b> and extend proximally to wrap around teeth <b>3614</b> of an outer ring <b>3610</b>.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0337">In the locked position, or configuration, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b>A</figref>, the disc <b>3608</b> can be proximally withdrawn to abut the teeth <b>3614</b>, thereby preventing release of the sutures <b>3602</b>.

The threshold force may be a level of force or load substantially below a calculated failure level during testing so that risk of failure is reduced. For example, if the one or more lumens or shafts of the shaft assembly <b>12</b> have an ultimate tensile strength of 20 lbs., the threshold force can be 10 lbs. for a safety factor of 2 or can be 15 lbs. for a safety factor of 1.5.

For example, the shorter the distance between the first and second portions <b>602</b>, <b>606</b> and the greater length of the connector <b>604</b> that is covered, the less force F that may be applied to the adapter <b>610</b>. Moreover, the greater the distance between the first and second portions <b>602</b>, <b>606</b> and the greater length of the connector <b>604</b> is uncovered, the greater the force F that may be applied to the adapter <b>610</b>. Accordingly, as the force F is reduced, the distance between the first and second portions <b>602</b>, <b>606</b> and the length of the connector <b>604</b> that is uncovered may decrease. In some embodiments, the distance between the first and second portions <b>602</b>, <b>606</b> may be inversely related to the force F being applied.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0357">The connector <b>604</b> may include indicators along the length of the connector <b>604</b> that can correlate with the force F being applied to the delivery system <b>10</b>. For example, the indicators can include colors, bands, stripes, numbers, shapes, symbols, or the like. The connector <b>604</b> can include any number of indicator(s). For example, the connector <b>604</b> can include one, two, three, four, five, six, or more than six indicator(s). In some embodiments, the connector <b>604</b> may include three indicators. The three indicators can include a band of different colors. For example, the three indicators can include one or more red bands, one or more yellow bands, and one or more green bands. The one or more green bands can include a single green band at or near the middle of the connector <b>604</b>. The one or more red bands can include two red bands that can be positioned adjacent the first and second portions <b>602</b>, <b>606</b>. The one or more yellow bands can include two yellow bands that can be positioned between the green band and the red bands. The green band can indicate that the amount of force being applied to the delivery system <b>10</b> is within an acceptable range or a preferred range. The red bands can indicate that the amount of force being exerted on the delivery system <b>10</b> is in an unacceptable range and the user should reduce the amount of force. The yellow bands can indicate the amount of force being applied to the delivery system <b>10</b> is within an acceptable range but the amount of force is increasing to the unacceptable range or the amount of force is decreasing to the preferred range.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0358">In some embodiments, the second portion <b>606</b> can be positioned distally of the first portion <b>602</b> on the handle <b>14</b>&#x2032;. The distance between the first and second portions <b>602</b>, <b>606</b> may be inversely related to the force F being exerted on the delivery system <b>10</b>. For example, the greater the distance between the first and second portions <b>602</b>, <b>606</b> and the greater length of the connector <b>604</b> is uncovered, the less the force F that may be applied to the adapter <b>610</b>. Accordingly, as the force F is increased, the distance between the first and second portions <b>602</b>, <b>606</b> and the length of the connector <b>604</b> that is uncovered may decrease.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0359">In some embodiments, the indicator knob <b>600</b> can include the same or similar functionality as the failsafe knob <b>500</b>. For example, a distance between the first and second portions <b>602</b>, <b>606</b> of the indicator knob <b>600</b> may increase as the force F being exerted on the delivery system <b>10</b> increases, as described above. Once the force F reaches a threshold force, the first and second portions <b>602</b>, <b>606</b> may decouple.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0360">From the foregoing description, it will be appreciated that an inventive product and approaches for implant delivery systems are disclosed.
