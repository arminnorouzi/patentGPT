id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Described herein are systems and methods that may efficiently detect multi-return light signals. A light detection and ranging system, such as a LIDAR system, may fire a laser beam that may hit multiple objects with a different distance in one line, causing multi-return light signals to be received by the system. Multi-return detectors may be able to analyze the peak magnitude of a plurality of peaks in the return signals and determine a multitude of peaks, such as the first peak, the last peak and the maximum peak. One embodiment to detect the multi-return light signals may be a multi-return recursive matched filter detector. This detector comprises a matched filter, peak detector, centroid calculation and a zeroing out function. Other embodiments may be based on a maximum finder that algorithmically selects the highest magnitude peaks from samples of the return signal and buffers for regions of interests peaks.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="156.55mm" wi="140.46mm" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="181.69mm" wi="142.49mm" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="215.39mm" wi="157.40mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="154.60mm" wi="132.84mm" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="200.66mm" wi="145.37mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="202.35mm" wi="168.66mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="196.17mm" wi="135.30mm" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="191.18mm" wi="135.13mm" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="203.28mm" wi="131.91mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="227.92mm" wi="168.99mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="234.02mm" wi="172.04mm" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-D00011" he="225.47mm" wi="154.26mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-D00012" he="223.18mm" wi="156.55mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00013" num="00013"><img id="EMI-D00013" he="228.35mm" wi="156.55mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00013.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00014" num="00014"><img id="EMI-D00014" he="228.77mm" wi="166.88mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00014.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00015" num="00015"><img id="EMI-D00015" he="217.85mm" wi="122.77mm" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00015.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00016" num="00016"><img id="EMI-D00016" he="228.52mm" wi="169.59mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00016.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00017" num="00017"><img id="EMI-D00017" he="231.73mm" wi="172.97mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00017.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00018" num="00018"><img id="EMI-D00018" he="215.65mm" wi="150.71mm" file="US20230003579A1-20230105-D00018.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a divisional application of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser.

Technical Field</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for detection of multi-return light signals. More particularly, the present disclosure may relate to a LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">B. Background</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Light detection and ranging systems, such as LIDAR systems, may employ pulses of light to measure distance to an object based on the time of flight (TOF) of each pulse of light. A pulse of light emitted from a light source of a light detection and ranging system interacts with a distal object. A portion of the light reflects from the object and returns to a detector of the light detection and ranging system. Based on the time elapsed between emission of the pulse of light and detection of the returned pulse of light, the distance to the object may be estimated. In some embodiments, pulses of light may be generated by a laser emitter. The light pulse may be focused through a lens or lens assembly. The light pulse may hit multiple objects, each having a different distance from the laser, causing multi-return signals to be received by the light detection and ranging system detector. Multi-return signals may provide more information of the environment to improve mapping or reconstruction. A dedicated detector may be required to precisely identify each return with its associated time delay information.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, light detection and ranging system detectors are based on peak detection technology and may only detect and record one or at most two returns. In one embodiment, a matched filter associated with a peak detector may only detect one return. Such detector methods may limit the accuracy of mapping or reconstruction.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, what is needed are systems and methods that may efficiently detect multi-return light signals in a light detection and ranging system, such as LIDAR system.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">References will be made to embodiments of the invention, examples of which may be illustrated in the accompanying figures.

Light Detection and Ranging System</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A light detection and ranging system, such as a LIDAR system, may be a tool to measure the shape and contour of the environment surrounding the system. LIDAR systems may be applied to numerous applications including both autonomous navigation and aerial mapping of a surface. LIDAR systems emit a light pulse that is subsequently reflected off an object within the environment in which a system operates. The time each pulse travels from being emitted to being received may be measured (i.e., time-of-flight &#x201c;TOF&#x201d;) to determine the distance between the object and the LIDAR system. The science is based on the physics of light and optics.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a LIDAR system, light may be emitted from a rapidly firing laser. Laser light travels through a medium and reflects off points of things in the environment like buildings, tree branches and vehicles. The reflected light energy returns to a LIDAR receiver (detector) where it is recorded and used to map the environment.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts operation <b>100</b> of a light detection and ranging system <b>102</b> according to embodiments of the present document. Light detection and ranging system <b>102</b> may comprise a transmitter <b>104</b> that transmits emitted light signal <b>110</b>, receiver <b>106</b> comprising a detector, and system control and data acquisition <b>108</b>. Emitted light signal <b>110</b> propagates through a medium and reflects off object <b>112</b>. Return light signal <b>114</b> propagates through the medium and is received by receiver <b>106</b>. System control and data acquisition <b>108</b> may control the light emission by transmitter <b>104</b> and the data acquisition may record the return light signal <b>114</b> detected by receiver <b>106</b>. Data analysis &#x26; interpretation <b>109</b> may receive an output from system control and data acquisition <b>108</b> and perform data analysis functions. Transmitter <b>104</b> and receiver <b>106</b> may include an optical lens (not shown). Light detection and ranging system <b>102</b> may be a LIDAR system and transmitter <b>104</b> may emit a laser beam have a plurality of pulses in a particular sequence.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the operation <b>200</b> of light detection and ranging system <b>202</b> including multi-return light signals: (1) return signal <b>203</b> and (2) return signal <b>205</b> according to embodiments of the present document. Light detection and ranging system <b>202</b> may be a LIDAR system. Due to the laser's beam divergence, a single laser firing often hits multiple objects producing multiple returns. The light detection and ranging system <b>202</b> may analyze multiple returns and may report either the strongest return, the last return, or both returns. Per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, light detection and ranging system <b>202</b> emits a laser in the direction of near wall <b>204</b> and far wall <b>208</b>. As illustrated, the majority of the beam hits the near wall <b>204</b> at area <b>206</b> resulting in return signal <b>203</b>, and another portion of the beam hits the far wall <b>208</b> at area <b>210</b> resulting in return signal <b>205</b>. Return signal <b>203</b> may have a shorter TOF and a stronger received signal strength compared with return signal <b>205</b>. Light detection and ranging system <b>202</b> may record both returns only if the distance between the two objects is greater than minimum distance. In both single and multi-return LIDAR systems, it is important that the return signal is accurately associated with the transmitted light signal so that an accurate TOF is calculated.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Some embodiments of a LIDAR system may capture distance data in a 2-D (i.e. single plane) point cloud manner. These LIDAR systems may be often used in industrial applications and may be often repurposed for surveying, mapping, autonomous navigation, and other uses. Some embodiments of these devices rely on the use of a single laser emitter/detector pair combined with some type of moving mirror to effect scanning across at least one plane. This mirror not only reflects the emitted light from the diode, but may also reflect the return light to the detector. Use of a rotating mirror in this application may be a means to achieving 90-180-360 degrees of azimuth view while simplifying both the system design and manufacturability.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a LIDAR system <b>300</b> with a rotating mirror according to embodiments of the present document. LIDAR system <b>300</b> employs a single laser emitter/detector combined with a rotating mirror to effectively scan across a plane. Distance measurements performed by such a system are effectively two-dimensional (i.e., planar), and the captured distance points are rendered as a 2-D (i.e., single plane) point cloud. In some embodiments, but without limitations, rotating mirrors are rotated at very fast speeds e.g., thousands of revolutions per minute. A rotating mirror may also be referred to as a spinning mirror.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">LIDAR system <b>300</b> comprises laser electronics <b>302</b>, which comprises a single light emitter and light detector. The emitted laser signal <b>301</b> may be directed to a fixed mirror <b>304</b>, which reflects the emitted laser signal <b>301</b> to rotating mirror <b>306</b>. As rotating mirror <b>306</b> &#x201c;rotates&#x201d;, the emitted laser signal <b>301</b> may reflect off object <b>308</b> in its propagation path. The reflected signal <b>303</b> may be coupled to the detector in laser electronics <b>302</b> via the rotating mirror <b>306</b> and fixed mirror <b>304</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As previously noted, time of flight or TOF is the method a LIDAR system uses to map the environment and provides a viable and proven technique used for detecting target objects. Simultaneously, as the lasers fire, firmware within a LIDAR system may be analyzing and measuring the received data. The optical receiving lens within the LIDAR system acts like a telescope gathering fragments of light photons returning from the environment. The more lasers employed in a system, the more the information about the environment may be gathered. Single laser LIDAR systems may be at a disadvantage compared with systems with multiple lasers because fewer photons may be retrieved, thus less information may be acquired. Some embodiments, but without limitation, of LIDAR systems have been implemented with 8, 16, 32 and 64 lasers. Also, some LIDAR embodiments, but without limitation, may have a vertical field of view (FOV) of 30-40&#xb0; with laser beam spacing as tight as 0.3&#xb0; and may have rotational speeds of 5-20 rotations per second.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The rotating mirror functionality may also be implemented with a solid state technology such as MEMS.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">B. Multi-Return Matched Filter Detectors</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As previously noted, one objective for a LIDAR system is the efficient detection of multi-return light signals. One method to achieve this objective may be a multi-return matched filter detector.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For LIDAR sensors, one laser fire may hit multiple objects with a different distance in one line, causing multiple return signals to be received, as discussed relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In some embodiments, a dedicated detector may be required to precisely identify each return with time delay information. Multi-return perception provides more information of environment for mapping or reconstruction. Many current LIDAR detectors are based on peak detection and may only detect and record one or at most two returns. This architecture may limit the accuracy of mapping or reconstruction.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">1. Peak Detectors</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In simple terms, a peak detector may be a detector whose output voltage approximates the true peak value of an applied signal. The peak detector tracks the signal in a sample mode and preserves the highest input signal in a hold mode. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> depicts peak detector <b>400</b> according to embodiments of the current disclosure. An input signal <b>402</b> may be coupled to a threshold comparator <b>404</b>, which in turn may be coupled to a buffer <b>406</b>, which in turn may be coupled to a maximum finder <b>408</b>. The output of maximum finder <b>408</b> may be peak signal <b>410</b>. The operational steps of the peak detector <b>400</b> may include: (1) Threshold Comparator <b>404</b>: Compare input signal <b>402</b> with a pre-set threshold, and generate output signal samples that may be greater than the pre-set threshold; (2) Buffer <b>406</b>: Buffer output samplers received from threshold comparator <b>404</b>; and (3) Maximum finder <b>408</b>: Determine the maximum output signal samples among the samples in buffer <b>406</b> and generate peak signal <b>410</b>. In one embodiment, maximum finder determines the largest peak. In another embodiment, the maximum finder determines the largest peak and the second largest peak. The operational steps may be executed in a specific time period. By way of example, but without limitations, a detector may operate at 8 samples per clock period. Therefore, for 1000 samples, the specific time period may be 1000/8 or 125 clock periods. A clock period may be a millisecond. A challenge with peak detectors can be that they may need to operate at their highest (signal-to-noise) S/N ratio in order to distinguish the signal from the noise. This may mean setting a high threshold in threshold comparator <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> depicts embodiment <b>420</b> of threshold detection <b>421</b> based on the operating noise environment and a target error rate (false alarm) according to embodiments of the current disclosure. The operating noise <b>422</b> and the targeted error rate <b>424</b> may be input into threshold detection <b>421</b>, which may determines a threshold <b>426</b>. When the operating noise <b>422</b> and/or the targeted error rate vary, the threshold <b>426</b> may be adjusted. Threshold <b>426</b> may define the pre-set threshold of threshold comparator <b>404</b> of peak detector <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Peak detection may be based on threshold detection or slope detection. For the case of threshold detection, a threshold derivation for a peak detector <b>440</b> may be utilized to achieve a certain probability of false alarm (P<sub>fa</sub>), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. The goal may be to achieve a certain level of false alarm, P<sub>fa.</sub>, i.e., error rate. Conditions for the threshold derivation may include: no signal and only additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), The distribution of the received signal may be viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, which graphically illustrates the threshold derivation for a peak detector according to embodiments of the current disclosure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> the y-axis represents the probability and the x-axis represents the position for the received signal displayed in a Gaussian distribution. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> illustrates the relationship between false alarms and noise characteristics.
