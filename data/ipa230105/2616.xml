Water pollution not only affects the environment and human well-being, but also disrupts the balance of the ecosystem. Many factors can cause water pollution such as herbicides, pesticides, toxic metal ions, and pathogens. Therefore, treating wastewater before its release back into the environment is crucial.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Organic dyes are an important synthetic component of hazardous water pollutants. Several methods have been used in the art to treat wastewater containing organic dyes, including electrochemical oxidation techniques using metal plates, adsorption methods, and photocatalytic methods. Photocatalysis using semiconductor nanomaterials has gained attention as a cost effective, green, and efficient method for decomposing various organic and inorganic pollutants.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a semiconductor nanomaterials is irradiated UV or visible light with at least the same energy as the band gap energy, electron-hole pairs (e<sup>&#x2212;</sup>/h<sup>+</sup>) are generated in the conduction band and the valence band of the semiconductor, respectively. The photo-generated charge carriers, i.e., electrons and holes, then migrate to the surface of the semiconductor nanoparticle and potentially become efficient reducing or oxidizing species.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Different semiconductor nanomaterials have been used for photocatalytic oxidation and reduction processes, including TiO<sub>2</sub>, ZnO, CdO, CdS, ZnS, etc. Among the various known semiconductor nanomaterials, zinc oxide (ZnO), particularly as a nanomaterial, has become a widely investigated metal oxide semiconductor as a suitable material for widespread environmental and energy applications due to its distinctive characteristics including environmental tolerability, photocatalytic activity, low cost, and biocompatibility. However, ZnO has the disadvantage that it is susceptible to two dissolution processes during the heterogeneous photocatalysis. The first dissolution process is chemical dissolution with species in solution and the second dissolution process is the photochemical dissolution, where the photogenerated holes can oxidize the ZnO. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of ZnO is limited by a high rate of charge carrier recombination and limited visible light absorption.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Several approaches have been attempted at decreasing the dissolution rate of ZnO nanoparticles, including surface and morphology modifications. Other approaches have focused on extending the absorption range of ZnO nanomaterials, for example, by metal/non-metal doping, metal loading, coupling with other semiconductor, hybridization with carbon nanomaterials such as graphene oxide (GO), and dye sensitization. Amongst these methods, photosensitizing ZnO nanomaterials with organometallic dyes has shown potential as an efficient and convenient method.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Recently, ZnO sensitized with cobalt-phthalocyanine indicated efficient visible light photocatalysis for cyanide degradation. ZnO nanorod sensitized with nickel phthalocyanine also exhibited photocatalytic activity for Rhodamine B transformation. Photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine 6G has also been achieved using zinc phthalocyanine in the presence of ZnO. Other efforts in the art are known.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">CN 103134753 A by Li et al. (M.
