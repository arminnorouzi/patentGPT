FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The field is that of tracking the use and maintenance of generator sets, and in particular portable generator sets intended in particular for occasional or temporary use on any type of site and terrain.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure thus finds particular use in the field of portable generator sets and more generally mobile systems including means of producing electricity, such as soldering sets or lighting poles. These various systems will hereinafter be known by the term &#x201c;generator set&#x201d;.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Portable generator sets enable users to have a device for furnishing electricity temporarily or continuously, or for furnishing electricity on any type of site or terrain not supplied with electricity in a fixed manner (construction, housing, harbors, etc.). They can be owned by private individuals or professionals, or used on location by rental equipment companies or made available by equipment leasing companies.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Classically, a generator set includes a chassis on which in particular an engine and an alternator are mounted. The engine, typically a thermal engine, drives the alternator in rotation in such a way as to produce the electricity.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The generator sets require regular maintenance, depending on the identified operating times as determined by the manufacturer and mentioned for example in the instruction materials. It is consequently useful to measure the durations of the use, or operation, of a generator set in order to determine when maintenance is necessary.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Hence it is important that the user, or the person responsible for this on the premises of a rental company, knows these durations and defines in good time when maintenance operations are required and performs the required maintenance operations, or sees that they are performed, in good time. This is necessary in order to guarantee the proper function and the reliability of the generator set.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Certain sets, particularly high-capacity sets, are equipped with integrated tracking means (e.g., tracking device) that measure the presence of an electrical current and/or voltage produced by the set, and means for calculating (e.g., calculator) the corresponding operating times and for managing maintenance. On the other hand, portable generator sets generally have such a device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In fact, these devices are not easily adaptable to portable generator sets, especially by reason of compactness and/or the production cost, since they are sold commercially at relatively low prices.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Users must therefore make their own estimate of the operating times and thus the times when maintenance is needed. This lack of tracking other than manually is a disadvantage of such portable generator sets, since they can consequently result in irregular or insufficient upkeep or maintenance, since for proper operation, the generator sets require regular maintenance and upkeep so that their performance and durability, in particular, are unchanged.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Poor tracking of the upkeep of these portable generator sets, which can also be associated with poor handling (impacts, exposure to extreme temperatures, etc.), can lead to faster deterioration of the generator set and hence to a shorter service life than intended, which is not satisfactory.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, in addition to the possibility of deterioration of the generator set, irregular maintenance, that is, maintenance not conforming to manufacturers' recommendations, can lead to risks for the users.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Hence there is a need to improve these portable generator sets.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">3. BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">One objective of the present disclosure is accordingly to at least partially overcome these disadvantages of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">This objective, as well as others which may become apparent in the course of the present description, are achieved with the aid of an autonomous device for tracking the usage time of a generator set, capable of furnishing at least one piece of characteristic information for an operating time of said generator set, the device including:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0016">at least one first sensor capable of measuring a first parameter representing a state of operation of said generator set;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0017">processing means (e.g., a data processor) furnishing said characteristic information for an operating time, as a function of said first parameter;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0018">means for internal storage (e.g., memory) of said characteristic information for an operating time;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0019">transmission means (e.g., transmitter or communication interface) capable of transmitting said characteristic information for an operating time to a terminal or an external server.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">Thus the disclosure proposes a novel and inventive approach making it possible to overcome, at least partially, the disadvantages of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">In particular, such a device enables a user to have an external tracking tool (such as a telephone, tablet, computer, server, etc.) that can track the operating time of the user's generator sets in an independently determined manner; in other words, in particular for measuring the electrical voltage or intensity produced, and consequently for performing the required maintenance operations, or having them performed, at the right time, it is unnecessary to be connected electrically to the generator set.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">Using a sensor that is capable of measuring a parameter that represents an operating status of the generator set in an autonomous device makes it possible, without being electrically connected to it, to detect whether or not the generator set is in operation. What the sensor picks up is not an electrical current, but a physical phenomenon representing the fact that the set is in operation, such as vibrations or temperatures produced by the engine, or an electromagnetic field produced by the alternator. The autonomous device ensures that the operating times detected are added up and can transmit the overall length that it has compiled in such a way that it can be determined whether maintenance is necessary. Tracking the usage times of the generator set and hence tracking the maintenance of the generator set are thus made more reliable in a simple manner.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">In addition, because there is no connection to the electricity-producing components (e.g., the alternator or output filter) of the generator set, it becomes possible, easily and inexpensively, to integrate the device with a portable generator set in such a way that, as applicable, it takes the form of an optional element capable of being put in place at any time over the lifetime of the generator set.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">In one embodiment, the device includes at least one second sensor capable of measuring a second parameter representing a state of operation of said generator set, said generator set being considered functional by said processing means when the two sensors furnish parameters indicating a potential operation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">Because at least two sensors are used, it is possible to provide extremely accurate characteristic information about an operating time; in particular, this avoids detecting operation incorrectly, particularly when a sole sensor has detected a phenomenon that is similar to something that could be produced by the set, but in reality is from outside it. For example, such a piece of characteristic information cannot be perturbed, vibrated, or otherwise adversely affected by the outdoor environment in which the generator set is located (vibrations caused by transporting the set in a small truck, an electromagnetic field resulting from a high-tension wire, etc.), and consequently the transmission means transmit the characteristic information from an operating time that is reliable.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">In this approach, the processing means considers the generator set to be in operation when the two sensors measure the parameters that indicate potential operation, or in other words when the first sensor and the second sensor both pick up a parameter indicating that the generator set is in operation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">In other words, the characteristic information for a state of operation is only delivered if the two sensors measure a parameter indicating that the set is in operation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">In one aspect of at least one embodiment, said sensor or sensors belong to the set including:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0029">a magnetic sensor capable of picking up the presence of a magnetic field generated by an alternator of said generator set;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0030">a vibration sensor capable of sensing vibrations generated by a engine of said generator set.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0026" num="0031">These two pieces of information are in fact characteristics of the operation of a generator set and are relatively easy to detect and analyze.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0032">It is understandable that the presence of two sensors, one magnetic and the other for vibration, in a particular embodiment, is of interest, since it enables detecting that the two major elements of the set are in operation, that is, the alternator and the engine. This also makes it possible to effectively reduce the risk of incorrect detection.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0033">In an aspect of at least one embodiment, said first sensor is a magnetic sensor capable of picking up the presence of an electromagnetic field of between 25 and 450 &#x3bc;T.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0034">With this order of magnitude for the measurements of the first sensor, it is possible to dispense with detecting residual fields that are not characteristic of a state of operation of the generator set (for example, a magnetic field from the external environment).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0035">In another aspect of at least one embodiment, said second sensor is a vibration sensor capable of picking up vibrations of between 20 and 200 Hz.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0036">In a particular characteristic of at least one embodiment, the device includes geolocation means.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0037">Such means can for example permit tracking and monitoring of the location and the use of the sets, as well as facilitating maintenance, especially in the context of managing a facility for portable generator sets (for example, a leasing company or a business that owns multiple sets) which may be contending with theft or with finding a set that had gone missing.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0038">In a particular aspect of at least one embodiment, the communication means employ a Bluetooth&#xae; Low Energy communications protocol.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0039">This makes it possible to achieve or optimize the autonomy of the device.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0040">In still another aspect of at least one embodiment, the device includes unique means of identification.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0041">This can make it possible to facilitate tracking and as applicable to identify the owner of the set, in the case of theft or loss.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0042">The disclosure also relates to a generator set having or including an autonomous device for tracking usage times in accordance with one of the embodiments cited above.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0043">In one characteristic of at least one embodiment, the autonomous device for tracking the usage time is affixed to the chassis by way of a coupling device or other mechanical fixation means.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0044">In this case, the mechanical fixation means can be irreversible, and in particular adapted to detect whether they have been removed or tampered with (for example such that not all the hours of use are shown).</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">4.

The periphery of this light can have a reinforcing ring, which may for example be of metal.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0065">The device <b>1</b> includes a second portion <b>12</b> having a greater thickness than the first portion <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0066">In this embodiment, the first portion <b>10</b> has a thickness of between 1 mm and 5 mm (on the order of 5 mm in the version shown), and the second portion <b>12</b> has a thickness of between 10 mm and 20 mm (on the order of 13 mm in the version shown).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0067">Furthermore, such an autonomous device <b>1</b> can have a length (the longer side) of several centimeters, preferably less than 20 cm.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0068">Furthermore, such an autonomous device <b>1</b> has a width of several centimeters, preferably less than 10 cm.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0069">This difference in size between the first portion <b>10</b> and the second portion <b>12</b> forms a rim <b>11</b> defining the first and second portions. This rim can also form a protection for the means for affixing the device <b>1</b> to the generator set.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0070">The first portion <b>10</b>, in this embodiment, has an oval shape. The second portion <b>12</b>, on the other hand, has a substantially rectangular shape. Other shapes and dimensions are certainly conceivable.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0071">This autonomous device <b>1</b> for tracking the usage time of the generator set <b>9</b> is capable of furnishing at least one piece of characteristic information about an operating time of this generator set.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0072">Such a piece of characteristic information about this operating time can for example include a number of total hours of operation of the generator set, or a datum on a number of hours of continuous operation of this generator set.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0073">Further data can also be provided by this autonomous device, such as data from a maintenance log or about upkeep of the generator set, the date of activation, or the location of the generator set.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0074">The autonomous device can then include geolocation means in order to function. This last point may in particular be useful for finding the position of a set, in the context of rentals or large-scale construction.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0075">As illustrated in <figref

parameter representing a state of operation of the generator set <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0081">In the embodiments where a single sensor is employed in the device, the at least one characteristic information of a state of operation of the generator set furnished by the autonomous device depends on the first representative parameter measured.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0082">In this embodiment, the characteristic information of a state of operation of the generator set <b>9</b> furnished by the device <b>1</b> depends on the first and second representative parameters measured.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0083">This autonomous device can also include an independent power not connected to the generator set, so that it is clearly autonomous.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0084">In the embodiment shown, the first sensor <b>101</b> is a magnetic sensor capable of showing the presence of a magnetic field generated by the alternator <b>92</b> of the generator set.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0085">The representative parameter measured by this first sensor <b>101</b> is thus linked to the rotation of the alternator of the generator set, which is a relatively strong parameter because there is a great difference between the magnetic field generated by the alternator <b>92</b> whether or not it is in operation.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0086">In fact, the difference in the displayed value of the magnetic field generated by the alternator is quite large whether the alternator is on or off.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0087">The fact that the device <b>1</b> is placed in proximity with the alternator, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, also makes reliable displays of this first measured representative parameter possible.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0088">On the other hand, this might be inadequate under certain circumstances, such as if the set is located close to an external source that itself produces a magnetic field (high-tension wires, for example, or some other set that is nearby.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0089">Hence a refined analysis of the magnetic field produced can be provided, for extracting from it a specific characteristic of the alternator (information which can also be used to monitor the state of the alternator and detect an anomaly if one occurs.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0090">In another approach, a vibration sensor can be used that is capable of sensing the vibrations generated by the engine <b>91</b> of the generator set <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0091">Such a sensor makes it possible to detect the vibrations of the engine <b>91</b> when it is in operation.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0092">Moreover, again, this may not be sufficient, under certain circumstances, for example if the set is placed in a moving vehicle, which also produces vibrations.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0093">Then a refined analysis of the vibration produce can be provided for, in order to extract a specific characteristic from this pertaining to the engine (information which can also be used for monitoring the status of the engine and detecting an anomaly, if applicable).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0094">In one particular embodiment, the presence of (at least) two sensors, and in particular one magnetic field sensor and one vibration sensor.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0095">As a result, in the embodiment, the characteristic information of the operating time of the generator set <b>9</b> furnished by the device <b>1</b> can take into account the first and second representative parameters measured.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0096">The fact of having a first sensor <b>101</b> and second sensor <b>102</b> available makes it possible to furnish a piece of characteristic information for an operating time that is more reliable, and for example is not perturbed by the outdoor environment where the generator set is placed, and consequently makes it possible to put out a reliable datum by the transmission means <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0097">In fact, the generator set is considered by said processing means to be in operation when the two sensors furnish parameters indicating potential operation; that is, when the engine and alternator are in operation.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0098">In fact, on the hypothesis that the generator set is located in an environment where there is a strong magnetic force, the measurements made of the first representative parameter by the first sensor <b>101</b> may be perturbed. In any case, by recouping, using the measurements of the second representative parameter produced by the second sensor <b>102</b>, which is a vibration sensor, the finding of a magnetic field when the generator set is not in operation is not identified as an indication that the generator set is in operation, because then the second sensor does not sense vibrations from the engine <b>91</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0099">The situation is the same on the hypothesis of vibrations produced in the generator set, for example when it is being moved from place to place. On this hypothesis, the measurements of the second representative parameter made by the second sensor <b>102</b> can be perturbed because of the vibrations, for example due to irregularities of the road while the generator set is being transported. Nevertheless, by recouping, with the measurements of the first representative parameter made by the first sensor <b>101</b> that senses a magnetic field, the detection of vibrations when the generator set is not in operation is not identified as an operation of the generator set, because the first sensor does not then pick up a magnetic field from the alternator <b>92</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0100">Thus, taking the analysis of connected representative parameters into account, the magnetic field produced by the alternator <b>92</b> and the vibrations produced by the engine <b>91</b> here, the device then, by way of the processing means <b>104</b>, furnishes the characteristic information for an operating time of the generator set.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0101">In this embodiment, the first sensor <b>101</b> shows the presence of an electromagnetic field of between 5 &#x3bc;T and 750 &#x3bc;T, and more particularly of between 25 &#x3bc;T and 450 &#x3bc;T.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0102">In addition, the second sensor <b>102</b> senses vibrations of between 20 Hz and 200 Hz. More generally, and in the embodiments, this second sensor can sense vibrations of between 10 Hz and 1000 Hz.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0103">Because of this, with these orders of magnitude for the measurements of the first sensor <b>101</b> and the second sensor <b>102</b>, measurements of residual magnitudes that are not characteristic of a state of operation of the generator set are not made.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0104">It should be noted that in other embodiments, it can be provided that the first sensor and the second sensor are of other types.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0105">For example, one can employ a temperature sensor for instance for the engine temperature.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0106">One can also provide a tension sensor at the boundaries of elements of the generator set.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0107">An acoustic sensor can also be provided, for instance to evaluate the sound produced by the engine or by the rotation of the alternator.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0108">Again, one may provide an oil pressure sensor, a sensor for the speed of rotation of the alternator, or an air flux sensor.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0109">Finally, non-autonomous sensors may be provided, such as a sensor for an analog value of the alternator frequency, or a tension sensor connected with a power supply of the generator set.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0110">Furthermore, a mounting sensor for the autonomous device can also be provided on the chassis so as to assure that the autonomous device is mounted properly on the generator set.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0111">In addition, related functions for the sensors employed may be provided. For example, it be provided that the vibration sensor also senses a peak vibration corresponding to a shock on the generator set, for the purpose of producing a piece of information about the risk of deterioration of the generator set.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0112">The processing means or data processor <b>104</b> providing the characteristic information for an operating time can, for example, include a microcontroller, which receives the data provided by the sensors and performs processing of these data. Such processing can in particular be achieved in conjunction with a unit for time-based measurement; that unit furnishes a measurement of how much time has elapsed.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0113">The internal storage means or memory <b>106</b> for the characteristic information for an operating time has the objective of performing the storage of the data on operation of the device as well as, at least, the characteristic information for a length of operating time.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0114">This storage unit can also be used to safeguard the recordings of data, including in particular a date, time, and location, as well as the length of time the device was used. Other parameters may also be recorded, such as a time when put under tension, a time when something is being transported, etc.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0115">The characteristic information of the operating time of the generator set can then be transmitted by the transmission means to an external terminal or an external server.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0116">Such a terminal can for example be a user's smartphone or a tablet.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0117">The transmission means such as transmitter <b>103</b> or other communication interface that communicate the information can be based for example on a technology known by the name Bluetooth &#x201c;Low Energy&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0118">This kind of technology has the advantage of having low consumption of electricity or energy, which makes it possible for the device <b>1</b> to have relatively great energy autonomy, while still having a bidirectional link between the mobile terminal and the device.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0119">In any case, other embodiments can be provided in which the communication mode is unidirectional, from the device to the external mobile terminal or external server.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0120">Communication means based on an NFC, Zigbee, Bluetooth, Zwave, WiFi, LoRa, Sigfox as well as mobile cellular networks or low-power radio networks can be provided. In particular, the device can communicate via protocols destined for the &#x201c;internet of things&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0121">In this embodiment, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the device <b>1</b> further includes means <b>105</b> (e.g., identifier or identification device) for identifying this device.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0122">These identification means, in this embodiment, are unique in order to assure the uniqueness of the device is unitary and, for example, to avoid a change of device among the generator sets.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0123">It can be provided that such identification means (e.g., identifier or identification device) include a serial number linked with the serial number of the generator set. The identifier may be alphanumeric series etched on the autonomous device. The identifier may be a bar code, quick response code, or another scannable image on the autonomous device. The identifier may be a data storage element (e.g., memory) from which the identifier is read. The identifier may be a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag configured to generate a modulated signal when excited by a carrier signal from an external source.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0124">Means for identifying the device can also be provided, requiring matching up of this autonomous device with a mobile terminal, or with the generator set.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0125">As indicated above, one can also, in one embodiment, provide that the autonomous device has geolocation means (e.g., a geolocation device). The geolocation device is configured to receive one or more satellite signals and analyze the signal to calculate a position of the autonomous device relative to a location on Earth. The geolocation device may be a global positioning system (GPS) device.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0126">In this way, possible theft of the generator set can be remedied by detecting the position of the generator set or of the autonomous device.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0127">The device can also include indicators (electroluminescent diodes, screen) that indicate a state and/or signal a need for connection (if the last connection is too old), a need for maintenance (if the time recorded is longer than a threshold value), and so forth.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0128">The present embodiments has the advantage in particular that it enables a user to have the capability of tracking an operating time of a mobile generator set, or even a group of mobile generator sets, and to efficiently manage their maintenance.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0129">Another advantage, in at least one embodiment, is to furnish a solution that is reliable regardless of the context in which the generator set is used.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0130">Another advantage of at least one embodiment is to implement a device which is easy to use and not expensive to operate.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0131">It can also be noted that the installation of the device can be done at the time of manufacture of the set, or later, in the form of an option or a supplement.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a flow chart for operation of the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>.
