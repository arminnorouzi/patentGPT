the present disclosure is to provide a mirror unit that is suitable to constitute a high-accuracy interference optical system in a compact manner, and an optical module including the mirror unit.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a mirror unit including: a mirror device that includes a base including a first surface and a second surface opposite to the first surface, and a movable mirror supported in the base to be movable along a first direction that intersects the first surface; an optical function member including a third surface that faces the second surface, and a fourth surface opposite to the third surface; and a fixed mirror that is disposed on a side opposite to the mirror device with respect to the optical function member. The mirror device is provided with a first light passage portion that constitutes a first portion of an optical path between a beam splitter unit that constitutes an interference optical system in combination with the movable mirror and the fixed mirror, and the fixed mirror. The optical function member is provided with a second light passage portion that constitutes a second portion of the optical path between the beam splitter unit and the fixed mirror. The second surface of the base and the third surface of the optical function member are joined to each other.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the mirror unit, the optical function member is disposed between the mirror device and the fixed mirror, and the base of the mirror device is joined to the optical function member. Accordingly, the base is stably held in a state in which deformation of the base is suppressed. Accordingly, it is possible to operate the movable mirror in the mirror device with accuracy. In addition, the mirror device is provided with the first light passage portion that constitutes the first portion of the optical path between the beam splitter unit and the fixed mirror, and the optical function member is provided with the second light passage portion that constitutes the second portion of the optical path. Accordingly, it is possible to dispose an interference optical system constituted by the beam splitter unit, the movable mirror, and the fixed mirror with spatial efficiency. As described above, according to the mirror unit, it is possible to constitute the high-accuracy interference optical system in a compact manner.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the mirror unit according to the aspect of the present disclosure, the second surface of the base and the third surface of the optical function member may be joined to each other by direct bonding. According to this, it is possible to realize strong joining between the base of the mirror device and the optical function member.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the mirror unit according to the aspect of the present disclosure, the fixed mirror may be formed on the fourth surface of the optical function member. According to this, it is possible to improve position accuracy and angle accuracy of the fixed mirror with respect to the movable mirror of the mirror device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the mirror unit according to the aspect of the present disclosure, the optical function member may further include a fifth surface that is separated from the mirror device at least in a region where the fifth surface faces the movable mirror. According to this, for example, even when a reference position in the case of reciprocating (vibrating) the movable mirror along the first direction is aligned to the third surface of the optical function member, it is possible to reciprocate the movable mirror along the first direction while preventing the movable mirror from coming into contact with the optical function member. Alignment of the reference position in the case of reciprocating the movable mirror along the first direction to the third surface of the optical function member is particularly effective for the case of correcting an optical path difference that occurs between an optical path between the beam splitter unit and the movable mirror, and an optical path between the beam splitter unit and the fixed mirror as to be described later.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the mirror unit according to the aspect of the present disclosure, the mirror device may be constituted by a semiconductor substrate, the semiconductor substrate may include a support layer that is a first semiconductor layer, a device layer that is a second semiconductor layer, and an intermediate layer that is an insulating layer disposed between the support layer and the device layer, the second surface of the base may be a surface opposite to the intermediate layer in the device layer, and a mirror surface of the movable mirror may be provided on a surface on the intermediate layer side in the device layer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the semiconductor substrate, the device layer is thinner than the support layer. Accordingly, for example, it is possible to make the mirror surface of the movable mirror closer to the optical function member in comparison to a &#x201c;configuration in which the second surface (joining surface with the optical function member) of the base is a surface opposite to the intermediate layer in the support layer, and the mirror surface of the movable mirror is provided on a surface opposite to the intermediate layer in the device layer.&#x201d; Accordingly, for example, it is possible to align the reference position in the case of reciprocating the movable mirror along the first direction to the third surface of the optical function member in an easy manner.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the mirror unit according to the aspect of the present disclosure, the fifth surface of the optical function member may extend to an outer edge of the optical function member when viewed from the first direction. According to this, even in a case where a gas exists in a region between the movable mirror and the fifth surface of the optical function member, the gas is likely to escape from the region, and thus it is possible to suppress an operation of the movable mirror from being hindered by the gas that exists in the region.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the mirror unit according to the aspect of the present disclosure, the first light passage portion may be a hole, the second light passage portion may be a light transmitting portion that corrects an optical path difference that occurs between an optical path between the beam splitter unit and the movable mirror, and an optical path between the beam splitter unit and the fixed mirror, and a surface of the light transmitting portion on the mirror device side may be located on the same plane as the third surface of the optical function member. Accordingly, for example, in the case of aligning the reference position when reciprocating the movable mirror along the first direction to the third surface of the optical function member, it is possible to correct an optical path difference between the both optical paths so that a difference between an optical path length of the optical path between the beam splitter unit and the movable mirror (optical path length in consideration of a refractive index of each medium through which the optical path passes), and an optical path length of the optical path between the beam splitter unit and the fixed mirror decreases.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the mirror unit according to the aspect of the present disclosure, the base may further include a sixth surface that is separated from the optical function member in a region including at least a part of an outer edge of the base when viewed from the first direction. Accordingly, when joining the second surface of the base and the third surface of the optical function member to each other, it is possible to perform handling of the mirror device by gripping the region in which the sixth surface is provided in the base.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the mirror unit according to the aspect of the present disclosure, the outer edge of the optical function member may be located outside of the outer edge of the base when viewed from the first direction. According to this, it is possible to realize strong joining between the base of the mirror device and the optical function member. In addition, it is possible to protect the outer edge of the base.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The mirror unit according to the aspect of the present disclosure may further include a stress mitigation substrate that is attached to the fourth surface of the optical function member with the fixed mirror interposed therebetween. When the mirror unit is provided in an installation target via the stress mitigation substrate, for example, even in a case where the installation target is deformed, it is possible to suppress the deformation from having an effect on the interference optical system.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an optical module including: the above-described mirror unit; and a beam splitter unit that constitutes an interference optical system in combination with the movable mirror and the fixed mirror.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the optical module, it is possible to constitute the high-accuracy interference optical system in a compact manner due to the above-described mirror unit.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the present disclosure, it is possible to provide a mirror unit that is suitable to constitute a high-accuracy interference optical system in a compact manner, and an optical module including the mirror unit.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an optical module of an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a plan view of a mirror unit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the mirror unit which is taken along line III-III illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the mirror unit which is taken along line IV-IV illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a mirror device which is taken along line V-V illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a partially enlarged view of the mirror device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a plan view of an optical function member illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the optical module which is taken along line VIII-VIII illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the optical module which is taken along line IX-IX illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of the mirror unit and a beam splitter unit which are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a beam splitter unit of a modification example.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a mirror unit of the modification example.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the mirror unit of the modification example.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the mirror unit of the modification example.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a plan view of the mirror unit of the modification example.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view for describing a process of manufacturing the mirror unit of the modification example.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view for describing the process of manufacturing the mirror unit of the modification example.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a plan view of a mirror device of the modification example.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a plan view of an optical function member of the modification example.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.
