Enterprise information management combines many enterprise class systems such as enterprise content management, business process management, customer experience management, and business intelligence. An enterprise information management system may utilize a content server to, among other things, store, and manage an organization or enterprise's digital assets such as content and documents (which are collectively referred to herein as &#x201c;managed objects&#x201d; or &#x201c;content objects&#x201d;). The content server conventionally operates behind the enterprise's firewall, and is configured so that only authorized users may have secure access to the managed objects in order to protect the managed objects.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It may be desirable for users associated with the enterprise to allow collaboration and/or file sharing between users. (&#x201c;Files&#x201d; is used herein to refer to managed objects that may include documents or other types of content.) In the case of external users (those who are not associated with the enterprise or who do not physically reside in a building of the enterprise), they are generally not authorized to access the enterprise's enterprise information management system. Consequently, they cannot view and/or edit any of the restricted files managed by the enterprise's content server. It may be possible to provide content sharing capabilities in a cloud-based system. For example, in one such system, managed objects may be uploaded by authorized enterprise users to a cloud-based file sharing system that is accessible by external users as well as enterprise users.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Collaborations between users of the file sharing system may, in various instances, require approval of one or more of the users. Typically, this will involve approval of a particular managed object, such as a document. The document may, for example, be an agreement, a change to a contract, or some other document that reflects some aspect of the collaboration. The documents may be subject to review and approval by one or more of the users. In this case, the document will be generated and then provided to the specific users whose approval is required. If a user approves of the document, the user may then electronically sign the document. In some instances, the user may modify the document and then sign the finalized document. When the document has been electronically signed, the document is stored with information indicating the corresponding electronic signature.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">While it is very beneficial to be able to electronically sign such documents, there are some disadvantages to this conventional approach. One of the drawbacks is that the approach is document-centric. The document must be prepared and finalized before it is signed, which may take a great deal of time and resources. Once the document is signed, the document and any data that is embedded in the document is typically locked. If multiple users are required to sign the document, it is normally necessary to send the finalized document (or a copy of the finalized document) to each of the users for their respective signatures. This approach may be inefficient and relatively inflexible, and may therefore be unsuitable for situations in which a user wishes to quickly and efficiently collect signature-verified data, rather than approval of a completed document.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present invention may provide solutions to one or more of the problems described above. For example, one embodiment enables the generation and sharing of electronically signed data in a collaborative cloud-based file sharing system. In this system, an authorized user can create a form that allows users to collaborate on the collection of data and to individually sign the respective data that is provided by each user. The collected data may be aggregated in a data structure such as a database table which includes data provided by multiple users, where the data is separate from the form. Data in the table which is provided by a particular user is signed by that user, while data in the table which is provided by another user is signed by the other user. The collection of the data in this manner eliminates the conventional document-centric approach. Thus, it is not necessary to generate a document which contains the data to which the user's electronic signature attests, and it is not necessary to provide a separate copy of the document (or a distinct document) to each user for that user's signature. In fact, the form may be changed during data collection, and data collection may be ended at any time (e.g., before all requested users have provided data and/or signatures). By eliminating the need to generate a completed document which is signed by the user, embodiments disclosed herein allow verified data to be collected more quickly and more easily than conventional approaches. Additionally, aggregating the electronically signed data of each user in a combined data structure may facilitate the use of the aggregated data, as compared to scenarios in which the data associated with each user is embedded in a separate electronically signed document.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One embodiment comprises a method for enabling collection of signed data in a collaborative content sharing platform. This method includes producing a form that has one or more data entry components and at least one signature block component. One or more assignee users of the collaborative content sharing platform are selected, and the form is provided to the selected assignee users, who are thereby enabled to access the form. The method further includes receiving information from at least one of the selected assignee users, the information including first input corresponding to at least one of the one or more data entry components, and second input associated with the first input, where the second input is indicative of an electronic signature of the assignee user. For each of the responding assignee users, the first input is stored with the corresponding second input indicative of the assignee user's electronic signature in a data structure which is separate from the form.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the first input of the assignee user and a reference to the electronic signature of the assignee user are stored in the same record of a database table. The database table does not contain the form, but may contain an identifier associated with the form. The database table may include multiple records, where each record corresponds to a different one of the responding assignee users (e.g., a first record may be associated with a first assignee user and a second record may be associated with a second assignee user). The selected assignee users may include a tenant user of the collaborative content sharing platform and/or an external user who is not a tenant of the collaborative content sharing platform. In the case of the tenant user, the method may include identifying electronic signature data stored in the collaborative content sharing platform, verifying the second input indicative of the electronic signature using the electronic signature data stored in the collaborative content sharing platform, and storing a reference to the electronic signature data stored in the collaborative content sharing platform. In the case of the external user, the method may include verifying the second input indicative of the electronic signature using electronic signature data external to the collaborative content sharing platform, and storing a reference to the electronic signature data In a record stored in the collaborative content sharing platform.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An alternative embodiment comprises a system for enabling collection of signed data, where the system includes a collaborative content sharing platform having one or more processors, one or more data storage devices communicatively coupled to the content sharing platform, and one or more user devices communicatively coupled to the content sharing platform. In this embodiment, the content sharing platform is configured to enable a first user on a first one of the one or more user devices to produce a form having one or more data entry components and at least one signature block component. The content sharing platform is further configured to enable the first user to select one or more assignee users from whom input will be requested through the form. The wherein the content sharing platform is further configured to provide the form to the selected assignee users and to enable the one or more selected assignee users to access the form. The content sharing platform receives input from one or more of these assignee users, the input of each assignee user including first input corresponding to at least one of the data entry components and second input indicative of an electronic signature of the corresponding assignee user. The content sharing platform stores the information for each of the responding assignee users in a data structure in the one or more data storage devices which is separate from the form.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The content sharing platform may be configured to store the first input for each assignee user with a corresponding reference to the electronic signature of that assignee user in the same record of a database table. The record may contain an identifier associated with the form, but does not contain the form. The content sharing platform may contain a forms app which is configured to enable the first user to build the form by selecting one or more form components, at least one of which is a signature component, adding the selected form components to the form, and configuring one or more attributes of the added form components. The content sharing platform may be configured, for assignee users who are tenant users of the collaborative content sharing platform, identify electronic signature data stored in a data storage device internal to the content sharing platform, verify the second input indicative of the electronic signature using the electronic signature data stored in the collaborative content sharing platform, and store a reference to the electronic signature data stored in the collaborative content sharing platform. The content sharing platform may be configured, for assignee users who are external user who are not tenants of the content sharing platform, verify the second input indicative of the electronic signature using electronic signature data external to the collaborative content sharing platform, and store a reference to the electronic signature data In a record stored in the collaborative content sharing platform.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another alternative embodiment comprises a computer program product including a non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions executable by one or more processors to perform a method that includes producing a form, selecting assignee users, providing the form to the selected assignee users, receiving input data and signatures from the assignee users, and storing the input data and corresponding electronic signature information in a data structure separate from the form. In some embodiments, first input data of an assignee user and a reference to the user's electronic signature are stored in the same record of a database table which may contain an identifier associated with the form, but does not contain the form itself. The database table may include multiple records, each corresponding to a different assignee user. The selected assignee users may include a tenant user of the collaborative content sharing platform and/or an external user who is not a tenant of the collaborative content sharing platform. For a tenant user, electronic signature data stored in the collaborative content sharing platform may be identified and verified, and a corresponding reference may be stored in the user's data record. For an external user, input indicative of the user's electronic signature may be verified using electronic signature data external to the collaborative content sharing platform, and a reference may be stored in the user's data record.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">One alternative embodiment comprises a system having a processor and a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium that stores computer instructions executable by the processor to perform a method substantially as described herein.

Descriptions of well-known starting materials, processing techniques, components, and equipment are omitted so as not to unnecessarily obscure the invention in detail.

Various substitutions, modifications, additions, and/or rearrangements within the spirit and/or scope of the underlying inventive concept will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">This disclosure describes a collaborative content sharing platform which may operate external to an enterprise computing environment, allowing users can safely and securely share and collaborate to generate objects such as combined data structures that store data collected by different users, portions of which are separately signed by the respective users that provided the data. The platform may, for example, enable an authorized user to create a form that can be provided to selected users, who can then enter data in the form, make selections presented in the form, or otherwise provide information through the form. The users can then provide an electronic signature via the form to attest to the information that they provided through the form. The information provided by each user is attached to the electronic signature of that user and is stored in a repository on the platform. While the information provided by each user may reference the form, the data is not stored in the form, but is instead stored apart from the form. The information provided by each user can therefore be easily used without having to first extract or separate the information from the form. The information provided by multiple users may also be aggregated in a single data structure, which allows the combined data to be easily viewed or used by an authorized user.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As noted above, electronic signatures conventionally are used in conjunction with specific documents&#x2014;a specific document is prepared and reviewed, and then the finalized document is electronically signed. The electronic signature is associated with the completed document. If several users electronically sign a document in a collaborative environment, each of the signatures is associated with the specific document on which they collaborated. Although information can be gleaned from the document, the information is normally integral with the document, and some effort must be taken to extract the information from the document in order to make use of the information. Embodiments of the present invention provide solutions to these problems. These embodiments still allow users to collaborate, but they collaborate using a form which allows each of the users to provide different information, and when they signed the form, each user's signature is associated with the specific information provided by that user, rather than the form document itself. The individually signed information may be stored in a structure such as a database table which may be directly accessed to make use of the data, rather than having to extract the information from multiple signed documents. The database table has the same types of data protections which are provided for other data on the content sharing platform.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the content sharing platform comprises a cloud-based multitenant system. Since there is a need to secure access to the managed objects and to prevent tenants from accessing other tenants' managed objects without authorization, the managed objects may be encrypted. An administrator for each tenant may configure access permissions for the tenant's managed objects in order to enable access by users (typically those associated with the tenant) to the managed objects. In some instances, it may be desirable for the tenant to share its managed objects with external users who are not part of the enterprise, not subscribed to content sharing platform, or not otherwise authenticated. Functionality is provided in the present embodiments to facilitate sharing and collaboration relating to collection of signed data without necessitating that a tenant administrator configure access permissions in each instance. This is accomplished in the present embodiments by building structure around the collaboration using shareable forms and electronic signature capabilities. The system may associate selected users with forms and may enable access by the users to the forms consistent with selection of the users by a user who has the necessary authorization to access the system.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagrammatic representation of a system <b>100</b> for collaboration based on an enterprise computing environment. In this example, internal users <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> reside on-prem within an enterprise computing environment <b>120</b>.

As mentioned above, in some cases, an enterprise user may need to collaborate and/or share files with external users, so enterprise computing environment <b>120</b> is connected by a network <b>130</b> to a cloud-based content sharing system <b>140</b>. Content sharing system <b>140</b> can be accessed by internal users <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> and external users (e.g. <b>150</b>) to collaborate. Shared data may be stored on data store <b>160</b>.

For example, an enterprise user may wish to collect information on a series of transformers that are in the field. The transformers may be inspected by contractors in the field who are not part of the enterprise (i.e., who may be &#x201c;external&#x201d; to the enterprise), so they may not have access to the enterprise information management system. Since the enterprise user needs input from these external contractors who will be inspecting the transformers, the enterprise user may generate a form and make this form available to the external users through the cloud-based content sharing system. The content sharing system may provide encryption and other security measures to control access to the form and the data that may be provided through the form. The enterprise may then share those objects according to access controls that are implemented by the content sharing system.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a diagrammatic representation of a distributed network computing environment in which embodiments disclosed herein can be implemented.

In this embodiment, an authorized user <b>302</b> accesses a form building application <b>304</b> on the content sharing platform. Authorized user <b>302</b> may, for example, be a tenant user associated with a tenant of the cloud-based multitenant system, where the tenant is a subscriber of the content sharing platform and the form building application. Authorized user <b>302</b> may log into the system and build a form <b>306</b> using the form building application. Form building application <b>304</b> may provide various different types of form elements that may be added to the form, such as text areas, formatted text or numeric fields, drop-down lists, dates, checkboxes, radio buttons, sliders, etc. each of the elements that are added to the form may be configured as needed by authorized user <b>302</b>. An electronic signature element is also added to form <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">After authorized user <b>302</b> has built form <b>306</b>, the user may identify other users that will be invited to provide information via form <b>306</b>. These users may include both internal users <b>308</b> and external users <b>310</b>. Users who are registered with the content sharing system, members of tenants subscribed to the system, or who otherwise have access to the system are considered internal users, for the purposes of this disclosure. Users who do not have such access to the system are considered external users for the purposes of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Users <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> have been invited to provide information through <b>306</b> form are then allowed to access the form. Internal users may login to the system using the same procedures by which they normally access the system. External users may access the form using links that are contained in their respective invitations to provide information via the form. Each user may provide all or a portion of the information that is requested on the form (i.e., information corresponding to the data entry elements provided in the form). After a user has provided information on the form, the user may electronically sign the form, thereby certifying that the corresponding data was provided by the attesting user.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The data which is provided by each user through the form is saved in a data structure which is separate from the form itself. For example, the data structure may be a database table <b>312</b> that includes fields for each of the elements in the form. A particular user's information may be stored as a single record in this database table. This record includes, for each of the fields, a corresponding value that was provided by the user. As noted above, the user need not provide entries for each one of the form elements.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">One of the fields in the database table is an electronic signature field that stores an indicator of the user's signature. In one embodiment, electronic signature data for the internal users is stored in a database <b>314</b> on the content sharing platform itself, so the indicator of the signature for these users may simply be a reference to this stored electronic signature data. Since the system does not store signature information for external users, the indicator of the electronic signature for external users may be retrieved from a separate, external database <b>316</b>, and may include a different type of information which may allow reference to, or verification of, the signature.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a flow diagram summarizing the collection of signed data on a content sharing platform in accordance with some embodiments is shown. In this embodiment an authorized user initially provides a form through which a user can enter data and sign the provided information (<b>405</b>). The form may be one that was previously created and stored on the content sharing platform, or it may be one that is newly created by the authorized user for the purpose of collecting the data. In the examples provided below, the creation of a new form will be described in more detail. Whether the form is one that was previously generated and stored, or one that is newly created, the authorized user may be referred to as the &#x201c;form owner&#x201d; for the purposes of describing this method.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the form that will be used to collect the data has been selected or created, the authorized user selects one or more users from the data will be collected (<b>410</b>). The users that are selected to provide the data may be internal users who are already registered with the content sharing platform, or they may be external users who are not known to the platform. Internal users may include, for example, members of entities that are tenants of the multitenant environment and subscribers to the content sharing platform. These internal users are capable of logging into the content sharing platform and using the platform, independent of their selection to provide data via the form. External users may not have access to the content sharing platform apart from their selection to provide data through the form, but are authorized via their selection by the authorized user to provide information through the form. Accordingly, these external users' access to the content sharing platform may be limited so that they are only allowed access which is necessary to provide the information requested on the form by the authorized user.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">After the form owner selects one or more users from home data will be collected using the form, the content sharing platform provides notifications to each of the selected users and enables these users to access the form (<b>415</b>). The notification to an internal user may, for example, comprise a notification dialog box which indicates that the user has been requested to provide information through the form. This notification may identify the form owner and provide a link to the form to facilitate the users access to the form. In the case of external users, the notification may, for example, comprise an email with a link to the form and a request for the user to provide information via the form.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">When the selected users receive the notification to provide input to the form, each user can access the form (e.g., via a link to the form included in the notification) and can input information to the form (<b>420</b>). As noted above, internal users' access to the content sharing platform may have already been enabled through a subscription of a tenant with which the user is associated, while external users' access may be enabled in an ad hoc manner through the action of the form owner requesting the users' input via the form. It should be noted that, although internal users may have already had access to the content sharing platform, access to the specific form for which input is requested will be limited to those users specifically selected by the form owner.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">After each user has input his or her information to the form, the user will electronically sign the form via a signature block or other signature element provided on the form (<b>425</b>). The content sharing platform will then store the information that was provided by the user in a data structure which includes the provided data, as well as the user's electronic signature (<b>430</b>). For example, the system may store the data in a database table, where each record in the table contains the data provided by a specific user, along with the user's electronic signature information. While the table may include a reference to the form, the data itself will be stored in the table apart from the form. In some embodiments, when a user signs the form, the system will &#x201c;lock&#x201d; the information so that the signed data cannot thereafter be altered. In alternative embodiments, the content sharing platform may be configured to enable the user to edit signed data. In some embodiments, the collection of data via the form is open ended, so that collection of data can be ended at any time&#x2014;it is not necessary to wait for all of the selected users to provide input before data collection through the form is ended. Additionally, in some embodiments, the user (form owner) may be able to modify the form during data collection (e.g., adding, deleting or modifying form components, or modifying the assignee users who are requested to enter data through the form).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the form may be constructed using a forms app of a cloud-based multitenant content sharing platform. An authorized user of the system may access the app by directing a browser to a login page of the content sharing platform. A server of the content sharing platform may receive the user's credentials as provided through the login page and verify the credentials. If the user's credentials are verified, the server may identify a tenant object corresponding to the tenant that is associated with the user (i.e., the enterprise with which the user is associated). The server may then identify and implement the settings associated with the retrieved tenant object. The settings may, depending upon the tenant's license level, allow the tenant and the authorized user to access specific functionalities provided by the content sharing platform, such as workflows, workflow templates, forms apps, etc. The form-based collection of signed data described herein may be implemented in conjunction with these other functionalities (e.g., as a part of a structured workflow generated using a workflow template), but this is not necessary in all cases, and the use of forms to collect signed data may not be constrained by a particular workflow. If the form-based collection of signed data is implemented with other functionality of the content sharing platform, the authorized user's selection of an external user to provide signed data through a form as described herein implies authorization of the external user to access this additional functionality, to the extent that the authorized user has access to the functionality.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, when an external user responds to a request for form-based collection of signed data, the user may direct a browser to a login page at the URL of the content sharing platform. The user may log in, providing a user credential which is used by the content sharing platform to determine whether there is a pending request to provide data via a form. If so, the platform may generate a user homepage that includes a link to the form associated with the request, and the user may access the form through the link. If there are no pending requests, the platform may generate a user homepage for the external user that does not enable unauthorized functionality, but provides access to some limited set of functions.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, providing signed data through the form may involve indirect access to a native content object (e.g., adding data to a database table), so the platform may verify the external user's access permission to both the form and the native content object. After the external user's permission to access the form and/or the native object have been verified, the user can access the form to enter data in the defined form fields and sign the form. The data entered by the user in the form (including the user's electronic signature information) is then added to the native content object. In some embodiments, even though the user is allowed to enter data into the native content object through the form, the user may not be allowed to view or edit data in the native content object.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>L</figref>, a set of diagrams are provided to illustrate an example of a user generating a form and collecting signed data using the form. As noted above, the authorized user must first provide a form to collect the desired data. In this example, the authorized user creates a form using a corresponding form app on the content sharing platform. The web-based interface of the app is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. as depicted in this figure, the user has created a new blank form <b>510</b>. The user may provide a name <b>512</b> for the form, as well as instructions <b>514</b> which will be provided to users who are requested to fill out the form. Initially, the body <b>516</b> of the form is empty. A menu <b>518</b> of form components is provided at the left side of the form app. Menu <b>518</b> includes a set of buttons, each of which corresponds to a different type of form component. In this example, the form components include checkboxes, drop-down's, numeric fields, text fields, text areas, dates, row separators, attachments, currency, rich text, percentages, links, images, and signature. Each of these form components can be selected to be added to the body <b>516</b> of the form. A form component may, for example, be selected by dragging and dropping the component into the body of the form. The component may then be edited as needed for the form.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, form <b>510</b> is shown after a number of form components have been added to the body of the form. These components include a currency component <b>520</b>, a rich text component <b>522</b>, two percentage components <b>524</b> and <b>526</b>, a hyperlink component <b>528</b>, and a signature component <b>530</b>. Each of the components includes one or more configurable attributes, such as a prompt area in which the user can identify the requested information. For example, in currency component <b>520</b>, the user has entered the text &#x201c;what are your total travel expenses?&#x201d;. This text will be displayed on the form so that the user is filling out the form is aware of the specific information that is being requested. Each of the form components may include corresponding controls and input fields that are appropriate for that particular component. Each of the form components also includes a button that the user can select to indicate whether or not a response is required when the form is filled out by another user. In this example, data is not required for components <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>, <b>526</b>, or <b>528</b>, but a signature is required in signature component <b>530</b>. When the authorized user has finished building the form, the user may elect to preview the form. The preview of the form built by the authorized user is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">After the authorized user has finished building the form, it can be saved, and users can be selected to provide data through the form. A user selection screen is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>. In this embodiment, the user selection screen allows users to be added by entering a user name (for internal users) or an email address (for internal or external users) in field <b>532</b> and clicking &#x201c;add&#x201d; button <b>534</b>. Users may be added as owners of the form or assignees (users who will fill out the form) using drop-down <b>536</b>. Users who have been added are listed in the selection screen with an indication of whether they are owners or assignees. A field <b>538</b> may be used by the authorized user to provide instructions to the selected users for filling out the form. When the desired assignees have been selected, the authorized user can click on the &#x201c;send invites&#x201d; button <b>540</b> to send invitations to each of the selected users to fill out the form.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref>, an example of a form which has been filled out by one of the assignees is shown. As depicted in this figure, the assignee has entered a currency and amount for travel expenses, and has provided a brief description of the purpose of the travel. Sliders have been used to indicate the percentages of the trip that were spent at a conference and traveling. The form shown in this figure has not yet been electronically signed by the assignee. The assignee's electronic signature may be provided in a number of different ways which are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>F-<b>5</b>I</figref>. in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref>, the assignee can select one of a set of previously saved signatures. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>G</figref>, the assignee can type their name and select one of a set of displayed fonts. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>H</figref>, the assignee can provide a signature or by drawing (physically signing) using a suitable I/O device (e.g., a stylus and touchscreen). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>I</figref>, the assignee can elect to drag-and-drop or upload a file corresponding to their electronic signature. After the assignee has provided their signature using one of these methods, the forms app may notify the assignee that the provided data cannot be changed after it is signed, and may require that the assignee confirm agreements to, e.g., applicable terms of use and privacy policies as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>J</figref>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As information is provided by the assignees via the form, a summary of the information is made available to the form owners as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>K</figref>. The form owners may include the authorized user who created the form, as well as any owners indicated in the list depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>. In this example, selected fields of the form (currency amount and travel purpose) are displayed. These fields may, for example, be selected by the form owner after the form is built. As depicted in this figure, the summary indicates, for each assignee, whether the assignee has electronically signed their the information which they provided. It should be noted that, while the summary of the assignee data identifies the form through which the data was provided (see form indicator <b>542</b>), the data is stored separately from the form, and the signatures are attached to the data, rather than to the form.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The form owner may elect to export the data provided by the assignees to a file such as a spreadsheet, database table, comma-delimited value file. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>L</figref>, an exemplary spreadsheet containing the assignee data is shown. In this example, the spreadsheet includes a column for each of the form components (currency and amount, travel purpose, percentage at conference, percentage traveling, review of travel policy, and signature). For each assignee, the data provided by that assignee is contained in a corresponding row of the spreadsheet. Each row of data includes a link to an image file for the corresponding assignee's signature.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Those skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the invention can be implemented or practiced with other computer system configurations, including without limitation multi-processor systems, network devices, mini-computers, mainframe computers, data processors, and the like.
