The system can comprise one or more processors. The system also can comprise one or more non-transitory computer-readable media storing computing instructions that, when executed on the one or more processors, perform: determining reservoir sampling and size of labeling from each strata; determining recall and variance for each strata; determining sum of sample size for a time period; and determining reservoir sampling for each strata and label the sample items.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A number of other embodiments can include a method. The method can be implemented via execution of computing instructions configured to run at one or more processors and configured to be stored at non-transitory computer-readable media. The method can comprise determining reservoir sampling and size of labeling from each strata; determining recall and variance for each strata; determining sum of sample size for a time period; and determining reservoir sampling for each strata and label the sample items.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In computing platforms, the quality of the product or content plays a key role in delivering a satisfactory experience to its customers. With the rapid growth of e-commerce, it became challenging to control the quality of the products with traditional methods such as manual review or heuristic rule driven engagement in terms of the trust and safety perspective. In recent years, the high quality of the content is increasing along with huge amount of bad quality content in the e-commerce platforms. Though minuscule compared to the size of the catalog, this anomaly content can have an outsized impact on the user experience and the e-commerce platform's reputation. At this juncture, the machine learning driven solutions are key factors to capture the anomalies in the system. In general, one of the biggest concerns in such anomaly detection scenario is to measure and track the actual recall in the real world. Scarcity on anomaly events make it difficult to measure recall in a development environment. Embodiments disclosed herein provide a solution on how to measure and track the recall metric of our deep learning driven solutions with a combination of sophisticated sampling techniques.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In such big e-commerce systems, a limitation in ML-based solutions is that the data source is so vast that one has difficulty replicating the exact distribution into the training/test data set. This challenge of replication results in a discrepancy between the performance metrics in the test and production environments; e.g., false positive rates or recall/precision. It is difficult to discern the performance metric in the production environment for rare event detection with a simple random sampling alone, as the data is not distributed normally or is highly skewed so that the ratio of positive over negative items is 1,000-10,000 times larger. Embodiments disclosed herein use limited labeling resources to estimate performance metrics in live traffic with a smart sampling technique.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Embodiments disclosed herein obtain a precise estimate of ML based model performance via as small a labelling resource as possible for rare events in the production environment. To do so, embodiments disclosed herein go over the advanced sampling techniques put in place into the live production traffic.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Turning to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a computer system <b>100</b>, all of which or a portion of which can be suitable for (i) implementing part or all of one or more embodiments of the techniques, methods, and systems and/or (ii) implementing and/or operating part or all of one or more embodiments of the non-transitory computer readable media described herein.

In some embodiments, the size of data or logs flowing though the streams are not a known fact, embodiments disclosed herein use reservoirs to maintain a uniform distribution in the sampling. In other words, the reservoir provides the same chance for all items to be picked by the random sampling technique, regardless of the order in which the application sees the items. As a result, random sampling may not be applicable to a streaming data set. In some embodiments, reservoir sampling is a version of random sampling. In rare event or anomaly detection, this sampling either barely works or needs a huge number of samples to determine the exact precision, recall, and other performance values due to the highly skewed data set. To take &#x201c;skewness&#x201d; into consideration, embodiments disclosed herein either stratify the data before sampling or use stratified sampling instead. Stratified-random sampling is also called proportional or quota random sampling involves dividing the entire population into homogeneous groups called strata. Random samples are then selected from each stratum. When the distribution of labels in the data is highly skewed, a simple random/reservoir sampling might result in the selection of only positive or negative data (especially if the sampling size is very small). The stratified sampling can be used to address this problem (provided the &#x201c;skewness&#x201d; is a factor in the stratification step); however, it is not enough to get the precise estimate. Therefore, embodiments disclosed herein have used a sophisticated sampling technique that is a version of reservoir stratified random sampling, and this technique keeps the sample size as small as possible by keeping the estimation as precise as possible.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Embodiments disclosed herein overcame the sampling challenge presented through highly skewed data by adding variance into the consideration along with reservoir stratified random sampling.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Reservoir-Stratified Random Sampling based on Variance. Embodiments disclosed herein used stratified sampling with different reservoir sizes for each stratum defined based on the variance. In this embodiment, the model scores are used to define the border of each strata called bins.

As such, the result is less than a good estimation of S<sub>k</sub><sup>2 </sup>which may result in an equal allocation per stratum which is far from true optimal allocation. This outcome is far from true optimal allocation. Conversely, if the initial sampling of size n<sub>init </sub>is large, then we essentially end up spending a large sizeable proportion of the labeling resource and will lose the advantage of using this algorithms.

Otherwise this algorithm end up being equal allocation per stratum which is still better than random sampling that might may result in the selection of only True Negatives instead of False Negatives (especially if sample size (n) is very low).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0085">As described herein, the machine learning models built for trust and safety or similar applications are trained on the very few positive (offensive) examples and some generic negative examples available during the training phase. Hence, it is critical to know if these models are achieving high enough coverage (recall rate) in production. However, since the models produce a much higher proportion of negative (non-offensive) predictions on the real data, it is prohibitively costly to review them manually to obtain an estimate of recall. Embodiments disclosed herein have come up with an intelligent sampling algorithm and a system around it that sends a small yet representative set of samples to the manual reviewers along with positive predictions and computes a reliable moving estimate of recall.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0086">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in several embodiments, the relationship system <b>311</b>, the evaluation system <b>312</b>, and the database system <b>313</b> can at least partially perform the activities <b>410</b>-<b>450</b> of method <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0087">Although recall estimation has been described with reference to specific embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0088">Accordingly, the disclosure of embodiments of the invention is intended to be illustrative of the scope of the invention and is not intended to be limiting.
