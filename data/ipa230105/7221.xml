The objects and advantages of the present subject matter may be realized and attained by means of the methodologies, instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Reference now is made in detail to the examples illustrated in the accompanying drawings and discussed below.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a right side view of an example hardware configuration of an eyewear device <b>100</b> utilized in separable distortion disparity determination system, which shows a right visible light camera <b>114</b>B for gathering image information. As further described below, in the separable distortion disparity determination system, two cameras capture image information for a scene from two separate viewpoints. The two captured images are modified to generate two corrected images, pixel pairs are determined between the two corrected images in a camera baseline direction and a disparity correspondence is determined for each of the pixel pairs.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Eyewear device <b>100</b>, includes a right optical assembly <b>180</b>B with an image display to present images, such as depth images. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-B</figref>, the eyewear device <b>100</b> includes the right visible light camera <b>114</b>B. Eyewear device <b>100</b> can include multiple visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B that form a passive type of three-dimensional camera, such as stereo camera, of which the right visible light camera <b>114</b>B is located on a right temple <b>110</b>B. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C-D</figref>, the eyewear device <b>100</b> also includes a left visible light camera <b>114</b>A.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Left and right visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B are sensitive to the visible light range wavelength. Each of the visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B have a different frontward facing field of view which are overlapping to enable generation of three-dimensional depth images, for example, right visible light camera <b>114</b>B depicts a right field of view <b>111</b>B. Generally, a &#x201c;field of view&#x201d; is the part of the scene that is visible through the camera at a particular position and orientation in space. The fields of view <b>111</b>A and <b>111</b>B have an overlapping field of view <b>813</b>. Objects or object features outside the field of view <b>111</b>A-B when the visible light camera captures the image are not recorded in a raw image (e.g., photograph or picture). The field of view describes an angle range or extent, which the image sensor of the visible light camera <b>114</b>A-B picks up electromagnetic radiation of a given scene in a captured image of the given scene. Field of view can be expressed as the angular size of the view cone, i.e., an angle of view. The angle of view can be measured horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an example, visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B have a field of view with an angle of view between 15&#xb0; to 30&#xb0;, for example 24&#xb0;, and have a resolution of 480&#xd7;480 pixels. The &#x201c;angle of coverage&#x201d; describes the angle range that a lens of visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B or infrared camera <b>220</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) can effectively image. Typically, the camera lens produces an image circle that is large enough to cover the film or sensor of the camera completely, possibly including some vignetting toward the edge. If the angle of coverage of the camera lens does not fill the sensor, the image circle will be visible, typically with strong vignetting toward the edge, and the effective angle of view will be limited to the angle of coverage.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Examples of such visible lights camera <b>114</b>A-B include a high-resolution complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor and a video graphic array (VGA) camera, such as 640p (e.g., 640&#xd7;480 pixels for a total of 0.3 m 3 egapixels), 720p, or 1080p. As used herein, the term &#x201c;overlapping&#x201d; when referring to field of view means the matrix of pixels in the generated raw image(s) overlap by 30% or more. As used herein, the term &#x201c;substantially overlapping&#x201d; when referring to field of view means the matrix of pixels in the generated raw image(s) or infrared image of a scene overlap by 50% or more.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The eyewear device <b>100</b> may capture image sensor data from the visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B along with geolocation data, digitized by an image processor, for storage in a memory.

Visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B allow the three-dimensional camera to simulate human binocular vision. Three-dimensional camera provides the ability to reproduce three-dimensional images based on two captured images from the visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B having the same timestamp. Such three-dimensional images allow for an immersive life-like experience, e.g., for virtual reality or video gaming.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For stereoscopic vision, a pair of raw red, green, and blue (RGB) images are captured of a scene at a given moment in time&#x2014;one image for each of the left and right visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B. When the pair of captured raw images from the frontward facing left and right field of views <b>111</b>A-B of the left and right visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B are processed (e.g., by the image processor), depth images are generated, and the generated depth images, which a user perceives on an optical assembly <b>180</b>A-B or other image display(s) (e.g., of a mobile device). The generated depth images are in the three-dimensional space domain and can comprise a matrix of vertices on a three-dimensional location coordinate system that includes an X axis for horizontal position (e.g., length), a Y axis for vertical position (e.g., height), and a Z axis for depth (e.g., distance). Each vertex includes a color attribute value (e.g., a red pixel light value, a green pixel light value, and/or a blue pixel light value); a position attribute (e.g., an X location coordinate, a Y location coordinate, and a Z location coordinate); a texture attribute, and/or a reflectance attribute. The texture attribute quantifies the perceived texture of the depth image, such as the spatial arrangement of color or intensities in a region of vertices of the depth image.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Generally, perception of depth arises from the disparity of a given 3D point in the left and right raw images captured by visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B. Disparity is the difference in image location of the same 3D point when projected under perspective of the visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B (d=x<sub>left</sub>&#x2212;x<sub>right</sub>). For visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B with parallel optical axes, focal length f, baseline b, and corresponding image points (x<sub>left</sub>, y<sub>left</sub>) and (x<sub>right</sub>, y<sub>right</sub>), the location of a 3D point (Z axis location coordinate) can be derived utilizing triangulation which determines depth from disparity. Typically, depth of the 3D point is inversely proportional to disparity. A variety of other techniques can also be used.

A processor is a circuit having elements structured and arranged to perform one or more processing functions, typically various data processing functions.

In addition, the method is described with reference to a camera system that includes two cameras separated in a horizontal direction. In other examples, the cameras may have another orientation with respect to one another (e.g., separated in a vertical direction).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">At step <b>602</b>, obtain two images of a scene. A processor (e.g., element <b>932</b> of eyewear device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> or element <b>1030</b> of mobile device <b>990</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) obtains images of the scene captured by respective cameras having different points of view. In an example, a left visible light camera <b>114</b><i>a </i>of an eyewear device <b>100</b> captures a left raw image (Left<sub>RAW</sub>) and a right visible light image <b>114</b><i>b </i>of an eyewear device <b>100</b> captures a right raw image (Right<sub>RAW</sub>).

The processor may modify the left and right raw images by applying a component-separated correction algorithm to create a left separable distortion corrected pixel image from the left raw image and a right separable distortion corrected pixel image from the right raw image. In an example, a monotonic function f is applied, where f is a 1D transformation function (e.g., f(x)=1+k_1*x{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}2+k_2*x{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}4; where x is the horizontal pixel distance from the distortion center and k_1 and k_2 are parameters). The monotonic function prevents the mapped image from collapsing on itself (e.g., due to 2 pixels being mapped to the same target).

Likewise, the y component is only affected by directional components in the y direction (and is not affected by directional components in the x direction). This separation of x and y components produces more realistic looking images than is typically achievable using conventional techniques. Additionally, the resultant images better maintain corresponding objects from image pairs in the same raster, which facilitates detection of the corresponding objects in determining disparity.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0081" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> depicts an illustrative example of a left separable distortion corrected image <b>808</b>A corresponding to the left raw image <b>858</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>) and a right separable distortion corrected image <b>808</b>B corresponding to the right raw image <b>858</b>B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>).

Correspondence may be determined by comparing color and/or image attributes of one or more pixels (pixel regions, 50 pixels) in the left image to one or more pixels in the right image. If the compared color and/or image attributes of the one or more pixels are identical or within a threshold (e.g., 5%) the one or more pixels may be identified as a pair.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0084">At step <b>608</b>, determine corrected disparity correspondence for each of the pixel pairs.

Correlation of the left and right pixels can be achieved with Semi-Global Block Matching (SGBM), for example. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> where a pixel <b>810</b>A is shown in solid line in a left separable distortion corrected image <b>808</b>A and a representation of that same pixel location <b>810</b>C is shown in dashed line in the right separable distortion corrected image <b>808</b>B.
