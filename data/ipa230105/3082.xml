A substantial portion of current drilling activity involves what is referred to in the art as &#x201c;directional&#x201d; drilling. Directional drilling involves drilling deviated and/or horizontal wellbores (as opposed to straight, vertical wellbores). Modern directional drilling systems generally employ a bottom hole assembly (BHA) at the end of the drill string that includes a drill bit and a hydraulically actuated motor to drive rotation of the drill bit. The drill bit is coupled to a drive shaft of the motor, typically through an assembly configured for steering the path of the drill bit, and drilling fluid pumped through the motor (and to the drill bit) from the surface drives rotation of the drive shaft to which the drill bit is attached. Such hydraulic motors are commonly referred to in the drilling industry as &#x201c;mud motors,&#x201d; &#x201c;drilling motors,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Moineau motors.&#x201d; Such motors are referred to hereinafter as &#x201c;hydraulic drilling motors.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hydraulic drilling motors include a power section that contains a stator and a rotor disposed in the stator. The stator may include a metal housing that is lined inside with a helically contoured or lobed elastomeric material. The rotor is usually made from a suitable metal, such as steel, and has an outer lobed surface. Pressurized drilling fluid (commonly referred to as &#x201c;drilling mud&#x201d;) is pumped into a progressive cavity formed between the rotor and the stator lobes. The force of the pressurized fluid pumped into and through the cavity causes the rotor to turn in a planetary-type motion. A suitable shaft connected to the rotor via a flexible coupling compensates for eccentric movement of the rotor. The shaft is coupled to a bearing assembly having a drive shaft (also referred to as a &#x201c;drive sub&#x201d;), which in turn rotates the drill bit through the aforementioned steering assembly.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As drilling fluid flows through the progressive cavity between the rotor and the stator, forces on the rotor and the stator, as well as abrasives in the drilling fluid, can damage parts of the motor. The motor may include a resilient portion (e.g., an elastomeric or rubber portion), typically as part of the stator, which is designed to wear. The elastomeric portion may be replaced after a certain amount of use, or when a selected amount of wear or damage is detected.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, a hydraulic tool includes a stator and a rotor rotatably disposed within the stator.

The rotor is configured to rotate within the stator in either of the two orientations of the stator.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In certain embodiments, a method of using a hydraulic tool includes disposing a rotor within a cavity defined by a stator.

The first end of the at least one lobe of the rotor is disposed proximate the upper end of the hydraulic tool, and the second end of the at least one lobe of the rotor is disposed proximate the lower end of the hydraulic tool. The methods further include passing a fluid through the cavity defined by the stator to rotate the rotor and at least one of removing the rotor from the cavity defined by the stator and removing the stator from the hydraulic tool. The methods include at least one of disposing the rotor into the cavity defined by the stator such that the first end of the rotor is disposed proximate the lower end of the hydraulic tool and the second end of the rotor is disposed proximate the upper end of the hydraulic tool and securing the stator to the hydraulic tool such that the first end of the stator is proximate the lower end of the hydraulic tool and the second end of the stator is proximate the upper end of the hydraulic tool.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, a drilling system includes a fluid source, a hydraulic tool, a drive shaft operatively associated with the rotor of the hydraulic tool, and a drill bit operatively associated with the drive shaft.

Additionally, elements common between figures may retain the same numerical designation.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present disclosure includes hydraulic tools (e.g., drilling motors, progressive cavity pumps, etc.) each having a stator and a rotor. At least a portion of the stator and/or the rotor is configured to be used in either of two orientations. The stator or rotor may be inverted, which may also be characterized as directionally reversed, after a first use to move fatigued or stressed portions of the stator or rotor to positions in which lower stresses are expected to be encountered and to move less-fatigued portions of the stator or rotor to higher-stress positions. Thus, the motor may have a longer useful life than a conventional motor having a stator and rotor each configured to be used in a single orientation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, a hydraulic drilling motor <b>10</b> includes a power section <b>1</b> and a bearing assembly <b>2</b>. The power section <b>1</b> includes an elongated metal housing <b>4</b>, having a resilient material <b>5</b> therein that has a helically lobed inner surface <b>8</b>. The resilient material <b>5</b> is secured inside the metal housing <b>4</b>, for example, by adhesively bonding the resilient material <b>5</b> within the interior of the metal housing <b>4</b>. The resilient material <b>5</b> is a material that is able to return to its original shape after being pulled, stretched, or pressed. The resilient material <b>5</b> may include, for example, a polymer such as a fluorosilicone rubber (FVMQ, e.g., a copolymer of fluorovinyl and methyl siloxane) , nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), a fluoroelastomer (FKM, e.g., a fluorocarbon copolymer, terpolymer, pentamer, etc.), hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), vinyl methyl polysiloxane (VMQ), carboxylated nitrile butadiene rubber (XNBR), polyacrylate acrylic rubber (ACM), a perfluoroelastomer (FFKM), ethylene propylene rubber (EPM), ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber (EPDM), or acrylic ethylene copolymer (AEM). The resilient material <b>5</b> and the metal housing <b>4</b> together form a stator <b>6</b>, which may be configured to be reversible along a longitudinal axis thereof. In other words, the hydraulic drilling motor <b>10</b> may be operable with at least a portion of the stator <b>6</b> in either of two longitudinally inverted orientations (i.e., two orientations longitudinally inverted from one another).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A rotor <b>11</b> is rotatably disposed within the stator <b>6</b> and configured to rotate therein responsive to the flow of drilling fluid (e.g., a liquid or a suspension of solid particulate matter in a liquid) through the hydraulic drilling motor <b>10</b>. The rotor <b>11</b> may include an elongated metal core <b>13</b> having a resilient material <b>14</b> thereon that has a helically lobed outer surface <b>12</b> configured to engage with the helically lobed inner surface <b>8</b> of the stator <b>6</b>. The resilient material <b>14</b> may be secured over the metal core <b>13</b>, for example, by adhesively bonding the resilient material <b>14</b> over the exterior of the metal core <b>13</b>. The resilient material <b>14</b> may be the same material as the resilient material <b>5</b> of the stator <b>6</b>, or the resilient materials <b>5</b>, <b>14</b> may be different materials. In some embodiments, a hardfacing material may be formed on a portion of the outer surface <b>12</b> of the rotor <b>11</b>. For example, the hardfacing material may include chrome, nickel, cobalt, tungsten carbide, diamond, diamond-like-carbon, boron carbide, cubic boron nitride, nitrides, carbides, oxides, borides and alloys hardened by nitriding, boriding, carbonizing or any combination of these materials. Hardfacing may be applied pure or as a composite in a binder matrix. Hardfacing materials on rotors are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0018227, published Jan. 26, 2012, and titled &#x201c;Components and motors for downhole tools and methods of applying hardfacing to surfaces thereof,&#x201d; the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In some embodiments, hardfacing materials may be disposed on surfaces of the stator <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The rotor <b>11</b> may be configured to be reversible along a longitudinal axis thereof. In other words, the hydraulic drilling motor <b>10</b> may be operable with at least a portion of the rotor <b>11</b> in either of two longitudinally inverted orientations (i.e., two orientations longitudinally inverted from one another). The inversion of the rotor <b>11</b> may be independent of the inversion of the stator <b>6</b>. That is, the rotor <b>11</b>, the stator <b>6</b>, or both may be inverted.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The outer surface <b>12</b> of the rotor <b>11</b> and the inner surface <b>8</b> of the stator <b>6</b> may have similar, but slightly different profiles. For example, the outer surface <b>12</b> of the rotor <b>11</b> may have one fewer lobe than the inner surface <b>8</b> of the stator <b>6</b>. The outer surface <b>12</b> of the rotor <b>11</b> and the inner surface <b>8</b> of the stator <b>6</b> may be configured so that seals are established directly between the rotor <b>11</b> and the stator <b>6</b> at discrete intervals along and circumferentially around the interface therebetween, resulting in the creation of fluid chambers or cavities <b>26</b> between the outer surface <b>12</b> of the rotor <b>11</b> and the inner surface <b>8</b> of the stator <b>6</b>. The cavities <b>26</b> may be filled with a pressurized drilling fluid <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As the pressurized drilling fluid <b>40</b> flows from a top <b>30</b> to a bottom <b>32</b> of the power section <b>1</b>, as shown by flow arrow <b>34</b>, the pressurized drilling fluid <b>40</b> causes the rotor <b>11</b> to rotate within the stator <b>6</b>. The number of lobes and the geometries of the outer surface <b>12</b> of the rotor <b>11</b> and inner surface <b>8</b> of the stator <b>6</b> may be modified to achieve desired input and output requirements and to accommodate different drilling operations. The rotor <b>11</b> may be coupled to a flexible shaft <b>50</b>, and the flexible shaft <b>50</b> may be connected to a drive shaft <b>52</b> in the bearing assembly <b>2</b>. As previously mentioned, a drill bit may be attached to the drive shaft <b>52</b>. For example, the drive shaft <b>52</b> may include a threaded box <b>54</b>, and a drill bit may be provided with a threaded pin that may be engaged with the threaded box <b>54</b> of the drive shaft <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the stator <b>6</b> and the rotor <b>11</b> of the hydraulic drilling motor <b>10</b> taken at section A&#x2014;A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the rotor <b>11</b> of the hydraulic drilling motor <b>10</b> taken at section line A&#x2014;A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.

The inner surface <b>8</b> of the stator <b>6</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> includes lobes <b>42</b><i>a</i>-<b>42</b><i>f, </i>which may be configured to interface with lobes <b>48</b><i>a</i>-<b>48</b><i>e </i>of the rotor <b>11</b>. As the rotor <b>11</b> rotates in the direction indicated by arrow <b>15</b>, the lobes <b>48</b><i>a</i>-<b>48</b><i>e </i>of the rotor <b>11</b> move into and out of the spaces between the lobes <b>42</b><i>a</i>-<b>42</b><i>f </i>of the stator <b>6</b>. As the rotor <b>11</b> rotates, portions of the stator <b>6</b> and/or the rotor <b>11</b> experience stresses. If the stator <b>6</b> includes a resilient material <b>5</b>, the resilient material <b>5</b> may be designed to partially deform as the rotor <b>11</b> rotates. Similarly, if the rotor <b>11</b> includes a resilient material <b>14</b>, the resilient material <b>14</b> may be designed to partially deform as the rotor <b>11</b> rotates. Thus, the resilient materials <b>5</b>, <b>14</b> may sustain a finite amount of damage (e.g., fatigue) for each rotation of the rotor <b>11</b>. Any damage to the resilient materials <b>5</b>, <b>14</b> may be concentrated at portions of the resilient materials <b>5</b>, <b>14</b> subjected to highest loads, which damage may be aggravated by solids in the drilling fluid.
