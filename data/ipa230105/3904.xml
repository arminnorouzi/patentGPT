Advantageous developments and improvements of the device indicated in the independent claims are possible by means of the measures described in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The advantages achievable with the presented approach consist in providing a possibility for detecting a group delay variation for a navigation sensor, for example in the manufacture of the navigation sensor. It can thus be ensured that a position of the navigation sensor or of a vehicle having a navigation sensor is correctly calculated during the operation of the navigation sensor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A method is presented for detecting a group delay variation for a navigation sensor for a navigation system for a vehicle. The method comprises a reading step and a determining step. In the reading step, at least one first GNSS simulator signal is read by means of a read device from a virtual satellite of a virtual global navigation satellite system at a first time and a second GNSS simulator signal is read from a virtual satellite or from at least one second virtual satellite of a virtual navigation satellite system at a second time different from the first time. The group delay variation is determined using the first GNSS simulator signal and the second GNSS simulator signal in the determining step.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This method can be implemented, for example, in software or hardware or in a hybrid form of software and hardware, for example in a control device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The abbreviation &#x201c;GNSS&#x201d; stands for and designates a &#x201c;Global Navigation Satellite System&#x201d;. The virtual global navigation satellite system is a simulated navigation satellite system scenario. This virtual navigation satellite system can comprise only the one virtual satellite, or additionally the second virtual satellite or any number of further virtual satellites. The navigation satellite system scenario can, for example, be a virtual static GLONASS scenario with as many virtual GLONASS satellites as possible. GLONASS stands for and describes a &#x201c;Global Navigation Satellite System&#x201d; which is operated by the Russian Federation. The read device can comprise at least one GNSS receiver or can be designed to read received signals of such GNSS receivers of the navigation sensor from the GNSS receivers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This method can be carried out, for example, in the manufacture of the navigation sensor and can be part of an &#x201c;end-of-line&#x201d; test or &#x201c;end-of-life&#x201d; test in which a reliability or function of the navigation sensor is tested prior to an intended use.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the determining step, the GNSS simulator signal can be evaluated in order to obtain a first measured quantity, and the second GNSS simulator signal can be evaluated in order to obtain a second measured quantity, wherein the group delay variation is determined using the first measured quantity and the second measured quantity. The GNSS simulator signals can in each case comprise, for example, a timestamp which represents a transmit time of the respective GNSS simulator signal from the respective virtual satellite. Using a further timestamp which represents a receive time of the respective GNSS simulator signal by means of the read device or the GNSS receiver, the delay of the individual GNSS simulator signals can then be calculated by forming a difference from the timestamp and the further timestamp.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one embodiment, the first GNSS simulator signal can be evaluated in the determining step in order to obtain a first pseudo distance representing a distance from the virtual satellite to the read device as the first measured quantity, and the second GNSS simulator signal can be evaluated in order to obtain a second pseudo distance representing a distance from the second virtual satellite to the read device as the second measured quantity. A pseudo distance, also referred to as a pseudo path or pseudorange, designates the first approximation of the distance between a transmitter and a receiver from the delay of the radio signal. Pseudo (meaning false, fictitious), given that, due to the major factor of the speed of light (300 meters per microsecond), even slight clock errors result in the pseudo paths becoming unusable as a direct measure of the distance.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The group delay variation can be determined in the determining step by forming the difference between the first measured quantity and the second measured quantity. In the determining step, for example, the group delay variation can be determined by forming the difference between the first pseudo distance and the second pseudo distance. This provides a fast method for detecting the group delay variation.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the reading step, for example, the first GNSS simulator signal can be read from a virtual GLONASS satellite or virtual GPS satellite or virtual Galileo satellite and additionally or alternatively the second GNSS simulator signal can be read from a virtual GLONASS satellite or virtual GPS satellite or virtual Galileo satellite. Different virtual GLONASS satellites can transmit signals at a different frequency here. Different virtual GPS satellites can transmit signals at the same frequency. This offers a possibility for determining the group delay variation using a variety of virtual satellite types.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to one embodiment, the first GNSS simulator signal and the second GNSS simulator signal which have different frequencies can be read in the reading step. The first GNSS simulator signal and the second GNSS simulator signal can be read here from different GLONASS satellites which each transmit signals at their own frequency.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the reading step, the first GNSS simulator signal and the second GNSS simulator signal can be read from the virtual satellite and from the second virtual satellite which have a simulated same distance to the read device. An embodiment of this type offers the advantage of minimizing possible errors in determining the group delay variation by means of the same simulated distance of the satellites from the read device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Alternatively, however, in the reading step, the first GNSS simulator signal and the second GNSS simulator signal can be read from the virtual satellite and from the second virtual satellite which have simulated different distances to the read device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is further advantageous if, according to one embodiment, the first GNSS simulator signal and the second GNSS simulator signal are read in the reading step from the virtual satellite and from the second virtual satellite which have simulated constant distances to the read device. If the distances remain constant during the measurement, this avoids Doppler effects.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The approach presented here further provides a device which is designed to carry out, control or implement the steps of a variant of a method presented here in corresponding devices. The object on which the approach is based can be achieved quickly and efficiently also by means of this embodiment variant of the approach in the form of a device.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">For this purpose, the device can have at least one computing unit for processing signals or data, at least one storage unit for storing signals or data, at least one interface to a sensor or to an actuator for reading sensor signals from the sensor or for outputting data signals or control signals to the actuator and/or at least one communication interface for reading or outputting data which are embedded in a communication protocol. The computing unit can be, for example, a signal processor, a microcontroller or the like, wherein the storage unit can be a flash memory, an EEPROM or a magnetic storage unit. The communication interface can be designed to read or output data in a wireless and/or wired manner, wherein a communication interface which can read or output wired data can read or output said data, for example electrically or optically, from or into a corresponding data transmission line.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A device can be understood here to mean an electrical device which processes sensor signals and outputs control signals and/or data signals depending thereon. The device can have an interface which can be designed in the form of hardware and/or software. In a hardware-based design, the interfaces can, for example, be part of a system ASIC which contains a wide variety of functions of the device. However, it is also possible for the interfaces to be dedicated, integrated circuits or to consist at least partially of discrete components. In a software-based design, the interfaces can be software modules which are present, for example, on a microcontroller along with other software modules.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one advantageous design, a method for detecting a group delay variation for a navigation sensor for a navigation system for a vehicle is controlled by the device. For this purpose, the device can, for example, access sensor signals such as a first GNSS simulator signal from a virtual satellite of a virtual global navigation satellite system at a first start time and a second GNSS simulator signal from the virtual satellite or at least one second virtual satellite of the navigation satellite system at a second time different from the first time. The control is performed by means of actuators such as a read device which is designed to read the first GNSS simulator signal and the second GNSS simulator signal, and a determination device which is designed to determine the group delay variation using the first GNSS simulator signal and the second GNSS simulator signal.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A navigation sensor for a navigation system for a vehicle having this device is further presented. A navigation sensor of this type is usable for a navigation system, wherein a group delay variation of the navigation sensor can be detected thanks to the device, or has already been detected before a use of the navigation sensor in connection with the navigation system.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A computer program product or computer program having program code which can be stored on a machine-readable carrier or storage medium such as a semiconductor storage device, a hard disk storage device or an optical storage device and is used to carry out, implement and/or control the steps of the method according to one of the embodiments described above, in particular when the program product or program is executed on a computer or a device, is also advantageous.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Exemplary embodiments of the approach presented here are explained in detail in the drawings and in the following description.
