In one embodiment, the quasi-licensed spectrum utilizes 3.5 GHz CBRS (Citizens Broadband Radio Service) spectrum, and a &#x201c;seamless&#x201d; reassignment of wireless spectrum without disruption or loss of continuity to existing data sessions of the CBSD is provided via a pool of temporary RF carriers which act as substitutes for the currently allocated (granted) carriers. The served user devices (e.g., UEs) are instructed by the CBSD to migrate to a new &#x201c;final&#x201d; carrier via the substitutes, either directly or via one or more intermediary hops. In one variant, existing 3GPP signaling mechanisms between the UE and CBSD/eNodeB obviates any changes to extant UEs. Communications between the CBSD and its cognizant SAS/DP include new information objects which direct the CBSD to implement the handover functionality. In a further variant, inter-CBSD sector and frequency handovers are provided for using CBRS-plane and 3GPP signaling.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img

Description of Related Technology</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A multitude of wireless networking technologies, also known as Radio Access Technologies (&#x201c;RATs&#x201d;), provide the underlying means of connection for radio-based communication networks to user devices. Such RATs often utilize licensed radio frequency spectrum (i.e., that allocated by the FCC per the Table of Frequency Allocations as codified at Section 2.106 of the Commission's Rules. In the United States, regulatory responsibility for the radio spectrum is divided between the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). The FCC, which is an independent regulatory agency, administers spectrum for non-Federal use (i.e., state, local government, commercial, private internal business, and personal use) and the NTIA, which is an operating unit of the Department of Commerce, administers spectrum for Federal use (e.g., use by the Army, the FAA, and the FBI). Currently only frequency bands between 9 kHz and 275 GHz have been allocated (i.e., designated for use by one or more terrestrial or space radio communication services or the radio astronomy service under specified conditions). For example, a typical cellular service provider might utilize spectrum for so-called &#x201c;3G&#x201d; (third generation) and &#x201c;4G&#x201d; (fourth generation) wireless communications as shown in Table 1 below:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="175pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Technology</entry><entry>Bands</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>3G</entry><entry>850 MHz Cellular, Band 5 (GSM/GPRS/EDGE).</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>1900 MHz PCS, Band 2 (GSM/GPRS/EDGE).</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>850 MHz Cellular, Band 5 (UMTS/HSPA+ up</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>to 21 Mbit/s).</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>1900 MHz PCS, Band 2 (UMTS/HSPA+ up to 21 Mbit/s).</entry></row><row><entry>4G</entry><entry>700 MHz Lower B/C, Band 12/17 (LTE).</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>850 MHz Cellular, Band 5 (LTE).</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>1700/2100 MHz AWS, Band 4 (LTE).</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>1900 MHz PCS, Band 2 (LTE).</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>2300 MHz WCS, Band 30 (LTE).</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">Alternatively, unlicensed spectrum may be utilized, such as that within the so-called ISM-bands.

The CBRS is unique, in that it makes available a comparatively large amount of spectrum (frequency bandwidth) without the need for expensive auctions, and without ties to a particular operator or service provider.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0010">Moreover, the CBRS spectrum is suitable for shared use between government and commercial interests, based on a system of existing &#x201c;incumbents,&#x201d; including the Department of Defense (DoD) and fixed satellite services. Specifically, a three-tiered access framework for the 3.5 GHz is used; i.e., (i) an Incumbent Access tier <b>102</b>, (ii) Priority Access tier <b>104</b>, and (iii) General Authorized Access tier <b>106</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The three tiers are coordinated through one or more dynamic Spectrum Access Systems (SAS) <b>202</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and Appendix I (including e.g., Band <b>48</b> therein).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0011">Incumbent Access (existing DOD and satellite) users <b>102</b> include authorized federal and grandfathered Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) users currently operating in the 3.5 GHz band shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. These users will be protected from harmful interference from Priority Access License (PAL) and General Authorized Access (GAA) users. The sensor networks, operated by Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) operators, make sure that incumbents and others utilizing the spectrum are protected from interference.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0012">The Priority Access tier <b>104</b> (including acquisition of spectrum for up to three years through an auction process) consists of Priority Access Licenses (PALs) that will be assigned using competitive bidding within the 3550-3650 MHz portion of the band. Each PAL is defined as a non-renewable authorization to use a 10 MHz channel in a single census tract for three years. Up to seven (7) total PALs may be assigned in any given census tract, with up to four PALs going to any single applicant.

Domains can be even larger/broader in scope, such as for example a terrestrial operator network. Moreover, domains may or may not use private addressing. A Domain Proxy (DP) <b>208</b> can aggregate control information flows to other SAS, such as e.g., a Commercial SAS (CSAS, not shown), and generate performance reports, channel requests, heartbeats, etc.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0018">CBSDs <b>206</b> can generally be categorized as either Category A or Category B. Category A CBSDs have an EIRP or Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power of 30 dBm (1 Watt)/10 MHz, fixed indoor or outdoor location (with an antenna&#x3c;6m in length if outdoor). Category B CBSDs have 47 dBm EIRP (50 Watts)/10 MHz, and fixed outdoor location only. Professional installation of Category B CBSDs is required, and the antenna must be less than 6 m in length. All CBSD's have a vertical positioning accuracy requirement of +/&#x2212;3 m. Terminals (i.e., user devices akin to UE) have 23 dBm EIRP (0.2 Watts)/10 MHz requirements, and mobility of the terminals is allowed.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0019">In terms of spectral access, CBRS utilizes a time division duplex (TDD) multiple access architecture.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Unaddressed Issues of Session Continuity and Frequency Management&#x2014;</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0020">Extant CBRS architectures, while promising from the standpoint of reduced contention for spectrum, currently lack mechanisms for maintaining service session continuity under various scenarios such as frequency change. In particular, when a given SAS instructs a CBSD to change frequency or reconfigure the serving channel (e.g., from 20 MHz to 10 MHz or 5 MHz), the system has to release all active users, obtain the new RF channel, and offer services on the new channel. Active users accordingly lose extant sessions, and hence are required to reconnect.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0021">Session continuity can be of critical importance to those utilizing CBRS spectrum and services, especially for commercial purposes. Voice calls (e.g., VoIP or VoLTE) are particularly susceptible to &#x201c;dropped&#x201d; sessions, since call flow effectively terminates and then must be re-established; an obvious disability and unacceptable operating condition. User perceptions of reduced availability and discontinuous (interrupted) data service can negatively impact continued use and profitability of the service by any given service provider, especially where other competing services offered, by other providers and which do not suffer from similar disabilities are available. This vulnerability is particularly acute if the service provider does not have any licensed spectrum available to it (e.g., for cellular data services such as LTE/LTE-A), and hence must rely solely on the CBRS spectrum for wireless services in certain use cases or areas. Stated differently, since service providers such as cable or terrestrial MSOs have little or no licensed spectrum available to them, the ability of their users and subscribers to routinely and robustly utilize unlicensed spectrum such as CBRS GAA becomes that much more critical, especially within the context of roaming users or subscribers (e.g., MSO subscribers which roam from their normal service location, and hence must access communication modalities other than those normally accessible to them on their served premises, such as DOCSIS cable modems, Wi-Fi APs, etc.).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0022">The present disclosure addresses the foregoing needs by providing, inter alia, methods and apparatus for providing wireless spectrum allocation/re-allocation while maintaining session continuity.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0023">In one aspect, a method for providing wireless spectrum reassignment is disclosed.

As opposed to an unmanaged network, the managed service-provider network <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>advantageously allows, inter alia, control and management of a given user's access (such user which may be a network subscriber, or merely an incidental/opportunistic user of the service) via the wireless access node(s) <b>314</b>, including imposition and/or reconfiguration of various access &#x201c;rules&#x201d; or other configurations applied to the wireless access nodes, as well as assisting in &#x201c;seamless&#x201d; handovers invoked by the cognizant SAS. For example, the service provider network <b>300</b> allows components at a venue of interest (e.g., CBSDs, Wi-Fi APs and any supporting infrastructure such as routers, switches, etc.) to be remotely reconfigured by the network MSO, based on e.g., prevailing operational conditions in the network, changes in user population and/or makeup of users at the venue, business models (e.g., to maximize profitability or provide other benefits such as enhanced user experience, as described infra), spectrum channel changes or withdrawals by the SAS (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), or even simply to enhance user experience using one RAT (e.g., CBRS) when another RAT (e.g., WLAN is sub-optimal for whatever reason). It also permits communication of data from the CBSDs backwards towards the controller, including configuration and demand data relating to the individual CBSDs for purposes of facilitating seamless handover.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0104">In certain embodiments, the service provider network <b>300</b> also advantageously permits the aggregation and/or analysis of subscriber- or account-specific data (including inter alia, particular mobile devices associated with such subscriber or accounts) as part of the provision of services to users under the exemplary delivery models described herein.

Specifically, the higher layer MPEG or other encoded content may be encapsulated using an IP network-layer protocol, which then utilizes an MPEG packetization/container format of the type well known in the art for delivery over the RF channels or other transport, such as via a multiplexed transport stream (MPTS). In this fashion, a parallel delivery mode to the normal broadcast delivery exists; e.g., in the cable paradigm, delivery of video content both over traditional downstream QAMs to the tuner of the user's DSTB or other receiver device for viewing on the television, and also as packetized IP data over the DOCSIS QAMs to the user's PC or other IP-enabled device via the user's cable modem <b>312</b> (including to end users of the access node <b>314</b>). Delivery in such packetized modes may be unicast, multicast, or broadcast.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0115">Delivery of the IP-encapsulated data may also occur over the non-DOCSIS QAMs, such as via IPTV or similar models with QoS applied.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0116">Individual client devices such as cable modems <b>312</b> and associated end-user devices <b>306</b><i>a</i>, <b>306</b><i>b </i>of the implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>may be configured to monitor the particular assigned RF channel (such as via a port or socket ID/address, or other such mechanism) for IP packets intended for the subscriber premises/address that they serve.

However, as discussed elsewhere herein, certain analytics and control functions may be performed by the MSO controller <b>310</b> and associated analytics engine in support of efficient and seamless handovers, depending on inter alia, the degree of integration between the cognizant SAS/DP and the MSO desired. For example, in one implementation, certain sets of rules or priorities may be implemented at the MSO level via logic on the controller <b>310</b> and analytics engine <b>413</b> which are not visible to the SAS (the SAS being largely agnostic to particulars of each MSO/MNO domain which it serves). As such, the SAS (or DP) may provide the MSO domain with higher-level instructions or directives on frequency/carrier use, reclamation, time periods, etc., and effectively let the MSO domain decide how to execute the process consistent with those instructions or directives. Likewise, the controller <b>310</b> and associated logic can act merely as a passive monitor of the transactions between the SAS/DP and relevant target CBSDs/eNBs, so as to maintain accurate accounting of user/frequency/CBSD mapping (i.e., which UE is using what frequencies via what CBSD/eNB at any given time), without actively participating in the handover process.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0125">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>, in operation, the Domain Proxy (DP) <b>408</b> is in logical communication with the CBSD/eNB disposed at the venue (either directly, as shown, or via MSO backend network infrastructure) and the MSO CBRS controller <b>310</b>. The DP <b>408</b> provides, inter alia, SAS interface for the CBSD/eNB, including directive translation between CBSD/eNB <b>314</b> and SAS commands, bulk CBSD/eNB directive processing, and interference contribution reporting to the SAS (i.e., to help an SAS tune or update its predictive propagation models and detect realistic interference issues once CBSDs/eNBs are deployed, the CBSDs/eNBs can provide signal strength and interference level measurements).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0126">The MSO controller <b>310</b> in the illustrated embodiment communicates with the DP <b>208</b> via an MSO CBRS access network <b>410</b>, which may be a public internetwork (e.g., the Internet), private network, or other, depending on any security and reliability requirements mandated by the MSO and/or SAS.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0127">As used herein, a CBRS &#x201c;domain&#x201d; is defined is any collection of CBSDs/eNBs <b>314</b> that are or need to be grouped for management, whether logically or by other scheme; e.g.: according to network operator (NO), according to a serving SAS vendor, and/or by physical disposition (e.g., within a large enterprise, venues, certain geographic area, etc.) In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>, the DP <b>408</b> aggregate control information flows to the SAS1 <b>402</b> and/or any participating other SAS (SAS2), which may be e.g., a Commercial SAS (CSAS)) <b>403</b>, and generates performance reports, channel requests, heartbeats, and other types of data, including data necessary for operation of the spectrum allocation algorithms described in greater detail subsequently herein.

Hence, for frequency re-use purposes, allocated GAA spectrum can be re-used within all other areas of the domains, since there is no chance of interference from common use of the same frequency band(s) based on geographic separation. This potential for re-use is significant, since an ostensible maximum allocation of 150 MHz for GAA users within a region (with minimum at 80 MHz) may cause significant constraints on servicing additional users within a region without such re-use.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0132">Returning again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>, the MSO subscriber and CBRS database <b>404</b> includes several types of data useful in operation of the system <b>400</b>.

Note that the revocation may be applicable only to a particular geographic region, and hence only a subset of CBSDs may need to relinquish the channel needed by some incumbent. The SAS having knowledge of both (i) the information regarding the channel needed by an incumbent, and (ii) the affected region, enables identification of CBSDs which are required to relinquish their assigned channel.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0142">At step <b>506</b>, when the SAS decides to either change an extant RF carrier or reconfigure it for a target CBSD (s) under consideration, the SAS queries the target CBSD(s) whether it is carrying traffic or not (e.g., via a protocol message sent from the SAS to the target CBSD via the DP or directly if no DP present). In one alternate embodiment, the DP may be configured to issue the protocol message as a proxy for the SAS (i.e., the SAS invokes the DP to generate and transmit the message to the target CBSD(s), and likewise generate a message relating to the CBSD reply for transmission from the DP back to the SAS).</p><p id="p-0147" num="0143">Per step <b>507</b>, once the CBSD(s) respond back with a positive indication of traffic (via protocol message), the SAS assigns a time (from the timer, discussed below) and an RF carrier (number and size depends on the active uses on the current CBSD(s) channels), and per step <b>508</b>, communicates to the target CBSD(s) to activate the carrier and start the timer. If the target CBSD/eNB queried does not have active traffic on the carrier, then per step <b>509</b> a message is sent to the SAS to that effect (query response), and the next CBSD/eNB in the target list (i.e., N+1) queried.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0144">It is noted that as part of the communication of step <b>508</b>, the SAS may also indicate to the target CBSD whether the provided RF carrier is the &#x201c;final&#x201d; RF carrier as well, or merely a temporary or ephemeral carrier to be used for the transition only. This may be accomplished either by inclusion of information in the protocol message (e.g., an IE specifying the RF carrier status or condition), or the absence of data (e.g., where no IE is provided or the IE is empty, the CBSD can infer that the RF carrier is of one type or the other).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0145">As referenced above, the SAS defines a timer parameter that is given to affected CBSD(s) to be used to complete the intra-cell and inter-frequency handover within the time defined by the timer parameter. For instance, as part of the protocol communication of step <b>508</b>, the SAS may utilize a defined IE (information element) present in a configuration or status message, with the value of the timer specified. For example, in one variant, the SAS and CBSDs continuously exchange Heartbeat (HB) messages to maintain the status of the allocated channels, perform &#x201c;health&#x201d; checks, etc. These messages may also be used by a SAS to terminate a grant/revoke previously granted channel. In one implementation, an IE is added to the HB message to enable the SAS to provide data including: (i) data indicating one or more alternate channels to be utilized; (ii) data indicative of whether the channel is temporary or permanent; and (iii) data indicating duration of the grant for the alternate channel(s) provided.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0146">It will be appreciated that other methods for signaling the presence or absence of active traffic being carried by the target CBSD(s)&#x2014;i.e., other than a &#x201c;message/response&#x201d; protocol&#x2014;may be used consistent with the disclosure. For example, in one variant, passive determination is used, such as where the CBSD(s) maintain updated UE/carrier data in a database which is either directly or indirectly accessible to the SAS or DP.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0147">In another variant, the absence of periodic or other &#x201c;heartbeat&#x201d; messaging from a given CBSD relating to its status may indicate the lack of traffic; for example, a CBSD may be configured to &#x201c;sleep&#x201d; when inactive, and reduce or eliminate upstream message traffic during such periods. By determining that a status or heartbeat message has not been issued by the CBSD for a prescribed period of time, the SAS or DP can infer that the CBSD is inactive. Yet other approaches will be recognized by those of ordinary skill given the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0148">Once the target CBSD(s) receive the timer data and frequency data (carrier number) per step <b>510</b>, it proceeds to activate the RF carrier, start its local timer, and instruct all active users (e.g., UEs with active sessions) to perform a intra-cell, inter frequency handover to the specified channel per steps <b>512</b> and <b>513</b>. Either at expiration of the local timer or upon completion of handing over active UEs to the specified RF carrier, the CBSD(s) releases the old (original) RF carrier per step <b>514</b>, and determines whether the assigned RF carrier was permanent (final) or temporary per step <b>516</b>. In one variant, the aforementioned IE data present in the protocol message is used to determine RF carrier status as temporary or final.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0149">When the evaluation of step <b>516</b> indicates that the RF carrier was in fact final, the CBSD informs the SAS via a protocol message sent from the CBSD to the SAS (or to the DP, as discussed supra) of the completion of the transfer to the final carrier per step <b>518</b>. The local timer may also be evaluated (not shown) to determine whether local time (e.g., a local CBSD/eNB value) exceeds the timer value parameter sent by the SAS; if so, an error message is generated and sent to the SAS or MSO controller <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0150">When the evaluation of step <b>516</b> indicates that the RF carrier was not final, the CBSD awaits the receipt of the next RF carrier from the SAS (or DP) per step <b>522</b>. As part of this procedure, the CBSD may inform the SAS via a protocol message sent from the CBSD to the SAS (or to the DP, as discussed supra) of the completion of the transfer to the temporary RF carrier (step <b>520</b>); this can be used in one embodiment to trigger the SAS/DP to issue the protocol message with the next RF carrier of step <b>522</b>.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0151">When the CBSD receives the next RF carrier from the SAS/DP, it activate the new carrier in the cell (step <b>524</b>), and performs the intra-cell inter-frequency handover from the temporary RF carrier to the new RF carrier per step <b>526</b>, and release the temporary (last) carrier per step <b>528</b>. The process then returns to step <b>516</b>, wherein the finality of the handover process is again evaluated.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0152">It is noted that in low load conditions (i.e., where extra RF frequencies exist), the temporary RF carrier assigned in step <b>508</b> may be the final RF carrier (as may be indicated by the SAS per the protocol message as described above). Conversely, &#x201c;chains&#x201d; using one or more temporary carriers may be employed, such as where there is a high load on a given CBSD. It will further be appreciated that the SAS/DP may utilize a &#x201c;break before make&#x201d; type logic where it causes a given CBSD to divorce itself from a given RF carrier (after the temporary carrier is activated), without knowledge of where the CBSD will be directed next in terms of frequency planning. As such, the SAS/DP may maintain a pool of temporary carrier for such purposes, and dynamically decide after each carrier transition where (in frequency) the next &#x201c;hop&#x201d; in the chain will terminate, based on then-prevailing conditions. This type of analysis may also be delegated to the MSO controller <b>310</b>, the latter which may also reside at least partly within the CBSD itself. As such, the SAS/DP (or controller) may apply contention and/or arbitration mechanisms for the temporary carriers in its pool(s), between e.g., different CBSDs (whether within the same MSO service domain or other) so that temporary carriers (and even final carriers) are fairly allocated, and the number of handovers is minimized to the maximum degree practicable.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0153">Alternatively, the SAS/DP may have planned out the complete chain of events for frequency migration/reassignment before invoking it at the target CBSD(s) per step <b>508</b>. For instance, the SAS/DP may, via algorithmic analysis performed by the SAS/DP or a proxy process such as the MSO controller, generate a plan for all UE on a given CBSD (or more broadly, across multiple CBSD) such that (i) there are no &#x201c;collisions&#x201d; (e.g., two UE on the same RF carrier at the same time, whether temporarily or permanently), and (ii) that any withdrawn or otherwise unusable carriers are completely devoid of UE within the prescribed time limit. For instance, in one variant, the SAS/DP generates a protocol message to the MSO controller <b>310</b> to invoke generation of a frequency plan by the controller. In one implementation, the message includes a) the pool of available carriers, including for temporary use; and b) the current RF carriers to be relinquished. The MSO controller logic then uses this data to generate a &#x201c;migration&#x201d; plan for all UE on the target CBSD(s), including the chain of hops (i.e., F1 to F2 to F3 for UE1, F5 to F4 for UE2, and so forth) such that no collisions occur, and session continuity is maintained. This plan can be sent back to the SAS/DP per a response protocol message, and the plan approved and implemented by the SAS/DP, and subsequently implemented thereby via the signaling described previously.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a ladder diagram illustrating the exemplary communications flow for the methodology of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, et seq.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0155">Table 4 below illustrates one exemplary implementation of a protocol message useful in implementing the foregoing methodology in the context of a CBRS-based system.

Specifically, as shown, the CBSD issues a &#x201c;heartbeat request&#x201d; (in the exemplary context of CBRS, a HeartbeatRequest object) which informs the SAS that the CBSD needs access to the allocated spectrum, and further can be used by the SAS to suspend or terminate a spectrum grant. This procedure is used by a CBSD when it has one or more grants in the &#x201c;Granted&#x201d; or &#x201c;Authorized&#x201d; states. If the transmit expiration timer expires prior to reception of a HeartbeatResponse object, the CBSD discontinues transmission for the grant within 60 seconds after the value of the transmitExpireTime parameter expires.

For example, a serving cell/sector can provision the thresholds for one or more UE(s) served by the cell/sector, and the UE provides the measurements to cell/sector. Moreover, the serving cell can &#x201c;tune&#x201d; thresholds associated with these measurements and effectively steer the UE towards the desired target cell.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0166">Next, the CBSD/eNB identifies a new or target sector (S2) and frequency (F2) associated therewith per step <b>706</b>. As used in this context, the term &#x201c;new or target&#x201d; refers to, inter alia, temporary or final frequencies; i.e., the target may be merely part of a &#x201c;hop&#x201d; sequence or plan, or may in fact be the (then) final frequency on which the UE will operate for at least a period of time without further hop. This identification of step <b>706</b> may be conducted by the CBSD/eNB alone, or based at least in part on information from the SAS/DP (e.g., from OpertionParam object as previously described). In one embodiment, the CBSD/eNB is configured to determine which sectors are available for the handover.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0167">Network planning is utilized to provide coverage for a given geographic region. Ideally, coverage is preserved across any channel (frequency) change. In reality, coverage during channel changes may be different, but the specified operational configuration should attempt to preserve as much of the original coverage as possible across the channel change. The new sector (S2) with the new channel (F2) should accordingly provide service to all UEs previously served using the prior channel (F1) to the greatest degree practicable.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0168">Next, per step <b>708</b>, the CBSD/eNB <b>314</b> signals the affected UE(s) <b>306</b> to cause them to invoke an access protocol on the newly identified sector/carrier (S2/F2). In one embodiment, the signaling advantageously leverages extant 3GPP RRC Connection Reconfiguration messaging protocols now utilized ubiquitously by LTE-enabled mobile devices. Specifically, the CBSD/eNB instructs, via the first sector array S1, the UE(s) to reconfigure their connection and invoke a RACH (random access channel) procedure by which the UE can obtain the new sector/carrier (S2/F2). Logic within the CBSD/eNB, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>a</i></figref>, communicates the new (F2) channel assignment to S2, such that the logic within the S2 radio chain responds to the UE RACH request with F2 (as opposed to some other carrier of its own choosing). It is noted in passing that in the illustrated embodiment, since S1 and S2 are under common association with the CBSD/eNB invoking the handover, the RACH procedure is &#x201c;contention free&#x201d; versus (contention based), as the UE already has an active RRC connection. As such, the time necessary for the CBSD/eNB to service and establish a new RRC Connection on F2/S2, via the S2 array, is advantageously very low.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0169">Moreover, since an intra-eNB handover is utilized in the illustrated embodiment, so there is no impact to an existing data session anchored in the core. In comparison, inter-eNB S1/X2 based handovers specified in 3GPP (LTE) provide session continuity and minimize disruption to data (e.g. transferring packets over X2 between two eNBs, and re-sequencing them, using end marker packets etc.); however the intra-eNB handover described herein is significantly more robust compared to inter-eNB scenario.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0170">Notably, in LTE, an idle mode UE does not have context in the eNB. Accordingly, this scenario can be addressed differently; e.g., by forcing the UE to perform idle mode cell reselection, and switch to the new channel.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0171">It will further be appreciated that the 3GPP (LTE) standards provide two modes for a Random Access (RACH) procedure, specifically: (i) non-contention based, and (ii) contention-based. The contention-based approach can be used any time for normal attach/handover etc.; however, the contention-free (non-contention based) approach can be used only during handover. Moreover, the contention-free approach can be used for both intra-eNB and inter-eNB handovers. Within the contention-free Random Access procedure, the serving cell provides the UE with the pre-amble in the target cell under both intra-eNB and inter-eNB handovers. This functionality further optimizes the handover process but as will be recognized, is purely optional under the various aspects disclosed herein.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">CBSD/eNB Apparatus&#x2014;</heading><p id="p-0179" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary CBSD/eNB access node <b>314</b> according to the present disclosure.

Additional unlicensed, licensed, or quasi-licensed air interfaces may also be used within the CBSD/eNB, including e.g., Wi-Fi, non-CBRS band LTE, 5G NR, or others. Moreover, the LTE radio functionality may be extended to incipient 3GPP-based 5G NR protocols; e.g., at maturation of LTE deployment and when 5G NR-enabled handsets are fielded, such adaptation being accomplished by those of ordinary skill given the contents of the present disclosure. As a brief aside, NG-RAN or &#x201c;NextGen RAN (Radio Area Network)&#x201d; is part of the 3GPP &#x201c;5G&#x201d; next generation radio system. 3GPP is currently specifying Release 15 NG-RAN, its components, and interactions among the involved nodes including so-called &#x201c;gNBs&#x201d; (next generation Node B's or eNBs). NG-RAN will provide very high-bandwidth, very low-latency (e.g., on the order of 1 ms or less &#x201c;round trip&#x201d;) wireless communication and efficiently utilize, depending on application, both licensed and unlicensed spectrum of the type described supra in a wide variety of deployment scenarios, including indoor &#x201c;spot&#x201d; use, urban &#x201c;macro&#x201d; (large cell) coverage, rural coverage, use in vehicles, and &#x201c;smart&#x201d; grids and structures. NG-RAN will also integrate with 4G/4.5G systems and infrastructure, and moreover new LTE entities are used (e.g., an &#x201c;evolved&#x201d; LTE eNB or &#x201c;eLTE eNB&#x201d; which supports connectivity to both the EPC (Evolved Packet Core) and the NR &#x201c;NGC&#x201d; (Next Generation Core).</p><p id="p-0184" num="0177">In some aspects, exemplary Release 15 NG-RAN leverages technology and functions of extant LTE/LTE-A technologies (colloquially referred to as 4G or 4.5G), as bases for further functional development and capabilities. For instance, in an LTE-based network, upon startup, an eNB (base station) establishes S1-AP connections towards the MME (mobility management entity) whose commands the eNB is expected to execute. An eNB can be responsible for multiple cells (in other words, multiple Tracking Area Codes corresponding to E-UTRAN Cell Global Identifiers). The procedure used by the eNB to establish the aforementioned S1-AP connection, together with the activation of cells that the eNB supports, is referred to as the S1 SETUP procedure; see inter alia, 3GPP TS 36.413 V14.4. entitled &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); S1 Application Protocol (S1AP) (Release 14)&#x201d; dated September 2017, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0178">As such, the various aspects of the present disclosure can be readily adapted for use within the 5G NR context, including use of a CBSD/gNB, and associated CU/DU functionality and &#x201c;splits&#x201d; to implement the seamless handover functions described herein.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0179">The tuner <b>815</b> in one embodiment comprises a digitally controlled RF tuner capable of reception of signals via the RF front end (receive chain) of the LTE radio <b>809</b> in the aforementioned bands, including in one variant simultaneous reception (e.g., both 2.300 to 2.500 and 3.550 to 3.700 GHz bands at the same time).</p><p id="p-0187" num="0180">The processing apparatus <b>802</b> is configured to execute at least one computer program stored in memory <b>804</b> (e.g., a non-transitory computer readable storage medium); in the illustrated embodiment, such programs include logic to implement the seamless inter-frequency, intra-cell handover logic and inter-sector handover logic described previously herein.
