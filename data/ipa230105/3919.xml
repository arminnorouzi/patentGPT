A metamaterial may comprise of an array of nanostructures distributed across a surface. A spectrum, such as the visible spectrum, may interact with the nanostructures. A plasmonic material may be a type of metamaterial. There may be a surface plasmon (SP) mode, where the spectrum may cause a charge distribution on the metamaterial's nanostructured surface that may oscillate between a positive and negative charge periodically.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A surface plasmon mode may occur when the nanostructures have a certain shape and distribution. In some embodiments, the nanostructures may be shaped like paraboloids and the distribution may comprise overlapping tiles that may be hexagonal in shape. The surface plasmon mode, also known as normal-to-plane mode, together with the distribution of the nanostructures, may interact together to reflect one wavelength from the spectrum at a much greater intensity than other wavelengths, which may be known as a &#x201c;peak wavelength reflected&#x201d; or a &#x201c;target wavelength.&#x201d; The nanostructures may be capable of operating in normal-to-plane mode. For many metamaterials, the angle of incidence may change the peak wavelength reflected. However, with a paraboloid-shaped nanostructures and the overlapping tile distribution, a change in angle of incidence may result in a markedly lower change of peak wavelength reflect compared to other shapes and distributions of nanostructures.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">This greatly reduced dependence of the peak wavelength on the angle of incidence may lead to the term &#x201c;angle independence&#x201d; being used herein to describe this phenomenon.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Furthermore, when the nanostructure is stretched or compressed, the peak wavelength reflected may change. This property of changing the peak wavelength reflected may be used to measure pressure changes when the nanostructure is part of a pressure sensing device. Lastly, a change in peak wavelength may also occur if the nanostructure is exposed to a liquid on its surface. The liquid may interact with the nanostructures surface to change the peak wavelength shift. This property of changing peak wavelength shift may be used to identify chemicals in a chemical analysis sensor.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">While previous processing techniques may allow for shapes including disks and pillars, none may allow for paraboloid or other rounded shapes that may be manufactured at the nanometer scale. As will be described, these processing techniques may enable a normal-to-plane mode nanostructure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an example embodiment of a structure <b>100</b>.

Pattern <b>103</b> may be periodic, which may be a repeatable distribution of nanostructures. Pattern <b>103</b> may have equidistant nanostructures <b>101</b>, such as a hexagonal pattern. Pattern <b>103</b> may have both equidistant and non-equidistant structures (i.e. are partially equidistant), such as a square pattern where some neighboring nanostructures may be equidistant while other neighboring nanostructures have a different distance (EG, diagonal neighbors).

A spectrum <b>201</b> may travel onto structure <b>100</b> at a first angle of incidence <b>203</b><i>a</i>, which may also be known as a first angle <b>203</b><i>a</i>. First angle <b>203</b><i>a </i>may be any angle between 0 degrees (parallel to the plane of structure <b>100</b>) and 90 degrees (perpendicular to the plane of structure <b>100</b>). In some embodiments, spectrum <b>201</b> may comprise any wavelength or range of wavelengths, which may be known as broadband light, in the visible and near-infrared spectrum. In another embodiment, spectrum <b>201</b> may be in a different spectrum range, such as near-infrared, ultraviolet, microwave, or other wavelength range. There may be a second angle of incidence <b>203</b><i>b </i>and a third angle incidence <b>203</b><i>c</i>, which may also be any angle between 0 degrees and 90 degrees.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Spectrum <b>201</b> may interact with structure <b>100</b> and produce a reflected spectrum <b>202</b>, which may be reflected from structure <b>100</b> at a first angle of reflection <b>204</b><i>a</i>.

That is, the response of structure <b>100</b> to spectrum <b>201</b> may be angle-independent. Angle-independence may not be truly independent, that is, there may be some variations in the exact peak wavelength reflected in reflected spectrum <b>202</b> based on the angles of incidence <b>203</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, but such angle dependence is greatly reduced compared to other metamaterials.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The peak wavelength reflected may vary slightly based on the angle of incidence <b>203</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>.

In response, reflected spectrum <b>202</b> may have a first peak wavelength of about 600 nm for first angle <b>203</b><i>a</i>, a second peak wavelength of about 602 nm for second angle <b>203</b><i>b</i>, and a third peak wavelength of about 604 nm for a third angle <b>203</b><i>c</i>. The first, second, and third peak wavelengths may be substantially similar so as to apply the term &#x201c;angle-independent,&#x201d; however, there may still be small wavelength variations in reflected spectrum <b>202</b> based on the angles of incidence <b>203</b><i>a</i>-<i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another embodiment, the peak wavelength for any given angle may change when structure <b>100</b> is stretched or compressed. If structure <b>100</b> is stretched or compressed, reflected spectrum <b>202</b> may have a new peak wavelength that is different than the first peak wavelength.

Reviewing the other pressure change responses <b>701</b> and <b>702</b>, one may find that response <b>702</b> may have an angle-independent response (EG, very little peak wavelength shift) to a change in peak wavelength of spectrum <b>202</b>. As described previously, angle independent may be less angle-dependent than other solutions. Response <b>702</b>, which may use paraboloid-shaped nanostructures of second nanostructure shape <b>302</b>, may have a peak wavelength shift at 0 mmHg of between 2.5 nm and 3 mm for angle of incidence ranges from 30 degrees of scenario <b>730</b> to 60 degrees of scenario <b>710</b> respectively. The difference in peak wavelength shift between a 30 degree and 60 degree angle of incidence may be approximately 0.5 nm.

The difference in peak wavelength shift between a 30 degree and 60 degree angle of incidence may be approximately 10 nm. In the visible spectrum, a difference in peak wavelength shift of 10 nm may result in a color change. Therefore, if a disc-shaped nanostructure is used in sensor <b>600</b>, there may be an &#x201c;angle dependent&#x201d; range where measurements may provide different readings across a range of angles of incidence.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0094">As described previously, paraboloid-shaped nanostructures may allow for a useful sensor <b>600</b> because it may be angle independent or less dependent on angles of incidence. The angle of incidence of spectrum <b>201</b> may not need to be exact and it may be a range of angles, such as from 30 degrees to 60 degrees. This may be shown in responses <b>702</b>. Unlike responses <b>701</b>, in responses <b>701</b>, there may be an angle dependent response which may not be useful for a sensor <b>600</b> because measurements may require an exact angle of incidence to provide repeatable measurements.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0095">Pressure measurement readings may be calibrated for sensor <b>600</b> by using the data of pressure measurement <b>700</b>, specifically responses <b>702</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0096">Sensor <b>600</b> may use paraboloid-shaped nanostructures and may be calibrated to pressure measurements as shown in responses <b>702</b>.
