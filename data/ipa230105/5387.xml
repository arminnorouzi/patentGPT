Since the four quantum number combinations of each element are unique by Pauli's exclusion principle, each chemical element occupies a different vertex of this lattice and has a unique location in 4D space. The 4 quantum numbers are used as independent vectors of a 4-dimensional vector space so that quantum numbers can be added in the same manner as vectors are added. The 4D PT displays complementarity and the principle of zero cyclic sum in numbers associated with elements. The 4D PT of elements and their coordinates extend to chemical molecules and compounds by adding coordinates of individual elements into composite coordinates of molecules and compounds in a larger expansive PT. The higher-dimensional table of elements and compounds can be represented in any digital media where they can be manipulated graphically and interactively by various input devices including virtual reality. The 4D PT can be displayed in print media as 2D charts, or 2D cards that can be combined in various ways. It can be physically built in different materials as 3D model kits for teaching, learning, research and practice of chemistry in academia and industry. The 3D model kits can be like space frames comprising nodes and connecting struts or 3D blocks or connected 2D panels.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000"

table (4D PT) of chemical elements based on the four known quantum numbers of the atom which determine the Cartesian coordinates (n,l,m,s) of a 4D-cubic lattice. Each chemical element lies on a different vertex of the 4D lattice. The 4D PT can be represented in digital or physical form. It can be physically built in 3-dimensions as a space frame comprising physical nodes representing the elements and joined by struts along 4 parallel directions. The 4D PT can also be represented as six sets of parallel planes derived from paired combinations of quantum numbers. These sets of planes lead to a system of panels which comprise modules, each module comprising elements, and the system can be used to construct various 3D and 2D periodic tables derived from 4D. The 4D co-ordinate system extends to isotopes by adding the 5th dimension. It also extends to molecules and compounds in a larger periodic table. This invention can be used for teaching, learning, research and practice of chemistry within academia and industry.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This patent continues the prior-filed Provisional Patent application 62/922,071 filed on Jul. 22, 2019.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Chemical elements in the universe are captured in the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements, a fundamental scheme for organizing different elements, nature's building blocks of all matter. It establishes the foundations in teaching, research and practice in all branches of chemistry. Advances in chemistry and its wide applications to technology, engineering, medicine, material science, solid state physics, nano-technology, and other fields which involve physical matter, are anchored by this underlying system. Over the years, various improvements in the design of the periodic table have been proposed and a large number of 2D and 3D periodic tables have been developed. The website The Internet Database of Periodic Tables curated by Mark R. Leach (meta-synthesis.com) provides a record of these developments in addition to the books by J. W. van Spronsen, <i>The Periodic System of Chemical Elements, A history of the First Hundred Years </i>(1969) and by Edward G. Mazurs, <i>Graphic Representations of the Periodic System During One Hundred Years </i>(1967).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention discloses a 4-dimensional periodic table (4D PT) based on the four quantum numbers, namely, the principle quantum number n, the angular (orbital, azimuthal) quantum number l, the magnetic quantum number m and the spin quantum number s. These four quantum numbers are well-known and define the structure of the atom [Herzberg, 1944]. They are used here as the 4 generators or vectors of a 4D periodic table of elements where each point location of the table has distinct 4D Cartesian co-ordinates (n,l,m,s) that specify each element uniquely. The sequence n, l, m and s of these co-ordinates follows the chronological sequence in which they were introduced into the periodic table. Scerri (2007, p. 192-203) provides a history of the sequence in which the quantum numbers were introduced into the periodic table by physicists: n was introduced by Bohr, l by Sommerfeld, m by Stoner and s by Pauli. The implications of this chronology is that it establishes the sequence of (n,l,m,s) co-ordinates used here.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These four quantum numbers are used here to define 4 independent directions of a 4D Euclidean space, a space which is the natural spatial extension of the familiar 3D space specified by three Cartesian coordinates and represented by 3 independent and mutually perpendicular axes. Similarly, 4D space is represented by four Cartesian coordinates, in this case (n,l,m,s), all independent and mutually perpendicular. When all known combinations of permissible values of quantum numbers are mapped in four coordinates in 4D space, it leads to a very specific topological structure for the 4D PT. The structure is embedded in a 4-dimensional cubic lattice, and each vertex of this lattice has different coordinates from others and thus provides a unique location for each element. This uniqueness satisfies the Pauli's exclusion principle which prohibits the same 4-number combination for two atoms.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Quantum numbers have been used in prior tables but there is no instance where all four have independent directions in space. Finke's Right 2D table has 3 quantum numbers, l, m and s along the same horizontal direction and n along the vertical. In Janet's Left Step 2D table, n+l is combined along the vertical and l,m,s are along the horizontal. In Tsimmerman's 3D tetrahedral table, n and l are separated but m and s are combined along one direction. In Stowe's 3D table, x-y-z represent s, m and n, respectively, while l is represented by color as an independent &#x201c;fourth&#x201d; dimension. The use of &#x201c;4D&#x201d; in this case combines 3 dimensions of space with the attribute of color as the fourth &#x201c;dimension&#x201d;. The latter use of 4D is carried over into the Janet-Stowe-Scerri model of a &#x201c;4D periodic table&#x201d; where 3 spatial dimensions are combined with a visual attribute as the fourth dimension, i.e. 3 spatial dimensions are combined with one non-spatial dimension. Though 4D PT has been used for these two tables, the present invention discloses all 4 dimensions as spatially equivalent and independent of each other.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">None of the prior periodic tables disclose a 4-dimensional periodic table of elements defined by four Cartesian co-ordinates of a hyper-cubic lattice based on 4 quantum numbers of the atom. The prior work also does not disclose how a such a 4D PT with 4 distinct directions can be represented in 2D or 3D, or how a physical 3D model can be built.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A primary object of this invention is to provide a new periodic table of elements, a 4D PT, in physical form in 3D space wherein all four quantum numbers are represented as 4 sets of edges of a projected 4D-cubic lattice with coordinates (n,l,m,s), wherein each set of edges represents a different quantum number, and all edges within one set are parallel to each other.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of the invention is to provide a way to build the 4D PT as a 3D model-kit composed of nodes and struts which can be assembled and disassembled to learn and teach the complex and complete relationships between the elements. Alternatively, the 4D PT can be built from 3D blocks or cells.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object of the invention is to build the 4D PT in 3D physical form from parallel planes which comprise a system of panels built from modules, each module representing a group of elements, and panels are interconnected by other joining elements.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the invention is to build the two 3D half-PTs and join them with one set of joining elements which represent the 4<sup>th </sup>dimension.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another object of the invention is to provide a new periodic table which graphically or spatially displays conservation laws that underpin physical and chemical properties of elements. The 4D periodic table disclosed here shows principles of complementarity and zero cycle sum in the numbers associated with the physical and chemical features and properties of elements.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another object of this invention is a periodic table of molecules and compounds as an extended lattice using the same 4D coordinates of chemical elements. Any molecule has the composite coordinates of the sum of quantum numbers (quantum sum) of the atoms comprising the molecule.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another object of this invention is a periodic table of isotopes as an extended 5D lattice where the number of neutrons is added as an independent axis.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another object of the invention is to provide a 2-dimensional graphic display of the 4D table in physical or digital formats like paper, plane surfaces, screens, tablets, phones, and the like, for purposes of learning, teaching and practice of chemistry.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another object of the invention is to provide a stack of 2D panels or cards derived from the 6 pairs of quantum numbers and use these cards to assemble them into different 2D periodic tables.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another object of the invention is to provide a basis for an interactive model of the 4D PT which can be navigated digitally by the user using touchscreen or other technologies which enable a navigation along the four dimensions specified by quantum numbers. These objects and features will become clear from the detailed description below which, along with the drawings, comprises a full disclosure of the invention. To those skilled in the art, it would be clear that deviations and variations of the invention are possible without substantially altering the scope of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention

Vector Star: <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the 4 quantum numbers by (n, l, m, s) vectors as generators of a 4D cubic lattice. The vector star <b>1</b> comprises 4 vectors 2-5, vector n, vector l, vector m, and vector s, respectively, emanating from the origin <b>6</b>. The 4D lattice generated by these vectors has all edges of the lattice parallel to these 4 directions. All vectors meet at 90-degress in 4D space and thus define the directions of edges of a 4D-cube and its array, a 4D-cubic lattice. This is similar to the familiar 2D graph paper which is a 2D lattice composed of squares, and has 2 vector directions at 90-degree angles defining the directions of all edges in the lattice. Its 3D version, a cubic lattice composed of arrays of cubes, has 3 vector directions at mutually perpendicular angles, where each cube composed of squares, and the 3 vector directions define the directions of all 3 sets of edges of the 3D-cubic lattice. Similarly, the 4D-cubic lattice is an array of 4D cubes, where all 4 directions are mutually perpendicular to each other and the 4 directions define the directions of all edges of the 40-lattice.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">1.1 Origin: In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the origin is shown at (0,0,0,0). Though this is correct, it requires the introduction of n=0 elements with 4D co-ordinates (0,0,0,1/2) and (0,0,0,&#x2212;1/2), suggesting a particle (electron) with in two states, +1/2 spin and &#x2212;1/2 spin. Since these two sets of quantum numbers do not define a complete atom, they are excluded from the periodic table of elements. This introduces n=1 as the lowest value of n, shifting the origin to 8 with coordinates (1,0,0,0) as in the extended vector-star <b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. This is used throughout in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b></figref>. Even here, it may be convenient to call Hydrogen (1,0,0,1/2) as the origin, since elements originate with Hydrogen. This will require the s vector to be emanating in a &#x2212;ve direction while the other 3 vectors are represented by arrows in a +ve direction by convention.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The extended vector-star <b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the extents (range) of the 4 vectors (n, l, m, s) based on the permissible values of 4 quantum numbers: n=1 thru 8, l=0 thru 3, m=&#x2212;3,&#x2212;2,&#x2212;1,0,1,2,3, and s=1/2 and &#x2212;1/2. These values lead to specific and unique coordinates <b>9</b> showing (n,l,m,s) values for each vertex (point) <b>10</b> on the 4D-lattice. The lines joining adjacent vertices are edges <b>11</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>of the 4D-lattice, edges <b>11</b><i>a </i>representing direction n, edges <b>11</b><i>b </i>representing direction <b>1</b>, edges <b>11</b><i>c </i>representing direction m and edges <b>11</b><i>d </i>representing direction s. The extent of edges emanating from the origin <b>8</b> are shown in <b>7</b> and are part of the full 4D-lattice which defines the periodic table which grows from these edges. Each vertex location <b>10</b> defines the precise spatial location of a distinct chemical element in 4D space. Pauli's exclusion principle is satisfied geometrically since each vertex has unique co-ordinates and no vertices are duplicated.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">1.2 Dimensional Build-up: The 4D PT can be built up in a number of ways sequentially and exhaustively as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b></figref>. In each figure, the vector star <b>7</b>&#x2032; is shown at the origin (1,0,0,0). These four figures are in incremental values of l, l=0 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, l=1 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, and l=2,3 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, while n, m and s are variables within each. This leads to n-m-s cubes which define known electronic blocks of elements, each block having edges <b>11</b><i>a </i>parallel to direction n, edges <b>11</b><i>c </i>parallel to direction m, and edges <b>11</b><i>d </i>parallel to direction s. Thus, for the four values of l(0,1,2 and 3), there are four corresponding n-m-s blocks, namely, the s-block comprising 1=0 elements (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), p-block comprising l=1 elements (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), d-block comprising l=2 elements (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) and f-block comprising l=3 elements (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The shapes of these blocks are finite portions of a 2-cubic lattice (s-block) with edges <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>d</i>, and 3-cubic lattices (p-, d- and f-blocks) with edges <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>c </i>and <b>11</b><i>d</i>. Note that the s-block has m=0 elements and is thus a 2D lattice.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">1.21 s-block (l=0): <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the s-block <b>12</b> comprising 16 elements with coordinates (n,0,0,s), where 1=0 and m=0. It is a finite 2D lattice having 16 vertices <b>10</b>, 14 edges <b>11</b><i>a </i>and 8 edges <b>11</b><i>d</i>, and is a part of the 4D cubic lattice defined by vector star <b>7</b>&#x2032; and edge directions n and s. By setting n=1 thru 8, m=0, and s=1/2 or &#x2212;1/2, a 8&#xd7;2 rectangular (2-cubic) array of 16 elements comprising the s-block is obtained (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). It has 8 elements with s=1/2 and remaining 8 with s=&#x2212;1/2. The sizes of arrays are counted by number of vertices in a block. Compared with the familiar 2D periodic tables where each element is represented by a square (or rectangle) &#x201c;tile&#x201d;, the method used here is equivalent to counting each square tile as a vertex located at the center of the tile. The present invention treats the periodic table as a network of points compared to a tessellation of tiles.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">1.22 p-block (1=1): <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the p-block <b>13</b> comprising 36 elements with coordinates (n,1, m, s), where 1=1.

Since there are only 4 triplets of quantum numbers, n-l-m, n-l-s, n-m-s, l-m-s, (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) there only four ways to build the 4D PT by adding the fourth quantum number as the &#x201c;fourth&#x201d; dimension to the familiar three. In a 3D projection, this means a quantum triplet is a cubic lattice and two such cubic lattices can be joined by the fourth quantum number in the same way a cube can be joined to another by adding the fourth dimension to make a hyper-cube. In this sense, each triplet leads to its corresponding complementary singlet, namely, s, m, l or n as the &#x201c;fourth dimension&#x201d;. This provides a practical way to build the 4D PT in 3D space by constructing quantum triplets as a 3D cubic lattice, then adding the fourth quantum number, namely, n, l, m or s, at an angle to the other three in 3D space. This requires designing the node of a space frame that permits the three cubic angles at right angles to each other, and the fourth meeting at an angle to the cubic lattice. Though the cubic angles are not a requirement for building a 3D model of the 4D PT, they may be most convenient and simplest for understanding the 4D PT since the cubic angles are familiar, and the way to read cubic angles in 3 parallel directions taken two at a time is also familiar.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">This 3-way reading of information is an extension of the graph paper concept, and standard tables and charts based on it, which is used in all STEM fields as way to represent information with 2 variables, one along the horizontal, second along the vertical. The 3D cubic chart is also familiar from mapping 3 variables in a cubic lattice reference framework, the x-y-z Cartesian grid. However, when it comes to representing and reading 4-way information, a 4-way Cartesian grid or a 4D-cubic lattice, we enter a challenging visual territory. The simplest way is to break it down into 3-way and 2-way grids, study them separately as part of a collective 4-way grid. This disclosure comprised these two integrally related parts of the same invention as two different dimensional representations, 3D and 2D, of the same 4D PT.

Since there are infinite states of 3D projections from 4D due to continuous angle variations of morphing the vector star in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a system of physical nodes that capture finite variations of angles is needed to build 3D space frame (or space grid, or lattice, or network) models of the 4D PT as one physical embodiment of the invention. The present invention discloses a space frame system comprising nodes connected by struts which allows four selected angle combinations to build preferred versions of the 3D PT. These angles determine the directions of struts. This system of nodes is based on a 12-coordinate system which is described next along with node-strut system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>16</b></figref>. In these illustrations too the vectors in the vector-stars are shown as struts.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">3.1 12-Coordinate System: Discrete states of a continuously morphing vector-star provide a convenient starting point for automating the exhaustive generation of 3D PTs projected from 4D. Independent rotations of each of the 4 vectors n, l, m, s, can be indexed by their individual spatial directions emanating from (0,0,0) to any location within their x-y-z space. Restricting to unit distances with positive and negative values within this space, 27 discrete states (3<sup>3</sup>) of vector directions are possible for each quantum number based on triplet combinations of &#x2212;1, 0 and 1 and indexed by their corresponding 3D Cartesian coordinates. These states are mapped on the vertices, faces and edges of a reference cube in the system <b>46</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. The six primary x-y-z directions emanating from the center (0,0,0) are: Right (1,0,0), Left (&#x2212;1,0,0), Front (0,1,0), Back (0,&#x2212;1,0), Top (0,0,1), Bottom (0,0,&#x2212;1). The 12 secondary directions are paired combinations of these 6 and are oriented towards the mid-points of the reference cube, the 8 tertiary directions are triple combinations of the primary directions and are oriented towards the corners of the cube.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Any states in between these discrete states are possible and lead to a continuum of vector orientations in 3D space. Conversely, any point in 3D space has a corresponding 3-vector values, opening up the repertory of possible strut directions of 3D space frames for the 4D PT. There are 27 corresponding states for each of the 4 vectors, namely, n, l, m, and s, leading to 4 analogous sets of 3D co-ordinate systems. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows <b>46</b>, a generic system of 3D vectors, with 3D co-ordinates for each direction. For each different vector, these can be indexed as (Nx, Ny, Nz) for vector n, (Lx, Ly, Lz) for vector l, (Mx, My, Mz) for vector m, and (Sx, Sy, Sz) for vector s.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">From these 4 parallel sets, combinations obtained by taking any one direction from each set and combining it with any other from each of the remaining three sets lead to all possible 3D 4-vector stars for building the 4D periodic table in a physical form. These combinations of 4 vectors can be indexed with their twelve co-ordinates (Nx,Ny,Nz)(Lx,Ly,Lz)(Mx,My,Mz)(Sx,Sy,Sz) comprising 4 sets of 3 co-ordinates, one set for each different vector in 3D space. Though there are infinite combinations if real number coordinates for vector directions are used, restricting to discrete states, the total combinations are 3<sup>12 </sup>states. These can be mapped on the vertices, faces, edges, and centers of 3D cells and hyper-cells of a 12D cube. To these vector directions, vector lengths add another variable though the starting point for PT design is provided by unit vectors. The number of possibilities increase when the coordinates take on non-unit and non-integer values. The challenge is to select the most useful cases. Some of these are presented here.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows <b>47</b> which includes 8 examples of vector combinations along with their coordinates, each vector contributing a group of 3 coordinates within brackets.

The nodes can be color-coded according to the blocks, a different color for each electronic block. A further finer color difference, e.g. lighter or darker shades of the same color, can be introduced to distinguish s=1/2 and s=&#x2212;1/2 elements. Color-coded struts require a different color for each quantum number. The kit comprises 88 n-struts (red), 56 l-struts (violet), 80 m-struts (cyan) and 60 s-struts (yellow) as shown in these illustrations. The nodes and struts within each block correspond to the numbers of vertices and edges as described in Sec 1.2. The 238 faces in Table 1 can be added as 4-sided panels to the kit, but this will complicate the design. However, it will permit the visualization of portions of the lattice with non-intersecting 3D cells (e.g. p-, d- and f-blocks) and other configurations.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The key consideration in building a 4D PT in 3D space is the design of a 4-directional node which captures each different spatial direction associated with a quantum number. These 4 spatial directions emanate radially from the center of any polyhedron to its vertices, edges or faces. Several classes of such structures were proposed earlier (Lalvani, 1991, 1996) and from this inventory of node designs a vast collection of 3D constructions of 4D PTs is possible. Any regular, semi-regular or irregular polyhedron could be used to determine the direction of struts emanating from its center to any combination of its vertices, edges or face. In addition, other available node options can be used. The proposed 4D lattice can be built from construction kits (used in architecture, design arts and structural engineering) or crystal lattice kits. The former includes Pearce's &#x201c;universal&#x201d; node system with 26 cubic directions, Mengringhausen's Mero system with 18 cubic directions, Bear's zome system using Zometool's 62 icosahedral directions, Fuller's &#x201c;octet truss&#x201d; with 12 node directions similar to the HCP crystal lattice. Some of these model-building systems will produce co-planar faces, hence physically intersecting struts, while some others like BCC lattice will produce overlapping vertices. The latter is unfortunate since the BCC node produces the 4-valent (4-connected) tetrahedral node familiar from the diamond lattice and is the only node option that can provide a global symmetry in the 3D lattice projected from 4D. All other 3D models of the proposed 4D PT will have varying degrees of departure from higher symmetries obtained from nodes based on the five regular polyhedra.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows <b>48</b> which illustrates two related examples of nodes based on the octagonal prism N<b>1</b> in <b>59</b> and a cube N<b>2</b> in <b>60</b> from which 4 struts <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>D emanate as shown to enable connection to other nodes. Their corresponding vector stars are shown in <b>57</b> and <b>58</b>, respectively, and show their derivation from a reference octagonal prism <b>61</b> and a reference cube <b>62</b>. The octagonal prism node N<b>1</b> has two struts, n-strut and m-strut, radiating to the mid-points of its faces and the other two, l-strut and s-strut, to the mid-points of its edges. It thus has two different strut lengths as seen in <b>61</b>. The cubic node N<b>2</b> also has two directions to its mid-faces (also n- and m-struts), and l-strut to its corner and s-strut to its mid-edge. It has 3 different lengths as seen in <b>62</b>. These are just two choices available from any four directions of the octagonal prism and the cube. From these node directions, the periodic table can be built by joining them with color-coded struts (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>), one color for each direction (representing each quantum number), and keeping all struts parallel to these four directions. The names of elements can be marked on the one more sides or faces of the node for visibility from different viewpoints.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Alternative node shapes are possible and four examples are shown in <b>63</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>) with the same directions of struts. <b>64</b> shows the cubic node N<b>2</b> with struts <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B and <b>11</b>D having directions along the faces of the cube <b>11</b>C along the edges of the cube. <b>65</b> shows a cylindrical node N<b>3</b>, <b>66</b> shows a spherical node N<b>4</b>, and <b>67</b> shows a polyhedral node N<b>5</b>, all three as variants having the same struts and directions as <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The struts can be removable and can be inserted into the nodes with receiving holes or nodes with protrusions.

The node must allow a variable number of struts to be inserted depending on its location in the PT. This could mean all identical nodes with eight holes, with two along the same direction, since some struts need to be collinear as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> for the element Sn.

These provide natural groupings of elements in the 4D PT. The groupings correspond to the vertices, edges, faces, cubes and hyper-cubes in the 4D PT. These edge connections lead to diads (element pairs), the square faces lead to tetrads (groups of 4 elements), the cubes lead to octads (groups of 8 elements) and the hyper-cubes lead to hexa-decads (groups of 16 elements).

In the currently known 2D and 3D periodic tables some of these topological elements are repressed or not visible. The continuous transformations of the periodic table by rotations of vectors also addresses, in part, the second part of this discussion which deals with many different periodic tables.

This is an example where the known values of quantum numbers of elements force a connectivity between them in a very specified manner when mapped in 4D space as disclosed herein. Element connectivity is here defined by the number of elements that are connected to its neighbors directly by edges of the lattice. In topological terms, this is the &#x201c;vertex valency&#x201d; of a graph or network and equals the number of edges meeting at that vertex. Though any element in the periodic element can be connected to any other within or without the block, the connection by edges provides the most direct connectivity along the 4 quantum number directions and determines this number. The edge connection between 2 adjacent elements is a one-step change in a quantum number, i.e. only one of the 4 quantum numbers is changed by one unit at a time. This is the minimum change from one element to another and may have implications for chemo-genesis.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref> shows the element connectivity for five early elements in the periodic table.

The table is broken up into 2 columns with s=1/2 elements on left and s=&#x2212;1/2 elements on its right. Each column is broken further into the 4 blocks. The third column on extreme right indicates the location of each element with respect to the entire block. These locations are the Vertex location at outer corners of a block, the Edge locations at the outer edges of the block, and the Face locations are within the outer or interior faces of blocks. Since the s-block is 2-dimensional, it has only Vertex and Edge locations. The 4 elements at the corners of the s-block have a connectivity value 2, and elements along its edges have a value 4. The p-, d- and f-blocks are 3-dimensional and have 3 distinct locations. There are 8 elements at their corners (Vertex locations) with a connectivity value 3. The elements on the outer edges of each block (Edge locations) have a value 5. Elements on faces of the block (Face locations) have a value 7.

The connectivity values of s=&#x2212;1/2 elements are identical to corresponding s=1/2 elements, indicating a mirror symmetry in these value within each block. The overall symmetry in the connectivity values within p-, d- and f-blocks corresponds to mmm, the crystallographic symmetry group of a rectangular parallelepiped (box, brick) since each block has three orthogonal 2-fold axes of rotation and also three orthogonal mirror planes. For the 2-dimensional s-block, the connectivity values have a crystallographic symmetry mm2 with one 2-fold axis of symmetry and two orthogonal mirror planes meeting at it.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0164">Like the number of topological elements in Table 1, these element connectivity values in Table 2 are also absolute in the 4D periodic table.

Each class comprises many parallel planes since all planes are constrained to only directions prescribed by the quantum doublet. Each individual plane comprises either modules of same color (i.e. same block) or different colored modules with each color representing a different electronic block. In addition, s=1/2 and s=&#x2212;1/2 elements within each block has a different shade of the same color.

Complementarity in Quantum Numbers</p><p id="p-0190" num="0188">The 4D PT reveals a global conservation principle of complementarity within each block: the sum of quantum numbers (quantum sum) of element pairs in complementary locations around the center of symmetry of the block is conserved. In addition, the sum of quantum numbers of element pairs in complementary locations within any topological element (2D, 3D or 4D cell) is conserved.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0189">Table 3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b></figref>) shows the 120 elements organized in <b>60</b> complementary pairs of s=1/2 elements s=&#x2212;1/2 elements in two columns. The elements are further organized in the 4 blocks. The s=1/2 elements are in increasing atomic number or increasing n (reading top to down) while the s=&#x2212;1/2 elements are in the reverse order of atomic number or decreasing n (reading bottom to top). The quantum sums for complementary pairs of elements are in the extreme right hand column. This pattern in complementarity, like Tables 1 and 2, provides another invariant in the design of periodic table and is independent of the shape of a particular table. There are two patterns of complementarity here. First, the complementary quantum sum within each block is conserved. Second, these quantum sums show a simple pattern: (9,0,0,0), (9,2,0,0), (9,4,0,0) and (9,6,0,0) as indicated by complementary sums for each electronic block in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b></figref>. This pattern of conservation in quantum sums of elements in complementary locations provide a rule for extending the table to g-block and beyond. For example, by extending the PT to include n=9 elements and extending the same pattern of electron configurations in the n=8 system, the respective quantum sums of complementary located elements in the extended s-, p-, d-, &#x2212;f, -g blocks are in the sequence (10,0,0,0), (10,2,0,0), (10,4,0,0), (10,6,0,0) and (10,8,0,0) for the resulting 170 elements. Extended s-block, p-block and d-block are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>66</b></figref> and extended f-block and g-block in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>67</b></figref> with their respective complementary quantum sums. This provides a systematic way to extend beyond the n=8 system by retaining the 4D structure. The extended half-PT for 85 s=1/2 elements is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>68</b></figref> along with its vector star <b>23</b>, the bounding box <b>24</b> and the color-code <b>81</b> for the colors of electronic blocks.

The outer form is a disphenoid, an isosceles tetrahedron. With the 85 s=&#x2212;1/2 elements added, the full extended PT is a 4D-disphenoid, two parallel disphenoids joined by s-axis, the same way a cube is connected to a parallel cube to make a 4D-cube. The 4D-disphenoid has 170 elements lying on the vertices of an extended 4D cubic lattice.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0190">Some examples of complementarity are provided with elements of s- and p-blocks followed by examples of complementarity within topological elements of the 4D PT.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0191">6.1 Blocks: In the s-block (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), the global center of symmetry is at (4.5,0,0,0); this is between n=4 and n=5 levels and the center is located at the middle of 2D cell K&#x2014;Ca&#x2014;Sr&#x2014;Rb.

A closed cycle joins any element to any other element in a polygonal loop and changes in numbers are positive when they increase in the same direction (say, clockwise), e.g. an increase in atomic number and negative when they decrease (counter-clockwise direction). Within a cycle, the clockwise sum and counter-clockwise sum are also equal.

The Li&#x2014;Be&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;Na&#x2014;Li cycle in (b), read in a clockwise manner, has the sum +1+8-1-8 which equals zero; the minus sign is for the counter-clockwise arrows. Similarly, the clockwise sum in C&#x2014;F&#x2014;Cl&#x2014;Si&#x2014;C cycle (c) yields the equation +3+8-3&#x2212;8=0, the clockwise sum in Li&#x2014;Be&#x2014;F&#x2014;C&#x2014;Li cycle in (d) yields +1+5-3&#x2212;3=0, and the clockwise sum in the hexagonal cycle Li&#x2014;Be&#x2014;F&#x2014;Cl&#x2014;Si&#x2014;Na&#x2014;Li yields +1+5+8-3-3&#x2212;8=0. These four examples show that the cyclic sum of change in Z between a few chosen elements within a block and between blocks equals zero. Extending this idea over the entire periodic table leads to a conservation principle in atomic numbers of chemical elements: the net change in atomic number in closed cycles of elements within the periodic table is zero. This is also the conservation in the change in number of protons in the periodic table.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0203">8.2 Atomic Mass: Zero-cyclic sum applies to atomic mass and is shown with one example of 10 elements in the s-block (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>74</b></figref>). The chosen elements have the same number of protons and neutrons, the atomic mass number A is shown for each (on upper left of each element symbol) and the atomic number Z is shown within brackets. The masses are shown at the vertices of the s-block lattice, and mass differences at the edges. The diagram has 4 cycles, each 4-sided. Starting from top left of each, these cycles are H&#x2014;He&#x2014;Be&#x2014;Li&#x2014;H, Li&#x2014;Be&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;Na&#x2014;Li, Na&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;Ca&#x2014;K&#x2014;Na, and K&#x2014;Ca&#x2014;Sr&#x2014;Rb&#x2014;K. The sum of mass differences in each cycle is zero and is indicated in the middle of each cycle. For example, the clockwise sum of mass differences in the cycle H&#x2014;He&#x2014;Be&#x2014;Li&#x2014;H is 1.988501476020+4.002701845870-1.990182212600-4.001021109290=0.

As before, the direction of arrows is along increasing atomic numbers, + indicates an energy gain along this direction and &#x2212; is energy loss along this direction.

Isotopes</p><p id="p-0210" num="0208">The 4D periodic table of elements can be extended to include isotopes by adding a 5th spatial dimension to the lattice for the variation in the number of neutrons N. This extends the mass number A systematically to include deviations from Z. This new axis (N-axis) can begin with N=0 and have only positive values of N as in the current 2D table of isotopes or nuclides [Sonzogni, 2018]. Alternatively, N=0 location can be where the number of protons and neutrons are equal, i.e. A=2*Z, and N increases away from this position in the positive direction when neutrons are added, or decreases to negative values in the opposite direction. A more compact idea to achieve this would be to re-arrange this neutron axis into several independent axes based on nuclear quantum numbers. This will add several more dimensions to the periodic table.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0209"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>78</b></figref> shows a small portion of this 5D lattice for 12 elements of the p-block located on the left side (same as n=2 and n=3 elements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). These are indexed with their mass number A and atomic number Z, where A=2*Z. Their notation is in the standard form with A on the upper left of the element symbol and Z on the lower left. Additional 12 corresponding nuclides are on located in corresponding locations on the right hand side with one neutron added to each nuclide. These 12 isotopes thus have A=2*Z+1, and the two sets are joined by the N axis representing a gain of 1 neutron by each of the 12 nuclides.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0210">The 5D table exhibits complementarity and the principle of zero-cyclic sum in numbers associated with isotopes in the same manner we saw earlier in elements having equal number of protons and neutrons.

The principle of zero cyclic sum in increase and decrease of Z and A also holds here. Conservation of complementary sum of A within a small subset of the 5D lattice would suggest that complementarity of A applies to other subsets of isotopes in each of the four blocks.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0212">9.2 Isotope Atomic Mass: The zero-sum principle in isotopes is illustrated with one example taken from nucleosynthesis and applies to any cycle in the 5D lattice of isotopes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>79</b></figref> shows a diagram excerpted from the B2FH paper (Burbidge et al, 1957, p. 552, Fig. I,<b>2</b>) and shown here in a simplified network with 12 elements at the nodes and inter-connecting lines from the original drawing.

The vectors of the 118-vector star are indexed v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, . . . v120, where the suffixes correspond to the atomic number of corresponding elements. The space of the compounds is a 120D-cubic lattice embedded within a super 4D-cubic lattice having the 4 quantum number co-ordinates. It provides a location for all combinations of all elements in one space. This space provides the starting point of an inclusive generative taxonomy for compounds wherein known compounds are indexed by specific co-ordinate locations and new compounds can be generated systematically. Isomers will require branching from each node of a generic compound to extend the morphologic space of compounds.
