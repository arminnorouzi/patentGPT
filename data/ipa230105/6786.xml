In a scenario in which a network device performs multi-user (Multiple User, MU) transmission, a physical layer protocol data unit (Physical Protocol Data Unit, PPDU) sent by the network device to a station (STA) includes a legacy preamble, an HE-SIG-A, an HE-SIG-B, and data. The HE-SIG-A and the HE-SIG-B indicate signaling information required for demodulating a subsequent data field. It can be learned that the PPDU sent by the network device includes the HE-SIG-B only in the MU transmission scenario. As a result, the STA needs to use two greatly different reception policies to receive the PPDU in the SU transmission scenario and the PPDU in the MU transmission scenario. In addition, a quantity of bits of the HE-SIG-A is limited. As a result, in the SU scenario, information carried in the HE-SIG-A is limited.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of this application provide a data transmission method and a related apparatus, so that a signaling field in a PPDU can carry more information.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a first aspect, an implementation of this application provides a data transmission method. The method includes:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A network device generates a first physical layer protocol data unit PPDU, where the first PPDU includes a first universal-Signaling field U-SIG field and a first extremely high throughput-Signaling field EHT-SIG field, and a sum of a quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field and a quantity of information bits of the first EHT-SIG field is less than or equal to 78 information bits.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The network device sends an encoded first PPDU to a station.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field meet at least one of the following:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">At least one of the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field includes an identifier indication field, where the identifier indication field is used to uniquely identify one station, for example, the identifier indication field is used to uniquely identify one station in a basic service set (BSS) including the network device;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">the first U-SIG field or the first EHT-SIG field includes a PPDU format indication field, and the PPDU format indication field occupies more than 1 information bit; or</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">the first demodulation indication field includes a spatial reuse indication field.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this way, the technical solution of this implementation of this application can ensure that the sum of the quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field and the quantity of information bits of the first EHT-SIG field is less than or equal to 78 information bits. This reduces indication overheads. In addition, the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field can carry more information without increasing indication overheads.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It should be noted that names of the first EHT-SIG field and the second EHT-SIG field in this implementation of this application are determined according to the 802.11be standard. The names of the first EHT-SIG field and the second EHT-SIG field in this implementation of this application may alternatively be names of related SIG fields in other standard versions. The first EHT-SIG field and the second EHT-SIG field in this implementation of this application are not limited to SIG fields related to the 802.11be standard. The first EHT-SIG field and the second EHT-SIG field in this implementation of this application may be used to indicate SIG fields related to any standard version.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Specifically, in a possible implementation, at least one of the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field includes an identifier indication field. The identifier indication field is an association identifier (AID) for uniquely identifying one station in the basic service set including the network device. In this way, an identifier indication field included in the encoded first PPDU can uniquely indicate one STA. The STA may learn, from the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field, whether the encoded first PPDU is sent to the STA, without continuing to receive a subsequent preamble data field. This reduces power consumption of the station. In addition, even if a data field following the first U-SIG field and a data field following the first EHT-SIG field are not correctly received, because the station can determine, based on the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field, that the first PPDU is sent to the station, the station may perform hybrid automatic repeat requests (HARQ) combined reception based on subsequent retransmission. Moreover, a third-party device can learn of a sender and a receiver of the first PPDU without causing interference to a device that is performing transmission. This helps the third-party device perform scheduling.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another possible implementation, a field that indicates a PPDU format and that is included in the first U-SIG field or the first EHT-SIG field occupies more than 1 information bit. In this case, compared with a solution in which only one information bit is occupied for indicating the PPDU format, in this implementation of this application, the PPDU format indication field occupies more than 1 information bit. In this way, the PPDU format indication field can carry more information, so that more functions can be supported.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The PPDU format indication field may indicate the PPDU format and indicate that a transmission mode is SU or MU transmission. In this way, when receiving a U-SIG field of first (N&#x2212;1) information bits, the station can determine whether SU transmission or MU transmission is performed, and use a corresponding reception policy.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">For example, the PPDU format indication field may further include information indicating that a transmission scenario is SU, MU non-orthogonal frequency division multiple access (MU non-orthogonal frequency division multiple, MU non-OFDMA), or MU OFDMA; may further include information indicating a trigger based (TB) frame; and may further include information indicating whether to perform puncturing.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In still another possible implementation, the first U-SIG field or the first EHT-SIG field includes a spatial reuse indication field. This can support a spatial reuse function.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Optionally, a length of the spatial reuse indication field is 2 information bits. The spatial reuse indication field may indicate any one of the following four items: an item for prohibiting parameterized spatial reuse (Parameterized Spatial reuse DISALLOW, PSR_DISALLOW), an item for prohibiting spatial reuse transmission (SR_RESTRICTED), an item for delaying spatial reuse transmission (SR_DELAY), and an item for prohibiting both PSR based spatial reuse and non-SR group (Group) overlapping basic service set (OBSS)-packet detection based spatial reuse. The spatial reuse indication field is used by the station to implement a corresponding spatial reuse function.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some implementations, a length of a second U-SIG field of an unencoded second PPDU is equal to the quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field, and both the quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field and the quantity of information bits of the second U-SIG field are less than or equal to 52 information bits. The first PPDU is sent by the network device to one station when the network device performs single-user transmission, and the second PPDU is sent by the network device to a plurality of stations when the network device performs multi-user transmission. In this case, the quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field in the first PPDU sent by the network device to the station in the SU scenario is equal to the quantity of information bits of the second U-SIG field in the second PPDU sent by the network device in the MU scenario. This can help reduce a difference between a reception policy for receiving the first U-SIG field by the station in the SU scenario and a reception policy for receiving the second U-SIG field by the station in the MU scenario, and help the station receive a U-SIG field in different scenarios.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some implementations, the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field include an identifier indication field. The identifier indication field includes a first indication subfield and a second indication subfield. The first U-SIG field includes the first indication subfield, and the first EHT-SIG field includes the second indication subfield. In this way, idle information bits in the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field are fully used, thereby avoiding a case in which the quantity of information bits in the first U-SIG field or the first EHT-SIG field is increased because a unique station identifier needs to be indicated.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some implementations, a start information bit of the first indication subfield is an Nth information bit of the first U-SIG field, and a field type of first (N&#x2212;1) information bits of the first U-SIG field is correspondingly the same as a field type of first (N&#x2212;1) information bits of the second U-SIG field, where N is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than 35. In this way, when the station receives the first U-SIG field in the SU scenario and receives the second U-SIG field in the MU scenario, a same policy is used for receiving first parts of information bits. This helps reduce a difference between reception policies for receiving a U-SIG field by the station in different scenarios, and helps the station receive and demodulate a PPDU.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some implementations, the field type of the first (N&#x2212;1) information bits of the first U-SIG field and the field type of the first (N&#x2212;1) information bits of the second U-SIG field include one or more of the following: a physical layer version indication field, an uplink/downlink indication field, a basic service set color indication field, a transmission opportunity indication field, a bandwidth indication field, a PPDU format indication field, a space-time block coding indication field, a spatial reuse indication field, a field indicating a guard interval and extremely high throughput-long training field size, a field indicating a low-density parity-check extra symbol segment, a field indicating a pre-forward error correction padding factor, a packet extension disambiguity indication field, and a preamble puncturing indication field.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some implementations, a second EHT-SIG field of the unencoded second PPDU includes a station identifier indication field, where a field type of a field that follows the second indication subfield and that is of the first EHT-SIG field is the same as a field type of a field that follows the station identifier indication field and that is of the second EHT-SIG field. In this way, when the station receives the first U-SIG field in the SU scenario and receives the second U-SIG field in the MU scenario, a same policy is used for receiving information bits that follow the station identifier indication fields. This helps reduce a difference between reception policies for receiving a U-SIG field by the station in different scenarios, and helps the station receive and demodulate a PPDU.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some implementations, the field type of the field that follows the second indication subfield and that is of the first EHT-SIG field and the field type of the field that follows the station identifier indication field and that is of the second EHT-SIG field include one or more of the following: a field indicating a number of space-time streams, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler, a beamforming indication field, a beam change indication field, a field indicating a modulation and coding scheme and whether dual carrier modulation is used, and a coding indication field.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some implementations, the start information bit of the first indication subfield is the N<sup>th </sup>information bit of the first U-SIG field, and a field type of a field that follows an N<sup>th </sup>information bit and that is of the second U-SIG field and a field type of a field that is before the station identifier indication field and that is of the second EHT-SIG field include one or more of the following: a field indicating a number of EHT-SIG field symbols or a number of multi-user multiple-input multiple-output users, a field indicating an EHT-SIG field modulation and coding scheme and whether dual carrier modulation is used, a field indicating a number of extremely high throughput-long training field EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler, a resource unit allocation indication field, a preamble puncturing indication field, and a center 26-tone resource unit (Center 26-tone Resource Allocation, Center 26-tone RU) indication field.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some implementations, the field indicating a number of EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler is a first string, where a first string group including the first string indicates that Doppler does not exist, the first string indicates the number of EHT-LTF symbols, and each string in the first string group corresponds to one number of EHT-LTF symbols; the field indicating a number of EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler is a second string, where a second string group including the second string indicates that Doppler exists and that the midamble periodicity is a first periodicity, the second string indicates the number of EHT-LTF symbols, and each string in the second string group corresponds to one number of EHT-LTF symbols; or the field indicating a number of EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler is a third string, where a third string group including the third string indicates that Doppler exists and that the midamble periodicity is a second periodicity, the third string indicates the number of EHT-LTF symbols, and each string in the third string group corresponds to one number of EHT-LTF symbols.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this way, information bits are saved in the foregoing manner, so that the first EHT-SIG field and the second EHT-SIG field can carry more information.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to a second aspect, an implementation of this application provides a data transmission method. The method includes: A network device generates a PPDU, and the network device sends the PPDU to a station. The PPDU includes an EHT-SIG field, and the EHT-SIG field includes a field indicating a number of EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler. The field indicating a number of EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler is a first string, where a first string group including the first string indicates that Doppler does not exist, the first string indicates the number of EHT-LTF symbols, and each string in the first string group corresponds to one number of EHT-LTF symbols; the field indicating a number of EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler is a second string, where a second string group including the second string indicates that Doppler exists and that the midamble periodicity is a first periodicity, the second string indicates the number of EHT-LTF symbols, and each string in the second string group corresponds to one number of EHT-LTF symbols; or the field indicating a number of EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler is a third string, where a third string group including the third string indicates that Doppler exists and that the midamble periodicity is a second periodicity, the third string indicates the number of EHT-LTF symbols, and each string in the third string group corresponds to one number of EHT-LTF symbols. In this case, a string group including a string is used to indicate Doppler and a midamble periodicity, and a value of the string indicates a number of EHT-LTF symbols. This can save information bits for indicating Doppler and the midamble periodicity.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to a third aspect, an implementation of this application provides a data transmission method. The method includes: A network device generates a PPDU, and the network device sends the PPDU to a station. A bandwidth for sending the PPDU is greater than 20 MHz, and the bandwidth includes a first sub-bandwidth and a second sub-bandwidth. The first sub-bandwidth carries a first content channel of an EHT-SIG field of the PPDU, and the second sub-bandwidth carries a second content channel of the EHT-SIG field. An i<sup>th </sup>information bit to a j<sup>th </sup>information bit of the first content channel carry a user field, and a field of first (i&#x2212;1) information bits of the first content channel is the same as a field of first (i&#x2212;1) information bits of the second content channel; or an i<sup>th </sup>information bit to a j<sup>th </sup>information bit of the first content channel carry a resource unit allocation indication field and a user field, and a field of first (i&#x2212;1) information bits of the first content channel is the same as a field of first (i&#x2212;1) information bits of the second content channel. Both i and j are positive integers, and i&#x3c;j. The field of the first (i&#x2212;1) information bits of the first content channel and the field of the first (i&#x2212;1) information bits of the second content channel may be understood as U-SIG overflow fields. In this case, the U-SIG overflow fields are duplicated and transmitted on the first content channel and the second content channel, so that a correct reception probability of the station can be increased.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to a fourth aspect, an implementation of this application provides a data transmission method. The method includes: A network device generates a PPDU, and the network device sends the PPDU to a station. A bandwidth for sending the PPDU is greater than 20 MHz, and the bandwidth includes a first sub-bandwidth and a second sub-bandwidth. The first sub-bandwidth carries a first content channel of an EHT-SIG field of the PPDU, and the second sub-bandwidth carries a second content channel of the EHT-SIG field. An i<sup>th </sup>information bit to a j<sup>th </sup>information bit of the first content channel carry a user field, and an i<sup>th </sup>information bit to a j<sup>th </sup>information bit of the second content channel carry a padding field, where both i and j are positive integers, and i&#x3c;j. In this way, a length of the first content channel is the same as a length of the second content channel. This helps the station receive the first content channel and the second content channel. In addition, the station may not read this padding field, so that a reading process of the station can be simplified.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to a fifth aspect, an implementation of this application provides a data transmission method. The method includes: A network device generates a PPDU, and the network device sends the PPDU to a station. A bandwidth for sending the PPDU is greater than 20 MHz, and the bandwidth includes a first sub-bandwidth and a second sub-bandwidth. The first sub-bandwidth carries a first content channel of an EHT-SIG field of the PPDU, and the second sub-bandwidth carries a second content channel of the EHT-SIG field. The first content channel includes a first sub user field, the second content channel includes a second sub user field, and a user field of a first user includes the first sub user field and the second sub user field. That is, in this implementation, a part of the user field of the same user is transmitted on the first content channel, and the other part is transmitted on the second content channel.

A user field of the first content channel is the same as a user field of the second content channel. In this case, the user fields are duplicated and transmitted on the first content channel and the second content channel, so that a correct reception probability of the station can be increased, and reliability can be improved.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to a seventh aspect, an implementation of this application provides a data transmission method.

This reduces indication overheads. In addition, the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field can carry more information without increasing indication overheads, so that the station can obtain more information from the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Specifically, in a possible implementation, at least one of the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field includes an identifier indication field. The identifier indication field is an association identifier (AID) for uniquely identifying one station in the basic service set including the network device. In this way, an identifier indication field included in the encoded first PPDU can uniquely indicate one STA. The STA may learn, from the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field, whether the encoded first PPDU is sent to the STA, without continuing to receive a subsequent preamble data field. This reduces power consumption of the station. In addition, even if a data field following the first U-SIG field and a data field following the first EHT-SIG field are not correctly received, because the station can determine, based on the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field, that the first PPDU is sent to the station, the station may perform hybrid automatic repeat requests (HARQ) combined reception based on subsequent retransmission. Moreover, a third-party device can learn of a sender and a receiver of the first PPDU without causing interference to a device that is performing transmission. This helps the third-party device perform scheduling.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In another possible implementation, a field that indicates a PPDU format and that is included in the first U-SIG field or the first EHT-SIG field occupies more than 1 information bit.

The first PPDU is sent by the network device to one station when the network device performs single-user transmission, and the second PPDU is sent by the network device to a plurality of stations when the network device performs multi-user transmission. In this case, the quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field in the first PPDU sent by the network device to the station in the SU scenario is equal to the quantity of information bits of the second U-SIG field in the second PPDU sent by the network device in the MU scenario.

In this way, idle information bits in the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field are fully used, thereby avoiding a case in which the quantity of information bits in the first U-SIG field or the first EHT-SIG field is increased because a unique station identifier needs to be indicated.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some implementations, a start information bit of the first indication subfield is an Nth information bit of the first U-SIG field, and a field type of first (N&#x2212;1) information bits of the first U-SIG field is correspondingly the same as a field type of first (N&#x2212;1) information bits of the second U-SIG field, where N is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than 35. In this way, when the station receives the first U-SIG field in the SU scenario and receives the second U-SIG field in the MU scenario, a same policy is used for receiving first parts of information bits.

The field indicating a number of EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler is a first string, where a first string group including the first string indicates that Doppler does not exist, the first string indicates the number of EHT-LTF symbols, and each string in the first string group corresponds to one number of EHT-LTF symbols; the field indicating a number of EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler is a second string, where a second string group including the second string indicates that Doppler exists and that the midamble periodicity is a first periodicity, the second string indicates the number of EHT-LTF symbols, and each string in the second string group corresponds to one number of EHT-LTF symbols; or the field indicating a number of EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler is a third string, where a third string group including the third string indicates that Doppler exists and that the midamble periodicity is a second periodicity, the third string indicates the number of EHT-LTF symbols, and each string in the third string group corresponds to one number of EHT-LTF symbols.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In this case, a string group including a string is used to indicate Doppler and a midamble periodicity, and a value of the string indicates a number of EHT-LTF symbols. This can save information bits for indicating Doppler and the midamble periodicity.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">According to a fifteenth aspect, an implementation of this application further provides a network device. The network device includes: a processing unit, configured to generate a PPDU; and a transceiver unit, configured to send the PPDU to a station. A bandwidth for sending the PPDU is greater than 20 MHz, and the bandwidth includes a first sub-bandwidth and a second sub-bandwidth. The first sub-bandwidth carries a first content channel of an EHT-SIG field of the PPDU, and the second sub-bandwidth carries a second content channel of the EHT-SIG field.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">An i<sup>th </sup>information bit to a j<sup>th </sup>information bit of the first content channel carry a user field, and a field of first (i&#x2212;1) information bits of the first content channel is the same as a field of first (i&#x2212;1) information bits of the second content channel, where both i and j are positive integers, and i&#x3c;j; or an i<sup>th </sup>information bit to a j<sup>th </sup>information bit of the first content channel carry a resource unit allocation indication field and a user field, and a field of first (i&#x2212;1) information bits of the first content channel is the same as a field of first (i&#x2212;1) information bits of the second content channel, where both i and j are positive integers, and i&#x3c;j.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The field of the first (i&#x2212;1) information bits of the first content channel and the field of the first (i&#x2212;1) information bits of the second content channel may be understood as U-SIG overflow fields. In this case, the U-SIG overflow fields are duplicated and transmitted on the first content channel and the second content channel, so that a correct reception probability of the station can be increased.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">According to a sixteenth aspect, an implementation of this application further provides a network device. The network device includes: a processing unit, configured to generate a PPDU; and a transceiver unit, configured to send the PPDU to a station. A bandwidth for sending the PPDU is greater than 20 MHz, and the bandwidth includes a first sub-bandwidth and a second sub-bandwidth. The first sub-bandwidth carries a first content channel of an EHT-SIG field of the PPDU, and the second sub-bandwidth carries a second content channel of the EHT-SIG field.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">An i<sup>th </sup>information bit to a j<sup>th </sup>information bit of the first content channel carry a user field, and an i<sup>th </sup>information bit to a j<sup>th </sup>information bit of the second content channel carry a padding field, where both i and j are positive integers, and i&#x3c;j.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In this way, a length of the first content channel is the same as a length of the second content channel. This helps the station receive the first content channel and the second content channel. In addition, the station may not read this padding field, so that a reading process of the station can be simplified.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">According to a seventeenth aspect, an implementation of this application further provides a network device. The network device includes: a processing unit, configured to generate a PPDU; and a transceiver unit, configured to send the PPDU to a station. A bandwidth for sending the PPDU is greater than 20 MHz, and the bandwidth includes a first sub-bandwidth and a second sub-bandwidth. The first sub-bandwidth carries a first content channel of an EHT-SIG field of the PPDU, and the second sub-bandwidth carries a second content channel of the EHT-SIG field.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The first content channel includes a first sub user field, the second content channel includes the second sub user field, and a user field of a first user includes the first sub user field and the second sub user field.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">That is, in this implementation, a part of the user field of the same user is transmitted on the first content channel, and the other part is transmitted on the second content channel. In this way, a quantity of information bits for transmitting the user field can be increased, so that more information can be transmitted.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">According to an eighteenth aspect, an implementation of this application further provides a network device. The network device includes: a processing unit, configured to generate a PPDU; and a transceiver unit, configured to send the PPDU to a station. A bandwidth for sending the PPDU is greater than 20 MHz, and the bandwidth includes a first sub-bandwidth and a second sub-bandwidth. The first sub-bandwidth carries a first content channel of an EHT-SIG field of the PPDU, and the second sub-bandwidth carries a second content channel of the EHT-SIG field. A user field of the first content channel is the same as a user field of the second content channel.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In this case, the user fields are duplicated and transmitted on the first content channel and the second content channel, so that a correct reception probability of the station can be increased, and reliability can be improved.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">According to a nineteenth aspect, an implementation of this application further provides a station. The station includes: a transceiver unit, configured to receive a first PPDU sent by a network device; and a processing unit, configured to decode the first PPDU to obtain a decoded first PPDU. The decoded first PPDU includes a first U-SIG field and a first EHT-SIG field, and a sum of a quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field and a quantity of information bits of the first EHT-SIG field is less than or equal to 78 information bits. The first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field meet at least one of the following:</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">At least one of the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field includes an identifier indication field, where the identifier indication field is used to uniquely identify one station, for example, the identifier indication field is used to uniquely identify one station in a basic service set (BSS) including the network device; the first U-SIG field or the first EHT-SIG field includes a PPDU format indication field, and the PPDU format indication field occupies more than 1 information bit; or the first demodulation indication field includes a spatial reuse indication field.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In this way, the technical solution of this implementation of this application can ensure that the sum of the quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field and the quantity of information bits of the first EHT-SIG field is less than or equal to 78 information bits. This reduces indication overheads. In addition, the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field can carry more information without increasing indication overheads, so that the station can obtain more information from the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Specifically, in a possible implementation, at least one of the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field includes an identifier indication field. The identifier indication field is an association identifier (AID) for uniquely identifying one station. In this way, an identifier indication field included in the encoded first PPDU can uniquely indicate one STA. The STA may learn, from the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field, whether the encoded first PPDU is sent to the STA, without continuing to receive a subsequent preamble data field. This reduces power consumption of the station. In addition, even if a data field following the first U-SIG field and a data field following the first EHT-SIG field are not correctly received, because the station can determine, based on the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field, that the first PPDU is sent to the station, the station may perform hybrid automatic repeat requests (HARQ) combined reception based on subsequent retransmission. Moreover, a third-party device can learn of a sender and a receiver of the first PPDU without causing interference to a device that is performing transmission. This helps the third-party device perform scheduling.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In another possible implementation, a field that indicates a PPDU format and that is included in the first U-SIG field or the first EHT-SIG field occupies more than 1 information bit. In this case, compared with a solution in which only one information bit is occupied for indicating the PPDU format, in this implementation of this application, the PPDU format indication field occupies more than 1 information bit. In this way, the PPDU format indication field can carry more information, so that more functions can be supported.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The PPDU format indication field may indicate the PPDU format and indicate that a transmission mode is SU or MU transmission. In this way, when receiving a U-SIG field of first (N&#x2212;1) information bits, the station can determine whether SU transmission or MU transmission is performed, and use a corresponding reception policy.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">For example, the PPDU format indication field may further include information indicating that a transmission scenario is SU, MU non-orthogonal frequency division multiple access (MU non-orthogonal frequency division multiple, MU non-OFDMA), or MU OFDMA; may further include information indicating a trigger based (TB) frame; and may further include information indicating whether to perform puncturing.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In still another possible implementation, the first U-SIG field or the first EHT-SIG field includes a spatial reuse indication field. This can support a spatial reuse function.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Optionally, a length of the spatial reuse indication field is 2 information bits. The spatial reuse indication field may indicate any one of the following four items: an item for prohibiting parameterized spatial reuse (Parameterized Spatial reuse DISALLOW, PSR_DISALLOW), an item for prohibiting spatial reuse transmission (SR_RESTRICTED), an item for delaying spatial reuse transmission (SR_DELAY), and an item for prohibiting both PSR based spatial reuse and non-SR group (Group) overlapping basic service set (OBSS)-packet detection based spatial reuse. The spatial reuse indication field is used by the station to implement a corresponding spatial reuse function.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In some implementations, a length of a second U-SIG field in the decoded second PPDU is equal to a quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field, and both the quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field and the quantity of information bits of the second U-SIG field are less than or equal to 52 information bits. The first PPDU is sent by the network device to one station when the network device performs single-user transmission, and the second PPDU is sent by the network device to a plurality of stations when the network device performs multi-user transmission. In this case, the quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field in the first PPDU sent by the network device to the station in the SU scenario is equal to the quantity of information bits of the second U-SIG field in the second PPDU sent by the network device in the MU scenario. This can help reduce a difference between a reception policy for receiving the first U-SIG field by the station in the SU scenario and a reception policy for receiving the second U-SIG field by the station in the MU scenario, and help the station receive a U-SIG field in different scenarios.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In some implementations, the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field include an identifier indication field. The identifier indication field includes a first indication subfield and a second indication subfield. The first U-SIG field includes the first indication subfield, and the first EHT-SIG field includes the second indication subfield. In this way, idle information bits in the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field are fully used, thereby avoiding a case in which the quantity of information bits in the first U-SIG field or the first EHT-SIG field is increased because a unique station identifier needs to be indicated.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In some implementations, a start information bit of the first indication subfield is an N<sup>th </sup>information bit of the first U-SIG field, and a field type of first (N&#x2212;1) information bits of the first U-SIG field is correspondingly the same as a field type of first (N&#x2212;1) information bits of the second U-SIG field, where N is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than <sub>35</sub>. In this way, when the station receives the first U-SIG field in the SU scenario and receives the second U-SIG field in the MU scenario, a same policy is used for receiving first parts of information bits. This helps reduce a difference between reception policies for receiving a U-SIG field by the station in different scenarios, and helps the station receive and demodulate a PPDU.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In some implementations, the field type of the first (N&#x2212;1) information bits of the first U-SIG field and the field type of the first (N&#x2212;1) information bits of the second U-SIG field include one or more of the following: a physical layer version indication field, an uplink/downlink indication field, a basic service set color indication field, a transmission opportunity indication field, a bandwidth indication field, a PPDU format indication field, a space-time block coding indication field, a spatial reuse indication field, a field indicating a guard interval and extremely high throughput-long training field size, a field indicating a low-density parity-check extra symbol segment, a field indicating a pre-forward error correction padding factor, a packet extension disambiguity indication field, and a preamble puncturing indication field.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In some implementations, a second EHT-SIG field of the unencoded second PPDU includes a station identifier indication field, where a field type of a field that follows the second indication subfield and that is of the first EHT-SIG field is the same as a field type of a field that follows the station identifier indication field and that is of the second EHT-SIG field. In this way, when the station receives the first U-SIG field in the SU scenario and receives the second U-SIG field in the MU scenario, a same policy is used for receiving information bits that follow the station identifier indication fields. This helps reduce a difference between reception policies for receiving a U-SIG field by the station in different scenarios, and helps the station receive and demodulate a PPDU.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In some implementations, the field type of the field that follows the second indication subfield and that is of the first EHT-SIG field and the field type of the field that follows the station identifier indication field and that is of the second EHT-SIG field include one or more of the following: a field indicating a number of space-time streams, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler, a beamforming indication field, a beam change indication field, a field indicating a modulation and coding scheme and whether dual carrier modulation is used, and a coding indication field.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In some implementations, the start information bit of the first indication subfield is the N<sup>th </sup>information bit of the first U-SIG field, and a field type of a field that follows an N<sup>th </sup>information bit and that is of the second U-SIG field and a field type of a field that is before the station identifier indication field and that is of the second EHT-SIG field include one or more of the following: a field indicating a number of EHT-SIG field symbols or a number of multi-user multiple-input multiple-output users, a field indicating an EHT-SIG field modulation and coding scheme and whether dual carrier modulation is used, a field indicating a number of extremely high throughput-long training field EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler, a resource unit allocation indication field, a preamble puncturing indication field, and a center 26-tone resource unit (Center 26-tone Resource Allocation, Center 26-tone RU) indication field.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some implementations, the field indicating a number of EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler is a first string, where a first string group including the first string indicates that Doppler does not exist, the first string indicates the number of EHT-LTF symbols, and each string in the first string group corresponds to one number of EHT-LTF symbols; the field indicating a number of EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler is a second string, where a second string group including the second string indicates that Doppler exists and that the midamble periodicity is a first periodicity, the second string indicates the number of EHT-LTF symbols, and each string in the second string group corresponds to one number of EHT-LTF symbols; or the field indicating a number of EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler is a third string, where a third string group including the third string indicates that Doppler exists and that the midamble periodicity is a second periodicity, the third string indicates the number of EHT-LTF symbols, and each string in the third string group corresponds to one number of EHT-LTF symbols.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In this way, information bits are saved in the foregoing manner, so that the first EHT-SIG field and the second EHT-SIG field can carry more information, and the station obtains more information.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">According to a twentieth aspect, an implementation of this application further provides a station, including a processing unit and a transceiver unit.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The transceiver unit is configured to receive a PPDU sent by a network device.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The PPDU includes an EHT-SIG field, and the EHT-SIG field includes a field indicating a number of EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler. The field indicating a number of EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler is a first string, where a first string group including the first string indicates that Doppler does not exist, the first string indicates the number of EHT-LTF symbols, and each string in the first string group corresponds to one number of EHT-LTF symbols; the field indicating a number of EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler is a second string, where a second string group including the second string indicates that Doppler exists and that the midamble periodicity is a first periodicity, the second string indicates the number of EHT-LTF symbols, and each string in the second string group corresponds to one number of EHT-LTF symbols; or the field indicating a number of EHT-LTF symbols, a midamble periodicity, and Doppler is a third string, where a third string group including the third string indicates that Doppler exists and that the midamble periodicity is a second periodicity, the third string indicates the number of EHT-LTF symbols, and each string in the third string group corresponds to one number of EHT-LTF symbols.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In this way, the station determines Doppler and a midamble periodicity based on a string group including a string, and indicates a number of EHT-LTF symbols based on a value of the string.

Similarly, fields included in the EHT-SIG field and a quantity of information bits of each field in the SU transmission scenario are the same as those in the MU transmission scenario.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0178">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of a data transmission method according to an embodiment of this application. The data transmission method includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0179">S<b>301</b>: A network device generates a first PPDU.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0180">The first PPDU includes a first universal-Signaling field U-SIG field and a first extremely high throughput-Signaling field EHT-SIG field, and a sum of a quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field and a quantity of information bits of the first EHT-SIG field is less than or equal to 78 information bits.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0181">S<b>302</b>: The network device sends an encoded first PPDU to a STA.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0182">It may be understood that, in step S<b>301</b>, the PPDU generated by the network device is an unencoded PPDU. The first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field are not encoded, either. A quantity of information bits is a quantity of unencoded bits. The sum of the quantity of bits of the unencoded first U-SIG field and the quantity of information bits of the first EHT-SIG field is less than or equal to 78 information bits. After generating the first PPDU, the network device may encode the first PPDU, and then send the encoded first PPDU to the STA.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0183">After the first PPDU is encoded, a quantity of bits occupied by each field in the first PPDU changes. For example, encoding is performed by using an MCS 0, and the MCS 0 is binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation with a coding rate of &#xbd;.In this case, a sum of quantities of bits of the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field in the encoded first PPDU is 156 bits, that is, a total of three orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols. When another modulation scheme and another coding rate are used, the 156 bits may also be described as an equivalent symbol quantity.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0184">S<b>303</b>: The STA decodes the first PPDU to obtain a decoded first PPDU, where the decoded first PPDU includes a first U-SIG field and a first EHT-SIG field.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0185">The first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field meet at least one of the following: At least one of the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field includes an identifier indication field, where the identifier indication field is used to uniquely identify one STA; a field that indicates a PPDU format and that is included in the first U-SIG field or the first EHT-SIG field occupies more than 1 information bit; or the first U-SIG field or the first EHT-SIG field includes a spatial reuse indication field.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0186">In the conventional technical solution corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, fields included in a U-SIG field and a quantity of information bits of each field in the SU transmission are the same as those in the MU transmission scenario, and some fields required during MU transmission are not required in the SU scenario. Consequently, an overhead waste is caused and transmission resources cannot be fully used. In this way, compared with the conventional technical solution, the technical solution of this embodiment of this application can ensure that the sum of the quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field and the quantity of information bits of the first EHT-SIG field is less than or equal to 78 information bits. This can reduce indication overheads. In addition, the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field can carry more information without increasing indication overheads.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0187">Specifically, in an example, at least one of the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field includes an identifier indication field. The identifier indication field is used to uniquely identify one STA. Specifically, the identifier indication field is specifically an association identifier (AID), and the AID may uniquely identify or indicate one station. The station is a station in a basic service set (BSS) including the network device. In this way, the encoded first PPDU includes an identifier indication field used to indicate a unique STA. The STA may learn, from the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field, whether the encoded first PPDU is sent to the STA, without continuing to receive a subsequent preamble data field. This reduces power consumption of the STA. In addition, even if a data field following the first U-SIG field and a data field following the first EHT-SIG field are not correctly received, because the STA can determine, based on the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field, that the first PPDU is sent to the STA, the STA may perform HARQ combined reception based on subsequent retransmission. Moreover, a third-party device can learn of a sender and a receiver of the first PPDU without causing interference to a device that is performing transmission. This helps the third-party device perform scheduling.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0188">Specifically, that at least one of the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field includes an identifier indication field may be understood as: The first U-SIG field includes the identifier indication field; the first EHT-SIG field includes the identifier indication field; or the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field include the identifier indication field, where the first U-SIG field includes a part of the identifier indication field, and the first EHT-SIG field includes another part of the identifier indication field.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0189">The identifier indication field may indicate a unique STA. For example, when the network device sends the first PPDU to one STA in an SU transmission scenario, the identifier indication field can uniquely indicate the one STA.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0190">Specifically, the identifier indication field has 11 information bits. In this way, the information bits in the identifier indication field can meet a requirement on an information bit for uniquely identifying one STA.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0191">In another example, a field that indicates a PPDU format and that is included in the first U-SIG field or the first EHT-SIG field occupies more than 1 information bit. In this case, compared with a solution in which only one information bit is occupied for indicating the PPDU format, in this embodiment of this application, the PPDU format indication field occupies more than 1 information bit. In this way, the PPDU format indication field can carry more information, so that more functions can be supported.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0192">For example, the PPDU format indication field may further include information indicating that a transmission scenario is SU, MU non-orthogonal frequency division multiple access (MU non-orthogonal frequency division multiple, MU non-OFDMA), or MU OFDMA; may further include information indicating a trigger based (TB) frame; and may further include information indicating whether to perform puncturing.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0193">Further, the PPDU format indication field may indicate a PPDU format and indicate that a transmission mode is SU or MU transmission. In this way, when receiving the U-SIG field of the first (N&#x2212;1) information bits, the STA can determine whether SU transmission or MU transmission is performed, and use a corresponding reception policy.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0194">In still another example, the first U-SIG field or the first EHT-SIG field includes a spatial reuse indication field. This can support a spatial reuse function.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0195">Specifically, the spatial reuse indication field may indicate any one of the following four items: an item for prohibiting parameterized spatial reuse (parameterized Spatial reuse disallow, PSR_DISALLOW), an item for prohibiting spatial reuse transmission (SR_RESTRICTED), an item for delaying spatial reuse transmission (SR_DELAY), and an item for prohibiting both PSR based spatial reuse and non-SR group (group) overlapping basic service set (OBSS)-packet detection based spatial reuse.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0196">Optionally, the first EHT-SIG field may be encoded by using a coding scheme agreed on by the network device and the STA. For example, a used modulation and coding scheme (MCS) is an MSC 0, and dual carrier modulation (DCM) is not used. In this way, the first U-SIG field does not include an MCS and DCM indication field of an EHT-SIG field, so that information bits can be saved, and the saved information bits are used to carry other important information. The agreed coding scheme may be, for example, a coding scheme specified in a protocol.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0197">In some embodiments, a length of a second U-SIG field of an unencoded second PPDU is equal to the quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field, and both the quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field and the quantity of information bits of the second U-SIG field are less than or equal to 52 information bits. The first PPDU is sent by the network device to the STA when the network device performs single-user transmission, and the second PPDU is sent by the network device to a plurality of STAs when the network device performs multi-user transmission.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0198">It can be learned that the quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field in the first PPDU sent by the network device to the STA in the SU scenario is equal to the quantity of information bits of the second U-SIG field in the second PPDU sent by the network device in the MU scenario. This can help reduce a difference between a reception policy for receiving the first U-SIG field by the STA in the SU scenario and a reception policy for receiving the second U-SIG field by the STA in the MU scenario, and help the STA receive a U-SIG field in different scenarios.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0199">In addition, in this embodiment of this application, both the quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field and the quantity of information bits of the second U-SIG field are less than or equal to 52 information bits. One OFDM symbol includes 52 information bits. A smaller quantity of information bits of the first U-SIG field and the second U-SIG field indicates a smaller quantity of information bits of the encoded first U-SIG field and the encoded second U-SIG field. In this case, in the encoded first PPDU, OFDM symbols occupied by the U-SIG fields are also reduced, so that a wireless transmission resource can be saved.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0200">In some embodiments, the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field include an identifier indication field. The identifier indication field includes a first indication subfield and a second indication subfield. The first U-SIG field includes the first indication subfield, and the first EHT-SIG field includes the second indication subfield. In this case, the identifier indication field is divided into two parts. The first U-SIG field includes one part, and the first EHT-SIG field includes the other part. In this way, idle bits in the first U-SIG field and the first EHT-SIG field are fully used, thereby avoiding a case in which the quantity of information bits in the first U-SIG field or the first EHT-SIG field is increased because a unique STA needs to be indicated.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0201">In some optional embodiments, a start information bit of the first indication subfield is an Nth information bit of the first U-SIG field, and a field type of first (N&#x2212;1) information bits of the first U-SIG field is correspondingly the same as a field type of first (N&#x2212;1) information bits of the second U-SIG field, where N is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than 35. In other words, a field type of a field that is before the first indication subfield and that is of the first U-SIG field is the same as a field type of first (N&#x2212;1) information bits at a corresponding location of the second U-SIG field. In this way, when the STA receives the first U-SIG field in the SU scenario and receives the second U-SIG field in the MU scenario, a same policy is used for receiving first parts of information bits. This helps reduce a difference between reception policies for receiving a U-SIG field by the STA in different scenarios, and helps the STA receive a PPDU.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0202">In some other optional embodiments, a second EHT-SIG field of the unencoded second PPDU includes an AID indication field, where a field type of a field that follows the second indication subfield and that is of the first EHT-SIG field is the same as a field type of a field that follows the AID indication field and that is of the second EHT-SIG field. In this way, when the STA receives the first U-SIG field in the SU scenario and receives the second U-SIG field in the MU scenario, a same policy is used for receiving information bits of the field that follows the second indication subfield and information bits that follow the AID indication field. This helps reduce a difference between reception policies for receiving a U-SIG field by the STA in different scenarios, and helps the STA receive the PPDU.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0203">It should be noted that the foregoing two optional embodiments may be combined. For example, a start information bit of the first indication subfield is an N<sup>th </sup>information bit of the first U-SIG field, and a field type of first (N&#x2212;1) information bits of the first U-SIG field is correspondingly the same as a field type of first (N&#x2212;1) information bits of the second U-SIG field, where N is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than 35. A second EHT-SIG field of the unencoded second PPDU includes a STA indication field. A field type of a field that follows the second indication subfield and that is of the first EHT-SIG field is the same as a field type of a field that follows the STA indication field and that is of the second EHT-SIG field. In this way, when the STA receives the first U-SIG field in the SU scenario and receives the second U-SIG field in the MU scenario, a same policy is used for receiving information bits of the field that follows the second indication subfield and information bits that follow the STA indication field. This helps reduce a difference between reception policies for receiving a U-SIG field by the STA in different scenarios, and helps the STA receive a PPDU. The STA indication field may be, for example, an AID used to uniquely identify one STA.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0204">In this embodiment of this application, both the first PPDU and the second PPDU that are sent by the network device are an encoded PPDU. Each of the first U-SIG field, the second U-SIG field, the first EHT-SIG field, and the second EHT-SIG field mentioned in this embodiment of this application is a field of an unencoded PPDU.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0205">Specifically, the field type of the first (N&#x2212;1) information bits of the first U-SIG field and the field type of the first (N&#x2212;1) information bits of the second U-SIG field include one or more of the following: a physical layer version (version identifier) indication field, an uplink/downlink (UL/DL) indication field, a basic service set color indication field (basic service set color, BSS color) indication field, a transmission opportunity (TXOP) indication field, a bandwidth indication field, a PPDU format indication field, a space-time block coding (space time block code, STBC) indication field, a spatial reuse indication field, a guard interval (GI) and extremely high throughput-long training field size (EHT-LTF Size) indication field, a field indicating a low-density parity-check extra symbol segment (LDPC extra symbol segment), a pre-forward error correction padding factor (Pre-FEC Padding Factor) indication field, a packet extension disambiguity (PE disambiguity) indication field, or a preamble puncturing (preamble puncture) indication field.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0206">Specifically, the UL/DL indication field indicates UL or DL.
