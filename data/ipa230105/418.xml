The coordinated use of multiple medical systems, e.g., each of which having their own display monitors and user input methods, presents obstacles to efficient use.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some use cases, the operating physician must maintain a sterile field, and during critical periods of a procedure must maintain one or both hands on medical instruments, e.g., catheters, guidewires, etc. The requirement of sterility may limit the number and type of medical information systems with which the operating physician can interact. The sterility requirement may also limit the interactivity of the medical information systems by requiring sterile bagging procedures that restrict interaction. The requirement of maintaining one or both hands on medical instruments during critical periods of the procedure may preclude the ability for personnel to use conventional medical information system interfaces, e.g., keyboard, mouse, joystick, physical buttons, etc. Electrogram information is often displayed and measured on multiple medical systems, with each system using a different mode of input and output. EGM, data includes one or more of time-sampled voltage data, sampling rate, displayed sample rate, assigned color, and sample identifier from electrodes on the body surface or within the heart. Conventional systems present data on display monitors within the procedure and control room. View of the monitor is often hindered due to necessity of physician moving about the room.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In various embodiments, a method includes providing, for display by a head-mounted display (HMD) worn by a user, a holographic rendering of intracardiac geometry including position of a catheter.

A head-mounted display (HMD) device provides a means for a physician to view and/or interact with EGM information (for example, which would be displayed on 2-dimensional (2D) monitor displays in a conventional system) in a mixed reality or augmented reality environment. In some embodiments, the head-mounted display provides EGM information as being overlaid on a monitor for display to a user or provides EGM information in conjunction with a display on one or more other devices. In other embodiments, the head-mounted display may also provide the EGM information, avoiding the need for monitor displays. The head-mounted display can display graphics such as 3D holographic renderings or other information such as data from sensors or instruments (e.g., catheter).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, an EGM processing system <b>100</b> includes one or more HMDs and/or 2D monitor displays, and one or more sources of electrogram data. An HMD may be an augmented reality device, or another type of device, such as virtual reality, mixed reality, or other immersive reality devices. An example HMD is the MICROSOFT HOLOLENS or a modified version of this, for example, equipped with additional sensors or hardware. In other embodiments, the HMD may be a completely custom-designed HMD.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A HMD or computer device may include one or more of: a position/orientation locator for locating its position and orientation in physical space (e.g., 2D or 3D), a wireless interface to communicate information between the devices, one or more processors for processing user input and data, storage for capturing data, a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions to execute embodiments of methods described herein, a display, a microphone for capturing audio (e.g., from a user) and detecting spoken commands, a camera for capturing image data, sensors for eye-tracking and/or gaze-tracking, and sensors for detecting hand and/or finger position and pose.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">EGM data is displayed by one or more of HMD displays and 2D monitor displays. Display data includes one or more of captured EGM data, user annotations, calculated measurements, and feedback of automatic processing. In one aspect, the EGM 2D monitor display is directly annotated with additional information for display on a conventional 2D monitor display. In another aspect, the EGM 2D monitor display is annotated with additional information in an overlay by the HMD. In another aspect, some or all EGM data and additional information is displayed within the HMD (e.g., without a monitor display).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In various embodiments, user input is achieved through one or more of voice input, gaze input, hand position, hand pose, or automated processing techniques. In one aspect, the user interacts with the system using commands from a predefined vocabulary of commands. In another aspect, the system uses natural language processing (NLP) to interpret general commands from spoken phrases, e.g., &#x201c;move left 10 milliseconds.&#x201d; In another aspect, gaze input based on head position and orientation and/or eye position and orientation is used to manipulate cursors on a display.

In another aspect, audio cues provide interpretation of how early a second signal is occurring relative to a reference. Signal processing techniques may also automatically position or assist in positioning of cursors on a display. In another aspect, any number of input techniques may be used in combination to interact with the system, e.g., voice command and gaze direction. These input techniques may be used to generate cursor positions, measurements between cursor positions in pixels, voltage and/or time, and annotations for storage by the system.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">I. Example System Environment Including Monitor Display</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an illustration of an EGM processing system <b>100</b> including a physical EGM monitor according to one embodiment. In some embodiments, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> can be used for sterile electrogram annotation using existing electrogram monitors, e.g., in a room equipped for surgical procedures. In some embodiments, the EGM recording system <b>68</b> produces waveform tracings of electrograms and provides the waveforms to one or more monitors <b>61</b> for display. An example of an EGM recording system <b>68</b> is the GENERAL ELECTRIC CardioLab Electrophysiology Recording system. The EGM processing system <b>100</b> can enable hands-free annotation and employs a HMD <b>67</b> with any number of the following characteristics: one or more onboard sensors (e.g., camera or distance sensor, among others) for acquisition of range and image data; ability to produce 3D overlay graphics (e.g., holographic renderings) superimposed on the real world; gaze, eye, and hand tracking capabilities; and one or more microphones or other types of audio sensors for recording annotations provided by audio.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the HMD <b>67</b> acquires an image of a monitor <b>61</b> and inputs the acquired image to a Monitor Detect Algorithm <b>53</b> that employs computer vision techniques to process the image to detect presence of a physical monitor configured to display EGM information. Example computer vision techniques include but are not limited to Faster R-CNNs (Girshick et al., 2015), You Only Look Once (YOLO) (Redmon and Farhadi, 2015), and Single Shot Detectors (SSDs) (Liu et al., 2015). Such techniques can generate a region and probability that an object is associated with a certain class that a classifier has been trained to recognize. For example, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> determines a probability that a region includes at least a portion of an image of a monitor. For any region having a probability greater than a threshold probability <b>62</b>, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> uses a Corner Detection Algorithm <b>54</b> to determine the corners of the imaged monitor. The EGM processing system <b>100</b> fits the imaged monitor to a model of a size of the object (i.e., monitor) to estimate position in 3D space of a planar rectangle <b>60</b> of a surface of the monitor <b>61</b>. The surface may be a viewing surface of the monitor <b>61</b> that displays EGM information. The planar rectangle <b>60</b> can be offset by a predetermined distance from the surface such that the graphics displayed on the planar rectangle <b>60</b> appear to the user <b>50</b> as being superimposed on images displayed by the monitor <b>61</b> (e.g., displayed as holograms).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The EGM processing system <b>100</b> provides overlay graphics (with measurement output) <b>59</b>, <b>63</b> to the HMD <b>67</b> for display to a user <b>50</b> such that the overlay graphics <b>59</b>, <b>63</b> appear to be positioned on the planar rectangle <b>60</b>. The gaze tracking <b>57</b>, voice tracking, and/or hand tracking <b>58</b> capabilities of the HMD <b>67</b> are used to position graphics of a digital caliper <b>63</b> (e.g., two parallel line cursors that can be positioned relative to the electrograms). The user <b>50</b> may use their voice, direct their gaze, and/or move their hand <b>51</b> to signal modifications to the positions of the digital calipers <b>63</b>, which appear superimposed over the EGM waveforms.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the change in position of the digital calipers <b>63</b> when directed by voice, gaze, and/or hand control may switch between detected positions of interest as detected by algorithms on processed electrogram information. The EGM processing system <b>100</b> can determine positions of interest using at least waveform statistics including peak detection on an EGM signal or derived signals. The EGM processing system <b>100</b> can determine the positions of interest at least in part by recalling previously selected positions by the current user <b>50</b> or other users of the EGM processing system <b>100</b> through a trained machine learning model.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> uses an EGM Waveform Scale <b>64</b> to convert spacing distance between the digital calipers <b>63</b> to a measured interval value in time or voltage.

The EGM Waveform Scale <b>64</b> may also be known a-priori or be input by the user <b>50</b> in a calibration step in which the user adjusts the caliper spacing against a known interval of time or voltage. The audio recorded by the HMD <b>67</b> can be stored in digital format, or methods for speech recognition <b>65</b> may be used to transcribe a measurement annotation <b>66</b>.

In some embodiments, a system for capturing electrogram data includes one or more catheters. The electrogram data can be transmitted to an HMD or another device for processing or display.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">EGM data is integrated into the EGM processing system <b>100</b> through one or more means. In one aspect, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> can directly measure EGM signals through an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter for processing by the system. In another aspect, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> can receive and transmit EGM data from existing EGM recording systems through a predefined hardware and/or software interface, e.g., RS-232, TCP/IP, etc. In another aspect, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> can capture EGM recording system 2D monitor display output through one or more capture devices, including directly sampling the monitor signal, or imaging the monitor signal using an imaging camera. EGM waveform data, EGM cursor data and measurements, and EGM parameters may be extracted from the sensed image data. In various embodiments, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> can use existing configuration data available or established during system installation, including 2D monitor display layout and placement, electrogram application or hardware configuration, electrogram signal color configuration, placement on 2D monitor displays, and electrogram sweep configurations.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">II.

In another aspect, EGM signals <b>70</b> are transmitted via a connection to an EGM recording system that can communicate EGM signals digitally.

If the signals are acquired via frame grabber, there is an additional EGM Scale Detection <b>71</b> step to determine the time and EGM Waveform Scale <b>72</b> (e.g., voltage scale) of the electrogram; this step can be automatically performed using computer vision techniques that extract electrogram data and detect the sweep speed.

Audio Feedback</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates audio encoding of signal landmarks according to one embodiment. As shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> can generate auditory information to serve as a supplement to the raw visual information provided by the EGM signals. The EGM processing system <b>100</b> processes the EGM signal information <b>38</b> using signal processing algorithms <b>30</b> to determine a series of landmark positions on each signal. This results in a landmark timing array <b>31</b> that has columns for each signal (e.g., S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, . . . ) and rows (e.g., L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b>, L<b>3</b>, . . . ) with entries indicating the time that the particular landmark was found in the corresponding signal. It is also possible that one or more landmarks may not be identified in one or more of the signals, in which case those entries are identified as empty.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In various embodiments, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> inputs the landmark timing array <b>31</b> into algorithms (e.g., landmark sequencer <b>32</b> and/or landmark differencer <b>33</b>) to convert the landmark information into audio information. The landmark sequencer <b>32</b> converts similar landmarks into audio sequences <b>34</b> of tones that are played sequentially in time, where each tone represents a different signal. The HMD can play the audio sequences <b>34</b> using speakers or any other suitable type of audio transmitter. Thus, a user <b>37</b> may perceive auditorily the order in which similar events are occurring on multiple signals, or if a landmark entry is empty, the lack of audio for the corresponding signal.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The landmark differencer <b>33</b> converts times between successive landmarks or times between neighboring signals into frequency shift information that is played as an audio frequency shift <b>35</b> to the user <b>37</b>. Alternatively, the frequency shift information may be converted into spatial audio <b>36</b> such that the user <b>37</b> perceives auditorily that a sound is coming from a particular direction (e.g., left, right, or in front of the user) depending on the time difference.

Waveform Timescale</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a process for determining time scale of a waveform according to one embodiment. As shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, two waveforms are obtained from a video frame grabber. Electrogram recording systems can represent the electrogram waveforms as a continuously updating waveform that is traced from left to right as the waveform is acquired. When the acquired waveform reaches the right-hand side of the display, the electrogram recording system renews the waveform at the left-hand side and replaces the old waveform as the new waveform traces across.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Image <b>400</b> represents a first example image frame acquired from an electrogram recording system at time T<b>1</b>, and image <b>410</b> represents a second example image frame acquired at time T<b>2</b> after time T<b>1</b>. In some embodiments, the difference between time frames (T<b>2</b>&#x2212;T<b>1</b>) must be less than the time required to perform a complete trace. A suitable computer algorithm can scan images <b>400</b> and <b>410</b> and find the regions where the waveforms are identical (e.g., or within a threshold difference of amplitude), and the rectangular region <b>420</b>, where the waveforms are not identical (e.g., deviating at least by the threshold difference of amplitude). The width W in pixels of the region <b>420</b> represents how many pixels are swept in the time T<b>2</b>&#x2212;T<b>1</b>, yielding a sweep speed scale of W/(T<b>2</b>&#x2212;T<b>1</b>) pixels/second.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Images <b>430</b> and <b>440</b> illustrate an example case where the waveform sweep has returned to the left side in the time between frame acquisitions. In such a case, both rectangular region <b>450</b> with width W<b>1</b> and rectangular region <b>460</b> with width W<b>2</b> are identified where the waveforms differ between images <b>430</b> and <b>440</b>, and the sweep speed scale calculation becomes (W<b>1</b>+W<b>2</b>)/(T<b>2</b>&#x2212;T<b>1</b>) pixels/second.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, an electrogram recording system directly display the sweep speed in a fixed position on the video monitor.

In such a case, the sub-region <b>480</b> is compared against a set of template images, each of which corresponds to a different sweep speed setting. The EGM processing system <b>100</b> can determine a template image match as measured by image correlation and use the template image match to establish the sweep speed scale. Other optical character recognition techniques known to one skilled in the art can also be employed to decode the sweep speed information displayed within the embedded character sub-region <b>480</b>.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">V.

An electrogram <b>500</b> is displayed by the EGM processing system <b>100</b>, via either an HMD or a monitor. The HMD can display an interaction area <b>501</b> overlaid on or adjacent to the electrogram <b>500</b>.

Responsive to determining that a finger position is within the rectangular bounding region, the HMD changes the digital caliper feature appearance to indicate that the feature is activated. Once activated, the HMD displays two separately controllable caliper graphics. The left caliper graphic consists of a measurement graphic (e.g., a line) <b>504</b> and active area <b>502</b>. The right caliper graphic consists of a measurement graphic <b>505</b> and active area <b>503</b>. The measurement graphics <b>504</b> and <b>505</b> are positioned over one or more displayed waveforms along with active areas <b>502</b> and <b>503</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Responsive to determining that the distance between a tracked thumb and another tracked finger is within a threshold distance, and the midpoint position between the tracked thumb and other finger is within the active area <b>502</b> or <b>503</b>, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> updates the position of the graphic. Suitable thresholds can be established such that the user perceives that the user is virtually grabbing the digital caliper graphics for manipulation, e.g., moving the digital caliper graphics right and/or left. As the distance between the measurement graphics (e.g., lines) <b>504</b> and <b>505</b> changes, the displayed measurement <b>506</b> updates to indicate the time elapsed between the two lines as represented by the waveform <b>507</b>.

The EGM processing system <b>100</b> processes waveform <b>600</b> using a Landmark Point Identification <b>620</b> algorithm to identify likely points of interest on the waveform, that is, landmarks. The Landmark Point Identification <b>620</b> algorithm can be constructed by combining elements of one or more of thresholded peak finding, derivative calculation to find points of inflection (e.g., based on maximum derivative), piecewise linear approximation to find suitable inflection points above an error threshold, and morphological techniques to identify landmarks in signals.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">An example Landmark Point Identification <b>620</b> algorithm for an input electrogram signal <b>600</b> includes the following steps: bandpass filter to eliminate DC and frequencies above 100 Hz; determine the maximum of a first region of points above a threshold voltage as a reference point; compute derivative of signal; identify positions in the signal where derivative changes sign; scan through the signal, constructing line segments that best fit the signal within an error threshold; and add endpoints of the line segments to the set of identified positions.

The ray information is input to a processor, along with the equation of the plane and positions of the waveform landmark points on the plane. The EGM processing system <b>100</b> determines intersection of the ray with the plane on which the waveform graphics are displayed. In an embodiment, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> determines the distance between the intersection point with each landmark point and determines the landmark point associated with the minimum distance. Responsive to determining that the minimum distance is below a threshold, the HMD displays a measurement graphic <b>650</b> that identifies the landmark (e.g., a point on the signal <b>640</b>); the waveform time distance between measurement graphic <b>630</b> and measurement graphic <b>650</b> is shown in a measurement <b>620</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In various embodiments, signal processing techniques are employed to identify landmark positions on the signal. The landmarks can be used to automatically position a measurement cursor at the identified landmarks, or alternatively, as input to algorithms that generate audio from the landmark sequencing. Examples of signal processing techniques include but are not limited to: thresholded peak finding to determine the lowest or highest point in a region above/below some threshold voltage; thresholded slope finding to determine points at the center of where the slope of the signal increases above a given threshold, or where there is an inflection point; wavelet based methods such as described in Paul S Addison, <i>Wavelet transforms and the ECG: a review, </i>26 P<smallcaps>HYSIOL</smallcaps>. M<smallcaps>EAS</smallcaps>. R155-R199 (2005), which can be used to identify portions of the signals with interesting characteristics; and piece-wise linear approximations such as described in Eamonn Keogh, Selina Chu, David Hart &#x26; Michael Pazzani, <i>Segmenting Time Series: A Survey and Novel Approach, in </i>D<smallcaps>ATA </smallcaps>M<smallcaps>INING IN </smallcaps>T<smallcaps>IME </smallcaps>S<smallcaps>ERIES </smallcaps>D<smallcaps>ATABASES </smallcaps>1-21 (2003), which can be used to identify change points of interest in the signal.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">VII.

The method <b>700</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is an example user interface displayed by a head-mounted display according to one embodiment. The example user interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> includes a holographic rendering <b>510</b> and an electrogram waveform <b>520</b>, which may be displayed adjacent to each other. In various embodiments, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> provides graphics for display by the HMD at a frame rate of at least 30 frame per second; the EGM processing system <b>100</b> also achieves a latency under 50 milliseconds between EGM signal acquisition and display. This frame rate and latency helps to provide visual comfort to a user wearing the HMD and interacting with the user interface.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The EGM processing system <b>100</b> provides <b>710</b> a holographic rendering <b>510</b> for display by the HMD worn by the user. The holographic rendering <b>510</b> shows intracardiac geometry, for example, of a patient's heart during a procedure to assist an operating surgeon. The holographic rendering <b>510</b> also includes display of a catheter <b>515</b>. The HMD can update the holographic rendering <b>510</b> to reflect changes in the position or orientation of the catheter <b>515</b> (e.g., in real time). Based on user input, the HMD can also update the intracardiac geometry, for example, by rotating, translating, increasing or decreasing zoom, changing color-coding, changing transparency of certain portions, among other changes to the displayed visual.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The EGM processing system <b>100</b> provides <b>720</b> an electrogram waveform <b>520</b> for display by the HMD; the electrogram waveform <b>520</b> is displayed adjacent to the holographic rendering <b>510</b> such that both are in the field of view of the user (e.g., allowing simultaneous viewing of both parts of the user interface). The electrogram waveform <b>520</b> includes one or more signals generated using data collected by the catheter <b>515</b> or other sensors or instruments.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The EGM processing system <b>100</b> determines <b>730</b> a gaze direction of the user. The EGM processing system <b>100</b> tracks the user's head direction and eye direction using sensor data from the HMD. The EGM processing system <b>100</b> can determine that head tracking information is consistent with eye tracking information. For example, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> verifies that the user's head direction is within a threshold error from the user's eye direction. The EGM processing system <b>100</b> determines the user's gaze direction using the head direction and eye direction, e.g., by verifying one with the other to remove false positive directions or determining the average between the two directions to provide a more stable gaze direction. In other embodiments, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> determines the user's gaze direction using only one of: head direction and eye direction.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The EGM processing system <b>100</b> provides <b>740</b> a marker <b>550</b> overlaid on the electrogram waveform <b>520</b> based on the gaze direction. In various embodiments, the HMD displays the marker <b>550</b> overlaid on the electrogram waveform <b>520</b> at an intersection between the gaze direction and the electrogram waveform; for example, the intersection between a line of the gaze direction and a planar surface on which the electrogram waveform is displayed in a 3D space. As the user's gaze direction changes, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> can update the location of the displayed marker <b>550</b> (e.g., in real time). By controlling the marker <b>550</b>, the user can interact hands-free with the user interface. The EGM processing system <b>100</b> provides a technical solution, that is, hands-free interaction of the user interface via an HMD, to the previously described problem of users (e.g., physicians or surgeons) not being able to&#x2014;or having inconvenience to&#x2014;touch a physical user interface in a sterile environment for a interventional procedure. Moreover, by displaying information to the user via the HMD, the user's view of the information is not hindered due to other obstructions. The user also does not need to look at multiple monitor displays for intracardiac geometry and electrogram waveform information, as the HMD can display both adjacent to one another.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The EGM processing system <b>100</b> determines <b>750</b> a measurement of the electrogram waveform <b>520</b> using the location of the marker. For example, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> determines the measurement using a digital caliper. Responsive to determining that the marker <b>550</b> is navigated to the measure electrogram <b>540</b> graphic, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> determines that the user intends to take a measurement using the digital caliper; and the EGM processing system <b>100</b> displays a first measurement graphic <b>525</b> and a second measurement graphic <b>530</b>. Responsive to determining that the marker <b>550</b> is navigated to the control graphic <b>535</b> of the first measurement graphic <b>525</b>, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> determines that the user intends to change the position of the first measurement graphic <b>525</b>. The EGM processing system <b>100</b> updates the position of the first measurement graphic <b>525</b> by tracking the user's gaze direction, for instance, indicating a shift of the first measurement graphic <b>525</b> to the left or right along the x-axis (i.e., time) of the electrogram waveform <b>520</b>. In a similar manner, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> can update the position of the second measurement graphic <b>530</b>. The EGM processing system <b>100</b> determines the measurement of the electrogram waveform <b>520</b> based on a distance between position of the first measurement graphic <b>525</b> the position of the second measurement graphic <b>530</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> automatically adjusts position of the measurement graphics. For example, responsive to determining that a position of the first measurement graphic <b>525</b> is within a threshold distance from a position of a feature of the electrogram waveform <b>520</b>, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> updates the position of the first measurement graphic <b>525</b> to the position of the feature. In some embodiments, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> determines the feature of the electrogram waveform <b>520</b> using a model. For example, the model is trained using training data labeled by an electrophysiologist to generate candidate features of interest (e.g., landmarks) for heartbeat data or a QRS complex of a heartbeat. Features of the electrogram waveform can be a peak or inflection of the electrogram waveform. The features can be determined using independent component analysis, beat-to-beat amplitude, separate analyses of high- and low-frequency wavelet components, wavelength-based analysis, and timing intervals, among other methods. In an embodiment, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> filters noise of the electrogram waveform <b>520</b> by using independent component analysis, identifying information-rich portions of a signal (e.g., including heartbeat related landmarks), or using other types of signal processing techniques known to one skilled in the art. The The EGM processing system <b>100</b> provides <b>760</b> the measurement of the electrogram waveform <b>520</b> for display by the HMD. The measurement can be displayed adjacent to a portion of, or overlapping a portion of, the electrogram waveform <b>520</b>. The EGM processing system <b>100</b> can update the measurement responsive to change to position of a measurement graphic and thus the distance between measurement graphics.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an embodiment, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> determines a position of a first surface of an electronic display (e.g., a monitor display). The HMD provides the holographic rendering <b>510</b> and the electrogram waveform <b>520</b> displayed on a second surface offset from the first surface. As a result, the holographic rendering <b>510</b> and the electrogram waveform <b>520</b> appear as floating-in-the-air holograms from the perspective of the user wearing the HMD.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> also uses voice commands from the user. The EGM processing system <b>100</b> determines a voice command by processing an audio input from the user. Example commands include &#x201c;take a picture&#x201d; or &#x201c;move it a millisecond earlier.&#x201d; Responsive to determining that user intends to &#x201c;take a picture&#x201d; of the electrogram waveform <b>520</b>, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> captures and stores an image of the current display of the electrogram waveform <b>520</b>, the holographic rendering <b>510</b>, and/or displayed measurements (e.g., from the digital calipers) or other annotations. Responsive to determining that the user intends to &#x201c;move it a millisecond earlier,&#x201d; referring to position of a measurement graphic, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> updates the position of the measurement graphic according to the instruction. The EGM processing system <b>100</b> can use any number of natural language processing techniques to determine voice commands. In some embodiments, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> uses a database of simplified vocabulary, which are associated with a set of known commands for interacting with a user interface.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> provides audio feedback to the user. As an example, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> determines proximity between the location of the marker <b>550</b> and a target location of the electrogram waveform <b>520</b> (e.g., of a landmark). In some embodiments, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> determines the target location based on a point of activation of a heartbeat signal in the electrogram waveform <b>520</b>. The EGM processing system <b>100</b> provides audio feedback at a frequency according to the proximity. For instance, the audio feedback (e.g., a beeping sound or a tone) is provided at a higher frequency as the proximity decreases and at a lower frequency as the proximity increases. In other embodiments, the EGM processing system <b>100</b> determines proximity between the target location and position of a measurement graphic (e.g., <b>525</b> or <b>530</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) instead of the location of the marker <b>550</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purpose of illustration; it is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed.
