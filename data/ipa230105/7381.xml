More particularly, the disclosure relates to a headset, or earphones, having a detachable arm, where the arm is attached to a part of the headset or earphone via one or more magnets. Further, according to the present disclosure, such a headset may comprise a multitude of microphones, where at least one microphone is arranged in or on the arm.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A headset may be used by a person as hands-free personal communication device, e.g. during gaming or other entertainment or communication activity. Generally, such headsets for hands-free personal communication devices may be used in a variety of known work and personal environments. In general, hands-free personal communication devices are useful in any application where it is desirable to provide one-way or two-way communication that leaves the user's hands free and performs a variety of other tasks.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure provides at least an alternative to the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to an aspect, the present disclosure provides a headset comprising a headband and an earcup. A recess may be formed in or at the earcup. An arm may be arranged detachably connectable to the earcup via the recess. The arm may be a boom arm. The arm may comprise one or more input transducers. The one or more input transducers may be arranged so that when the headset is positioned on the head of a user, the one or more transducers may be arranged to pick up sound mainly from the mouth of the user.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Presently, it is preferred that a headset according to the present disclosure provides an output signal based on one or more microphones in, or connected to the headset, which output signal comprises the user's/wearer's voice. This output signal is then preferably provided to a device, e.g., a computer, mobile phone, video game console or the like. The wearer's voice may then be transmitted to a far-end receiver, e.g., another player in a game or a remote person in a telephone call, either phone-based or data-connection, such as video conferencing software and/or video conferencing hardware and/or softphone connection.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The output signal, or simply signal, representing or comprising the user's voice may be filtered and/or processed in order to provide a relatively clean speech signal. The headset may be configured to use beamforming techniques to pick up sounds or utterances from the user wearing the headset. Such a beamformer may be established using two or more microphones of the headset, e.g., two microphones in a earcup of the headset or one microphone in an earcup and one in an arm attached to the earcup, or two microphones in an arm attached to the headset or combinations thereof. The beamformer may be adaptable in the sense that the processing of sound picked up is</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A headset according to the present disclosure may include first and second earcups connected by a headband which is intended to sit across the head of the wearer. The earcup may be dismountable from the headband. The first and/or second earcup may be pivotable so that they may conform better to the individual head shape of the wearer and/or provide a tighter fit to the head of the user/wearer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The arm may be detachably connected to the earcup, e.g. so that one or more magnets in the earcup may be arranged to attract one or more metallic members in the arm. Alternatively, one or more magnets in the arm may be arranged to attract one or more metallic members in the earcup. Further alternatively, one magnet in the earcup may be arranged to attract one metallic member in the arm and one magnet in the arm may be arranged to attract one metallic member in the earcup. When more than one member is present in the arm and/or the more than one member in the earcup, is present, such members may be arranged e.g. opposite each other, next to each other, such as perpendicular to each other. Two magnets and/or metallic members may be arranged symmetrically around a protraction configured to be received in the recess of a earcup in a headset according to the present disclosure. One magnet may be arranged so as to encircle the recess in the earcup and/or one magnet may be arranged so as to encircle a protrusion on the arm configured to engage with the recess in the earcup.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">At area of the arm configured to connect to the recess, the arm may comprise electrical connections configured to engage with corresponding connections at the earcup, e.g., in the form of pads or sockets.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The recess may be arranged in a rotatable member in the earcup. This could allow the arm to be positioned in at least two positions during use, e.g. an active state or position where the arm is arranged generally so that one or more microphones are able to pick up sound from the user's mouth, and a mute state where, owing to the position of the arm, signals from at least the one or more microphones in the arm is muted so that privacy of the user is ensured. This could e.g. be a slightly angled position relative to horizontal for the first mode, and an angle of at least 45 degrees from horizontal for the second mode. This allow the user to lower the arm when wishing to speak via microphones in the arm and raise the arm when not whishing speech to be transmitted via the headset. During e.g. gaming this could be useful for situations where the user speaks with persons in the same room and do not wish this conversation to be transmitted via a game or communication software or the like.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The headset or headphones described herein may include one or more additional microphones arranged on or in an earcup. This would allow the headset to base an output signal on signals from the one or more microphones in the arm and signals from the one or more additional microphones in the earcup. The headset may have two earcups.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A wired or a wireless interface may be provided. Though such a connection, the headset may communicate a signal representing the user's voice to an external device, such as a computer or a mobile phone, and the headset may receive a signal to be reproduced via an earcup. The signal to be reproduced to the user/wearer may be a stereo signal, a mono signal or a multi-channel signal. The headset may comprise a processor with capabilities to transform a signal received from an external device from one format to another, including transforming the signal from having one set of channels to a signal having a different set of channels. This could include reducing the number of channels prior to supplying audio to the user or increasing the number of channels prior to providing audio to the user.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">When the headset comprises two earcups, e.g., a first earcup and a second earcup, and a multitude of microphones, there is the possibility that in at least the following configurations active microphone signals from the following microphones are used as a basis for the headsets output signal:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0014">one microphone could be arranged in the first earcup and no microphone in the second earcup</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0015">one microphone could be arranged in each earcup,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0016">at least two microphones could be arranged in the first earcup, and no microphones in the second earcup,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0017">at least two microphones could be arranged in the first earcup and at least one microphone could be arranged in the second earcup,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0018">one microphone in the arm and at least one microphone in the first earcup and/or the second earcup.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0015" num="0019">Similar set could be defined if the headset comprised only one earcup. The microphones mentioned above could be input transducers arranged as omni directional microphones or directional microphones. E.g., a directional input transducer could be arranged at the first earcup, while an omni directional microphone could be arranged in the arm.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0020">The headset could thus be configured to provide an output signal based on one, two or more of the above listed microphone configurations. The output signal could be provided wired or wirelessly to an external device. The external device could be a computer device, a mobile phone device, a hand-held device, such as a hand-held gaming device or other suitable device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0021">The headset according to the present disclosure, where the headset comprises at least one earcup and a headband, where the at least one earcup comprises at least one microphone, the headset being configured to engage with a detachable arm having at least one microphone, could be configured so that when the arm is attached to the headset, the headset could be configured to operate in a first mode where an output signal is based on a signal from the at least one microphone in the earcup and the at least one microphone in the arm, and when the arm is not attached, the headset could be configured to operate in a second mode were an output signal is based on the at least one microphone in the earcup alone. The headset could be configured to seamlessly switch between two such modes, pending a detection of the arm being attached or detached. Detecting that the arm is attached or not could be achieved via a contact, such as a capacitive contact configured to sense the presence of the arm, an electrical contact configured to sense signals between, such as to and/or from, the arm and the headset, a processor in the headset may be configured to determine if a signal is present on a microphone connection between the headset and the arm.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0022">In situations where the arm is not attached to the earcup, a cover plate may be attached. This could provide a protection against dust and/or debris, which could hinder connection force and/or reduce electrical connection stability. The cover plate may be attached via one or more magnets in or on the cover plate or as mechanical interface that temporarily attach the cover plate to the earcup/headset. A mechanical interface could be a protrusion configured to fit into a recess of the earcup, e.g., where the arm is configured to attach to the earcup.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0023">A range of mechanic stops may be provided in a rotation arrangement in an earcup of a headset. This could provide a differentiation between functions in the headset. One stop could be around &#x2212;40 degree relative to horizontal, in which position the arm would provide a microphone signal to a processor in the headset.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0024">A headset may comprise an active noise cancellation or reduction function, where a signal from a microphone provides an input to a filter configured to provide a signal that (at least substantially) cancel noise at/in the earcup.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0025">An earcup of a headset may comprise an opening adjacent to an annular cushion, where the cushion is configured to provide a comfortable interface with the skin of the wearer during use of the headset.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0026">The headset may comprise a touch interface, e.g. at an earcup not being configured to receiving a detachable arm. Such a touch interface could comprise a capacitive interface, an accelerometer, or comprise other suitable sensor to detect input of a user.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0027">The headset may comprise an antenna for providing wireless communication between the headset and an external device, such as a phone, computer, tablet computer or the like. The antenna may be formed in an earcup, the headband, both in an earcup and in the headband, partly in the detachable arm and/or in two earcups. The antenna may be configured to operate in the range of 2 to 6 GHz, such as at 2.4 GHz, or other suitable frequency. Wireless communication may be provided via a protocol such as Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, or other suitable protocol.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0028">The present disclosure also relates to a kit of parts comprising a headset and a detachable arm. The present disclosure further relates to a kit of parts comprising a headset, a detachable arm and a cover plate.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0029">The present disclosure provides a method of operating a headset comprising an earcup and a detachable arm, where the earcup comprises an earcup input transducer and the arm comprises an arm input transducer. The method may then comprise detecting the presence or absence of the arm being attached to the earcup, and operating the headset accordingly. This could be to operate the headset in a first mode if the arm is detected as attached and in a second, different, mode if the arm is not detected as attached. The first mode could then mean that a processor in the headset establishes an output signal based on the earcup input transducer and the earcup input transducer. The output signal could be processed so that it comprises signals representing speech of the person wearing the headset. This could allow the headset to operate as a voice input device for a telephone, a computer, a tablet or the like.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0030">The method may include, in an attached configuration, to detect a position of the arm relative to the earcup, and if the arm is in a first orientation relative to the earcup to mute all signals from input transducers, and in a second, different, orientation of the arm relative to the earcup, allow signals from the arm input transducer and/or earcup input transducer to be used to establish the output signal.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0031">The method may include to operate the headset according to the additional, optional, features of the headset as disclosed herein.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0032">The aspects of the disclosure may be best understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures.

The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of various concepts. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. Several aspects of the apparatus and methods are described by various blocks, functional units, modules, components, circuits, steps, processes, algorithms, etc. (collectively referred to as &#x201c;elements&#x201d;). Depending upon particular application, design constraints or other reasons, these elements may be implemented using electronic hardware, computer program, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0039">The electronic hardware may include micro-electronic-mechanical systems (MEMS), integrated circuits (e.g. application specific), microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), gated logic, discrete hardware circuits, printed circuit boards (PCB) (e.g. flexible PCBs), and other suitable hardware configured to perform the various functionality described throughout this disclosure, e.g. sensors, e.g. for sensing and/or registering physical properties of the environment, the device, the user, etc. Computer program shall be construed broadly to mean instructions, instruction sets, code, code segments, program code, programs, subprograms, software modules, applications, software applications, software packages, routines, subroutines, objects, executables, threads of execution, procedures, functions, etc., whether referred to as software, firmware, middleware, microcode, hardware description language, or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0040">A headset according to the present disclosure may comprise i) an input unit such as a microphone for receiving an acoustic signal from a user's surroundings and providing a corresponding input audio signal, and/or ii) a receiving unit for electronically receiving an input audio signal. The headset may further include a signal processing unit for processing the input audio signal and an output unit for providing an audible signal to the user in dependence on the processed audio signal.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0041">The input unit may include multiple input microphones, e.g. for providing direction-dependent audio signal processing. Such directional microphone system is adapted to (relatively) enhance a target acoustic source among a multitude of acoustic sources in the user's environment and/or to attenuate other sources (e.g. noise). In one aspect, the directional system is adapted to detect (such as adaptively detect) from which direction a particular part of the microphone signal originates. This may be achieved by using conventionally known methods. A, relatively, fixed direction may be preferred, e.g. for a directional input transducer located on or in an earcup, where the directional input transducer is configured to mainly pick up signals from a direction where the mouth of the person wearing the headset is assumed to be located. This will allow the headset to pick up a signal representing the user's voice. The signal processing unit may include an amplifier that is adapted to apply a frequency dependent gain to the input audio signal. The signal processing unit may further be adapted to provide other relevant functionality such as compression, noise reduction, etc.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically illustrates a headset <b>10</b> having a first <b>12</b> and a second <b>14</b> earcup.

This could allow the arm to be positioned in at least two positions during use, e.g. an active state or position where the arm is arranged generally so that one or more microphones are able to pick up sound from the user's mouth, and a mute state where, owing to the position of the arm, signals from at least the one or more microphones in the arm is muted so that privacy of the user is ensured.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0049">A range of mechanic stops may be provided in a rotation arrangement in an earcup of a headset. This could provide a differentiation between functions in the headset. One stop could be around &#x2212;40 degree relative to horizontal, in which position the arm would provide a microphone signal to a processor in the headset.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0050">Included in the earcup <b>12</b>, a limit switch is arranged so that the limit switch will be activated when the boom arm <b>20</b> is in position about 70 degrees, in which position the limit switch will touch a protrusion so that the microphone mute function is activated. At the same time, a metal spring will abut at another point, and a rib will produce a sound to provide a tactile feedback to the user, and thus provide a better feel for the user, altering or informing the user that the microphone, or microphones, is muted. Similar feedback to the user is provided when the arm <b>20</b> is moved in the reverse direction and passes the about 70 degree position.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0051">When the arm <b>20</b> is at around 95 degrees, a further protrusion restricts further rotation. When the arm <b>20</b> is at around &#x2212;40 degrees, a still further protrusion restricts further rotation, thereby a rotation range of from about 95 degrees to around &#x2212;40 degrees is established, yielding a range of about 135 degrees of rotation for the arm <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> schematically illustrates the headset <b>10</b> with a recess <b>18</b> for receiving the detachable boom arm <b>20</b>. When the arm <b>20</b> is not connected to the headset <b>10</b>, the headset <b>10</b> is configured to operate in a mode where the headset <b>10</b> provides a signal based on an output signal from a microphone in the first earcup <b>12</b>. This signal should mainly comprise the wearer's voice. Such a signal is then provided via a wireless, or wired, connection to an external device. The external device may be a computer device, a mobile phone or the like. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the recess is here overall rectangular shaped. Further, at one end a first structural feature is provided, and at the opposite, second end of the recess, a second structural feature is provided. The first and second structural features are different. These two different shapes or geometries provide an assurance that the user is not able to attach the arm in a non-intended orientation, thus also ensuring proper electrical connection between the arm and the headset. The overall oblong shape of the recess also provides an improved rotational properties to the arm/headset interface. The user is able to rotate the arm into different positions so as to achieve different modes of operation.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> schematically illustrates the headset <b>10</b> with a cover plate mounted <b>36</b>.

The cover plate <b>36</b> is intended to be placed over the recess <b>18</b> when the user detach the arm <b>20</b>. The user could wish to detach the arm <b>20</b> when the user wishes to use the headset <b>10</b> when walking or being outside his/her house, but not needing the arm <b>20</b>. The headset <b>10</b> without the arm <b>20</b> could be considered less obtrusive by the user, and, detaching the arm <b>20</b> from the headset could be done while the user, e.g., is engaged in a game on a handheld device, such as a smartphone or the like. The headset <b>10</b> would then be able to transition between operation modes without the user loosing connection to the device. The user could be engaged in a conversation via a softphone application on a smartphone while being at the office but needs to leave the office while maintaining the connection to the call. By detaching the arm <b>20</b> from the headset, the headset <b>10</b> detect the configuration change and automatically switch to a mode where a microphone in the headset is used to provide a signal representing the user's voice to the far end of the call. Similar, if the arm <b>20</b> is detached and the user attach the arm <b>20</b> while in a call, the headset <b>10</b> could be configured to automatically switch to a mode where at least the microphone <b>30</b> in the arm <b>20</b> is used to provide a signal comprising the user's voice.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> schematically illustrates a conceptual interface between a detachable boom arm <b>20</b> and a headset <b>10</b> in a cross-sectional view. In the arm <b>20</b>, a section <b>54</b> thereof is configured to attach to a section or part of the earcup as discussed above. The section <b>54</b> comprises first <b>37</b> and second <b>38</b> magnets. These are arranged symmetrically at a mechanical interface <b>48</b>.
