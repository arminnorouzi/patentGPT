Hydraulic fracturing fluids are pumped into the subsurface formation to be treated, causing fractures to open in the subsurface formation. The wings of the fracture extend away from the wellbore within the formation. Proppants may be mixed with the treatment fluid and deposited in the created fractures to keep the fracture open when the treatment is complete.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is often desirable during and after fracturing a subsurface formation to hold the fractures open through the use of proppants for more effective oil and gas production than without. However, sand particles, which are used as a proppant, and constitute more than 90% of all proppants used in hydraulic fracturing, may not provide sufficient crush resistance for use in a given subsurface formation due to higher stresses than what sand can handle. Conventional uncoated proppants break under downhole stress.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As exploration activities extend to deeper wells, common proppants such as sand and resin coated sand fail to withstand increased closure stresses. Consequently, stronger proppants are needed. Ceramic proppants are primarily synthetic proppants with high crush strengths. Compared to uncoated silica sand and resin coated sand, ceramic proppant has higher strength and is more crush resistant. Additionally, ceramic proppants are more uniform in size and shape, and exhibit greater sphericity and roundness than both regular silica sand and resin coated sand. This can maximize porosity and permeability of the proppant bed. Furthermore, ceramic proppants have the highest thermal and chemical stability, which can minimize diagenesis. These improved properties result in greater conductivity inside a fracture as compared to conventional silica sand and resin coated sand.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The specific gravity (S.G) of sand is approximately 2.65 and the manufactured ceramic proppants have S.G as high as 3.9, both of which are significantly heavier than the water (S.G of 1.0) or brine solution (S.G of about 1.2) which are typical base fluids used to carry the proppant to the formation. As a result, there are three major trade-offs in using high density proppants. First, using the higher density materials means smaller fracture volume for a fixed weight of proppant. Second, higher density material means higher cost. Third, a higher density material will have faster settling rate in the carrier fluids. To prevent settling, the common practice is to use high viscosity fracturing fluids to keep the proppant material suspended to allow it to penetrate further into the fractures. However, shale reservoirs are often fractured with low viscosity slickwater which generates long fractures and causes minimal formation damage compared to crosslinked fluids. Due to the relatively low viscosity of the slickwater, a high density proppant cannot be carried efficiently. As such, very high pumping rates are employed to transport the proppant into the fracture by velocity rather than the fluid viscosity and elasticity. Therefore, a proppant with lower density can be more useful in situations where high pump rates or carrier fluids with low viscosities are needed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, a need exists for a proppant with relatively low density and relatively high crush strength. Several techniques have been used to reduce specific gravity of the proppant. Selecting proppant materials with a lower density, such as walnut shells, pits, or husks result in deeper formation penetration, however, these proppants exhibited relatively low crush strength, therefore limiting the applicability of such materials to formations with relatively low closure pressures. Additionally, generation of small particles resulting from crushing of such materials reduces the conductive space available for fluid flow by reducing the fracture network. The present disclosure addresses this need by providing a 3D printed proppant with a API crush resistance strength of greater than 40 Mega Pascals (&#x2dc;6000 psi; which is crush resistance of pure sand proppant of 20/40 mesh with density of 2.65 g/cc) and a density of less than 2.5 grams per cubic centimeter.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the subject matter of the present disclosure, a 3D printed proppant includes a core having support bars extending from the core to a shell, the shell encapsulating the core and the support bars, wherein: the core comprises metal, polymer, ceramic, composite or combinations thereof; the support bars comprise metal, polymer, ceramic, composite or combinations thereof; the shell comprises metal, polymer, ceramic, composite, or combinations thereof; and the 3D printed proppant has a particle size from 8 mesh to 140 mesh.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure, a 3D printed proppant includes a porous core and a shell encapsulating the porous core, wherein: the porous core has a porosity from 10% to 75% and comprises metal, polymer, ceramic, composite, or combinations thereof; the shell comprises metal, polymer, ceramic, composite, or combinations thereof; and the 3D printed proppant has a particle size from 8 mesh to 140 mesh.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure, a method of producing a 3D printed proppant includes providing a 3D printing apparatus that produces the 3D printed proppant; distributing a layer of build material within a build chamber of the 3D printing apparatus, wherein the build material comprises metal, polymer, ceramic, composite or combinations thereof; depositing a layer of binder material on the layer of build material; curing the binder material within the 3D printing apparatus; and repeating as necessary to produce the 3D printed proppant, wherein: the 3D printed proppant comprises (i) a core having support bars extending from the core to a shell, the shell encapsulating the core, or (ii) a porous core and a shell encapsulating the porous core; the core comprises metal, polymer, ceramic, composite or combinations thereof; the porous core has a porosity from 10% to 75% and comprises metal, polymer, ceramic, composite, or combinations thereof; the support bars comprise metal, polymer, ceramic, composite, or combinations thereof; and the shell comprises metal, polymer, ceramic, composite, or combinations thereof. The 3D printed proppant may need post printing processing to realize the ultimate strength in some cases. For example the ceramic proppants may need to be sintered for realizing the ultimate strength to weight ratio. Polymer based proppants may need to be cured later at higher temperature to cure, crosslink to get the strength. To enhance the properties additives and fillers may need to be added to the printed proppant to enhance mechanical strength such as creep resistance, crush strength improvement, modulus increase, chemical resistance, and to control.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The following detailed description of specific embodiments of the present disclosure can be best understood when read in conjunction with the following drawing, where like structure is indicated with like reference numerals and in which:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a schematic view of a 3D printed proppant, according to one or more embodiments described in this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a schematic view of a 3D printed proppant, according to one or more embodiments described in this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is a schematic view of a 3D printed proppant, according to one or more embodiments described in this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method of making a 3D printed proppant, according to one or more embodiments described in this disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As used throughout this disclosure, the term &#x201c;hydraulic fracturing&#x201d; refers to a stimulation treatment routinely performed on hydrocarbon wells in reservoirs with a permeability of less than 200 milliDarcys.

Mesh is a measurement of particle size often used in determining the particle-size distribution of a granular material. As used throughout this disclosure, &#x201c;mesh&#x201d; sizes are designated by the number of openings per linear inch in the sieve.

For ease of conversion to particle size, the conversions from mesh to particle size are as follows: 8 mesh (diam. 2380 &#x3bc;m); 16 mesh (diam. 1190 &#x3bc;m); 20 mesh (diam. 841 &#x3bc;m); 30 mesh (diam. 595 &#x3bc;m); 40 mesh (diam. 420 &#x3bc;m); 70 mesh (diam. 210 &#x3bc;m); and 140 mesh (diam. 105 &#x3bc;m).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The 3D printed proppant may include various sizes or shapes.

The resin may comprise phenolic resin, epoxy resin, furan resin, polyurethane resin, polyurea resin, polyester, polyamide-imide resin, polyamide resin polyurea/polyurethane resin, urea-formaldehyde resin, melamine resin, silicone resin, vinyl ester resin, or combinations of these. Novolacs are phenol-formaldehyde resins with a formaldehyde to phenol molar ratio of less than 1, where the phenol units are mainly linked by methylene or ether groups, or both. The novolac polymer may have a molecular weight of from 1,000 to 100,000 grams per mole (g/mol). The novolac polymer comprises a glass transition temperature greater than 250&#xb0; F., 300&#xb0; F., 350&#xb0; F., 390&#xb0; F., 400&#xb0; F., 450&#xb0; F., or 500&#xb0; F.

Resoles are phenol-formaldehyde resins with a formaldehyde to phenol molar ratio of more than 1, where the phenol units are mainly linked by methylene or ether groups, or both. This can harden without the addition of a crosslinking agent due to abundance of methylene to bridge the phenol groups. The resole may have a molecular weight of from 1,000 to 100,000 grams per mole (g/mol). Resin or polymer inks may also be used. Resin or polymer inks are a photocurable polymer material, i.e., a &#x201c;photopolymer&#x201d; which may be cured on receiving light. Within technologies such as SLA, DLP, or even PolyJet, photosensitive liquid resins are used for manufacturing. These can be divided into two categories, thermoplastics and thermo-solids. These resins allow for objects to be printed with either matte or glossy finishes. The polymeric proppants are cured with hardened or crosslinked to get the thermoset material either at room temperature or by post curing at higher temperature in the oven. For example novolac resin is crosslinked with from 13 to 16 wt. % hexamine at from 200&#xb0; F. to 400&#xb0; F. to give fully cured thermoset proppant.

Sometime Tg is also lowered due to temperature and the absorption of moisture and other fluids in the proppant. This has to be taken into account and testing need to be done prior to deployment in the field.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The 3D printed proppant may include reinforcing agents.

The ZnS coated multi-walled carbon nanotubes retain significantly greater weight in thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) test compared to multi-walled carbon nanotubes without a ZnS coating. The article titled <i>Carbon fiber/epoxy composites: effect of zinc sulphide coated carbon nanotube on thermal and mechanical properties </i>by G. K. Maron, et al., originally published Jul. 7, 2017, and available from <i>Polym. Bull. </i>75, 1619-1633 (2018). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00289-017-2115-v shows this phenomenon where it states that: &#x201c;<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>shows the decomposition behavior as a function of temperature of the MWCNT, MWCNTf, and MWCNTf-ZnS powders. The untreated MWCNT showed a thermal stability up to 510&#xb0; C., being fully degraded at 580&#xb0; C. The MWCNTf and MWCNTf-ZnS that have suffered an acid treatment started to lose weight at lower temperatures, due to the presence of functional groups bounded to the carbonic structure. The MWCNTf presented the lower stability, mainly due to the presence of more defects in its structure, caused by the functionalization process. From the three tested samples, the MWCNT-ZnS had the better results. The thermal stability of the MWCNTf-ZnS was up to 580&#xb0; C., with the carbonic structure being fully degraded at 620&#xb0; C. At higher temperatures, only the sulphide particles have resisted to the thermal exposure and not suffered degradation.&#x201d; The coexistence of nanotubes and graphene fillers shows a distinct synergistic effect in improving the tensile properties. It is contemplated that the combination of nanotubes and graphene synergistically reinforce the polymer matrix is ascribed to the strong interfacial interaction between filler and matrix and the nanotube-graphene interconnections. Specifically, the molecular couplings between the nanotubes and graphene may transfer load when the proppant particle is under stress. Not intending to be limited by theory, the reduction in tensile strength may be dependent on the degree of defects introduced to the multi-walled carbon nanotubes and epoxy interfaces. The Young's modulus is at its greatest value when the amount of reinforcing agents is approximately 0.1 to 10 wt. % by weight of build material, which is desired for proppant application.

The annealing process is time and temperature dependent. Annealing of polymers is a heating of a polymeric part to below its glass transition temperature in order to relieve the internal stresses introduced during its fabrication (molding, cooling after molding, machining, welding, etc.). Thermal annealing is a simple route for stabilizing glassy polymers via the densification of their polymer chains and is accomplished through thermal treatment of the glassy thermoplastics. For amorphous polymers, the thermal treatment can play a very important role in changing the morphology. If the temperature is lower than the glass transition temperature Tg, the polymer chains are mainly immobile, thereby maintaining the existing morphology; however, if the annealing temperature is greater than the Tg, the polymer chains will relax. It has been found that the morphology can be modified upon annealing at a temperature higher than the Tg, thus changing the physical properties of the polymers.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As previously described, proppants are propping agent particles used in hydraulic fracturing fluids to maintain and hold open subsurface fractures during or following subsurface treatment.

Metal printed parts have higher strength and hardness and are often more flexible than parts that are manufactured using a traditional method. However, they are more prone to fatigue. To print metallic bodies, the most commonly used commercial manufacturing technologies are powder-bed approaches such as selective laser sintering/melting (SLS/SLM) and electron beam melting (EBM) according to the fusion mechanism and energy source. In these technologies, fine micro scale metal powders are tightly compacted to form a powder bed. A high-intensity laser or electron beam selectively scans the pow-der particles to fuse them layer-by-layer. Once completed, the fused part is removed from the powder bed and thoroughly cleaned by removing the loose or partially sintered powders. A direct energy deposition (DED), where a focused energy beam is utilized to fuse the metallic materials as they are being deposited can be used to print 3D metal bodies. Another method used by Skylar-Scott et al. they sintered water-based silver inks using a focused laser as they were being extruded from the nozzle.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Solvent-cast 3D printing (SC-3DP) consists of an ink paste containing metal powders, polymer and volatile solvent, in which no lasers or power beds are required. The metallic ink is extruded through a micro nozzle under an applied pressure. The volatile solvent evaporates rapidly upon extrusion as a result of the pressure drop. The polymer solidifies and the rigidity of the extruded ink filament increases, which allows it to hold its shape and support the subsequent layers. The result is a metal/polymer composite 3D structure.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Another method is using a water-based polymer solution to prepare metallic inks for SC-3DP, which is comprised of deionized water, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) binder and polyethylene glycol (PEG) plasticizer.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Another method, alloys powders are uniformly mixed with a water-based polymer solution using a ball mill machine. The metallic paste, referred to the ink, is loaded into a syringe barrel and extruded through a tapered-micro nozzle under a specific pressure at room temperature. A fan blows air over the extruded ink filament to accelerate solvent evaporation. The chitosan is 90% deacetylated with an average molecular weight of 207 kDa. 0.8 g chitosan is dissolved in 10 mL 80 vol % acetic acid/deionized water. The chitosan solution is mixed using a ball mill mixer (8000M mixer/Mill) for 10 min. After mixing, it is sealed and stored in a refrigerator. The metallic ink is prepared by mixing chitosan/acid solution with HAS powders at a weight ratio of 1:6.5 using the ball-mill for 5 min.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">SLM and DMLS can produce parts from a large range of metals and metal alloys including aluminum, stainless steel, titanium, cobalt chrome and Inconel. A key strength of metal 3D printing is its compatibility with high strength materials, such as nickel or cobalt-chrome superalloys, that are very difficult to process with traditional manufacturing methods. Common materials includes aluminum alloys (Good mechanical &#x26; thermal properties, Low density, Good electrical conductivity but has Low hardness), Stainless steel &#x26; tool steel (High wear resistance, Great hardness, Good ductility and weldability), Titanium alloys (Corrosion resistance, Excellent strength-to-weight ratio, Low thermal expansion, Biocompatible), Cobalt-Chrome superalloys (Excellent wear &#x26; corrosion resistance, Great properties at elevated temperatures, Very high hardness, Biocompatible) and Nickel superalloys (Inconel) (Excellent mechanical properties, High corrosion resistance, Temperature resistant up to 1200&#xb0; C., Used in extreme environments)</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Compulsory post-processing steps include the removal of the loose powder and the support structures, while heat treatment (thermal annealing) is commonly used to relieve the residual stresses and improve the mechanical properties of the part. 3D Printing of a hybrid system including two or more of the above described Ceramocs, Metal Alloys and Polymers. A three-dimensional (3D) printer is an apparatus for manufacturing a 3D shape by spraying inks with specific materials including a powder type one by one and laminating thereof to minute thicknesses. 3D printing can be performed using a computer-controlled 3-axis positioning robot (such as I&#x26;J2200-4, I&#x26;J Fisnar) and a pressure dispensing system (HP-7X, EFD). The metallic ink is loaded into a syringe (3 mL, Nordson EFD) attached with a smooth flow tapered nozzle (exit inner diameter=250 &#x3bc;m). A liquid 3D printer uses a UV light to solidify photopolymer resin while an FDM 3D printer, which extrudes melted plastic through a heated nozzle. Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), also known by its non-trademarked term, fused filament fabrication (FFF), is one of the most popular 3D printing methods. Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is an additive manufacturing process that involves the fusing of plastic powdered material using a powerful laser. With a combination of high accuracy, speed, reliability and lack of support structures, SLS is used both for functional prototyping and low-volume production. Stereolithography (SLA) is the formal name of the technology behind liquid 3D printers. Traditional SLA printers consist of a build platform in a vat of liquid photopolymer resin. A UV laser focused on the surface of the resin precisely draws each layer. Then the build platform is lowered, and a blade spreads the resin over the top of the previous layer so that the next layer can be drawn. Other liquid 3D printer versions now exist, including inverted SLA printers and digital light processing (DLP) printers. The inverted SLA printers address the problem of large vats by printing &#x201c;upside down&#x201d;. The laser focuses up through the bottom of a resin tank, which has a transparent bottom, and the build plate lifts up out of the resin tank one layer at a time. This makes it possible to print with only a small volume of resin in the tank. Since a laser beam controls the geometry of the printed object, SLA printers are capable of much finer resolution than FDM printers, in which the resolution is limited by the diameter of the nozzle. With a liquid 3D printer, resolutions can be as high as 20 microns, whereas an FDM printer will typically linger around 50 to 100 microns. That means fewer layer lines and a high amount of detail.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The following examples illustrate features of the present disclosure but is not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure.
