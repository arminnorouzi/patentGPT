Each of the bonding films <b>3</b> contains copper particles and a solid reducing agent.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">The bonding sheet <b>1</b> is favorably used so as to bond to a target object <b>5</b> to be bonded, the target object <b>5</b> having at least one metal selected from gold, silver, copper, and nickel on the surface thereof (hereinafter, the target object <b>5</b> to be bonded is also referred to simply as &#x201c;bonding target&#x201d;). Also, in the bonding sheet of the present invention, the bonding films <b>3</b> are formed on both faces, respectively, of the copper foil <b>2</b>, and thus the bonding sheet <b>1</b> may be used such that the bonding sheet <b>1</b> is interposed between two bonding targets <b>5</b> to bond the bonding targets <b>5</b> to the faces of the bonding films <b>3</b>, respectively. The metal present on the surface of each bonding target <b>5</b> may be in the form of, for example, a metal layer on the surface of the bonding target <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">Each of the bonding films <b>3</b> of the bonding sheet <b>1</b> is sinterable. As used herein, the term &#x201c;sinterable&#x201d; refers to the following state of copper particles: the copper particles are present in the bonding film <b>3</b> without being fused to each other, and by sintering the copper particles present in the bonding film <b>3</b>, a sintered body having a sintered structure of the copper particles fused to each other can be formed. By heating the bonding films <b>3</b> of the bonding sheet <b>1</b> and the bonding targets <b>5</b> preferably under pressure, the copper foil <b>2</b> of the bonding sheet <b>1</b> can be bonded to the bonding targets <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, each of the bonding films <b>3</b> after heating is a conductive bonding layer <b>30</b> having a sintered structure of copper particles. The bonding layers <b>30</b> bond and electrically connect the copper foil <b>2</b> to the two bonding targets <b>5</b>. The bonding sheet <b>1</b> can be obtained using, for example, a production method described later.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">The copper foil <b>2</b> of the bonding sheet <b>1</b> is a copper foil composed of copper and inevitable impurities as the balance, or a copper foil made of a copper alloy containing copper and a metal other than copper.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">In view of achieving both the strength of the copper foil and the electro-conductivity of the bonded structure, the copper foil <b>2</b> contains copper in an amount of preferably 97 mass % or more, more preferably 99 mass % or more, and even more preferably the copper foil <b>2</b> is composed of copper and inevitable impurities as the balance.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">From the same viewpoint, the copper foil has a thickness of preferably 0.5 &#x3bc;m or more and 1000 &#x3bc;m or less, and more preferably 1 &#x3bc;m or more and 500 &#x3bc;m or less. The thickness of the copper foil can be measured by, for example, observing a cross section of the bonding sheet in the thickness direction with a scanning electron microscope.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the bonding films <b>3</b> of the bonding sheet <b>1</b> may be formed on the entirety of both faces of the copper foil <b>2</b>. Alternatively, one of the bonding films <b>3</b> of the bonding sheet <b>1</b> may be discontinuously formed on one of the faces of the copper foil <b>2</b>, and the other bonding film <b>3</b> may be formed on the entirety of the other face of the copper foil <b>2</b>. Alternatively, the bonding films <b>3</b> of the bonding sheet <b>1</b> may be discontinuously formed on both faces of the copper foil <b>2</b>.

Examples of the other solid layer include an additional copper foil and an additional bonding film.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">However, another solid layer may be present on at least one of the faces of the bonding sheet <b>1</b> as long as the advantageous effects of the present invention are exhibited.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">The copper particles contained in the bonding films <b>3</b> may be, for example, in any of the following modes: (i) copper particles consisting of copper and inevitable impurities as the balance; (ii) copper particles made of a copper alloy containing copper and a metal other than copper; and (iii) a mixture of the copper particles (i) and the copper particles (ii). In the present invention, the copper particles in any of these modes are collectively referred to simply as &#x201c;copper particles&#x201d;. Also, depending on the context, the term &#x201c;copper particles&#x201d; may be used to exactly refer to copper particles, or a copper powder, which is an aggregate of copper particles.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">In view of improving both thermal conductivity and electro-conductivity, the copper particles contain copper in an amount of preferably 50 mass % or more, more preferably 70 mass % or more, and even more preferably 90 mass % or more, with inevitable impurities as the balance. Also, from the same viewpoint, the mode of the copper particles is preferably an aggregate of (i) copper particles consisting of copper and inevitable impurities as the balance. In the case where the aggregate of the copper particles contains a plurality of types of particles, the copper content is calculated based on all copper particles.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">The solid reducing agent contained in the bonding films <b>3</b> is in the form of a solid at 1 atm pressure and room temperature (25&#xb0; C.), and is used to facilitate sintering of the copper particles caused by heating the bonding films <b>3</b>. For this purpose, it is advantageous that the solid reducing agent have a chemical structure that contains at least one amino group and a plurality of hydroxyl groups. By using a reducing agent with such a structure, oxidation of the copper particles during sintering can be suppressed, as compared with the case where a reducing agent that contains a plurality of hydroxyl groups and no amino group is used, and a dense sintered structure can thus be obtained due to the furtherance of sintering of copper particles. As a result, it is possible to obtain a bonded structure that has high thermal conductivity and electrical conduction reliability. The expression &#x201c;solid at room temperature (25&#xb0; C.)&#x201d; means that the melting point of the solid reducing agent is above 25&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">The melting point of the solid reducing agent is preferably 300&#xb0; C. or less. The boiling point of the solid reducing agent is preferably higher than the boiling point of a liquid medium, which will be described later.
