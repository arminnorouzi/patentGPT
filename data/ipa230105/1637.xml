Material extrusion is one kind of additive manufacturing processes, in which material is extruded, or drawn through a nozzle mounted on a movable arm. The nozzle moves horizontally for fabrication of each layer, while vertical movement between the support and the bed allows the layers to be placed in successive manner.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">GENERAL DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In accordance with one aspect of the presently disclosed subject matter, there is provided a support apparatus for use in conjunction with an ALM system having a printing head being movable with respect to the support apparatus. the support apparatus comprising a dynamic surface configured to support a printed 3D item thereon during fabrication thereof by the printing head. The dynamic surface being manipulable between a first position, at which the dynamic surface has a first concavity with respect to the printing head, and a second position, at which the dynamic surface has a second concavity with respect to the printing head. The second concavity being greater than the first concavity. The support apparatus also comprises a manipulating mechanism operable to induce manipulation the dynamic surface at least from the first position to the second position.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The support apparatus of the above aspect can be configured to provide support for each layer fabricated by the ALM system. The first layer is fully supported by the dynamic surface. Then, for each consecutive layer to the first layer, the support apparatus of the above aspect is configured to be manipulated in order to provide support, which in addition to the support provided by a preceding layer, will enable the support apparatus to support a consecutive layer having a larger surface area than its preceding layer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The problem solved by the present invention is the need to fabricate 3D items that has at least a bottom half having a curved shape, without the need for disposable or removable support materials. In contrast to the teachings of the presently disclosed subject matter, prior publications disclose introducing removable support, either disposable or re-usable that are required to be disposed of or cleaned each time an item is fabricated, and are suitable for only a single type of a printed 3D item by providing a certain structure, onto which layers are printed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The presently disclosed subject matter can be used for fabricating edible printed 3D items for the food industry, and in particular, for fabricating a printed 3D foodstuff item having a curved surface, at least at its bottom half, made from a semi-solid material. Typically, fabricating a printed 3D foodstuff item from semi-solid materials requires firm support due to the fabrication method of an ALM system. For example, in extrusion type ALM systems, layers could have been at the same size or smaller than the layers beneath them, or elsewise, threads of material may spill from the edges of a further layer that is not being directly supported by the previous layer, while requiring an increased curing time between the printing of the layers for enabling each layer to support another layer on top of it with a surface area larger therefrom.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The support apparatus according to the above aspect can have any one or more features described below in any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">At the first position of the dynamic surface, it can have a first surface area, and at the second position thereof, the dynamic surface can have a second surface area being larger than the first surface area.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The support apparatus can comprise two curvature enabling members, each associated with a respective lateral side of the dynamic surface and configured to enable the manipulating mechanism to increase the curvature of the dynamic surface thereby.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The curvature enabling members is configured to react to the manipulation made by the manipulation mechanism, so as to enable the curvature of the dynamic surface to be increased. The manipulation mechanism can be configured to induce displacement of the dynamic surface, wherein the displacement of the dynamic surface is enabled by the curvature enabling members. Alternatively, the manipulation mechanism can be configured to displace the curvature enabling members, so as increase the curvature of the dynamic surface by acting thereon.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Each of the two curvature enabling members can be distanced to a different lateral side of a print axis along a cross-print axis, where the concavity of the dynamic surface can be measured between the two curvature enabling members. Each of the curvature enabling members can be aligned on an axis parallel to the print axis and constitutes a lateral edge of the dynamic surface. In some cases, the curvature enabling members are not symmetrical with respect to the print axis.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The manipulating mechanism can be configured to gradually increase the curvature of the dynamic surface from the first position to the second position thereof hence, there can be many intermediate positions in between the first position and the second position. There can also be third and fourth positions, having third and fourth curvatures larger than the second and third curvatures, respectively.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The manipulating mechanism can have a first state, corresponding to the first position of the dynamic surface, in which the dynamic surface is not enabled to reach its second concavity, and a second state, corresponding to the second position of the dynamic surface, in which the dynamic surface is enabled to reach its second concavity. In some cases, in the first state of the manipulating mechanism, the manipulation mechanism can be configured to prevent the dynamic surface from reaching its second concavity under the influence of gravity, and in the enabling state of the manipulating mechanism, it can be configured to enable the dynamic surface to reach its second concavity under the influence of gravity.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The manipulating mechanism can be configured to gradually change the state of the dynamic surface from the first state to the second state, in an automated manner in accordance with the amount of weight supported by the dynamic surface.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The manipulating mechanism can be configured to provide the dynamic surface with a bottom support, such that in first position thereof most of the dynamic surface is being supported, and in the second position thereof most of the dynamic surface is free from being supported thereby. In a first example, the dynamic surface can comprise a plurality of links hingably connected to each other, the dynamic surface can be pivotally connected to a support member by first and second lateral links, and the manipulating mechanism can comprise a bottom support moveably positioned below the dynamic surface.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The bottom support of the manipulating mechanism can be moveable between the first position of the dynamic support, in which it provides support for all of the links of the dynamic surface, and the second position of the dynamic support, in which none of the plurality of links of the dynamic surface are supported thereby.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The bottom support can also comprise at least a pair of opposite motorized bars, each being positioned from a different lateral side of the print axis, and are operable to be moved in opposite directions. In some cases, the pair of opposite motorized bars can be operative to move simultaneously. In some cases, each one of the motorized bars can be configured with a length which is at least equal to the length between its corresponding lateral link of the dynamic surface to the print axis.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The bottom support structure can be configured to be arrested in any position along its path from the first position of the dynamic surface and the second position of the dynamic surface.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The dynamic surface can be made from a thin sheet of elastic material dimensioned and operable to be supported by a support member, and the manipulating mechanism comprises a vertical displacement mechanism having at least a portion thereof positioned between the dynamic surface and the support member. The vertical displacement mechanism can be moveable between a first state corresponding to the first position of the dynamic surface, in which at least the portion thereof that is positioned between the dynamic support and the support member is distanced from the support member to a first distance, and a second state corresponding to the second position of the dynamic support structure, in which at least the portion thereof positioned between the dynamic surface and the support member is distanced from the support member to a second distance larger than the first distance.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The manipulating mechanism can be constituted by a pair of elevating rods positioned in parallel to the print axis, each on other lateral side thereof, and are operable to be moved simultaneously and in a mirror image manner. In some cases, each one of the elevating rods can be configured with a length corresponding to the length of the dynamic surface along the print axis, so as to enable each of the elevating rods to vertically elevate a corresponding portion of the dynamic surface during transition from the first position to the second position.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">At least a portion of the dynamic surface can be configured to rest onto the support member in both the first and the second positions. In some cases, the dynamic surface can be secured at both of its ends to a portion of the support member to maintain a predetermined tension at least in the first position thereof</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The support apparatus can further comprise a processing module configured to receive data from the ALM system and to actuate the manipulating mechanism in accordance with the received data. The received data from the ALM system can comprise the number of layers constituting the printed 3D item, and configured to operate the manipulating mechanism in accordance with the serial number of the layer that is about to be printed.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some cases, the received data can further comprise measurements of the layers constituting the printed 3D item, and configured to operate the manipulating mechanism for providing sufficient support for layers that are configured with greater measurements than their preceding layer. The received data can also comprise the accumulated weight present onto the dynamic surface.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The curvature of the dynamic surface can form a spaceless continuous sheet of elastic material.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The fabricated 3D item can be made from edible materials.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In accordance with a second aspect of the presently disclosed subject matter, there is provided a method for fabricating a printed 3D item, the method comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0027">a. providing a an ALM system comprising: a processing module; a movable printing head controllable by the processing module; and a support apparatus comprising:        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0028">i. a dynamic surface configured to support fabrication of the printed 3D item thereon by the printing head, the dynamic surface being manipulable between a first position, at which the dynamic surface has a first concavity with respect to the printing head, and a second position, at which the dynamic surface has a second concavity with respect to the printing head, the second concavity being greater than the first concavity; and</li>            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0029">ii. a manipulating mechanism operable to induce manipulation the dynamic surface at least from the first position to the second position.</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0030">b. providing to the processing module a product design having pattern coordinates to the ALM system;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0031">c. providing by the processing module instructions for the printing head to print at least one layer onto the dynamic surface in accordance with the pattern coordinates;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0032">d. providing by the processing module instructions for the manipulation mechanism to increase the concavity of the dynamic surface from the first concavity; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0033">e. providing instructions for the printing head to print at least one further layer having a surface area larger than the first layer on top of the first layer in accordance with the pattern coordinates.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0028" num="0034">The method according to the above aspect can have any one or more features described below in any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0035">The method can further comprise step c* between steps c and d, comprising calculating whether the next layer should require further support in addition to the support provided by the previous printed layer, and if so to calculate the extent of support that the dynamic surface should provide to be able to sufficiently support the next layer in addition to the support provided by the preceding layer and wherein the instructions provided in step d are based on said calculation.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0036">The pattern coordinates can comprise sequential cross-sectional layers of the printed 3D item being fabricated, each of the cross-sectional layers comprises a plurality of pixels, wherein each pixel comprises signals for the printing head for fabricating at least one of two edible components on a corresponding pixel on the support apparatus. in some cases, the pixels can be configured to comprise void signal signaling the printing head to leave a corresponding pixel on the support apparatus empty.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0062">The presently disclosed subject matter is directed to a support apparatus for use in conjunction with an ALM system having a printing head being movable with respect to the support apparatus. The support apparatus comprises a dynamic surface configured to support a printed 3D item thereon during fabrication thereof by the printing head, and a manipulating mechanism operable to induce manipulation the dynamic surface. The dynamic surface is manipulable by the manipulating mechanism between a first position, at which the dynamic surface has a first concavity with respect to the printing head, and a second position, at which the dynamic surface has a second concavity with respect to the printing head. The second concavity is greater than the first concavity.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0063">The support apparatus of the presently disclosed subject matter is operable to provide support for the fabrication of a printed 3D item having at least a curved lower portion. The support apparatus can be configured to provide support by gradually increasing the curvature of at least a portion thereof with the addition of one or more printed layers during the fabrication process. This increase of curvature allows printing layers that are configured with a larger surface area than their preceding layers.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0064">The support apparatus can be configured to operate in conjunction with an ALM system, enabling it to fabricate at least one material thereon to form printed 3D items having a curved surface at least in their bottom half The ALM system can comprise a printing head being movable with respect to the support apparatus. In some cases, the printing head can be configured to fabricate material onto the support apparatus by extrusion.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0065">In general, the printing head can be configured to be positioned at about the same distance from at least the portion of the support apparatus that is configured to support extruded material from the printing head during the fabrication process of the 3D item. In some cases, the printing head can comprise extruders that can be configured to extrude filaments of at least one material, or at least a portion of such filaments, onto the support apparatus. Upon operation thereof, the printing head can be moveable with respect to the support apparatus at least along a P axis and along an XP axis, being normal to the P axis, and in further cases, the printing head can be moveable along a Z axis. According to other examples, the printing head <b>10</b> can be movable at any other known in the art directions defined by any other coordinates, such as a spherical coordinates. The printing head can be movable with respect to the support apparatus either by movement of the printing head, by movement of at least a portion of the support apparatus, or by a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0066">In some cases, the printing head can be configured to extrude, via one or more extruders, a filament of material onto the support apparatus. The printing head can be configured to extrude the filament along or in parallel to the P axis to a first direction, move along or in parallel to the XP axis, and then to extrude the filament along or in parallel to the P axis to a second direction opposite to the first direction, and so on to fabricate a layer of extruded material. Then, the newly fabricated layer is being distanced from the printing head, to enable fabrication of a new layer on top of the preceding one.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0067">After fabrication of the first layer onto the support apparatus, the support apparatus can be configured to provide support also for the next layers. The support apparatus can do so by increasing the amount of surface area thereof available to support the fabricated 3D item. The amount of support provided by the support apparatus can increase in order to correspond to the number of layers of the 3D item that are placed on top of each other, or at least for the bottom half thereof.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0068">The support apparatus can increase the amount of support by increasing the amount of surface area of a portion thereof available to support the 3D item by causing at least a portion thereof to change its orientation with respect to the printing head. For example, the support apparatus can increase the curvature of at least a portion thereof, such that part of that curved portion will be positioned at the same level with the preceding layer, and in proximity thereof, to enable extrusion of filaments to form a layer on top of the preceding layer and the curved portion.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0069">In some cases, the extruded material can be edible material for fabrication of an edible 3D item. In further cases, the extruded material can be configured with a semi-solid properties, at least until curing thereof In such cases, the support apparatus can be configured to increase the amount of support provided thereof while being prevented from increase the amount of support to a degree in which it prevents the printing head from reaching its coordinates above the support apparatus. Also, support apparatus can be prevented from increasing the amount of support to a degree in which the curvature of the support apparatus presses the lateral edges of the layers at the bottom half of the fabricated 3D item towards each other to an extent greater than the extent determined by a user.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0070">In general, the support apparatus can comprise a dynamic surface operative to change it structure for supporting the printed 3D item during fabrication thereof. The dynamic surface can be manipulable between an initial, first position, at which the dynamic surface has a first position, enabling the printing head to fabricate a first layer having a first surface area, and at least one second position, enabling the printing head to fabricate a second layer having a second surface area larger than the first surface area. The support apparatus can be configured with at least one intermediate position in between the first position and the second position, where each of the at least one intermediate position can have a surface area corresponding to its position being larger than the first surface area and smaller than the second surface area. The support apparatus can also be configured with at least one further position, such as a third and a fourth positions, in which a portion of the support apparatus can have a curvature larger than their consecutive curvature.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0071">The support apparatus can further comprise a manipulating mechanism operative to induce manipulation of the dynamic surface, at least from the first position to the second position, and in further cases, through each of the at least one intermediate position. The dynamic surface can be manipulable, either directly by the manipulating mechanism or indirectly where the manipulating mechanism enables the dynamic surface to be affected by gravity, so as to increase the amount of support provided to the printed 3D item fabricated thereon.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0072">The term &#x201c;increase the amount of support&#x201d; as used hereinafter, relates to the size of the surface area that is configured to be, or already in contact with the fabricated material forming the printed 3D item.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0073">The manipulating mechanism can have a first state, in which the dynamic surface is prevented from reaching its second concavity, and a second state, in which the dynamic surface is not being prevented from reaching its second concavity. In some cases, the manipulating mechanism can increase the amount of potential energy of the dynamic surface between the first state and the second state. In some cases, the manipulating mechanism can provide a bottom support that prevents the dynamic surface from increasing its curvature by the influence of gravity, and the manipulating mechanism can remove the bottom support to enable the dynamic surface to increase its curvature by the influence of gravity.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0074">In general, the dynamic surface can be configured to increase its curvature to provide an increased amount of support corresponding to the number of layers of the printed 3D item already fabricated thereon. As such, dynamic surface can comprise an initial, first position, in which it has a first concavity with respect to the printing head, and with a second position, at which the dynamic surface has a second concavity with respect to the printing head, being greater than the first concavity. By increasing the concavity, a portion of the dynamic surface can be configured to serve as lateral support, at least from one lateral side of the print axis to a lateral portion of the second layer.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0075">In some cases, the support apparatus can comprise a processing module that can be configured to operate the support apparatus regardless of the ALM system. In other cases, the processing module of the support apparatus is common with the processing module that operated the ALM system. The processing module can be configured to receive a 3D computerized design of a printed 3D item that is configured to be fabricated thereon. The processing module can be configured to provide instructions to the manipulation mechanism to change the curvature of the dynamic surface. The processing module can also be operative to calculate whether the next layer should require further support in addition to the support provided by the previous printed layer, and if so&#x2014;calculating the extent of support that the dynamic surface should provide to be able to sufficiently support the next layer in addition to the support provided by the previous layer and providing instructions for the manipulating mechanism accordingly.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0076">In other cases, the support apparatus can constitute a portion of a printing system having an ALM system with a processing module that can be configured to operate the entire and synchronize the fabrication of the layers with the operation of the manipulating mechanism in a coordinated manner. The processing module can be configured to receive a 3D computerized design of a 3D item that is configured to be fabricated on the support apparatus by the printing head. The processing module can be configured to provide instructions to the printing head to extrude filaments of material onto the dynamic support to form a first layer. Then, or in parallel to the fabrication of the first layer, the processing module can instruct the manipulation mechanism of the support apparatus to change the curvature of the dynamic surface so as to provide support for the next layer or for a filament of material that is about to be extruded by the printing head.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0077">In some cases, the processing module can be configured to calculate the amount of force that the increase in curvature would cause the support apparatus to apply on the layers of the bottom half of the fabricated 3D item. In such cases, the processing module can instruct the printing head to revise the 3D computerized design of the printed 3D item, such that material will be extruded in a manner allowing it to be pressed without changing the final design of the printed 3D item.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0078">The term &#x201c;concavity&#x201d; or &#x201c;curvature&#x201d; as used hereinafter, relates to the curvature of the surface of the dynamic surface that faces the printing head, and by which the printed 3D item should be supported during fabrication.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0079">Whilst the illustrated apparatus is symmetrical relative to the plane of symmetry, at least some of its components can be asymmetrical.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>, illustrate a schematic model of the support apparatus of the present invention, designated as <b>100</b>, used in conjunction with an ALM system (not shown) having a printing head <b>10</b> having one or more extruders <b>14</b>. The printing head <b>10</b> is movable by a driving element <b>12</b> with respect to the support apparatus <b>100</b>.

Then, in order to provide support for a second layer on top of the first layer, a manipulating mechanism (not shown) operates to induce manipulation of the dynamic surface <b>110</b> towards a second position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. In the second position, a portion of the dynamic surface <b>110</b> under the printing head <b>10</b> has a second concavity C<b>2</b> with respect to the printing head, being greater than the first concavity C<b>1</b>. In the second position, the curved portion of the dynamic surface <b>110</b> forms a lateral inclined sidewall <b>120</b>, configured to provide a bottom support for the fabrication of a second layer L<b>2</b>, having a second surface area greater than the surface area of the first layer, and specially the lateral edges thereof Le<b>2</b>, together with the first layer Ll that was already fabricated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0083">In general, the support apparatus can comprise one or more curvature enabling members, configured to enable the dynamic surface to increase or decrease its concavity with respect to the printing head. The curvature enabling members can be positioned at opposite lateral sides of the lateral sidewall <b>120</b> along the cross-print axis XP, and configured to react to the manipulation made by the manipulation mechanism, so as to enable the curvature of the dynamic surface to increase.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0084">The portion of the dynamic surface that is configured to change its curvature can be linked to the support apparatus by two or more curvature enabling members. Each of the two or more curvature enabling members being positioned at opposite lateral sides of the print axis P along the cross-print axis XP. It is emphasized that the curvature of the dynamic surface is measured between the two curvature enabling members.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0085">The dynamic surface can comprise one or more elements made from a rigid material, and the manipulation mechanism can be configured to control the positioning of the one or more elements of the dynamic surface with respect to the printing head. In some cases, the manipulation mechanism can comprise two or more bottom supports configured to be positioned under the support portion and be moved gradually to opposite directions along the cross-print axis XP, thereby allowing an increasing portion of the dynamic surface to sink dure to the influence of gravity and thereby increase its curvature.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>E</figref> illustrate a first example of the support apparatus of the presently disclosed subject matter, designated as <b>200</b>. The support apparatus <b>200</b> comprises a support member <b>210</b> having the print axis P traversing the center thereof, and a cross-print axis XP horizontally normal to the print axis P traversing the length of the support member <b>210</b>. The support member <b>210</b> is constituted by a table having a central opening <b>212</b> at its center, and a dynamic surface <b>220</b> comprising a plurality of rigid links <b>222</b> slidably connected to one another.

The dynamic surface can be configured to increase the curvature thereof by gradually increasing the space between the adjacent links. The links can be positioned symmetrically with respect to the print axis P. In accordance with another embodiment of the first example, the dynamic surface can be configured to change its curvature by increasing the number of links, that are configured with predetermined distance from each other, in the central opening of the support member.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0088">In the present example, the dynamic surface comprises a plurality of interconnected first side links <b>222</b>A from a first side of the print axis P and a plurality of second lateral links <b>222</b>B from a second side of the print axis P.
