The array of electrically conductive leads protrude from the peripheral surface with areas of the second surface of the encapsulation arranged between adjacent leads. LDS structured areas of the second surface located between adjacent leads in the array of electrically conductive leads provide a further array of electrically conductive leads exposed at the second surface.

Hence, phrases such as &#x201c;in an embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;in one embodiment&#x201d;, or the like, that may be present in various points of the present description do not necessarily refer exactly to one and the same embodiment. Furthermore, particular configurations, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any adequate way in one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The headings/references used herein are provided merely for convenience and hence do not define the extent of protection or the scope of the embodiments.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Quad-flat package (QFP) is a current designation for a surface-mounted integrated circuit package with leads (possibly of the &#x201c;gull-wing&#x201d; type) extending from its sides.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The designation &#x201c;multi-row package&#x201d; may apply to a semiconductor device package having multiple rows of leads. Multiple rows of leads facilitate increasing the I/O number while maintaining (or possibly even reducing) the package footprint.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In fact, QFP packages may exhibit limited flexibility in a current distribution complying with the specifications underlying the wire bonding process. Also, in a current QFP design, a metal pad is left exposed at the back or bottom side of the package for a thermal dissipation, with the pad intended to be soldered on support substrate such as a printed circuit board (PCB).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A QFP package may thus have a limited I/O number, which leads to a package size increase in case the I/O number is increased.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">An attempt to overcome such a constraint in terms of interconnection layout and package size can be made by resorting to an unconventional QFP package comprising additional leads bent inwards near the package plastic body.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For instance, additional leads can be coupled with standard leads in the QFP package using the free space between these latter in order to increase the I/O number keeping a same package size.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Such an approach is inevitably related to a fairly complex bending process used to create added leads.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Laser direct structuring or LDS technology is a laser-based technology now currently used in manufacturing semiconductor devices. Using LDS technology, electrically conductive formations such as lines and vias can be formed in an otherwise insulating molding compound via laser beam activation or &#x201c;structuring&#x201d;, possibly followed by plating.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Laser direct structuring or LDS technology (oftentimes referred to also as direct copper interconnection (DCI) technology) is discussed, for instance, in documents such as United States Patent Application Publication Nos. 2018/0342453, 2020/0203264, 2020/0321274, 2021/0050226 or 2021/0050299, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the examples described herein, LDS processing is used to create additional interconnections in a semiconductor device package.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In that way, the I/O number in a package such as a QFP package can be increased by keeping a same package size (or possibly even reducing the package side) in a simple, easy, and reproducible way.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The examples discussed herein retain the basic structure of a semiconductor device package such as a QFP package adapted to be mounted on a support substrate S such as a printed circuit board (PCB), for instance.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, such a device <b>10</b> comprises a leadframe <b>12</b> including: a die pad <b>12</b>A onto which one or more semiconductor integrated circuit chips or dies <b>14</b> (only one is illustrated for simplicity) can be arranged; and an array of leads <b>12</b>B extending from the sides of the device package.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Attachment of the chip or die <b>14</b> to the die pad <b>12</b>A is via die attach material <b>14</b>A (&#x201c;glue&#x201d;), as conventional in the art.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The designation &#x201c;leadframe&#x201d; (or &#x201c;lead frame&#x201d;) is currently used (see, for instance the USPC Consolidated Glossary of the United States Patent and Trademark Office) to indicate a metal frame that provides support for an integrated circuit chip or die as well as electrical leads to interconnect the integrated circuit in the die or chip to other electrical components or contacts.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Leadframes are conventionally created using technologies such as a photo-etching technology.
