The controller <b>21</b> determines (S<b>120</b>) whether the obtained IC card information is of particular format data. The particular format is a format having been defined in advance. The particular format may include data of a table type format with particular contents. More concretely, the particular format includes a CSV format or a Jason format. In other words, particular format data may be data having a file name of which extension is CSV or JSON. When the obtained IC card information is not the particular format data, the controller <b>21</b> proceeds to S<b>220</b>. In S<b>220</b>, the controller <b>21</b> informs the user that the obtained IC card information cannot be recognized, for example, via the user IF <b>24</b> of the device <b>20</b>.

Therefore, the client device <b>40</b> can obtain the file for using (e.g., controlling) the device <b>20</b> easily.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Use cases of the device management system <b>1</b> in this embodiment will be presented here by way of example. That is, for example, a manager of a company gives telecommuters who work at home from among the company's employees the device <b>20</b> to use when they work at home. The telecommuters have the IC cards <b>50</b>, respectively. When the telecommuter receives the device <b>20</b> at home, he or she holds the IC card <b>50</b> over the device <b>20</b>. In this way, a distribution file is sent to the telecommuter's address for using the device <b>20</b> from the telecommuter's client device <b>40</b>. The telecommuter receives the distribution file on client device <b>40</b> and installs or retains the file as needed. In this way, the telecommuter can use the device <b>20</b> from the client device <b>40</b> at home.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In such a usage situation, the telecommuter can obtain the necessary distribution file simply by holding the IC card <b>50</b> over the device <b>20</b>.

In other words, transmission of the request data from the device <b>20</b> to the management device <b>10</b> (S<b>170</b>) is performed in response to receipt of the IC card information from the IC card <b>50</b>. Therefore, the IC card ID and device information can be quickly sent to the management device <b>10</b>, which in turn allows the client device <b>40</b> to quickly obtain the distribution file.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">(1e) When the controller <b>21</b> of the device <b>20</b> receives a response containing an authentication success code in response to the request data sent to the management device <b>10</b>, the controller <b>21</b> stores the authenticated user information including the IC card ID sent to the management device <b>10</b> in the storage <b>22</b> (S<b>200</b>). Then, when the same IC card ID is received again thereafter, the process is shifted from S<b>130</b> to S<b>230</b> to avoid execution of S<b>140</b> and subsequent processes.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Therefore, in the client device <b>40</b>, the distribution file that has already been acquired can be suppressed from being received again.

The registration-related information transmitted here may, for example, include at least information (e.g., IC card ID) that can identify the user. Then, the device <b>20</b> may be configured to store some or all of the registration-related information transmitted from the management device <b>10</b> in S<b>200</b> as authenticated user information or as part of the authenticated user information.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In this way, by storing unique registration-related information associated with the user on the device <b>20</b> side, it is possible to efficiently perform subsequent processes on the device <b>20</b> based on the registration-related information. For example, by including information indicating that color printing is not permitted as registration-related information, it is possible for the device <b>20</b> to reject color printing when the corresponding user requests the device <b>20</b> for the color printing.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">2-5. In the above embodiment, the management device <b>10</b> obtains the destination address of the distribution file by referring to the user list database (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), but the destination address of the distribution file may be obtained by any means. For example, user address information may be stored in the device <b>20</b>, and the user address information may be transmitted together with the request data to the management device <b>10</b>. Alternatively, for example, the user address information may be included in the IC card information obtained from the IC card <b>50</b>. Then, the user address information contained in the IC card information may be transmitted from the device <b>20</b> to the management device <b>10</b> together with the request data.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">2-6. The portable communication device according to the present disclosure may be in a different form from the IC card <b>50</b> of the above embodiment. For example, the portable communication device according to the present disclosure may be one that is easily portable, such as a smartphone or tablet-type device.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">2-7. In the above embodiment, the IC card <b>50</b> and the device <b>20</b> are configured to communicate with each other using the NFC communication method, but the communication between the IC card <b>50</b> and device <b>20</b> may be performed using any communication method. For example, the communication may be performed using any of various communication methods such as BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Direct, USB (Universal Serial Bus), a wired LAN, and the like. It is noted that &#x201c;Bluetooth&#x201d; is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, and &#x201c;Wi-Fi&#x201d; is a registered trademark of Wi-Fi Alliance.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">2-8. Multiple functions of one component in the above embodiment may be realized by multiple components, or one function of one component may be realized by multiple components. Further, multiple functions of multiple components may be realized by a single component, or a single function realized by multiple components may be realized by a single component. In addition, some of the components of the above embodiments may be omitted.
