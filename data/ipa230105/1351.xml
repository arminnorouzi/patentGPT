Dioxin is known as the most toxic substance in the world, whose toxicity is 1000 times more that of potassium cyanide. The steel production capacity of EAF steelmaking currently accounts for about 10% of the total steel production capacity in China. In recent years, the country has actively encouraged the development of EAF steelmaking, planning to raise the proportion of EAF steel to 20% and to reduce the energy consumption of EAF smelting by 10% by the end of 2025. On the one hand, the increase in the output of EAF steel will inevitably increase the dioxins emission, which demands stricter control of dioxin emission from the EAF flue gas; on the other hand, the temperature of EAF flue gas is high, and the energy consumption of steel production can be effectively reduced by recycling the waste heat of the flue gas. In terms of dioxin control, the control technology is mainly flue gas quenching technology for dioxin in EAF flue gas. Although this technology can effectively control the dioxin emission, it cannot recycle the waste heat of the flue gas. In terms of waste heat utilization of EAF flue gas, the scrap steel preheating has been proven to effectively reduce steelmaking energy consumption, but the preheating process will lead to the dioxins formation. Waste heat boiler technology can effectively recycle heat, but dioxin resynthesis will occur in its operating range (200&#xb0; C. to 800&#xb0; C.). Therefore, the existing flue gas treatment process cannot meet the needs of emission reduction and energy conservation at the same time. Additionly, with the increasingly strict environmental protection standards, NO<sub>x </sub>in flue gas also faces the demand for emission reduction. Hence, there is a need for a new-style EAF flue gas treatment process coupling emission reduction with energy conservation.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">CN203772039U discloses an EAF flue gas waste heat utilization and high-efficiency filtration combined purification system, including an EAF, a flue gas treatment device, a dust removal device, a main fan and a chimney connected in sequence through pipelines.
