Raw material is not limited to freshly derived rice bran. For example, rice bran under proper storage conditions to minimize degradation can be used as a raw material for this process. Stabilized rice bran, either chemically or heat-treated rice bran to reduce rancidity of rice bran can be used in some embodiments. In some embodiments, de-fatted and/or de-oiled rice bran can be used. In some embodiments, a combination of rice bran and rice hulls can be used.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a quantity of rice bran can be added to a batch tank and suspended in water and acid (<b>102</b>) to achieve a pH ranging from 0.2-4 for a period of time sufficient for components of the rice bran to be solubilized. In some embodiments, the rice bran is suspended in about 1000 gallons of deionized water. In some embodiments, between 100 and 3000 pounds of rice bran is added to the batch tank. In some embodiments, between 500 and 2500 pounds of rice bran is added to the batch tank. In some embodiments, between about 100 and 2000 pounds, between about 100 and 1500 pounds, between about 100 and 1000 pounds between about 100 and 500 pounds or between 500 and 3000 pounds, between 1000 and 3000 pounds, between 1500 and 2000 pounds, or between 2500 and 3000 pounds of rice bran is added to the batch tank. In some embodiments, the pH can range from 1 to 2, from about 0.2 to 4, from about 0.2 to 3.5, from about 0.2 to 3, from about 0.2 to 2.5, from about 0.2 to 2, from about 0.2 to 1.5, from about 0.2 to 1, from about 0.5 to 4, from about 1.0 to 4, from about 1.5 to 4, from about 2.0 to 4, from about 2.5 to 4, from about 3.0 to 4, or from about 3.5 to 4, from 1.5 to 2, from 1 to 2.5, from 0.4 to 2.5, from 1.5 to 2.5, from 2 to 2.5, from 1.5 to 3, from 1 to 3, from 0.4 to 3, from 1.5 to 3, from 2 to 3, from 2.5 to 3, from 0.4 to 3.5, from 1 to 3.5, from 1.5 to 3.5, from 2 to 3.5, from 2.5 to 3.5, from 3 to 3.5, from 1 to 4, from 1.5 to 4, from 2 to 4, from 2.5 to 4, from 3 to 4, or from 3.5 to 4. In some embodiments, the pH ranges from 1 to 2. In some embodiments, the pH is about 0.5, about 1, about 1.5, about 2, about 2.5, about 3, about 3.5, or about 4. In some embodiments, the mixture can be treated at a temperature ranging from 4-100&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the temperature of the mixture is 20-65&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the temperature of the mixture is ambient temperature. In some embodiments, the temperature of the mixture is about 35&#xb0; C., 40&#xb0; C., 45&#xb0; C., 60&#xb0; C., 65&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the temperature of the mixture is from 35 to 40&#xb0; C., 35 to 45&#xb0; C., 35 to 50&#xb0; C., 35 to 55&#xb0; C., 35 to 60&#xb0; C., 35 to 65&#xb0; C., 40 to 45&#xb0; C., 40 to 50&#xb0; C., 40 to 55&#xb0; C., 40 to 60&#xb0; C., 40 to 65&#xb0; C., 45 to 50&#xb0; C., 45 to 55&#xb0; C., 45 to 60&#xb0; C., 45 to 65&#xb0; C., 50 to 55&#xb0; C., 50 to 60&#xb0; C., 50 to 65&#xb0; C., 55 to 60&#xb0; C., 55 to 65&#xb0; C., 60 to 65&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the mixture is agitated. In some embodiments, the rice bran can be treated from 1 min to 24 hours, from 1 min to 1 hour, 10 minutes to 1 hour, from 10 minutes to 2 hours from 1 hour to 2 hours, from 2 to 3 hours, from 3 to 4 hours, from 4 to 5 hours, from 5 to 6 hours, from 6 to 7 hours, from 7 to 8 hours, from 8 to 10 hours, from 10 to 11 hours, from 11 to 12 hours, from 12 to 13 hours, from 13 to 14 hours, from 14 to 15 hours, from 15 to 16 hours, from 16 to 17 hours, from 17 to 18 hours, from 18 to 19 hours, from 19 to 20 hours, from 20 to 21 hours, from 21 to 22 hours, from 22 to 23 hours, or from 23 to 24 hours. In some embodiments, the rice bran extract can be treated from 1 to 2 hours, for example, 1 hour, 1.5 hour, or 2 hours. In some embodiments, the rice bran extract can be treated for between about 1 to 2 hours.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The acid can be any mineral or organic acid strong enough to reduce the pH of the suspension to required level and suitable for batch extraction of rice bran components. Examples of acids that can be used but are not limited for this purpose are hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, nitric acid etc. In some embodiments, the acid is strong enough to reduce the pH of the suspension to a pH ranging from 1 to 2.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the soluble components of the suspension are then applied to a shaker screen (<b>104</b>). A shaker screen allows a crude separation of larger particulate matter from smaller particulate matter and dissolved matter. The duration of the shaker screen separation can be modified depending on the condition of the crude extract, as is known by those skilled in the art. In some embodiments, the components of the suspension can be further separated from insoluble components of rice bran by one or more processes known in the art. In some embodiments, the insoluble components can be removed by bag filtration, shaker screen filtration, gravity decantation, centrifugation, or membrane filtration. For example, in some embodiments, the components in the solution are further separated from insoluble components by centrifugation (<b>106</b>) and microfiltration (<b>108</b>) (e.g., with a 2 &#x3bc;m filter). In some embodiments, the insoluble components that are removed can include carbohydrates, proteins, oil/fat and any other insoluble component. In some embodiments, about 5-25% carbohydrates, about 8-14% proteins, and about 15-30% oil/fat and combinations thereof can be removed during the process described herein. The soluble portion of suspension contains proteins, fats, carbohydrates, organic and inorganic compounds commonly found in rice bran. In some embodiments, the rice bran extract can have a finished composition of moisture 1-12%, protein 4-12%, fat/oil &#x3c;0.2%, dietary fiber 3-10%, ash 40-55%, carbohydrate 25-55%, total phosphorous content 4-7%, and calcium 0.03-0.01%.]</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Next, the rice bran extract with complete removal or substantially complete removal of insoluble particulates and/or suspended solids can be treated with ion exchange resin to remove the divalent and trivalent ions present in the liquid extract to make it more soluble and functional at neutral pH (<b>110</b>). In some embodiments, at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, at least 99.5%, at least 99%, at least 99.5%, or at least 99.9% of divalent and trivalent ions are removed from the rice bran extract. Ion exchange could be any resin known in the art for removing excessive ions present in a solution or ones used for purification purposes. Alternative technologies known in the art to separate metal ions such as, but not limited to, electrodialysis, membrane filtration systems such as ultrafiltration, and nanofiltration can be used to process rice bran extract.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Rice bran extract after ion exchange resin treatment can be pH adjusted to neutral or any pH suitable for application of interest (<b>112</b>). Specific pH ranges for rice bran extract can depend on the pH of the finished application and can be formulated such that a significant shift in pH is not observed in the finished application due to the addition of rice bran extract. Any commonly known organic or inorganic bases can be used to adjust pH including, but not limited to, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, and similar buffers known in the art. In some embodiments, the pH could be adjusted to range from pH 4 to pH 11. pH ranging from 4-7 is very common for food ingredients. pH up to pH 11 is common for meat ingredients. In some embodiments, the pH is adjusted to between about 4 and 10.5, between about 4 and 10, between about 4 and 9.5, between about 4 and 9.0, between about 4 and 8.5, between about 4 and 8.0, between about 4 and 7.5, between about 4 and 7.0, between about 4 and 6.5, between about 4 and 6.0, between about 4 and 5.5, between about 4 and 5.0, between about 4 and 4.5, between about 4.5 and 11, between about 5.0 and 11.0, between about 5.5 and 11, between about 6.0 and 11.0, between about 6.5 and 11, between about 7.0 and 11.0, between about 7.5 and 11, between about 8.0 and 11.0, between about 8.5 and 11, between about 9.0 and 11.0, between about 9.5 and 11, between about 10.0 and 11.0, or between about 10.5 and 11. In some embodiments, the pH is adjusted to between about 7 and 9.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next, the pH adjusted rice bran extract can be vacuum evaporated to remove excess water to increase the concentration of solids in solution (e.g. % weight solid in solution) (<b>114</b>). In some embodiments, the rice bran extract is then pasteurized (<b>116</b>). In some embodiments, prior to evaporation, the rice bran extract can have between about 0.5 and 12% soluble solids. In some embodiments, the amount of soluble solids in the rice bran extract is between about 0.5 and 12%, between about 0.5 and 10%, between about 0.5 and 8%, between about 0.5 and 6%, between about 0.5 and 4%, between about 0.5 and 2%, between about 0.5 and 1%, between about 1 and 12%, between about 2 and 12%, between about 4 and 12%, between about 6 and 12%, between about 8 and 12%, or between about 10 and 12%. In some embodiments, the rice bran extract has about 5%-9% soluble solids. In some embodiments, the final solids level in the aqueous solution can be anywhere from 5 to 80% by weight depending upon the processing equipment used to dry the extract as well as the end use of the material. In some embodiments, the solids level can be 40-75% by weight for drying in a vacuum dryer (<b>118</b>) or for direct use as a liquid concentrate in finished application. In some embodiments, rice bran extract is evaporated to about 45-75%, about 50-75%, about 55-75%, about 60-75%, about 65-75%, about 70-75%, about 45-70%, about 45-65%, or about 45-60%, about 45-55% or about 45-50%. In some embodiments, the rice bran extract is evaporated to about 55-60% by weight of soluble solids. For example, a solids level of 40% or lower can be used for drying in case of a spray drying operation. In some embodiments, the moisture content of a dry powder made using the process described herein is less than 10% (e.g., about 9%, about 8%, about 7%, about 6%, about 5%, about 4%, about 3%, about 2% or about 1% moisture content).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, a dried form of rice bran extract can have the same functional and sensory attributes as the liquid concentrate or liquid extract prior to vacuum evaporation. In some embodiments, the rice bran extract can significantly enhance the water retention in meat, and seafood products when incorporated in meat/seafood matrix alone or along with other commonly added ingredients.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">An exemplary process for producing rice bran extract comprises adding 1000 gallons of deionized water to about 2000 pounds of rice bran. In some embodiments, the pH is adjusted to between 1.2 and 1.8 (e.g., 1.5) using about 50 gallons of 20% hydrochloric acid. The mixture can be agitated in a batch tank for 1 hour at ambient temperature. In some embodiments, suspended solids are separated from the mixture using shaker screen followed by centrifugation and microfiltration steps. The resulting rice bran extract is subsequently processed using a cationic resin to remove divalent and trivalent cations. The pH of the rice bran extract is adjusted, in some embodiments to about pH 6.8 and 10.2 (e.g., 8.5), using 50% sodium hydroxide. The resulting rice bran extract, which can have approximately 4%-6% (e.g., 5%) soluble solids, can be evaporated using a low temperature evaporator under vacuum to about 48%-72% (e.g., 60%) soluble solids. In some embodiments, the rice bran extract concentrate is dried using a continuous vacuum belt dryer. In some embodiments, the dried rice bran extract is ground into fine particles, e.g., by using a hammer mill and packaged</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Compositions Comprising Rice Bran Extract</heading><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Water retention of meat, poultry and seafood products are considered desirable as it leads to a tender and more favored textural attribute. A variety of binders such as starches, proteins are commonly used for water retention. However, these components result in a poor textural attribute of finished product. In some embodiments, the rice bran extract or compositions comprising the rice bran extract can improve the water retention along with enhanced textural attribute of finished product.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Rice bran is a nutrient-dense composition derived from the milling of rice.

In some embodiments, rice bran extract is used as a nutritional supplement or a component of a composition used to promote health. For example, in some embodiments, rice bran extract is used to support healthy blood sugar levels. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the rice bran extract or oil improves insulin resistance, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0080">The rice bran extract can be delivered to or introduced into a food product in any manner that results in an effective amount of the rice bran being present in the food product. An effective amount refers to an amount that is necessary to achieve a desired result (e.g., water retention, flavor addition, stabilization of protein content, etc.). In some embodiments, the rice bran extract is present in a thawing solution. For example, frozen foods (e.g., shrimp) are thawed in a thawing solution. In some embodiments, the rice bran extract is present in a thawing solution. In some embodiments, the thawing solution has 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75%, 1%, or between about 1% and about 2%, between about 2% and 3%, between about 3% and 4%, between about 4% and 5%, or even up to about 10% rice bran extract, or any integer between 5% and 10%. In some embodiments, the thawing solution comprises sodium chloride at between about 0.5% and about 10% by weight. In some embodiments, the thawing solution comprises sodium chloride at about 2%.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0081">In some embodiments, the rice bran extract is delivered to a meat product by injection. In some embodiments, the injection delivers a composition, such as a brine or a pickle, comprising rice bran extract. For example, a brine solution comprising about 1.0% rice bran extract can be injected into chicken breast. In some embodiments, delivery of the rice bran extract to the meat product is passive. For example, in some embodiments, the meat product is marinated in a composition comprising the rice bran extract. The weight extension (i.e., the increase in weight of the meat product) resulting from delivery of the rice bran extract is between about 5% and 25%. For example, the weight extension in some embodiments after injection of the rice bran extract containing brine solution is about 15%. In some embodiments, the brine solution further comprises sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) at about a 0.3% final concentration. In other embodiments, the STPP final concentration is between about 0.1% and 0.5%. Meat products that are suited for injection of a brine solution comprising rice bran extract include, but are not limited to, chicken, ham, smoked sausage, and cured turkey &#x201c;ham.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0087" num="0082">In some embodiments, the pickle comprises, in addition to rice bran extract, sea salt, turbinado sugar, celery juice powder, acerola juice powder, and vinegar powder.

In some embodiments, the pH of the pickle can be between about 5.5 and 11.0, between about 6.0 and 11.0, between about 6.5 and 11.0, between about 7 and 11.0, between about 7.5 and 11.0, between about 8 and 11.0, between about 8.5 and 11.0, between about 9 and 11.0, between about 9.5 and 11.0, between about 10 and 11.0, or between about 10.5 and 11.0.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0083">In some embodiments, a brine or pickle solution is mixed with the meat product. Such a solution comprising rice bran extract is effectively incorporated into ground meats, such as ground chuck, ground pork, ground turkey, and other ground or extruded meats or meats used in making sausage or hot dogs. For example, a brine solution comprising rice bran extract can be mixed with a meat product (e.g., ground chuck, ground turkey, etc.) having a final concentration of 0.5%-1.5% by weight of rice bran extract. In some embodiments, the brine solution is prepared and mixed to result in a weight extension of the meat product between 5% and 25%. In some embodiments, the weight extension of the meat product is between about 5% and 20%, between about 5% and 15%, between about 5% and 10%, or between about 10% and 25%, between about 15% and 25%, or between about 20% and 25%.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0084">In some embodiments, the rice bran extract can be added to a meat product to increase water retention in the meat product. Increased water retention can contribute to increased cooked weight yield (i.e., the ratio of the weight of the cooked meat product compared to the weight of the raw meat product, often expressed as a percentage). In some embodiments, the cooked weight yield of a meat product treated with rice bran extract is between about 70% and 95%, between about 75% and 95%, between about 80% and 85%, or between about 90% and 95%, or between about 70% and 90%, between about 70% and 85%, between about 70% and 80%, or between about 70% and 75%, or even about 95% or greater. In some embodiments, water retention in a meat product treated with rice bran extract is compared to water retention in a meat product treated with untreated meat. In some embodiments, the cooked weight yield of a meat product compared to an untreated product prepared in identical conditions is at least 5% greater. In some embodiments, the cooked weight yield of a treated meat product compared to an untreated meat product is between about 1% to 5% greater, between 1% and 4% greater, between 1% and 3% greater, between 1% and 2% greater, between 2% and 5% greater, between about 3% and 5% greater, or between about 4% and 5% greater. In some embodiments, meat products treated with rice bran extract can have a percent purge even less than about 1%.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0085">In some embodiments, the water retention is measure or otherwise characterized in such a way as to enable one skilled in the art to ascertain improvements in water retention. For example, measuring the cooked weight yield of a meat product treated with rice bran extract and an untreated (or alternatively treated) meat product prepared (i.e., cooked) in the same conditions can allow a determination of differences in water retention of the two meat products. Cooking conditions can include temperature, length of cooking, and, in some embodiments, even the cooking apparatus. In some embodiments, the cooked weight yield is dose dependent (i.e., the greater the amount of rice bran extract, the greater the yield). Purge, or the expulsion of water or other fluid, from a meat product can also be measured. In some embodiments, meat products treated with rice bran extract have a decreased purge compared to untreated meat products. Percent purge for untreated meat products can be above 5%. In some embodiments, meat products treated with rice bran extract can have a percent purge less than between about 1% to 5%, between 1% and 4%, between 1% and 3%, between 1% and 2%, between 2% and 5%, between about 3% and 5%, or between about 4% and 5%. In some embodiments, meat products treated with rice bran extract can have a percent purge even less than about 1%.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0086">Meat products contain significant amount of fat content that can lead to rancidity over time. Rancidity is oxidation of fat and results in undesirable flavor development that leads to a lower quality of meat and reduced shelf life of product. Antioxidants that reduce the level of oxidation in the meat product can be of great commercial importance. The level of oxidation present in meats can be determined by measuring the amounts of peroxide present in a sample. Values for the amount of peroxide oxygen per kilogram can be expressed as milliequivalents per kilogram (mEq/kg). Meat products treated with rice bran extract, in some embodiments, have decreased levels of oxidation. Methods for determining the amount of peroxide in a meat product are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0087">The color of meat can be measured using any method known in the art. In some embodiments, meat color retention is determined by visual inspection and comparison to a standard, such as a control meat product with a known color retention (e.g., a meat product treated with a synthetic agent such as a synthetic phosphate source). One standardized method for measuring the internal color of a meat product is using the Hunter Lab color system, wherein the &#x201c;L&#x201d; value corresponds with lightness in the meat, the &#x201c;a&#x201d; variable corresponds to the amount of green and red in the meat, and the &#x201c;b&#x201d; variable corresponds to the amount of yellow and blue in a sample. In some embodiments, meat products treated with rice bran extract have comparable or improved L, a, and/or b values compared to controls. In some embodiments wherein the color of meat is determined by the Hunter Lab color system, the determined values for a meat product treated with rice bran extract and a control meat product differ by less than 20%, less than 15%, less than 10%, or even less than 5%. In some embodiments, the determined values of a control meat product are about the same.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0088">Other physical properties that are considered when determining the quality of a meat product include, but are not limited to, hardness and texture. Meat products treated with rice bran extract have improved texture and hardness in some embodiments. One measure for quantitating texture of a meat product is determining the slicing yield. Processed meats such as ham, turkey, etc. are often sold as thin slices made using commercial slicing machines. Slicing yield is the number of intact slices of meat product in total number of slices. Slicing yield is of commercial importance as a low slicing yield results in damaged slices with diminished value. In some embodiments, hardness of a meat product can be determined using methods known in the art including, but not limited to, the Texture Profile Analysis. In some embodiments, meat products treated with rice bran extract have improved texture profiles compared to untreated meat products.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 1&#x2014;Rice Bran Extract Production Process</heading><p id="p-0094" num="0089">2000 lbs. of locally sourced fresh rice bran were added to 1000 gallons of deionized water and pH was adjusted to 1.5 using approximately 50 gallons of 20% Hydrochloric acid.

For each treatment enough of a salt brine was made to extend the weight by ten percent. The STPP and rice bran extract was dissolved in the brine.
