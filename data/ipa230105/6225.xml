THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is concerned with improved fuel cell systems and methods.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Teachings of fuel cells, fuel cell stacks, fuel cell stack assemblies, and heat exchanger systems, arrangements and methods are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art, and in particular include WO2015004419A, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Definitions of terms used herein can be found as necessary in the above publication. In particular, the present invention seeks to improve the systems and methods disclosed in WO2015004419A.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Operating hydrocarbon fueled SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell) systems where the fuel cell stack operates in the 450-650 Deg C. range (intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell; IT-SOFC), more particularly in the 520-620 Deg C. temperature range, results in a challenging set of technical problems being encountered. Such fuel cell stack operating temperature does not lend itself to high levels of internal reforming of fuel and thus such systems typically require high levels of reforming prior to fuel reaching the fuel cell stack.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In such systems, steam reforming is used to convert a hydrocarbon fuel stream (such as natural gas) into a hydrogen-rich reformate stream which is fed to the fuel cell stack anode inlet.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To effect IT-SOFC stack cooling, air is blown over the cathode side of the fuel cell stack. To achieve the above high reformer temperature, the reformer is usually closely thermally coupled with the fuel cell stack tail-gas burner (which burns any remaining fuel in the anode off-gas in oxidant, typically by combusting with the hot cathode off-gas). In such an arrangement, the tail-gas burner and its hot exhaust gas are closely thermally coupled with the reformer by way of a heat exchanger such as a heat exchange surface. Typically, the reformer is arranged so that it is immediately adjacent to or in contact with the tail-gas burner in order that as much heat as possible is passed from the tail-gas burner to the reformer.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The delivery of fuel cell stack cooling (in particular by pumps/blowers to the cathode side of the fuel cell) is a substantial system parasitic load (typically, the largest system parasitic load).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">If the fuel cell stack loses efficiency over time, it generates more heat for a given electrical output, and therefore needs more cooling. Since the fuel cell stack provides the electrical power to the pumps/blowers to provide fuel cell stack cooling this leads to an increased power demand, requiring increased power generation, in turn resulting in further increase in heat generation requiring a further increase in cooling.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Close thermal coupling of the (endothermic) fuel reformer to the tail-gas burner (TGB) means that the enthalpy of the fuel flow leaving the fuel reformer is a function of the total airflow to the fuel cell stack. With IT-SOFC degradation, the increased electrical resistance and thus increased fuel cell heat generation results in increasing reformer temperature and thus increasing hydrogen content in the reformed fuel, in turn increasing the fuel cell stack cooling load during fuel cell stack operation.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is drawn from WO2015004419A in which these and other problems are addressed by, inter alia, providing a parallel-flow reformer heat exchanger <b>70</b>.

Should the tail gas burner exhaust temperature drop below this minimum value, additional unreformed fuel is supplied directly to the tail gas burner <b>80</b> from the fuel source <b>250</b> to increase the tail gas burner exhaust temperature.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">The prior art reformer heat exchanger <b>160</b> is a parallel-flow heat exchanger in which the outlet gases approach the same temperature. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. As the hot air (or oxidant) passes along the heat exchanger (illustrated by progress from left to right in the figure), it heats the fuel and the fuel temperature increases as it progresses in parallel. At the outlet, the two temperatures are approximately the same. The fact that the reformer heat exchanger is a parallel-flow heat exchanger and is arranged for exchanging heat between the cathode and anode inlet gases prior to their entry into the at least one fuel cell means that the outlet temperature of the cathode and anode inlet gases from the reformer and the reformer heat exchanger, and hence inlet temperatures to the cathode and anode sides of the at least one fuel cell stack, are very close to one another. The temperature difference between the anode and cathode inlet gases to the at least one fuel cell is primarily determined by the performance of the reformer heat exchanger. For example, in a steady-state operation, the temperature difference between the anode and cathode inlet gases to the at least one fuel cell stack may be within 20 Deg C., more typically within 15 Deg C. of one another.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">Certain embodiments in WO2015004419A provide a degree of independent control of the reformate outlet stream temperature from the reformer heat exchanger <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">Control means <b>200</b> is connected to fuel cell stack cathode inlet gas temperature sensor T<b>1</b>, fuel cell stack cathode off-gas temperature sensor T<b>2</b>, and blowers <b>210</b> and <b>210</b>&#x2032;. Control means <b>200</b> is configured to maintain the temperature determined by temperature sensors T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> at or about a desired temperature during steady-state operation of the fuel cell system.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">The heating of cathode inlet gas is controlled by varying the ratio of cathode inlet gas mass flow between the main cathode inlet gas flow path <b>230</b> and the air bypass inlet gas flow path <b>240</b>. This is achieved by varying the relative speeds of, and hence mass flow delivered from, blowers <b>210</b> and <b>210</b>&#x2032;. If the temperature of cathode inlet gas measured at temperature sensor T<b>1</b> is too low, the ratio of cathode inlet gas flow through air bypass inlet gas flow path <b>240</b> to cathode inlet gas flow through main cathode inlet gas flow path <b>230</b> is reduced, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">The mass flow rate of cathode inlet gas in the fuel cell stack is the total cathode inlet gas mass flow rate from blowers <b>210</b> and <b>210</b>&#x2032;. If the temperature of the fuel cell stack cathode off-gas as measured at temperature sensor T<b>2</b> is too high, the total mass flow of cathode inlet gas delivered by blowers <b>210</b> and <b>210</b>&#x2032; is increased, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">Control means <b>200</b> is configured to maintain the temperature determined by temperature sensors T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b> and T<b>3</b> at or about a desired temperature during steady-state operation of the fuel cell system. The air flow rate through the air bypass inlet gas flow path <b>260</b> is controlled independently of the air flow rates in both the main cathode inlet gas flow path <b>230</b> and air bypass inlet gas flow path <b>240</b>. The temperature control on the reformer outlet <b>72</b> provides the ability to increase the temperature of the anode inlet gas fluid flow path A relative to the temperature of the fuel cell cathode inlet <b>61</b>A.

There is a common cold air source <b>802</b>, an air filter/noise attenuator <b>805</b>, a fuel cell blower <b>810</b> and first and second air bypass valves <b>820</b> and <b>821</b>. First air bypass valve <b>820</b> controls supply of cold air to the anode off-gas heat exchanger <b>110</b>. Second air bypass valve <b>821</b> controls air to the air bypass inlet gas flow paths <b>240</b> and <b>260</b>. These valves control the proportion of air passed from the blower <b>810</b> to these three paths.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0099">Ambient air at about 30 Deg C. passes to the anode off-gas heater where is first heated and then to the air preheater <b>150</b> where it is further heated. This is the hottest point in cathode inlet gas fluid flow path C. Air is heated to a high temperature primarily by exhaust from the tail gas burner may be about 800 to 900 Deg C.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0100">This hot air is mixed in mixer <b>830</b> with cold air from air bypass path <b>240</b>. The outlet air from mixer <b>830</b> may be between 500 and 600 Deg C. This passes through the reformer heat exchanger, causing the reformed fuel to heat to between about 400 and 500 Deg C., and the air exits from the reformer heat exchanger at a similar temperature (or to a temperature about 15 to 25 Deg C. above that temperature, but, as will be explained, it may exit at a temperature below that of the reformed fuel).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0101">Between the reformer heat exchanger oxidant outlet <b>162</b> and the fuel cell stack cathode inlet <b>61</b> is a further mixer <b>840</b> that has bypass paths <b>260</b> as an inlet and has hot bypass <b>401</b> as another inlet. Hot bypass path has a throttle, choke or restrictor <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0102">After mixing with cold air from bypass path <b>260</b> and hot air from hot bypass <b>401</b>, the temperature at the fuel cell stack cathode inlet <b>61</b> is between about 500 and about 600 Deg C. Thus, the temperature T<b>1</b> at the fuel cell stack cathode inlet <b>61</b> is greater than the temperature T<b>3</b> at the fuel cell stack anode inlet <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0103">All the air from the blower <b>810</b> is used, so the blower is used to its maximum efficiency. The fuel cell stack cathode and anode inlet temperatures can be carefully controlled by air bypass valves <b>820</b> and <b>821</b> and the power supplied to the blower <b>810</b> can he reduced to match the demands from these valves.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0104">In an alternative embodiment, the hot bypass <b>401</b> is dispensed with, and the reformer heat exchanger is modified to heat the fuel to a temperature below that of the oxidant from the cathode inlet gas fluid flow path, prior to mixing with air from air bypass inlet gas flow path <b>260</b>. The reformer heat exchanger <b>160</b> can, for example, be a foreshortened parallel flow heat exchanger that does not completely heat the fuel to the outlet temperature of the air. Alternatively, it can be a contra-flow heat exchanger in which there is a temperature difference between the primary (heating) and secondary (heated) paths at all points along those paths. Other arrangements are possible. Operation of such embodiments is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, which shows the fuel and air emerging from the reformer heat exchanger with the air hotter than the fuel and shows a temperature drop as the emerging air is mixed in a controlled manner with oxidant from the cathode inlet gas fluid flow path, under the control of the blower <b>210</b>&#x2033; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) or the bypass valve <b>821</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0105">It has been explained that, in the preferred embodiment, the restrictor or throttle <b>410</b> is fixed. This is because controlling the flow of hot gas requires an expensive control valve that is prone to frequent maintenance or replacement. For this reason, in smaller systems, it is preferable to bring the temperature of the air exiting the reformer to a temperature above that of the fuel and then to cool it to the required temperature by mixing.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0106">As an alternative, particularly in larger systems, the throttle <b>410</b> may be controlled by the controller <b>200</b> or <b>800</b> to allow just the required amount of hot cathode gas to bypass the reformer so as to bring the fuel cell stack cathode inlet <b>61</b> to the desired temperature above that of the fuel cell stack anode inlet <b>41</b>. This arrangement may be preferable in systems generating more than 10 or 20 kW of power. In such systems, the energy saving from greater efficiency is such that the expense of hot flow control components may be outweighed by the energy savings.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0107">In this way, a fuel cell system with a hot reformer bypass, and with cold pre- and post-reformer bypasses has been described and various alternative combinations of these (hot bypass with post-reformer bypass and no pre-reformer bypass; no hot bypass with post-reformer bypass and optional pre-reformer bypass; hot controllable bypass with post-reformer bypass and optional pre-reformer bypass). In some embodiments the fuel is heated in the reformer to a temperature below that of the oxidant at the reformer outlet. In the case, for example, of a counter flow reformer heat exchanger, the hot bypass flow would need to be greater, and the flow of cold pre ref bypass would be greater. These can indeed be advantageous in terms of lower pressure drops in the system or compactness.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0108">System warm-up options may be provided in which a different type of reforming reaction is used other than steam reforming. For example, CPOX reforming can be used before reverting to SMR in normal operation. This would preferably include anode off gas recirculation. This would be implemented by taking some of the flow from stream &#x2018;B&#x2019; at any point between the stack <b>20</b> and the TGB <b>80</b> and feeding it into the inlet of the reformer <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0109">A related modification includes dispensing with the evaporator heat exchanger <b>170</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0110">The present invention is not limited to the above embodiments only, and other embodiments will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope of the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
