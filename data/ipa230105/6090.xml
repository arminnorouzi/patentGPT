The layout of the activated region and the non-activated regions makes the LED semiconductor structure include: a high-efficiency light emitting region and light emitting obstacle regions located on two sides of the high-efficiency light emitting region. The high-efficiency light emitting region includes: the activated region, a part of the light emitting layer in which directly below the activated region, and a part of the N-type semiconductor layer in which directly below the activated region. The light emitting obstacle regions include: the non-activated regions, parts of the light emitting layer in which directly below the non-activated regions, and parts of the N-type semiconductor layer in which directly below the non-activated regions. When an area of LED is certain, compared with a case where the P-type ion doped layer is entirely the activated regions, the high-efficiency light emitting region enables an electric field between the P electrode and the N electrode to be concentrated. The concentrated electric field means that an intensity of the electric field is large, and LEDs emit light in a concentrated manner, so that a luminous efficiency is improved. In addition, the blocking layer is used to selectively activate the P-type ion doped layer to avoid etching the P-type ion doped layer and damaging the light emitting layer in the high-efficiency light emitting region, and reduce defects. At the same time, due to the existence of a mask, the light emitting obstacle regions are formed on two sides of an LED device, which suppresses unevenness of emitted light caused by a non-radiative recombination effect, and improves luminous efficiency.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030">2) In an alternative, the P-type ion doped layer includes at least two activated regions and at least three non-activated regions, and the activated regions and the non-activated regions are distributed at intervals. A plurality of activated regions and a plurality of non-activated regions are distributed at intervals to form a plurality of alternately distributed high-efficiency light emitting regions and light emitting obstacle regions. When the area of LED is fixed, compared with one large-area light emitting region, a plurality of small-area high-efficiency light emitting regions can further increase a recombination efficiency of carriers per unit area of LED, so that the luminous efficiency is improved.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0031">3) In an alternative, a) the light emitting layer and the P-type ion doped layer expose a part of the N-type semiconductor layer. An N electrode is provided on the exposed part of N-type semiconductor layer. An ohmic contact is formed between the N electrode and the N-type semiconductor layer. A P electrode is provided on the activated region. An ohmic contact is formed between the P electrode and the activated region. Or b) an N electrode is provided on a side of the N-type semiconductor layer away from the light emitting layer. An ohmic contact is formed between the N electrode and the N-type semiconductor layer. A P electrode is provided on the activated region. An ohmic contact is formed between the P electrode and the activated region. The alternative a) corresponds to an LED with a horizontal structure. A conduction current flows along a horizontal direction (vertical to a thickness direction of the LED). The alternative b) corresponds to an LED with a vertical structure. A conduction current flows along a vertical direction (the thickness direction of the LED).</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method for manufacturing a semiconductor structure according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>3</b></figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating an intermediate structure corresponding to a process in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic sectional diagram illustrating the semiconductor structure according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic sectional diagram illustrating a semiconductor structure according to a second embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic sectional diagram illustrating a semiconductor structure according to a third embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic sectional diagram illustrating a semiconductor structure according to a fourth embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic sectional diagram illustrating a semiconductor structure according to a fifth embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic sectional diagram illustrating a semiconductor structure according to a sixth embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0038" num="0040">To facilitate the understanding of the present disclosure, all reference signs appearing in the present disclosure are listed below:</p><p id="p-0039" num="0041">Semiconductor structures <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b></p><p id="p-0040" num="0042">N-type semiconductor layer <b>11</b></p><p id="p-0041" num="0043">Light-emitting layer <b>12</b></p><p id="p-0042" num="0044">P-type ion doped layer <b>13</b></p><p id="p-0043" num="0045">Blocking material layer <b>14</b>&#x2032;</p><p id="p-0044" num="0046">Blocking layer <b>14</b></p><p id="p-0045" num="0047">Opening <b>14</b><i>a </i></p><p id="p-0046" num="0048">Activated region <b>131</b></p><p id="p-0047" num="0049">Non-activated region <b>132</b></p><p id="p-0048" num="0050">N electrode <b>151</b></p><p id="p-0049" num="0051">P electrode <b>152</b></p><p id="p-0050" num="0052">Passivation layer <b>16</b></p><p id="p-0051" num="0053">Electron blocking layer <b>17</b></p><p id="p-0052" num="0054">First region <b>171</b></p><p id="p-0053" num="0055">Second region <b>172</b></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0056">In order to make the objects, features and advantages of the present disclosure more obvious and understandable, specific embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail below with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method of manufacturing a semiconductor structure according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>3</b></figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating an intermediate structure corresponding to a process in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic sectional diagram illustrating the semiconductor structure according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0058">First, referring to step S<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an N-type semiconductor layer <b>11</b>, a light emitting layer <b>12</b>, a P-type ion doped layer <b>13</b>, and a blocking material layer <b>14</b>&#x2032; disposed from bottom to up are provided.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0059">Materials of the N-type semiconductor layer <b>11</b> can be group III nitride materials, such as at least one of GaN, AlGaN, InGaN, or AlInGaN.
