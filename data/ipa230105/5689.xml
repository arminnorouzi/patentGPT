Therefore, a mechanical latching device is attached to the electromagnetic contactor. In a mechanical latching device disclosed in PTL 1, when a latch support is displaced to a closed side in conjunction with a contact support, a roller attached to a latch lever is caught on a shoulder portion of the latch support to mechanically prevent the latch support from returning to a released side.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">PTL 1: JP 2000-251601 A</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a control coil of the electromagnetic contactor is excited, a slight gap (allowance) is provided between the shoulder portion of the latch support and the roller.

One way is to drive the plunger <b>26</b>. Specifically, when the plunger <b>26</b> is moved forward to the one side in the widthwise direction by the electromagnet <b>25</b> in the closed state, the protrusion rod <b>28</b> pushes the rotating member <b>24</b> to displace the portion of the rotating member <b>24</b> on the back side in the depthwise direction to the one side in the widthwise direction. Another way is to manually operate the manual operation portion <b>54</b>. Specifically, when a user operates the manual operation portion <b>54</b> of the rotating member <b>24</b> in the closed state, the portion of the rotating member <b>24</b> on the back side in the depthwise direction is displaced to the one side in the widthwise direction. In this way, returning the rotating member <b>24</b> to the initial position allows for cancellation of the latched state of the latch support <b>22</b>.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Effects</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, main effects of the first embodiment are described.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The amount of stroke of the contact support <b>14</b> varies depending on the model of the electromagnetic contactor <b>11</b>, due to which the conventional structure has required the adjustment of the gap between the portions that mechanically prevents the returning of the latch support.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, the mechanical latching device <b>12</b> of the electromagnetic contactor <b>11</b> according to the first embodiment includes the latch support <b>22</b> and the rotating member <b>24</b>. The latch support <b>22</b> is connected to the contact support <b>14</b> of the electromagnetic contactor <b>11</b> and displaceable between the released side and the closed side. The latch support <b>22</b> includes the protrusion <b>33</b> protruding laterally and formed with the latch surface <b>44</b> facing the released side. One end side of the rotating member <b>24</b> is rotatably supported beside the latch support <b>22</b>, and the other end side thereof is biased toward the protrusion <b>33</b>. Additionally, when the latch support <b>22</b> is on the released side, the outer peripheral surface <b>51</b> on the other end side of the rotating member <b>24</b> contacts with the tip of the protrusion <b>33</b>, allowing the latch support <b>22</b> to be displaced to the closed side. In addition, when the latch support <b>22</b> is on the closed side, the other end side of the rotating member <b>24</b> rotates according to the position of the latch support <b>22</b> in the displacement direction, and the tip surface <b>52</b> faces the latch surface <b>44</b>, thereby mechanically preventing the latch support <b>22</b> from returning to the released side at the plurality of positions along the displacement direction. This eliminates the need for work on adjusting a gap between the portions that mechanically prevent the returning of the latch support <b>22</b>, so that improved convenience can be achieved. Furthermore, the rotating member <b>24</b> is a single component, enabling suppression of increase in the number of components, and also facilitating assembly.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The latch surface <b>44</b> is inclined in such a manner as to go from the closed side to the released side from the rotating member <b>24</b> side toward the latch support <b>22</b> side. As a result, the tip surface <b>52</b> of the rotating member <b>24</b> faces the latch surface <b>44</b> according to the position of the latch support <b>22</b>, thereby enabling the latch support <b>22</b> to be mechanically prevented from returning to the released side at the plurality of positions along the displacement direction. Moreover, any gap can be eliminated between the portions mechanically preventing the returning of the latch support <b>22</b>. Accordingly, even when the control coil of the electromagnetic contactor <b>11</b> is not excited, the returning of the latch support <b>22</b> can be suppressed. In addition, in such a cam structure that the rotating member <b>24</b> is driven so as to follow a contour of the latch surface <b>44</b>, the rotating member <b>24</b> can be operated smoothly without any sense of stepping since the latch surface <b>44</b> has no steps. Furthermore, the latch surface <b>44</b> of the protrusion <b>33</b> and the tip surface <b>52</b> of the rotating member <b>24</b> are not required to have high accuracy in dimensions, so that increased manufacturing cost can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The mechanical latching device <b>12</b> includes the plunger <b>26</b>. The plunger <b>26</b> is driven by the electromagnet <b>25</b>. When the plunger <b>26</b> moves forward from the latch support <b>22</b> side toward the outer peripheral surface <b>51</b> on the other end side of the rotating member <b>24</b>, the tip of the plunger <b>26</b> pushes back the outer peripheral surface <b>51</b> on the other end side of the rotating member <b>24</b>. This can easily cancel the latched state of the latch support <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The rotating member <b>24</b> includes the manual operation portion <b>54</b> that is rotatably operated by a user. Accordingly, when the manual operation portion <b>54</b> of the rotating member <b>24</b> is operated by the user, the portion thereof on the back side in the depthwise direction is pushed back. This allows for easy cancellation of the latched state of the latch support <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, a comparative example is described.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref> are diagrams illustrating the comparative example.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is a diagram of the comparative example as viewed from one side in the longitudinal direction. In the drawing, a latch support <b>71</b> includes a shoulder portion <b>72</b>, and a latch lever <b>73</b> includes a roller <b>74</b>. In the comparative example, when the latch support <b>71</b> is displaced to the closed side, the roller <b>74</b> of the latch lever <b>73</b> is caught on the shoulder portion <b>72</b> of the latch support <b>71</b> to mechanically prevent the latch support <b>71</b> from returning to the released side. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> is an enlarged diagram of the portions mechanically preventing the returning of the latch support <b>71</b>. Excitation of the control coil of the electromagnetic contactor <b>11</b> provides a slight gap &#x201c;d&#x201d; (allowance) between the shoulder portion <b>72</b> and the roller <b>74</b>. However, the amount of stroke of the contact support <b>14</b> varies depending on the model of the electromagnetic contactor <b>11</b>, due to which the gap &#x201c;d&#x201d; also varies in size. When the control coil of the electromagnetic contactor <b>11</b> goes into an unexcited state, the latch support <b>71</b> returns by the size of the gap &#x201c;d&#x201d;. Therefore, depending on the size of the gap &#x201c;d&#x201d;, there is a need for work on adjusting the gap &#x201c;d&#x201d;, such as replacement with the roller <b>74</b> that has a different outer diameter.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Configuration</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The second embodiment has the same configuration as the first embodiment described above, except that the portions that mechanically prevent the returning of the latch support <b>22</b> are changed in structure.
