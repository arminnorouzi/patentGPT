end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The following description of the embodiments of the invention is not intended to limit the invention to these embodiments, but rather to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use this invention.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">1. Overview</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the method can include: obtaining protein isolates S<b>100</b>, and producing an animal product analog S<b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In variants, the method can function to utilize protein assemblies (e.g., micelles of globulin, such as 11S globulin hexamers) to produce plant-based alternatives to animal products and/or provide other functionalities.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">2. Technical Advantages</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Variants of the technology can confer one or more advantages over conventional technologies.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">First, conventional plant-derived milk analogs and downstream products thereof (e.g., butter, yogurt, cheese, etc.) are often achieved by using modifiers to augment properties of a plant-derived base until it resembles the animal product. Notably, this conventional approach does not satisfactorily match the functional behaviors of dairy milk or the dairy experience (e.g., emulsion stability, curdling behavior, flavor, whipping capacity, foaming capacity, texture properties of the resulting curds, etc.). Notable examples of this are plant-derived cheese products that often rely on gums and other texture modifiers, which may result in functional properties and protein contents that are distinct from those of dairy cheese. In variants, the inventors have discovered that forming protein assemblies, wherein the protein assemblies simulate functional properties of certain animal-derived proteins (e.g., increasing emulsion stability between a fatty component and an aqueous component), can improve the functional behaviors of a dairy analog product produced using the protein assemblies, which, in variants, can augment, reduce the need for, and/or eliminate the need for gums and/or other texture modifiers.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Second, in variants, the protein assemblies can scatter light as it passes through a protein assembly solution, wherein the protein assemblies can be white in color. Plant matter used as a base may not be a conventional milk color, such as, for instance, green in color. A spherical micelle structure of a protein assembly (e.g., with a diameter between 100-1000 nm) may diminish a green color of a milk analog solution containing the protein assembly by encapsulating the green matter and/or due to light scattering by the particles. Likewise, a plant-derived protein assembly solution can be &#x201c;milk-white,&#x201d; demonstrating light scattering as a result of assembly. Achieving the &#x201c;milk-white&#x201d; protein solution is a notable gain of function for plant-derived products since many plant extracts retain the color of the starting plant material.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Third, press cakes represent a potentially valuable waste byproduct of traditional oilseed extraction processes (e.g., cooking oil production; lipid extraction; etc.), particularly for plant-based alternatives to meat and/or dairy products. In examples, press cakes can be particularly useful since an additional lipid-removal step no longer needs to be performed prior to subsequent processing, and strong flavors within the substrate are oftentimes extracted with the lipid component (e.g., removed from the press cake). However, using press cakes in food production introduces several challenges, including matching nutritional content, flavor profile, and/or functional properties of a press cake food product to a target food product. The inventors have discovered that these challenges can be mitigated by reconstituting a press cake with secondary components (e.g., plant-based oil, creams, polysaccharides, etc.) from another source (e.g., foreign source, external source, etc.), and/or by extracting proteins from the press cake (e.g., for protein assembly formation). In an example, a fatty component can be selected and combined with the press cake such that the press cake substrate's flavor is masked, the nutritional profile more closely matches a target profile (e.g., including saturated fats), and/or to improve the functional property behavior of the food product.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">However, further advantages can be provided by variants of the system and method disclosed herein.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">3. Method</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the method can include: obtaining a protein isolate S<b>100</b> and producing an animal product analog using the protein isolate S<b>200</b>. In variants, obtaining the protein isolate S<b>100</b> can include: extracting protein isolates from a substrate S<b>140</b>, and forming protein assemblies from the protein isolates S<b>160</b>. Optionally, the method can include: selecting a substrate S<b>120</b>, separating the substrate into a solid component and a liquid component S<b>150</b>, producing a plant-based milk S<b>240</b> (e.g., wherein the animal product analog is produced using the reconstituted product), processing the animal product analog S<b>260</b>, and/or any other suitable method.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The resultant animal product analog preferably has one or more functional properties similar to the target animal product. The resultant animal product analog is preferably entirely plant matter, but can additionally or alternatively be primarily plant matter (e.g., more than 50% plant matter; more than 99% plant matter; etc.), partially plant matter, and/or have any other suitable plant matter content. The resultant animal product analog can exclude and/or include less than a threshold amount of total and/or added: animal products (e.g., excludes animal proteins, such as caseins), gums (e.g., polysaccharide thickeners), allergenic ingredients, and/or any other suitable ingredient. Added ingredients and/or compounds can include: materials that were not present in and/or are foreign to the plant substrate or other ingredients, materials added in as a separate ingredient, and/or otherwise defined. The threshold amount can be between 0.1%-10% or any range or value therebetween (e.g., 10%, 5%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.1%, etc.), but can alternatively be greater than 10% or less than 0.1%. The animal product analog's functional properties that can be matched or substantially matched to the target animal product can include: nutritional profile (e.g., macronutrient profile, micronutrient profile, etc.), flavor, texture, phase change responses (e.g., melt, stretch, etc.), treatment responses (e.g., caramelization, etc.), and/or any other functional profile. For example, the animal product analog's functional properties can be matched to within a threshold difference from the target animal product, wherein the threshold difference can be between 1%-30% or any range or value therebetween (e.g., 1%, 5%, 10%, 30%, etc.), but can alternatively be greater than 30% or less than 1%. For example, a milk analog can have a protein percentage of about 3.5% by weight or volume, a soft cheese (e.g., cottage cheese, brie, etc.) analog can have a protein percentage of about 8%-21% by weight, a semi-hard cheese (e.g., cheddar) analog can have a protein percentage of about 18-28% by weight, and a hard cheese (e.g., gouda) can have a protein percentage of about 24-28% or higher by weight. Alternatively, the animal product analogs can have one or more functional properties that differ (e.g., drastically; more than 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, and/or another percentile) from the target animal product.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Obtaining the protein isolate S<b>100</b> functions to obtain a high-protein starting ingredient for animal product analog production. In variants, this can enable the resultant animal product analog to have functional properties (e.g., texture, phase change behavior, nutritional profile, etc.) that are similar to a target animal product, and/or confer other benefits.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">One or more protein isolates can be obtained. When multiple protein isolates are obtained, the protein isolates can be of the same or different class (e.g., all globulins, etc.) or type (e.g., all 11S globulins, 11S globulins and 7S globulins, etc.), and/or can be from the same or different source/substrate (e.g., different protein isolates from the same plant and/or plant component; different protein isolates from different plants; etc.).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The protein isolates are preferably substantially pure (e.g., higher than 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, etc.), but can alternatively be impure (e.g., have between 2%-10%, 5%-20%, 10%-30%, and/or any other suitable range of impurities. For example, the protein isolate can have a purity higher than 70%.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The proteins within the protein isolate can be of the same or different type. The proteins within the protein isolate can include: globulins (e.g., 2S globulins, 11S globulins, 7S globulins, conglutin, napin, sfa, edestin, amandin, concanvalin, vicilin, legumin, cruciferin, helianthinin, etc.), pseudoglobulins, globular proteins, prolamins, albumins, gluten, conjugated proteins (e.g., lipoprotein, mucoprotein, etc.), other storage proteins, animal proteins (e.g., casein, insect proteins, etc.), and/or any other suitable protein or combination thereof. In a specific example, the proteins include 80% edestin proteins, 19% vicilin proteins, and 1% other proteins. The proteins preferably are non-casein proteins, non-mammalian proteins, and/or non-animal proteins, but can alternatively include casein, mammalian, and/or animal proteins. For example, the proteins can include casein, mammalian, and/or animal proteins below a threshold amount, wherein the threshold amount can be between 0.1%-10% or any range or value therebetween (e.g., 10%, 5%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.1%, etc.), but can alternatively be greater than 10% or less than 0.1%. The sedimentation coefficient of the proteins can be between 6S-13S or any range or value therebetween (e.g., 7S-9S, 10S-12S, etc.), but can alternatively be less than 6S or greater than 13S. The solution of protein isolates may contain 0%-20% impurities or any range or value therebetween (e.g., 5%-15%, 10%, etc.), but can alternatively contain greater than 20% impurities. Impurities include other proteins, macronutrients, fats, molecules, particulates, and/or any other component. The protein isolates may optionally assemble together into protein aggregates (e.g., quinary structures, assemblies of quaternary structures, etc.). The protein isolates are preferably in an aqueous solution, but can additionally or alternatively be in an ionic solution (e.g., an aqueous solution with salts), nonpolar solution, a lipid solution (e.g., oil), and/or in any other solution. The protein isolates are preferably dissolved in the solution, but can alternatively be suspended within the solution or otherwise distributed within the solution.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a first variant, the protein isolates form higher-order structures (e.g., protein-protein interactions forming agglomerates, and agglomerate-agglomerate interactions form quinary structures) wherein each higher order structure can be formed from one or more smaller protein subunits or chains. In some embodiments, a majority of the protein isolates in this variant do not form higher order structures (e.g., do not form micelles, homo-oligomers, and/or complexes) with other protein isolate units and/or higher-order structures (e.g., of the same or different type). For example, the protein isolate can include hexamers of 11s globulin units (e.g., 2 11s globulin units) which are not organized into higher order structures, or may only partially be organized into higher-order structures (e.g. quinary structures, micelles, agglomerates, complexes, or aggregates).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a second variant, the protein isolates are aggregated into quinary structures (e.g., assemblies of quaternary structures; agglomerates, complexes, aggregates, etc.). In embodiments, each higher-order structure (e.g., quinary structure) includes two or more protein subunits (e.g., quaternary structures), wherein each protein subunit itself includes two or more proteins (e.g., protein subunits; tertiary structures). Examples of quinary structures that can be formed include: micelles, homoligomers, complexes, and/or any other quinary structure, aggregate, and/or agglomerate. For example, the protein isolates can include micelles formed by two or more oligomers (e.g., hexamers of ns globulin units). In another example, the protein isolates can include micelles of a combination of ns globulin hexamers and 7s globulin trimers and/or hexamers. In another example, the protein isolates can include micelles formed by two or more us globulin oligomers (e.g., hexamers, trimers, etc.). The protein units within the higher-order structure (e.g., quinary structure) can be from a single plant protein source (e.g., exclusively sunflower seed protein isolates, exclusively hemp seed protein isolates, etc.), or multiple plant protein sources (e.g., a mixture of sunflower and rice protein isolates, etc.); include a single protein type (e.g., exclusively ns globulins) or a mixture of protein types (e.g., include both us globulins and one or more other proteins, such as 7s globulins, etc.); and/or be otherwise constructed. More than a threshold proportion of the protein isolate units in solution are preferably organized into higher-order (e.g., quinary) structures; alternatively, less than a threshold proportion of the protein isolate units in solution can be organized within a higher-order (e.g., quinary) structure. The threshold proportion of the protein isolate units can be between 20%-99% or any range or value therebetween (e.g., 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% 70%, 80%, 90%, 99%, etc.), but can alternatively be less than 20% or more than 99%. The higher-order (e.g., quinary) structures preferably only include protein units (e.g., exclude other components, such as sugars, starches, gums, fats, etc.) and optionally solvent (e.g., aqueous solution, water, etc.), but can additionally or alternatively include a threshold proportion of additional components (e.g., salts or ions, such as calcium ions; carbohydrates; vitamins; flavoring; etc.). The threshold proportion of additional components can be between 0%-40% or any range or value therebetween (e.g., less than 0.01%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, etc.), but can alternatively be greater than 40%.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">However, the protein isolates can have or be organized into any other suitable structure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The protein isolate can be: obtained from a third party (e.g., in wet form, in dry form), extracted from a substrate, assembled, and/or otherwise obtained.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a first variant, S<b>100</b> includes obtaining the protein isolate from a third party.

One or more substrates can be selected.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The substrate is preferably plant matter, but can alternatively be matter derived from insects, animals, fungi, and/or any other matter or combination thereof. Generally, the substrate may primarily include plant matter, such that the substrate may include over fifty percent plant matter. In some aspects, it may be desirable for the substrate to include over ninety-nine percent plant matter. It is feasible that the substrate includes exclusively plant matter. For instance, the substrate may include plant matter such as cocoa beans, truffles, olives, coconut flesh, grape pomace, pumpkin (e.g., pumpkin seed), cottonseed, canola, sunflower, hazelnut, pistachio, almond, walnut, crude walnut, cashew, brazil nuts, hazelnut, macadamia nuts, pecan, peanut, hemp, oat, rice, poppy, watermelon (e.g., watermelon seed), chestnut, chia, flax, <i>quinoa</i>, soybean, peas, cassava, citrus (e.g., citrus fiber), grape (e.g., grape pomace), split mung beans, aquafaba, <i>lupini</i>, fenugreek, kiwi, Sichuan pepper, mustard, sesame, sunflower seeds, algae, duckweeds (e.g., lenna); plants selected from the <i>cucurbita, anacardium, cannabis, salvia, arachis, brassica</i>, sesamun, legume, and/or other genuses; plants selected from the Anacardiaceae, Asteraceae, Leguminosae, Cucurbits, Rosaceae, Lamiaceae, and/or other family; and/or any other plant matter. The substrate may include major production oilseeds (e.g., soybean, rapeseed, sunflower, sesame, niger, castor, canola, cottonseed, etc.), minor production oilseeds (coconut, palm seed, pumpkin, etc.), and/or other crops or plant matter. The plant-derived proteins are preferably from one or more storage components of a plant (e.g., nuts, seeds, legumes, etc.), but can alternatively be derived from any other plant component (e.g., leaves, stems, roots, etc.). The substrate may include a single variety of plant matter, a mixture of various plant matter, include animal matter (e.g., insect matter, mammalian products, etc.), and/or include matter from any other source. In a first example, the substrate may include hemp and coconut flesh, such as, for instance, to include approximately 50% hemp by mass and 50% coconut flesh by mass. In a second example, the substrate may include a mixture that is 50% peas and 50% soybeans, or 30% almonds, 30% chia, and 40% lentils. However, the substrate can include any other matter.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The substrate (and/or components thereof) can optionally be selected based on the respective attributes of the substrate (and/or components thereof). The attributes may be selected for desirability in the substrate, desirability in a component of the substrate, and/or desirability in a product derived from the substrate. Examples of desirable attributes may include: cost of the substrate, nutritional content of the substrate (e.g., PDCAAS or DIAAS score), flavor of the substrate, functionalities of the substrate (e.g., functional properties, interaction with fat and/or other ingredients, etc.), appearance of the substrate (e.g., color), allergenicity of the substrate (e.g., a lower allergenicity), climate impact (e.g., carbon impact), allergenicity (e.g., wherein allergenic ingredients are excluded from the substrate mixture), and/or any other attribute. Functional properties can include: texture, mouthfeel, stretch, melt, gelation point, denaturation point, chemical properties, precipitation, emulsion stability, interactions with other molecules (e.g., dextrinization, caramelization, denaturation, coagulation, shortening, etc.), water binding capacity, stability in a given solvent, emulsion stability, foamability, whippability, flavor (or lack thereof), and/or any other properties.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Components of a substrate mixture may be selected based on the individual, cumulative, and/or complementary characteristics of the components. For example, a first component may have a characteristic with different values than the characteristic of a second component. Characteristics can include: functional properties, nutrition (e.g., macronutrient profile, micronutrient profile, etc.), and/or other characteristics. The substrate mixture is preferably selected such that the resultant animal product analog's characteristics are substantially similar to (e.g., within a predetermined margin of error, such as 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, etc.) that of the target animal product, but can alternatively be otherwise selected. In an example, characteristics may include a protein profile of the components. For instance, it may be desirable to create a substrate with a specified protein profile. The first component of a substrate mixture may be selected for having aspects of a protein profile that, when combined with the second component, wherein the second component may have a protein profile that complements the protein profile of the first component, the protein profile of the mixture may substantially match the specified protein profile. Put another way, the first component may include aspects of a desired protein profile, but may be missing certain desired proteins. The second component may be selected based on including the missing desired proteins, thus allowing the substrate mixture to have the full desired protein profile.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The substrate and/or components thereof can optionally be selected as those with the highest attribute values, based on an optimization (e.g., between nutrition, cost, extraction difficulty, etc.), based on a collective attribute profile (e.g., select complimentary substrate components that collectively produce a desired substrate nutritional profile, etc.), and/or otherwise selected. In a first example, a set of substrates and/or substrate components can be selected to collectively include all or a plurality of proteins, precursors to protein analogs, and/or amino acids within milk and/or another target protein profile. In a second example, a substrate is selected based on the globular protein content (e.g., pumpkin seeds may be selected due to high globular protein content). In an illustrative example, the substrates high in 11s globulins and/or 7s globulins can be selected for inclusion. In a third example, the addition or enrichment of lipid-binding proteins may decrease creaming. Enzymatically-treated proteins may be used that may act as hydrophobic anchors on the end, which may increase lipid affinity. Further combinations of ingredients may accomplish texture functionalities, such as milk analog stability, which may incorporate, for example, specific gelling and/or emulsifying proteins or fats that may have the effect of, for instance, creating saturated fat to create certain room temperature stability.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">However, the substrate can be otherwise selected.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The substrate can be whole (e.g., with all macronutrients and/or components intact), be sourced with a component removed from the substrate (e.g., lipid-removed, dried, etc.), and/or be sourced in any other suitable format.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a first variant, the substrate is lipid-removed, wherein a portion of oils, fats, and/or flavor compounds have been removed from the original form of the substrate (e.g., the natural form of the substrate, the whole substrate). The lipid can be removed from the whole substrate by a third party (e.g., wherein the substrate is obtained from the third party) and/or removed by any other entity. In this variant, the substrate can be: a press cake, a waste byproduct from an oilseed extraction process, and/or any other product. In this variant, the substrate can include less than: 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 1% 0.01%; between 1% and 80%, between 0% and 10%, between any of the values discussed above; and/or any other proportion lipid component by weight (e.g., dry weight, liquid weight, etc.) or volume. In an illustrative example, the substrate can include less than 30% lipid content by weight. In another illustrative example, the substrate can include less than 20% lipid content by weight. In another illustrative example, the substrate can include less than 15% lipid content by weight. In another illustrative example, the substrate can include between 6%-9% lipid content by weight. Additionally or alternatively, less than: 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 1% 0.01%; any other suitable range therein, and/or any other proportion of flavor compounds and/or aromatics can be removed from the original (whole) substrate. In variants, a lipid-removed substrate can be a desirable starting substrate, due to the relative proportions of macronutrients (e.g., proteins, fats, carbohydrates, etc.) in the lipid-removed material and/or the reduced cost of using the lipid-removed substrate, since an additional lipid-removal step can be skipped or drastically minimized. For example, the amount of protein in the lipid-removed substrate can be substantially higher (e.g., 3 times higher) than the amount of fat in the lipid-removed substrate, which can enable easier, purer, and/or higher-concentration protein extraction. One or more ingredients and/or compounds can be derived (e.g., extracted, processed, etc.) from the lipid-removed substrate. Examples of ingredients and/or compounds that can be derived from the lipid-removed substrate can include: protein extracts, carbohydrate extracts, sugar extracts, fiber extracts, flavor extracts, nutrient extracts, solid matter (e.g., powders, fibers, etc.), and/or any other suitable ingredient, extract, and/or other product.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a second variant, the substrate is whole (e.g., does not have any macronutrients extracted from the substrate).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a first embodiment, the substrate can be used in its whole form for subsequent processes.

In this embodiment, other extracts, such as fats, sugars, and/or other components can be left within the protein extract and/or removed from the protein extract (e.g., to form a protein isolate).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a third embodiment, the method can optionally include separating the whole substrate into a solid component and a liquid component S<b>150</b>, which functions separate oils from the substrate (e.g., remove or extract lipids from the substrate). S<b>150</b> can be performed prior to S<b>140</b> and/or at any other time. Separating the substrate into a solid component and a liquid component can include subjecting the substrate to mechanical processing, chemical processing, and/or any other separation processing. For instance, the substrate may be pressed, such that mechanical force is applied to the substrate. Any method of pressing may be used, such as screw pressing and compaction. The separation processing functions to extract the oils from the substrate, such that the remaining solid components of the substrate may be substantially free of oils. The solid component of the substrate may have a proportion of oil (or any fat) content that is 0%-30% or any range or value therebetween (e.g., less than 15%, less than 10%, less than 5%, etc.) by weight and/or volume, but can alternatively have a proportion of oil content that is greater than 30%.

The aqueous solution is preferably a salt water solution, but can alternatively be water (e.g., wherein salts are optionally added after dilution) and/or any other aqueous solution. The substrate can be concurrently comminuted while diluting with the aqueous solution (e.g., a press cake and water are blended together), comminuted prior to diluting in an aqueous solution, comminuted after diluting in an aqueous solution, and/or comminuted at any other time. Any specific manner of comminution may be used, including: pulverizing, blending, crushing, tumbling, crumbling, atomizing, shaving, grinding, milling, cryo-milling, chopping, and/or any other comminution method. In a specific example, comminuting a press cake substrate can create press cake particulates having a predetermined size or size distribution, which can optionally be used as a component within the reconstituted product (e.g., S<b>240</b>). Any suitable equipment for carrying out any of these processes can also be used.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Adjusting the salt concentration of the aqueous mixture can function to solubilize and/or extract proteins from the substrate, stabilize the proteins, cause the proteins to form desired tertiary, quaternary, quinary, and/or other structures, and/or confer other functionalities. Adjusting the salt concentration of the aqueous mixture can be performed prior to producing the aqueous mixture using the substrate (e.g., adjusting the salt concentration of the aqueous solution), performed after producing the aqueous mixture (e.g., adding salts to the mixture), and/or performed at any other time. Adjusting the salt concentration can include increasing or decreasing the concentration of salt in the aqueous mixture (and/or components therein) to achieve a target salt concentration. The target salt concentration can be between 0.5-25,000 millisiemens or any range or value therebetween (e.g., 1-10 millisiemens, 2-8 millisiemens, 100-10,000 millisiemens, etc.), but can alternatively be less than 0.5 millisiemens or greater than 25,000 millisiemens, 0.1%. 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.5%, and/or any other percentage of the aqueous solution and/or mixture by weight or volume; and/or have any other concentration. In an example, increasing the concentration of salt includes adding salts to the aqueous mixture (e.g., adding salts to the aqueous solution prior to diluting the substrate with the aqueous solution, adding salts to the aqueous mixture, etc.). Examples of salts include: NaCl, calcium citrate, CaCl<sub>2</sub>), sodium citrate, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, salts with cations (e.g., divalent cations, such as calcium), and/or any other salt. The ionic strength of the aqueous mixture may be selected based upon the desired yield or functional properties of the desired protein isolate, which can be substrate specific. For example, when producing a fava bean protein isolate, it may be desirable to use an aqueous solution with an ionic strength of approximately 0.5M NaCl during protein isolate extraction, while it may be desirable to use an ionic strength of approximately 0.9M NaCl when producing a pumpkin seed isolate. However, the salt concentration can be otherwise adjusted.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Adjusting the pH level of the aqueous mixture can function to solubilize or extract proteins from the substrate, stabilize the proteins, cause the proteins to form desired tertiary, quaternary, and/or other structures, and/or confer any other functionality.

Adjusting the pH level can include adding one or more acids and/or bases to bring the pH of the aqueous mixture (and/or components therein) to a target pH. Examples of acids and bases that can be used include: HCl, NaOH, citric acid, lactic acid, gluconic acid, and/or any food-safe (e.g., at relevant quantities) acid and/or base. The target pH is preferably basic (e.g., greater than 7, greater than 8, greater than 9, etc.), but can alternatively be acidic and/or neutral. For example, the target pH can be between 4-11.5 or any range or value therebetween (e.g., 7-10, 8-9, 9-10, 9.4-9.6, etc.), but can alternatively be less than 4 or greater than 11.5. For example, the pH level of the aqueous mixture may be adjusted to approximately 9.5 by adding to the aqueous mixture (or any component thereof) any number of bases that are known to increase the alkalinity of a substance, such as a sodium hydroxide solution. However, the pH level can be otherwise adjusted.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Collecting protein isolates from the aqueous mixture functions to obtain proteins having a predetermined structure and/or purity. Collecting the protein isolates can include: separating non-soluble mixture components (e.g., proteins, fats, cellular debris, etc.) from the aqueous mixture and collecting soluble protein isolates within the aqueous phase. However, the protein isolates can be otherwise collected from the aqueous mixture.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In a first example, separating non-soluble mixture components from the aqueous mixture includes centrifuging the aqueous mixture to separate the aqueous mixture into soluble and insoluble components, wherein each of the soluble and insoluble components may include the macromolecule components of the aqueous mixture (e.g., nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, etc.). In a second example, separating non-soluble mixture components includes filtering the mixture (e.g., using a mesh colander). In other examples, separating non-soluble mixture components includes decanting, drying, allowing sedimentation to occur, chilling, and/or any other separation method.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The soluble components in the aqueous phase (e.g., the supernatant) may then be selected from the aqueous mixture, wherein the aqueous phase solution may be a liquid, such as water, with protein isolates (e.g., soluble protein isolates) and/or protein isolate precursors. Collecting the soluble protein isolates can include: collecting the aqueous phase, retaining the aqueous phase, and/or otherwise treating the aqueous phase. The protein concentration (by weight) of the aqueous phase can be between 1%-50% or any range or value therebetween (e.g., 3%-10%, 5%-40%, 10%-15%, 15%-25%, etc.). Alternatively, the protein concentration can be less than 1% or greater than 50%. In variants, the soluble protein isolates within the aqueous phase can be collected without an additional fat removal step (e.g., wherein the aqueous phase is not chilled to assemble the lipids in solution). In embodiments, this can be accomplished by extracting the protein isolate from a lipid-removed or lipid-reduced substrate. Alternatively, the aqueous phase can be repeatedly treated (e.g., chilled, filtered, reacted, etc.) to remove one or more components (e.g., proteins, fats, starches, etc.). In an illustrative example of the alternative, the aqueous phase can be repeatedly chilled for fat removal (e.g., as disclosed in CA2244398, incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference).

Examples of higher-order protein structures that can be formed include: quaternary structures (e.g., hexamers, trimers, octamers, etc.), quinary structures, other higher-order structures (e.g., senary, septenary, octonary, nonary, denary, etc.), oligomers, homoligomers, complexes, and/or any other higher-order protein structure. For example, S<b>160</b> can form micelles of 11S globulin hexamers, wherein the 11S globulin hexamers can be extracted from the substrate in S<b>140</b>. As used herein, each successive higher-order protein structure can include assemblies, aggregates, agglomerates, and/or associations of multiple protein subunits of the preceding order, or can be otherwise defined. For example, a quinary structure can be or include an agglomeration, assembly, or association of several quaternary structures in a closely packed arrangement, wherein each quinary structure subunit can have its own primary, secondary, tertiary, and/or quaternary structure. The quinary subunits can be held together by hydrogen bonds, London dispersion forces, van der Waals forces, and/or any other suitable chemical bond. However, the quinary structure can be otherwise defined.

The assemblies can be agglomerates, aggregates, higher-order structures, and/or any other suitable association between protein units. When multiple protein isolates are used, the protein isolates can be from a single substrate (e.g., single plant source), multiple substrates (e.g., multiple plant sources, multiple forms of a single plant source, etc.), and/or any other combination of substrates. For example, a first protein isolate solution and a second protein isolate solution (e.g., produced from a different substrate through a process optimized for the different substrate) may be combined. The combined protein isolate solution may then be used to form the protein assemblies. For instance, one or more protein isolate solutions may be combined prior to forming the protein assemblies to form protein assemblies with unique compositions. Alternatively, isolated protein assemblies formed from different protein isolate solutions may be combined after or during protein assembly formation to create mixed populations of protein assemblies. A combination of protein isolate solutions may be selected based on complementary characteristics of the protein isolate solutions. For instance, it may be desirable to form a protein assembly that includes a specified protein profile (e.g., size, denaturation points, surface hydrophobicity, lipid binding, etc.). This may be a protein profile that is present in a dairy milk and/or other dairy product, a target protein profile (e.g., a 50/50, 40/60, 30/70, 20/80, 10/90, 5/95, 95/5, 90/10, 80/20, 70/30, 60/40, and/or any other ratio between a first and second protein isolate), and/or any other protein profile. Alternatively, a specific protein profile may be found to have benefits in the assembly formation process distinct from that found in dairy. The protein isolate solution is preferably substantially pure protein, but can additionally or alternatively include impurities (e.g., fats, salts, starches, sugars, etc.), additives (e.g., fats, salts, starches, sugars, flavoring, etc.), and/or any other suitable component. In a first example, the combined protein isolate solution can include 11S globulins from a first and second substrate (e.g., pumpkin seed and hemp seed) in an approximately 50/50 ratio. In a second example, the combined protein isolate solution can include globulins (e.g., 11S globulins) and sugars.

In an example, this can form micelles (e.g., assemblies; higher-order protein structures) of protein oligomers. In an illustrative example, rapid dilution can cause proteins to aggregate and/or assemble into micelles by rapidly changing the isoelectric environment surrounding each protein (e.g., wherein the micelle structure is maintained by inter-protein and/or inter-protein oligomer interactions, such as ionic bonds, van der Waals bonds, hydrogen bonds, etc.; and/or by differences between the interior and exterior isoelectric points). Alternatively, dilution can cause protein aggregation or assembly into a micellar structure via any other suitable mechanism.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Diluting the protein isolates preferably includes using an aqueous solution, such as water (e.g., deionized water), to dilute the protein isolates, but can alternatively use organic and/or inorganic solvents (e.g., alcohol) to dilute the protein isolates. The protein isolate is preferably diluted to a target concentration rapidly (e.g., immediately; all of the solvent is added to the protein isolate solution at once), but can alternatively be diluted incrementally or at any other rate.

While sedimentation is occurring, the diluted protein isolate may be maintained at a temperature of &#x2212;80&#xb0; C.-30&#xb0; C. or any range or value therebetween (e.g., 0&#xb0; C.-12&#xb0; C., 4&#xb0; C., room temperature, etc.), but can alternatively be maintained at a temperature less than &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. or greater than 30&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In a second variant, concentrating the diluted protein isolates includes centrifuging the diluted protein isolate solution. For example, the diluted protein isolate solution can be centrifuged for 1 minute-1 hour or any range or value therebetween (e.g., 10 minutes-30 minutes, 20 minutes, etc.), but can alternatively be centrifuged for less than 1 minute or greater than 1 hour. Centrifugation can occur at 300 rpm-15000 rpm or any range or value therebetween (e.g., 5000 rpm), but can alternatively be centrifuged at less than 300 rpm or greater than 15000 rpm.

In this variant, the pellet is collected after centrifugation, wherein the pellet includes the protein assemblies.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The resulting protein assembly (e.g., after concentration) can be a solid, a liquid (e.g., a viscous liquid), a gel (e.g., pre- or post-heating), and/or any other mixture type. Optionally, the protein assemblies can be diluted (e.g., diluted with water, any aqueous solution, oil, etc.). Dilution can function to achieve a desired protein concentration, a desired protein assembly solution consistency, a desired salt concentration (e.g., wherein the protein assembly solution can be diluted with water and subsequently reconcentrated to reduce salt in the protein assembly solution), and/or for any other function for downstream use.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In an example, the protein assemblies can be formed using the method disclosed in CA 2,244,398, which is incorporated in its entirety by this reference.

The protein assemblies can include a set of protein oligomers (e.g., tertiary protein structures) arranged into a sphere (e.g., a micelle), but can alternatively have any other structure. The protein oligomers are preferably hexamers, but can alternatively be dimers, trimers, tetramers, pentamers, and/or any other oligomer. The diameter of the protein oligomers can be between 10 nm-200 nm or any range or value therebetween (e.g., 20 nm-100 m, 40 nm, etc.), but can alternatively be less than 10 nm and/or greater than 200 nm.

In a first variant, the protein assemblies are micelles with a first face that is hydrophilic and a second face that is hydrophobic. For example, the micelles may have an external face, wherein the external face is in contact with the solution in which the micelle is suspended, and an internal face, wherein the internal face is substantially opposed to the external face. In a first example, the external face of the micelle may be hydrophilic and the internal face of the micelle may be hydrophobic. In a second example, the external face of the micelle may be hydrophobic and the internal face of the micelle may be hydrophilic, such that the micelle may be a &#x201c;reverse micelle.&#x201d; In a second variant, the protein oligomers within the protein assemblies (e.g., higher-order structure; quinary structure; etc.) have polar (hydrophilic) regions between the protein oligomers (e.g., such that the interaction between two protein oligomers includes interactions between a negative charge region on one oligomer and a positive charge region on the other oligomer). In this variant, the regions of the oligomers on the external and/or interface face of the micelle may be more nonpolar (e.g., more hydrophobic) than the regions between oligomers, but can alternatively be less polar. In a third variant, the protein oligomers within the protein assemblies (e.g., higher-order structure; quinary structure; etc.) have nonpolar (hydrophobic) regions between the protein oligomers (e.g., such that the interaction between two protein oligomers includes interactions between nonpolar regions of the two oligomers). In this variant, the regions of the oligomers on the external and/or interface face of the micelle may be more polar (e.g., more hydrophilic) than the regions between oligomers, but can alternatively be less polar. In a fourth variant, the orientation of protein oligomers within the protein assemblies (e.g., higher-order structure; quinary structure; etc.) may change depending on the surrounding environment. In a first example, the protein assembly is a reverse micelle when substantially surrounded by oil, and a standard micelle when substantially surrounded by water. In a second example, the protein oligomers may be oriented with hydrophobic regions positioned between neighboring oligomers (within the protein assembly) when the protein assembly is immersed in water, and the protein oligomers may be oriented with hydrophobic regions positioned towards the internal and/or external face of the protein assembly when a fatty component is introduced.

For example, the addition of a fatty component may increase protein/lipid associations of certain hydrophobic protein domains, resulting in a more stable colloidal solution. Additionally, the addition of components can optionally change the size of the protein assemblies (e.g., a lipid/protein assembly) and/or the net surface charge of the protein assembly (e.g., by varying salt concentrations or pH). Such changes may include the size of the protein assembly spheres, the number of protein oligomers within a protein assembly, the temperature stability of the protein assemblies, the interactions within and between protein assemblies, nutritional availability, digestibility of the proteins within the protein assemblies, and/or any other protein assembly property.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The protein assembly solution (e.g., example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) or product produced therefrom (e.g., emulsion, curd, etc.) can be analyzed using any texture analysis technique (e.g., rheology, extension, etc.). In a first example, rheological measurements may measure viscoelastic properties of the protein assembly solution.

A texture profile analysis (&#x201c;TPA&#x201d;) test may include two compression cycles on the protein assembly solution or product produced therefrom. The TPA test may quantify stiffness, compression strength, gumminess, springiness, and cohesiveness of the cheese product. Example TPA data is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.

Additionally, the DSC may quantify the energy of phase transitions and measure onset melting temperature, peak melting temperature, net melting energy, and thermal hysteresis of a melting event. The temperature sweep assay may also indicate a gelation/denaturation point for the protein assembly solution and/or can precisely measure the energy, in the form of heat, of chemical reactions (e.g., namely protein and starch gelation). At elevated temperatures, the DSC may quantify and differentiate between protein denaturation (which demands energy) and gelation (which releases energy).

Examples of comminution methods include: pulverizing, blending, crushing, tumbling, crumbling, atomizing, shaving, grinding, milling, cryo-milling, chopping, and/or any other method. Homogenization (e.g., to form an emulsion between the protein assembly solution and the fatty component) can include using a rotor stator system and/or any other homogenizer device. The resultant emulsion can have an aqueous continuous phase with fatty droplets, and/or be otherwise structured. When protein isolates and/or protein assemblies are used, the protein isolates and/or protein assemblies are preferably primarily in the aqueous continuous phase (e.g., more than 50%, 60-%, 70%, 80%. 90%, etc. of the protein isolates and/or protein assemblies are in the aqueous phase), but can alternatively be primarily in the fatty droplets. The homogenizer device preferably imparts a shear force below a threshold (e.g., to not break up protein structures in the protein solution), but can alternatively impart any shear force. In an example, a rotor stator system can used at an rpm between 1,000 rpm-50,000 rpm or any range or value therebetween (e.g., 5,000 rpm-15,000 rpm, 10,000 rpm, etc.), but can alternatively be used at less than 1,000 rpm or greater than 50,000 rpm. The rotor stator system can used for 10 seconds-1 hour or any range or value therebetween (e.g., 30 seconds-5 minutes, 1 minute, etc.), but can alternatively be used for less than 10 seconds or greater than 1 hour. However, a rotor station system can be used at any other rpm and for any amount of time. The reconstituted product can be a slurry, cake, liquid, viscous liquid, emulsion, suspension, precipitate, and/or any other product.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Components can be combined concurrently and/or asynchronously. In a first example, the protein assembly solution and the fatty component are homogenized to form an emulsion, wherein additional ingredients are subsequently added to the emulsion (e.g., such that the resulting reconstituted product can function as a milk analog). In a second example, a press cake may be soaked in a liquid (e.g., water, salt water, etc.), wherein an industrial homogenizer may be used to blend the soaked press cake with the fatty component. The protein assemblies may then be added to the homogenized mixture using a second homogenization step. In a fourth example, the protein assembly solution, the fatty component, and/or additional ingredients are concurrently homogenized using a single homogenization step to form the reconstituted product. Optionally, the fatty component can be heated prior to and/or during combination. Heating the fatty component can optionally transition the fatty component from a solid to a liquid, which can facilitate homogenization. The fatty component is preferably heated below a threshold temperature (e.g., 85&#xb0; C.) such that proteins in the protein assembly solution do not denature, but can alternatively be heated to any temperature. For example, the fatty component can be heated to a temperature between 25&#xb0; C.-100&#xb0; C. or any range or value therebetween (e.g., less than 85&#xb0; C., 30-50&#xb0; C., 40&#xb0; C., etc.), but can alternatively be less than 25&#xb0; C. or greater than 100&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In variants, the plant-based milk can be manufactured by producing the reconstituted product, then diluting the reconstituted product with a liquid or other thinner. This can be particularly useful when the reconstituted product is gel-like or has a viscosity higher than a predetermined threshold (e.g., more than 2.0 cp, 1.0 cp, etc.; more than 1.02-1.05 specific gravity at 16&#xb0; C., etc.), which can result when a fat (e.g., solid at room temperature) and/or the protein assemblies are used; and/or when other conditions are met. Diluting the reconstituted product can include: combining the reconstituted product with a liquid (e.g., producing a slurry from the reconstituted product, etc.). The liquid can be water, a salt solution, a sodium hydroxide solution, and/or any other liquid. The ratio of reconstituted product-to-liquid may be variable depending on the purposes of the animal product analog, such that a higher ratio of reconstituted product-to-liquid may produce a more viscous dairy analog and a lower ratio of reconstituted product-to-liquid may produce a less viscous dairy analog. The mixture of the reconstituted product and liquid may be homogenized, mixed, comminuted (e.g., until the mixture has reached the desired consistency of the slurry), and/or otherwise combined. Examples of comminution methods include: pulverizing, blending, crushing, tumbling, crumbling, atomizing, shaving, grinding, milling, cryo-milling, chopping, and/or any other method. Any suitable equipment for carrying out any of these processes can also be used. In some embodiments, at least blending is used. For example, the mixture may be blended until the dairy analog (e.g., the slurry) is substantially in liquid form, although there may still be particulates remaining. Solid masses may be filtered or separated out by any of known means, leaving the remaining liquid as a milk analog. Alternatively, or additionally, the solid masses may be further blended, the dairy analog may be further blended, the solid masses may be left in the dairy analog, and/or solid masses may not be present in the dairy analog (e.g., when the reconstituted product does not include solid masses). An aspect of the present disclosure may be directed towards a milk analog produced from a reconstituted product, such as the milk analog as produced by the preceding process.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">However, the plant-based milk can be otherwise formed.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The method can optionally include processing the plant-based milk S<b>260</b>, which functions to: produce a downstream animal product analog (e.g., a plant-based cheese analog) and/or an intermediate product to the downstream product (e.g., a cheese curd analog), to prime the plant-based milk for making the downstream product, to preserve the plant-based milk, and/or for any other purpose. Processing the animal product analog can include: adjusting the pH level, adjusting the temperature, adding microbial cultures and/or other ingredients, emulsifying the animal product analog, curdling (e.g., gelling) the animal product analog, obtaining curds from the animal product analog, processing curds from the animal product analog, and/or any other processing step. Processing methods can be performed in any order and performed any number of times.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In a specific example, the animal product analog can be processed to produce a cheese in the same way a dairy product (e.g., non-analog product) would be processed to produce a cheese. For example, additional ingredients (added to the plant milk during S<b>260</b>) can be selected to be the same as or as close to the target animal product. For example, blue cheese microbial cultures that are used to make dairy-based blue cheese can be selected for inclusion in the reconstituted product (e.g., to make a plant-based blue cheese analog). In another example, all ingredients and processes can be the same as dairy-based food product manufacture, except that the dairy milk is replaced with the reconstituted product (e.g., the plant milk). However, the additional ingredients and/or process steps can be otherwise selected.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Adjusting the pH level of the animal product analog can include determining an initial pH (e.g., via measuring, calculating and/or estimating based on dairy analog formulation, etc.), comparing the pH to a target pH, and adjusting the pH based on the comparison. This can function to induce curdling in the plant-based milk, to prepare the plant-based milk for downstream processes (e.g., create a more favorable environment for inoculation with a microbial culture), and/or performed for other purposes. In a first variant, adjusting the pH includes raising pH (e.g., prior to curdling). In an example, the pH can be raised to a target pH (e.g., 7 to 14, 8 to 12, 9 to 10, not lower than 6, not higher than 14, etc.) by adding one or more bases (e.g., a solution containing sodium hydroxide). In a second variant, adjusting the pH includes lowering the pH (e.g., to induce curdling). In an example, the pH can be lowered to a target curdling pH (e.g., 3.5 to 5.5, 4 to 5, 4.5 to 4.75, not lower than 3, not higher than 7, etc.) by adding one or more acids (e.g., a solution containing sodium hydroxide). In a third variant, adjusting the pH includes raising the pH and lowering the pH (e.g., in any order). However, the pH level of the diary analog can be otherwise adjusted.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Adjusting the temperature of the animal product analog preferably includes heating the animal product analog (e.g., to the denaturation point of the protein isolates and/or protein aggregates, to under the denaturation point, etc.), but can alternatively include cooling the animal product analog (e.g., heating followed by cooling, blanching, etc.). The adjusted temperature and/or the amount of time the adjusted temperature is maintained can be selected based on a microbial culture (e.g., a culture already added to the dairy analog, a culture which will be added to the dairy analog, etc.). In examples, the adjusted temperature can be: 0-200 degrees Fahrenheit, 85-120 degrees Fahrenheit, 100-130 degrees Fahrenheit, 72 degrees Fahrenheit, 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit, above 25&#xb0; C., 30&#xb0; C., 40&#xb0; C., 50&#xb0; C., and/or above any other temperature, below 25&#xb0; C., 30&#xb0; C., 40&#xb0; C. (e.g., below 32&#xb0; C.), 50&#xb0; C., and/or below any other temperature, and/or be any other temperature. However, the temperature of the diary analog can be otherwise adjusted. The temperature of the animal product analog can be adjusted and/or held: after pH adjustment, during and/or after inoculation (e.g., held in a bath for the inoculation time period), and/or at any other point in time.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Adding microbial cultures to the animal product analog (e.g., the dairy analog) can optionally include steeping the animal product analog in one or more cultures (e.g., where the animal product analog rests at a target temperature after the cultures are added). The cultures can include cultures for cheeses such as blue, camembert, cheddar, alpine, parmesan, swiss, and/or any other microbial culture and/or combination thereof. Examples of microbial cultures that can be used include: cheese cultures (e.g., cheese starter cultures), yogurt cultures, wine cultures, beer cultures, and/or any other microbial culture.

The steeping time can be 30 minutes to 2.5 hours and/or any other steeping time. Steeping can be terminated when the dairy analog has thickened above a threshold (e.g., as determined by a viscosity measurement, viscoelastic property analysis, etc.).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Curdling the animal product analog (e.g., the dairy analog) is preferably performed after microbial culture addition, but can alternatively be performed at any other time. Curds can be any substantially solid and/or semi-solid formation (e.g., a gel). Curds can be formed by: acid-induced curdling (e.g., acidification), salt-induced curdling, heating, fermentation, emulsification, and/or using any other method. In a first variant, curdling the dairy analog can include adding a salt mix to the dairy analog. In an illustrative example, a solution including approximately 0.5 g of CaCl<sub>2</sub>) and approximately 3 g MgCl<sub>2 </sub>may be combined with approximately 5 mL of water to create the salt mix. In a second variant, curdling the dairy analog can include adding an acid mix to the dairy analog. In an illustrative example, a ratio of approximately 2 g of citric acid may be added to 5 mL of water to create the acid mix. In a third variant, curdling the dairy analog can include adding enzymes to the dairy analog. In an example, the enzymes that can be used include: transglutaminase, chymosin, tyrosinase, rennet enzymes and/or rennet-type enzymes (e.g., from animal sources, plant-based sources, microbial sources, etc.), and/or any other suitable enzyme. In a fourth variant, curdling the dairy analog can include adjusting the temperature of the dairy analog (e.g., heating the dairy analog to a target temperature for a target period of time). In a fifth variant, curdling the dairy analog can include any combination of adding salt, adding acid, adding enzymes, adjusting the temperature, and/or any other processing step (e.g., in any order). However, curdling the dairy analog can be otherwise performed. The acidified mixture can optionally be incubated at above room temperature, above 30&#xb0; C. above 40&#xb0; C., above 50&#xb0; C., above, below, at, or near the denaturation point of the protein, at a temperature favorable to the microbial culture, and/or at any other suitable temperature.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Obtaining curds from the dairy analog (e.g., isolating curds, collecting curds, etc.) can function to isolate the curds for further processing. This preferably occurs after the dairy analog curdles to form a substantially solid portion (e.g., curds) and a substantially liquid portion (e.g., whey), but can alternatively be performed at any other time. Separating the curds can include pouring the dairy analog through a filter and/or strain to capture the curds. However, separating the curds can be otherwise performed.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Processing curds from the dairy analog can function to produce a cheese analog, a dairy food product analog, and/or any other food product. Processing the curds can be performed after separating the curds from the dairy analog, prior to separating the curds from the dairy analog, and/or at any other time. Processing can include: pressing the curds (e.g., to a target moisture content), cutting the curds, cheddaring, salting the curds, adjusting the temperature of the curds (e.g., incubation at a target temperature and for target period of time), shaping the curds, aging the curds, and/or any other processing method. Cutting the curds can be performed prior to separating the curds from the dairy analog (e.g., to increase further whey drainage from the curds) and/or after separating the curds from the dairy analog. Aging (e.g., including ripening, fermenting, affinage, etc.) can be for a target period of time (e.g., optimal aging time for a target flavor profile, texture profile, etc.) and/or at one or more target temperatures (e.g., optimal for microbes in the curds). However, the curds can be otherwise processed.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">However, the dairy analog can be otherwise processed.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">A first example includes an animal product analog made from one or more ingredients extracted from a waste product of edible oil production (e.g., a press cake; an oilseed press cake; etc.). In this example, the waste product can be used without an additional lipid extraction step before use as an ingredient in a plant-based food; alternatively, the waste product can be additionally post-processed (e.g., to remove remaining fats, off-flavors, etc.). Examples of ingredients that can be derived from the waste product include: proteins, polysaccharides, flavors, small molecules, carbohydrates, waste product solids (e.g., powders, fibers, etc.), other macromolecules (e.g., cellulose, starch, nucleic acids, etc.), macronutrients, micronutrients, and/or any other suitable ingredient or derivative product. Examples of the animal product analog that can be made include: milk, dairy products (e.g., cheese, cream cheese, yogurt, etc.), tissue replicas (e.g., wherein the proteins can be formed into a matrix by gelling, crosslinking, or otherwise treated), egg products (e.g., powdered egg, scrambled egg, etc.), and/or any other suitable animal product analog. In variants, the protein extract can be assembled into micelles, wherein the micelles are used as an ingredient in the plant-based dairy analog. Alternatively, the protein extract can be used without higher-order protein assembly (e.g., agglomeration, aggregation, micellarization, etc.). The micelles can be higher-order (e.g., quinary) protein structures formed from multiple protein oligomers (e.g., globulin hexamers; 11S globulin hexamers; etc.), or have any other structure (e.g., include a lipid exterior, encapsulating proteins therein; etc.). The protein oligomers can self-aggregate into the micellar structure under certain conditions (e.g., rapid dilution), and/or be otherwise created. In an example, the protein micelle can have a diameter between 50 nm and 800 nm (e.g., between 100 nm and 300 nm).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">A second example includes a plant-based milk made from protein assemblies (e.g., micelles; micellar protein isolates (MPIs)). The protein assemblies can be substantially pure protein (e.g., exclude substantial amounts of lipids, salts, etc.), and optionally include an aqueous solution. The protein assemblies can be higher-order (e.g., quinary) protein structures formed from multiple protein oligomers (e.g., globulin hexamers; 11S globulin hexamers; etc.; wherein the protein oligomers can self-aggregate into the protein structure; etc.), or have any other structure (e.g., include a lipid exterior, encapsulating proteins therein; etc.). In variants, the protein assemblies can be mixed (e.g., emulsified) with a lipid component, wherein the lipid component is in the dispersed phase and an aqueous solution is in the continuous phase; the protein assemblies are preferably within the aqueous solution/continuous phase (e.g., primarily), but can additionally or alternatively be within the lipid component. The plant-based milk can additionally or alternatively include other ingredients, such as plant solids (e.g., protein powder, fiber, etc.), salts, sugars, and/or other ingredients.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">A third example includes a plant-based dairy product made from protein assemblies (e.g., micelles; micellar protein isolates). The plant-based dairy product is preferably manufactured using the plant-based milk described in the second illustrative example, but can additionally or alternatively use any other suitable ingredient. In an example, the plant-based dairy product is manufactured using one or more standard dairy product manufacturing techniques (e.g., the entirety of a standard dairy manufacturing process, one or more steps from a standard dairy manufacturing process, etc.), while replacing dairy milk with the plant-based milk. In a second example, the plant-based dairy product is manufactured using the plant-based milk, using different techniques to achieve comparable intermediary and/or final products (e.g., comparable as measured by similarity across a predetermined set of functional properties). In an illustrative example, when making a plant-based cheese, the plant-based milk can be cultured (e.g., inoculated) with microbial cultures before heating and/or curdling. In a second illustrative example, when making a plant-based cheese, curdling in the plant-based milk can be induced by acidification (e.g., using salts and/or acids) instead of or in addition to heating.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">However, the plant-based food product can be otherwise made with any other set of ingredients, and have any other composition.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers and expressions, such as those expressing dimensions, physical characteristics, etc., used in the specification (other than the claims) are understood as modified in all instances by the term &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; or &#x201c;about&#x201d;.
