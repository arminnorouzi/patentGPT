Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Nowadays, various types of display devices, such as liquid crystal display devices and organic light emitting display devices, are being developed. Various display technologies and convergence technologies are also being developed to meet various user needs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, there have been gradually under development transparent display devices through which light may be transmitted to allow the background to be seen have gradually for various applications. As another example, in addition to the function of displaying an image or video, touch-based input functions that allow the user to easily and intuitively and conveniently input information or a command have been developed.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To provide touch-based entry in a transparent touch display device, the transparent touch display device may require that touch sensor configurations including touch electrodes and touch routing wires be formed on the panel. However, such touch sensor configurations may degrade the transmittance of the transparent touch display device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To secure transmittance in the transparent touch display device, a reduction in the area of the touch sensor inevitably ensue, lowering the capacitance for touch sensing and resultantly degrading touch sensitivity. Therefore, a benefit exists for development of a transparent touch display device capable of providing high touch sensitivity as well as high transmittance.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the disclosure may provide a transparent touch display device having high transmittance and high touch sensitivity.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the disclosure may provide a transparent touch display device having a structure capable of increasing the area of the touch sensor without reducing the area of the transmissive areas.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to embodiments of the disclosure, there may be provided a transparent touch display device, comprising a substrate including a display area displaying an image and a non-display area not displaying the image, the display area including a plurality of light emitting areas and a plurality of transmissive areas, a first pixel electrode disposed in a first light emitting area of a first subpixel among the plurality of light emitting areas, a first light emitting layer on the first pixel electrode, a second pixel electrode disposed in a second light emitting area of a second subpixel positioned in a first direction with respect to the first light emitting area, a second light emitting layer on the second pixel electrode, a first touch sensor metal disposed while avoiding the first light emitting area, a second touch sensor metal disposed while avoiding the second light emitting area, and a transparent electrode disposed in a first transmissive area positioned between the first light emitting area and the second light emitting area and electrically connected with at least one of the first touch sensor metal and the second touch sensor metal.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the first transmissive area, the touch buffer film may include an opening.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The transparent touch display device may further comprise a common electrode disposed between the first light emitting layer and the encapsulation layer in the first light emitting area and between the second light emitting layer and the encapsulation layer in the second light emitting area.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The common electrode may have an opening in the first transmissive area positioned between the first light emitting area and the second light emitting area.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The transparent touch display device may further comprise a floating metal disposed in the opening of the common electrode and electrically disconnected from the common electrode.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The floating metal may include a same material as the common electrode.
