The translucent panels may have various levels of transparency depending, for example, on whether decorative or privacy effects are desired. A sealed space of air or inert gas is formed within the insulating translucent panel assembly and helps maintain the temperature difference between the interior side of the barrier and the exterior side of the barrier. Developments in the field of insulating translucent barriers for the past thirty years have included the spacers used to hold the parallel panels of glass or plastic in spaced apart relation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Early spacers were formed from hollow metal bars filled with a desiccant material that would keep the sealed space within the insulating translucent barrier dry. The high thermal conductivity between panels of glass or plastic led to misting or fogging problems in extreme weather conditions, and this led to improved spacers. Some spacers combined a desiccant foam material with a moisture barrier to remove most of the thermal conduction between the panels of glass or plastic at the glazing edge zone.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The sealing ability of spacers is crucial to reducing the misting or fogging problems noted previously and maintaining the insulating gas between the panels. However, known manufacturing methods are not conducive to consistently providing spacers that have exact measurements. For example, conventional methods for manufacturing spacers conventionally begin with an extrusion process in which dies are designed to extrude a spacer of specific width dimensions, for example &#xbd; inch or &#x215d; inch. However, the extrusion process is not always exact and the industry standard allows for up to 5% tolerance in dimension variance. Furthermore, downstream processes, such as the application of a vapor barrier and/or curing, can create still greater alterations in the shape and dimensions of the extruded material. The slightest change in the spacer dimensions, even those spacers manufactured within but at the higher end of the 5% tolerance allowance, can be detrimental to the final sealing capability of the spacer. Therefore, it is desirable to improve the manufacturing method and systems to maintain tighter tolerances in the manufacturing of spacers and to simplify the process and reduce overall expense.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, when a changeover of process is necessary, such as when the manufacture of a different size or type of spacer is desired, the entire manufacturing process must be stopped and the extrusion die changed out before manufacturing continues. The process of stopping the extrusion and changing out the die are time consuming and greatly decrease productivity. Thus, it would be desirable to have a system that can be easily switched between spacer types when a different size is desired.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In various embodiments, the invention provides a spacer and method of producing a flexible thermoset polymer spacer body; without the use of a traditional energy intensive extrusion, heat curing, and heat baking process; by using a two component polymer; one component carrying a desiccant powder, and the other component being the catalyst for cure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment, the invention provides a system for manufacturing an insulating spacer for assembling spaced apart translucent panels and forming an insulated panel assembly.

a production or manufacturing line for a spacer constructed in accordance with one illustrative embodiment of the invention. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, one embodiment of an insulating translucent panel assembly <b>10</b> includes first and second translucent panels <b>12</b> positioned in a parallel and spaced-apart relation to each other. The translucent panels <b>12</b> can be conventional sheets of glass or plastic as typically used in residential or commercial windows and door lites. Although the translucent panels <b>12</b> shown are rectangular, one skilled in the art will realize the shape and other dimensional or design characteristics of the translucent panels can be modified without departing from the inventive scope. Also, more than two panels <b>12</b> may be used. Further exemplary or illustrative details for the manufacturing of insulating translucent panel assemblies are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/892,087, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. The translucent panels <b>12</b> comprise a periphery or outer edges <b>14</b> to be sealed together. The insulating translucent panel assembly <b>10</b> includes a spacer <b>16</b> applied to the periphery of the translucent panels <b>12</b> by thin layers of adhesive <b>17</b>. The translucent panels <b>12</b> and the spacer <b>16</b> then form a sealed space <b>18</b> containing air or inert gas between the translucent panels <b>12</b>. This sealed space <b>18</b> improves the thermal transfer properties of the insulating translucent panel assembly <b>10</b>. A secondary sealant <b>36</b> such as hot melt adhesive, may be applied as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Generally, the spacer <b>16</b> comprises an extrudate <b>22</b> and a vapor barrier <b>24</b> affixed to each other as a unitary structure or assembly. The vapor barrier <b>24</b> is shown as a flexible, corrugated thin metal, such as 304 stainless steel of about 2 mil thickness although other thicknesses, materials and configurations may be used. The corrugated design allows the vapor barrier <b>24</b> and attached extrudate <b>22</b> to bend in three dimensions for easier manipulation during manufacture of the assembly, and better sealing ability. At the location where two ends of the extrudate/vapor barrier assembly <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> come together, an extension of the corrugated vapor barrier <b>24</b> may be exposed or extended from the extrudate <b>22</b> and overlap against a vapor barrier portion which had previously been attached to the extrudate <b>22</b>. The extension (not shown) and vapor barrier portion <b>24</b> may be adhesively secured to each other using a suitable adhesive for the application needs. The extrudate <b>22</b> maintains dryness in the sealed space and isolates the sealed space from the outside atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, at an upstream end of the manufacturing line a roll of stainless steel sheet material <b>26</b> is directed into a corrugation station which comprises a pair of gears <b>28</b> that rotate very close to one another essentially in meshing engagement to form corrugations in the very thin stainless steel material <b>26</b>, to be discussed further below. The corrugations may be, for example, 1/16&#x2033;-&#x215b;&#x2033; peak-to-peak and in height. The thin stainless steel corrugated material <b>24</b> then enters a scoring station where two circular rotating blades <b>30</b> very slightly score portions of the corrugated stainless steel material <b>24</b> approximately 3/16 inch from each side lengthwise edge of the corrugated stainless material <b>24</b>. The blades <b>30</b> may be motorized to rotate in a direction opposite to the production line direction. The scored vapor barrier <b>24</b> then enters a lip forming station <b>31</b> at which the outer edge portions <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the vapor barrier <b>24</b> are turned upward at a fold line defined along the score lines previously formed by the pair of circular blades <b>30</b>. This forms the vapor barrier <b>24</b> into a tray having turned up outer lip edge portions <b>24</b><i>a </i>for receiving an extrudate pumped onto the vapor barrier at an extrusion station. The extrudate is pumped through a flat nozzle <b>32</b> from a 2K mixer/extruder (discharging a two component extrudate of a flowable mixed thermoset resin/polymer desiccant matrix material to be detailed hereinbelow). Specifically, the following nozzle may be used: 4&#x2033; LG13/4&#x2033;&#xd7;&#x215b;&#x2033; sold by Techcon Systems, Cypress, Calif. The extrudate <b>22</b> and vapor barrier <b>24</b> then travels along the production line and, if necessary, may be selectively heated by one or more IR (infrared) lamp modules <b>33</b> to maintain an optimal curing temperature.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The extrudate <b>22</b> used in this illustration is discussed and disclosed more specifically below, and has been formulated to cure at approximately room temperature, depending on the manufacturing plant location and conditions. As necessary, one or more IR (infrared) lamp modules <b>33</b> or other heating means may be used to ensure that the extrudate <b>22</b> is maintained at a consistent temperature. Finally, when the extrudate <b>22</b> has sufficiently cured, the vapor barrier <b>24</b> and extrudate <b>22</b> is directed through a cutting station <b>35</b> by a puller <b>37</b> where the outer lip portions <b>24</b><i>a </i>are cut from the central region <b>24</b><i>b </i>and one or more spacer strips <b>16</b> are formed as shown at the downstream end of the manufacturing line. Then, either along the same manufacturing line, or at another location, pressure sensitive adhesive is applied by extruders <b>39</b> to the lengthwise edge portions as further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and discussed below.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of the illustrative corrugated vapor barrier <b>24</b> material before the outer edge portions have been turned up to form lips <b>24</b><i>a </i>that will ultimately contain the extruded two part thermoset polymer <b>22</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a cross section taken along line <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The specific material used in this illustration is a very thin, for example, 2 mil thick 304 stainless steel, however, it will be appreciated that many other metallic and/or nonmetallic materials may be used instead. Nonmetallic, multilayer vapor barrier materials used for window spacers in the past may be used in various embodiments of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B, <b>3</b>C and <b>3</b>D</figref> schematically illustrate the scoring operation of the corrugated stainless steel material <b>24</b> and the subsequent lip formation at the lengthwise outer edge portions <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the vapor barrier. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, this essentially forms a shallow tray about 3/16&#x2033; deep for containing the extrudate <b>22</b>. The width of the tray may be varied, as well as the height of the lips <b>24</b><i>a</i>. The width will be chosen depending on the desired width and number of spacers <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> is a close-up end view of the operation of extruding the two-part thermoset, desiccant containing polymer material from a nozzle <b>32</b> into the vapor barrier tray <b>24</b>, <b>24</b><i>a </i>formed in the steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B through <b>3</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref> schematically illustrates the cured state of the extrudate <b>22</b> which has filled the tray <b>24</b>, <b>24</b><i>a </i>to a consistent, essentially flat level and, in dash-dot lines, the use of infrared heat from one or more IR (infrared) lamp module <b>33</b> is shown to optionally maintain the temperature along these portions of the production line consistent, for example at approximately 80&#xb0; F.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>G-<b>3</b>I</figref> schematically illustrate the process of cutting the extrudate filled tray lengthwise to, 1) cut off the turned up lip portions <b>24</b><i>a </i>at the lengthwise outer edges, and 2) form the interior sections into two spacer strips <b>16</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>I</figref>.

This adhesive <b>17</b> is preferably a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA), such as a conventional adhesive formed from an acrylic material, or a butyl based compound in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention as further disclosed below. When using a butyl based PSA, the edges of the corrugated stainless steel vapor barrier <b>24</b> must be fully covered by the PSA to hermetically seal the stainless steel to the glazing layers <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>L</figref> is a perspective view showing a subsequent step of applying a peel away protective backing <b>34</b>. It will be, perhaps, most efficient to use a single peel away backing <b>34</b> having a width great enough to extend along one side edge portion, thereby covering the adhesive <b>17</b> on one side, and then extending across the top of the spacer <b>16</b> and over the opposite side edge portion and the adhesive <b>17</b> on that side edge. Alternatively, separate peel away backing strips (not shown) may be applied along each side edge portion to protect and cover the pressure sensitive adhesive strips <b>17</b> separately.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As discussed, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of a pair of translucent panels <b>12</b>, such as for a window, in perspective and illustrating use of a window spacer <b>16</b> constructed in accordance with the present invention along peripheral edges thereof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross sectional view taken along line <b>5</b>-<b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and showing a spacer <b>16</b> as previously shown and described adhesive secured between the pair of spaced apart translucent or even transparent panels <b>12</b>.

More specifically, the scoring and lip forming stations are part of an assembly having vertical adjustment means to allow a desired amount of vertical adjustment to be made to the scoring blades <b>30</b> relative to their contact with the corrugated stainless steel <b>24</b> and to allow adjustment of the lip forming station <b>31</b>, including a fixture <b>42</b> that utilizes camming surfaces on each side to gradually fold the outer lengthwise edge portions <b>24</b><i>a </i>from the horizontal orientations shown on the right hand side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>7</b>A</figref> to the vertical orientation shown on the left hand side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>7</b>A</figref>. As discussed in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a puller <b>37</b> is used to pull the tray <b>24</b>, <b>24</b><i>a </i>along the production line, although supplemental means for moving the product along the line may also be used.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of the cutting station and specifically a housing placed along a cutting path <b>50</b> and including two sets of cutting assemblies or heads <b>54</b> having three blades <b>58</b>. The outer two blades <b>58</b> are used to cut off the turned up lipped or lip portions <b>24</b><i>a </i>while the center blade <b>58</b> is used to cut the central portion of the vapor barrier <b>24</b> into two vapor barrier strips <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a partial disassembled view of a cutting head <b>54</b> while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a side, cross sectional view illustrating one cutting head <b>54</b> angled downwardly into a position for cutting engagement with the extrudate <b>22</b> and vapor barrier <b>24</b> and the other cutting head <b>54</b> raised into a horizontal position out of any engagement with the extrudate <b>22</b> and vapor barrier <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The one or more cutting heads <b>54</b> are positioned in series along the cutting path <b>50</b> of the housing <b>40</b> and are configured to cut the extrudate <b>22</b> and vapor barrier <b>24</b> into one or more spacers <b>16</b> of an appropriate width, such as 0.5 inch or 0.625 inch spacers. While one embodiment of the cutting head <b>54</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, it will be understood that other embodiments may also be used, including, for example, blades, knives, lasers, water jets, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the illustrated cutting head <b>54</b> is described in detail. The cutting head <b>54</b> is comprised of a plurality of blocks <b>56</b> where a cutting blade <b>58</b> may be positioned between any two successive blocks <b>56</b> in order to cut the extrudate <b>22</b> and sheet <b>24</b> to an appropriate width(s) for the desired spacer(s). The specific illustrated example includes two spacers <b>16</b> and two remnants <b>24</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In other embodiments, any resultant remnant generated from the cuts may be disposed of accordingly. Of course, other dimensions and numbers of blocks <b>56</b> are possible and, furthermore, it would not be necessary to limit the number or size of the blocks <b>56</b> within a particular cutting head <b>54</b> to a uniform dimension. For example, a single cutting head <b>54</b> may include a combination of &#xbc; inch and &#x215d; inch blocks to simultaneously cut &#xbc; inch and &#x215d; inch spacers.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The blocks <b>56</b> may be constructed from any suitable rigid materials. Each block <b>56</b> includes a plurality of holes, i.e., at least one lower hole <b>60</b> (two are shown) configured to receive a screw (not shown) or other securement device for securing the cutting blade(s) <b>58</b> within blocks <b>56</b> of the cutting head <b>54</b>. The blocks <b>56</b> further include two positioning holes <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> configured to receive a pin <b>74</b> for securing the cutting head <b>54</b> to the housing <b>40</b> in either of a cut or no-cut position as subsequently discussed.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The cutting blade <b>58</b> may include any sufficiently sharp edge for cutting partially or fully cured extrudate <b>22</b>. The particular illustrated embodiment includes a double-edged razor blade constructed from carbon steel, stainless steel, or other similar materials.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Turning again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the cutting heads <b>54</b> are positioned and secured to one of a plurality of cutting head docking spaces within the housing <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). As shown, opposite walls <b>44</b> (only one each of two shown) of the housing <b>40</b>, at each cutting head docking space include three holes, which are configured to provide two positions for each cutting head <b>54</b> within the given cutting head docking space, e.g., a cut position and a no-cut position. It will be understood that the holes (not shown) of the first and second walls <b>44</b> (one shown for each cutting head) are arranged and aligned such that the first and second walls are mirror images with respect to the other so as to maintain the cutting heads <b>54</b> in a parallel relationship; however, if another structure for securing the cutting heads within the docking spaces is used, then the mirror image relation may not be necessary.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, one cutting head <b>54</b> is shown in the no-cut (horizontal) position and the other cutting head <b>54</b> is shown in the cut position. To achieve the no-cut position, the cutting head <b>54</b> is positioned within the respective docking space and the two positioning holes <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are aligned with appropriate holes (not shown) of the walls <b>44</b> (one shown). Through pins <b>74</b> (or other elements such as bolts, screws, dowel rods, and so forth) extend through the respectively aligned holes. The cutting blades <b>58</b> of the secured, horizontal cutting head <b>54</b> will not cut the extrudate <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">To achieve the cut position, the cutting head <b>54</b> is positioned within the respective docking space and the two positioning holes <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are aligned with the appropriate holes (not shown) of the opposite walls <b>44</b> (one shown). Through pins <b>74</b> are positioned through the respectively aligned holes. Because the third, cut position hole (not shown) in the walls <b>44</b> (one shown) is downstream and angled away from the first hole, the cutting blade <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> will be angled downward within the housing <b>40</b> to engage the entering web of extrudate <b>22</b>. Thus, the cutting blades <b>58</b> of the cutting head <b>54</b> will be secured in the angled orientation shown and will engage and cut the extrudate <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">It will be readily appreciated that the length of the cutting blades <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) of each cutting head <b>54</b> must be sufficient to cut the extrudate <b>22</b> in a single pass through the cutter <b>38</b>. Accordingly, the length of the cutting blade <b>58</b> must be greater than the height of the extrudate <b>22</b> divided by sin a, where a is the angle formed between the cutting blade <b>58</b> and the base <b>48</b> of the housing <b>40</b>. Furthermore, and because the cutting blade <b>58</b> is longer than the height of the web of extrudate <b>22</b>, each of the docking spaces may be associated with a blade sink <b>76</b> within the base <b>48</b> of the housing <b>40</b> to provide clearance for the blade <b>58</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As a result of this individual adjustability of the separate cutting heads <b>58</b>, a plurality of cutting heads <b>58</b> may be positioned within the housing <b>40</b> while one or more of the plurality cuts the at least partially cured extrudate <b>22</b>. By cutting the partially cured extrudate <b>22</b> instead of relying only on the accuracy of the die of the extrusion process, a spacer having more accurate spacer dimensions can be manufactured. That is, the dimensions of the spacer <b>16</b> are mechanically determined by the cutting blade spacing of the cutting head <b>54</b> and not by the irregular expansion of material passing through a die. This level of accuracy may be further used in other embodiments where a cutting head <b>54</b> may be constructed with a cutting blade <b>58</b> positioned to skim a layer (such as about 0.01 inches) off the extrudate <b>22</b> and provide a spacer having dimensions determined with a level of precision not achievable by extrusion alone. Therefore, the series of cutting heads <b>54</b> may be set forth within the housing <b>40</b> to cut one of more spacers <b>16</b> and/or trim spacers <b>16</b> to a nearly exact dimension.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Reconfiguration of the cutter <b>38</b> to manufacture a different style of spacer <b>16</b> may be accomplished by moving one cutting head into the no-cut position and dropping another cutting head into the cut position. More specifically, to move the cutting head <b>54</b> in the first docking space to the cut position, the pin <b>74</b> extending through the second hole <b>64</b> of the cutting head and the second hole of the walls <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> is removed, the second hole <b>64</b> of the cutting head <b>54</b> is aligned with a third hole in the walls <b>44</b> (one shown) and the pin <b>74</b> is replaced into newly aligned holes. It will be appreciated that the pin <b>74</b> through the first aligned holes need not be removed, which allows the cutting head <b>54</b> to swing between the two positions.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a similar manner, the cutting head <b>54</b> in the second docking space may be moved from the cut position to the no-cut position by removing the pin <b>74</b> from aligned holes. The second hole <b>64</b> of the cutting head <b>54</b> is aligned with a second hole (not shown) of the walls <b>44</b> (one shown), and the pin <b>74</b> is reinserted through newly aligned holes. Again, the pin <b>74</b> through the aligned first holes does not need to be removed.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Therefore, it will be readily appreciated that the cutting heads <b>54</b> may be selectively moved between the &#x201c;cut&#x201d; and &#x201c;no-cut&#x201d; positions during the manufacturing process. That is, extrusion may continue while reconfiguring the cutter <b>38</b>, which greatly reduces the amount of down time of conventional extrusion methods (with the limitation that the extrudate <b>22</b> remains the same color throughout). Moreover, including an adjustable die in the manufacturing system <b>10</b> having a cutter in accordance with an embodiment of this invention provides a great number of manufacturing options for spacers that are otherwise only possible with significant system down time. A holder <b>80</b> ensures that the extrudate <b>22</b> and tray <b>24</b>, <b>24</b><i>a </i>remain flat and stable during the cutting process.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates an optional, modular or movable IR (infrared) heating lamp module <b>90</b> that may be wheeled into and out of position over the vapor barrier tray <b>24</b>, <b>24</b><i>a </i>containing the extrudate <b>22</b> as it is curing. It will be appreciated that, depending on application and/or environment needs, more than one such module <b>90</b> may be used. This type of movable assembly <b>90</b> allows the operator to wheel the heating unit into and out of position as necessary based on the current temperature conditions in the plant or other manufacturing location so as to maintain the two part thermoset, desiccant containing material <b>22</b> at the optimal temperature for curing.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The corrugated, stainless steel tray <b>24</b> may be coated with a polyurethane black extrudate <b>22</b> in one aspect of this illustrative embodiment, as mentioned. The following provides a more specific description. The polyurethane may be the reaction product of one or more di- or polyisocyanates and one or more di- or polyols. The relative amounts of isocyanate compound to alcohol compound may range from 1:3 to 1:4, based on the weight of the two components.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The polyurethane formulation may include a desiccant, which may be added to the formulation in an amount of about 30 weight % to about 65 weight % based on the total weight of the formulation. For instance, the desiccant may be added to the formulation in an amount of about 30 weight %, 31 weight %, 32 weight %, 33 weight %, 34 weight %, 35 weight %, 36 weight %, 37 weight %, 38 weight %, 39 weight %, 40 weight %, 41 weight %, 42 weight %, 43 weight %, 44 weight %, 45 weight %, 46 weight %, 47 weight %, 48 weight %, 49 weight %, 50 weight %, 51 weight %, 52 weight %, 53 weight %, 54 weight %, 55 weight %, 56 weight %, 57 weight %, 58 weight %, 59 weight %, 60 weight %, or any fractional part thereof.
