In the field of low, medium or high voltages and/or currents, and in particular in the automotive sector, such connectors have to guarantee transmission of electrical power, signals and/or data permanently, repeatedly and/or for a short time after a comparatively long period of inactivity in mechanically stressed, warm, possibly hot, contaminated, damp and/or chemically aggressive environments. Owing to a wide range of applications, a large number of specially designed connectors are known.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such a connector and, if applicable, the associated (e.g. in the case of a connector device) or higher-level housing (e.g. in the case of a connector device) thereof can be installed on an electrical line, a cable, a cable harness etc. &#x2014;referred to below as an assembled (electrical) cable (also: electrical entity) &#x2014;or to/in an electrical device, such as e.g. to/in a housing, to/on a lead frame, to/on a circuit board etc., of a (power-) electrical, electro-optical or electronic component or a corresponding aggregation etc. (electrical entities).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">If a connector (with/without a housing) is located on a cable, a line or a cable harness, this is also called a flying (plug) connector or a plug, a socket or a coupling; if it is situated on/in an electrical, electro-optical or electronic component, aggregation etc., this is also referred to as a connector device such as a (built-in/mounted) connector, a (built-in/mounted) plug or a (built-in/mounted) socket. A connector on such a device is further often also referred to as a (plug) receptacle, pin header, pin strip or header. In the context of electrical power engineering (generating, converting, storing and transporting high-voltage electrical current in electricity grids, for example with three-phase high-voltage transmission), reference is made here to cable fittings because of their comparatively complex structure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such a connector must ensure proper transmission of electricity, wherein mutually corresponding and partially complementary connectors (connector and mating connector) usually have locking devices and/or fastening devices for permanent but generally releasable locking and/or fastening of the connector to/in the mating connector or vice versa. Furthermore, an electrical connecting device for a connector, e.g. comprising or at least having: an actual electrical contact element (terminal; usually formed materially in one piece or integrally, e.g. a (crimp) contact element etc.) or an electrical contact device (terminal; usually configured so as to be in one piece and from several or two parts, or materially integral, e.g. a (crimp) contact device), has to be held securely therein.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A connecting device may itself be formed from several parts. A connecting device may comprise or have e.g. two or more electrical terminals. This is the case e.g. with coaxial or twin axial or twisted-pair connecting devices which may comprise or have one or two inner, electrical terminals (male and/or female) and one outer terminal (shield contact sleeve). Furthermore, a ferrule (support sleeve) may be established within the outer terminal in the connecting device. In the case of a (pre-)assembled electrical cable, such a connecting device may be provided as a connector, that is to say without a housing, for example in a flying manner.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Efforts are continually being made to improve electrical connectors and their connecting devices, in particular due to miniaturization to make them more robust, design them more effectively and produce them at lower cost. Here, rules apply to HF-connecting devices (HF: high-frequency, transmission frequencies greater than 3 to greater than 300 MHz and well into the GHz range (approx. 150 GHz)) that are considerably different to those for conventional connecting devices (transmission frequencies lower than about 3 MHz), since the wave properties of electricity are particularly evident in HF-technology. In the case of electrical HF-plug connections, maintaining signal integrity is proving to be an ever-greater obstacle.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is an observable trend for cable manufacturers to make the shields in multi-core cables, such as e.g. twisted-pair cables, twin axial cables etc., increasingly more oval because more and more manufacturers are placing the shields of the multi-core cables directly around the inner conductors of the multi-core cables instead of around additional fillers as before. However, the insulation sheaths of the multi-core cables remain substantially circular. The conventional crimp ferrules for crimp connecting devices of such multi-core cables are designed in such a way that they are suitable only for being crimped onto a substantially circular shield.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A crimp ferrule includes an assembly portion assembled on a non-circular internal cross section of a multi-core cable and a diameter compensation portion forming a circular external cross section of the crimp ferrule on the multi-core cable. The assembly portion and the diameter compensation portion are arranged successively in an axial direction of the crimp ferrule.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying Figures, of which:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a crimp ferrule according to an embodiment for a multi-core cable in a stretched state;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of the crimp ferrule in a pre-bent state immediately prior to or during crimping;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of the crimp ferrule in a crimped state without a multi-core cable;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an end view of the crimp ferrule in an assembled state on a multi-core cable; and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of the crimp ferrule in the assembled state on the multi-core cable.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT(S)</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The invention is explained in greater detail below on the basis of exemplary embodiments with reference to the appended drawings, which are diagrammatic and not to scale. Portions, elements, component parts, units, components and/or patterns which have an identical, unique or analogous configuration and/or function are identified by the same reference signs. A possible alternative which is not explained in the description, is not shown in the drawing and/or is not definitive, a static and/or kinematic reversal, a combination etc. with respect to the exemplary embodiments of the invention or a component, a pattern, a unit, a component part, an element or a portion thereof, can further be gathered from the description of the figures.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the case of the invention, a feature (portion, element, component part, unit, component, function, variable etc.) can be of positive configuration, that is to say present, or of negative configuration, that is to say absent. In this specification, a negative feature is not explained explicitly as a feature if value is not placed on it being absent according to the invention. That is to say, the invention which is actually made and is not constructed by way of the prior art consists in omitting the said feature.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A feature of this specification can be used not only in a specified manner and/or way, but rather also in another manner and/or way (isolation, combination, replacement, addition, on its own, omission, etc.). It is possible, in particular, in the description, the patent claims and/or the drawing, to replace, add or omit a feature in the patent claims and/or the description on the basis of a reference sign and a feature which is assigned to it, or vice versa. Furthermore, a feature in a patent claim can be interpreted and/or specified in greater detail as a result.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The features of the description can also be interpreted as optional features; that is to say, each feature can be considered to be an optional or arbitrary feature, that is to say a feature which is not mandatory. Therefore, a separation of a feature, possibly including its periphery, from an exemplary embodiment is possible, it then being possible for the said feature to be transferred to a generalized inventive concept. The absence of a feature (negative feature) in an exemplary embodiment shows that the feature is optional in relation to the invention. Furthermore, in the case of a type term for a feature, a generic term for the feature can also be implicitly understood (possibly further hierarchical breakdown into subgenus, etc.), as a result of which a generalization of the feature is possible, for example with consideration of equivalent effect and/or equivalence.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The invention is explained in more detail hereunder by exemplary embodiments of a variant of a multi-core cable crimp ferrule <b>2</b> according to the invention, hereunder referred to only as the crimp ferrule <b>2</b>, in particular an HF crimp ferrule <b>2</b>, for an electrical connecting device <b>0</b> of an electrical multi-core cable <b>5</b>. Presently, the multi-core cable <b>5</b> may be formed e.g. as a twisted-pair cable <b>5</b>, a twin axial cable <b>5</b>, etc. Accordingly, the connecting device <b>0</b> may be formed as a multi-core connecting device <b>0</b>, such as e.g. a twisted-pair connecting device <b>0</b>, a twin axial connecting device <b>0</b> etc., and the crimp ferrule <b>2</b> may be formed as a twisted-pair crimp ferrule <b>2</b>, a twin axial crimp ferrule <b>2</b>, etc.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Although the invention is described and illustrated further in greater detail by way of exemplary embodiments, the invention is not restricted by way of the disclosed exemplary embodiments, but rather is of more fundamental nature. Other variations can be derived therefrom without departing from the scope of protection of the invention. The invention can be used in general in the electrical sector in the case of an electrical entity.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The drawing shows only those spatial portions of the subject matter of the invention which are necessary for understanding of the invention.
