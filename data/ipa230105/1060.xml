More specifically, the present disclosure relates to a dialysis system including a flow regulation device for regulating the fluid flow to a dialysis device.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hemodialysis uses a dialysis fluid to remove waste products from a patient's blood. One of the drawbacks of performing home hemodialysis (hemodialysis in a patient's home) is the need for a dedicated water treatment, which includes equipment, water connection and drainage. Installing and using those components is a difficult and cumbersome task that can require a patient's home to be modified. Nevertheless, there are benefits to daily hemodialysis treatments versus bi- or tri-weekly visits to a treatment center. In particular, a patient receiving more frequent treatments removes more toxins, waste products, and excess water more frequently, thus reducing fluctuations in blood chemistry and blood pressure, than a patient receiving less frequent but perhaps longer treatments.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Peritoneal dialysis utilizes a sterile dialysis solution, which is infused into a patient's peritoneal cavity and into contact with the patient's peritoneal membrane. Waste, toxins and excess water pass from the patient's bloodstream through the peritoneal membrane and into the used dialysate. The spent dialysate is later drained from the patient's peritoneal cavity to remove the waste, toxins and excess water from the patient. Patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis also face difficulties in terms of the volume of treatment fluid needed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Dialysis machines require large (ranging from 20 to 200 liters per treatment) amounts of water to provide the dialysis fluid used in the machine. Further, the fluid demand of a dialysis machine is not constant and varies with the cycling of the machine. In the institutional setting, most water systems for dialysis supply a hydraulic branch with very large volumes of water. The excess water and large number of individual dialysis systems connected to the branch mitigate the variable fluid demand of each individual machine. Moreover, many water systems include large tanks capable of holding several thousand liters to provide a backup reservoir to account for changes in draw rate.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a home setting, a single dialysis device may be connected to a single water supply without any fluid reservoir in the circuit. Thus, the device lacks the water reserve capabilities previously described for systems with large numbers of dialysis machines. Because dialysis machines do not draw a constant flow of water but rather start and stop, problems are presented. The fluid supply to the device needs to have a flow capacity that is at least as great as the maximum instantaneous draw rate of the dialysis device, which can be significantly greater than the average fluid demand of the dialysis device. Further, if the water source provides a continuous flow of fluid, a significant amount of dialysis fluid is produced but not used for dialysis, and thus is wasted.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure provides a dialysis system including a flow regulation device for regulating the fluid flow to the dialysis device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, a dialysis system includes a dialysis machine with a variable fluid demand including at least a lower demand and a higher demand.

While the embodiments discussed are not limited to home applications, it will be readily apparent that an efficient, safe, and conveniently-sized dialysis system is most useful in a home application. Nevertheless, the systems disclosed herein may also be used in larger institutions, such as hospitals or clinics, and may be used as back-up or reserve capacity in the event that the supply chain is somehow interrupted.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A general hemodialysis system is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Patient P is undergoing hemodialysis with hemodialysis machine <b>20</b>, which may be a home hemodialysis machine. The patient is connected to the hemodialysis machine via tubing <b>12</b>, arterial and venous access needles A<sub>N </sub>and V<sub>N</sub>, and access site <b>14</b>. The hemodialysis machine H pumps fresh dialysate from a fluid source, which may be provided by the system for preparing dialysis solution described below. Tubing <b>16</b> conveys fresh dialysate from a dialysis source to a dialysate pump in the hemodialysis machine, and then to the dialyzer <b>18</b>. A system for administering peritoneal dialysis using fresh dialysate fluid may be used instead.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the dialysis system includes a fluid source <b>10</b>, a flow regulation device <b>20</b>, and a dialysis machine <b>30</b>. The fluid source may be the system <b>60</b> (described below) for producing dialysis fluid, or another suitable fluid source. Alternatively, the dialysis fluid can be produced in the dialysis machine <b>30</b>, and the fluid source may supply the dialysis machine <b>30</b> with purified water for dialysis. The dialysis machine <b>30</b> has a variable fluid demand. The fluid source <b>10</b> is in fluid communication with the dialysis machine <b>20</b> and provides dialysis fluid to the dialysis machine <b>30</b>. When the dialysis system is in the no flow or lower flow parts of a pump cycle, the flow regulation device <b>20</b> is filled with dialysis fluid or purified water from the fluid source <b>10</b>. When the dialysis device <b>30</b> initiates the high flow portion of the pump cycle, the volume of fluid in the flow regulation device <b>20</b> is decreased. Thus, the flow regulation device <b>20</b> acts as a damper to reduce the pulsatility, or variations in fluid demand, that the fluid supply <b>10</b> is exposed to.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">One system <b>60</b> for producing dialysate to provide fluid for the dialysis fluid source <b>10</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. System <b>60</b> receives purified water for dialysis through line <b>61</b><i>a </i>and control valve <b>61</b><i>b</i>. The water is heated, if desired, using in-line heater <b>61</b>. The heated water flows through lines <b>61</b><i>c</i>, <b>61</b><i>d </i>to A and B concentrate pumps <b>62</b>, <b>63</b>, for pumping concentrate respectively from reservoirs <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>63</b><i>a</i>. The pumps are positive displacement pumps, such as gear pumps, vane pumps, or piston pumps, to pump precise amounts of A or B concentrate. One embodiment uses small ceramic piston pumps, available from Fluid Metering, Inc., Long Island, N.Y., U.S.A. U.S.A. Other pumps may be used. Other embodiments use proportioning or ratiometric pumps, whose flow of A or B concentrate may be set, and which thereafter pump A and B concentrate in a ratio proportional to the distilled water metered out. A controller for the system keeps track of the amounts of concentrate pumped, and also keeps track of the amount of deaerated water and A that is pumped, thus keeping precisely proportioned flows.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment, the A concentrate pump <b>62</b> pumps A concentrate to mixing vessel <b>64</b> through line <b>62</b><i>a</i>, the vessel not filled but retaining an air gap at its top, while the correct ratio of water also flows to the vessel through line <b>61</b><i>e</i>. After the water and the A concentrate are mixed, the mixture is deaerated by spraying using precision metering pump <b>64</b><i>a</i>, nozzle <b>64</b><i>c</i>, and air trap <b>64</b><i>b</i>. Other embodiments such as a simple restriction creating a starved intake to pump <b>64</b><i>a</i>, could be substituted for the sprayer to remove the air from the solution. The mixture is monitored by temperature and conductivity sensors <b>64</b><i>d</i>, <b>64</b><i>e</i>. Vessel <b>64</b> includes a level sensor L. The deaerated acid mixture is then sent to the B mix chamber <b>65</b>, where B concentrate from the B concentrate pump through line <b>63</b><i>b </i>is added, in this case in-line. The B mix chamber <b>65</b> is equipped with a second conductivity sensor <b>66</b> to monitor the quality of the finished dialysis solution.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The dialysis solution is then pumped by supply pump <b>67</b> through filter <b>67</b><i>a</i>, to remove particles larger than 150&#x3bc;. Control valve <b>68</b> controls the flow of dialysis solution from system <b>60</b>. If the correct level of continuity has not been achieved, the freshly-prepared dialysis solution may be recycled as desired through the filter and the mixing chamber, as shown, until the proper mixing and purity has been achieved. The dialysis solution can then be pumped through a final filter, endotoxin filter <b>69</b>, on its way to being used. The endotoxin filter is intended to remove endotoxins and bacteria, or fragments of bacteria, such as <i>E. coli </i>and <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. This filter could be an ultrafilter such as those made by Medica Mirandolla Italy or a charged membrane microfilter such as those made by Pall, Long Island, N.Y., USA.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The process described above is only one method for preparing a dialysis solution. Other dialysis solutions may be used, including those requiring an osmotic agent, such as a small amount of dextrose, glucose, sodium or potassium polyacrylate, or mixtures of these, or other component. These solutions are prepared in generally similar ways, some embodiments using powders, some using concentrates, some using solutions. Any such embodiments are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure. Embodiments using powders may require a conventional stirred-tank vessel, or vessel suitable for mixing powders using a stirrer or using flow, often turbulent flow, to insure a good mixing. For home use, this may be any suitable mixer capable of maintaining and preserving sterility.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an embodiment <b>40</b> of the flow regulation device. The flow regulation device <b>40</b> is disposed between the fluid source <b>10</b> and the dialysis machine <b>30</b>. Flow regulation device <b>40</b> includes a fluid inlet <b>42</b> in fluid communication with the fluid source <b>10</b> and a fluid outlet <b>44</b> in fluid communication with the dialysis machine <b>30</b>. The flow regulation device <b>40</b> is operable to expand and contract to provide a variable internal volume. The flow regulation device <b>40</b> expands when the dialysis machine <b>30</b> has a lower demand and contracts when the dialysis machine <b>30</b> has a higher demand. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the flow regulation device <b>40</b> in a second configuration with a larger internal volume <b>47</b> than the internal volume <b>45</b> of the flow regulation device <b>40</b> in the first configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The flow regulation device <b>40</b> includes a first wall <b>46</b> and a second wall <b>48</b> disposed opposite each other between the fluid inlet and the fluid outlet. Walls <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> define in part the internal volume <b>45</b>. The walls <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> move away from each other when the device expands and towards each other when the device contracts. The walls <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> are composed of a compliant material so that they may expand and contract depending on the flow requirements of the dialysis device. Suitable compliant materials include elastomers and plastics, such as natural rubber latex, PVC, polyurethane, or silicone.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The dialysis machine <b>30</b> may operate at a typical average flow rate of 500 ml/min, but the given instantaneous demand rate may be between 0 ml/min and 1000 ml/min. Thus, the lower fluid demand may be 0 ml/min, and the higher fluid demand may be 1000 ml/min. The fluid flow rate from the fluid source <b>10</b> is preferably generally equal to the average dialysis fluid demand of the dialysis machine <b>30</b>. The flow regulation device <b>40</b> may provide a maximum internal volume between 25 ml and 200 ml, preferably between 50 mL and 100 mL. Thus, the flow regulation device <b>40</b> may provide for pulses of no flow and maximum flow of about 6-10 seconds. In one embodiment, the dialysis machine provides a flow cycle of between 5 and 60 seconds of fluid demand, and between 0.5 and 30 seconds of no fluid demand.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates another embodiment <b>50</b> of a flow regulation device. The flow regulation device <b>50</b> includes a fluid inlet <b>52</b> in fluid communication with the fluid source <b>10</b> and a fluid outlet <b>54</b> in fluid communication with the dialysis machine <b>30</b>. The flow regulation device <b>50</b> includes at least one pleated wall <b>56</b> and optionally a second pleated wall <b>58</b>. The pleats in the pleated walls <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> allow the walls <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> to expand outwardly and contract inwardly to provide a variable internal volume for the flow regulation device <b>50</b>. The flow regulation device <b>50</b> may be made of any suitable material, including elastomers, plastics, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The flow regulation devices <b>40</b>, <b>50</b> may be easily sanitized between uses. Because the inner surfaces of the flow regulation devices <b>40</b>, <b>50</b> are exposed to fluid (which may be a disinfecting solution), it is easy to ensure that the entire flow circuit has been disinfected.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates another embodiment <b>70</b> of a flow regulation device. Flow regulation device <b>70</b> includes a rigid container <b>76</b> to regulate the required flow from the fluid source to the fluid demand of the dialysis machine. The container <b>76</b> includes dialysis fluid <b>71</b> in the bottom portion <b>75</b> and air or other gas <b>73</b> in the top portion <b>77</b>. The level of the dialysis fluid <b>71</b> rises when the dialysis machine <b>30</b> has a lower demand and falls when the dialysis machine <b>30</b> has a higher demand and draws fluid from the container <b>76</b>. To accommodate the change in the volume of the fluid <b>71</b>, the air <b>73</b> also changes volume. To accommodate the change in air volume, the air <b>73</b> may be compressed or expanded as appropriate. Alternatively, air <b>73</b> may be discharged to the exterior of the flow regulation device <b>70</b> and taken into the device <b>70</b> to control the air volume. The intake of air is preferably through a suitably rated filter or other mechanism to maintain the sterility of the system.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The systems described herein provide significant advantages over current systems. By using a flow regulation device, changes in draw rate are smoothed so that the fluid supply <b>10</b> only needs to supply dialysis fluid at the average draw rate of the dialysis machine <b>30</b>, not at the peak draw rate. The flow regulation devices <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>70</b> take up very little space and do not require the large tank volumes of conventional systems.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In another aspect, a dialysis system <b>10</b> uses a flow control method to accommodate the variations in fluid demand of the dialysis machine <b>30</b>. The system includes a data connection between the dialysis machine <b>30</b> and the fluid source <b>10</b>. The data connection provides a signal from the dialysis machine <b>30</b> to the fluid source <b>10</b> to adjust the flow setting of fluid from the fluid source <b>10</b>. The flow setting may include a simple on/off control or a more precise flow control. The signal may be indicative of a current fluid demand of the dialysis machine <b>30</b>, or the anticipated future demand. The dialysis machine <b>30</b> may include a control mechanism for its pumps. Based on the current and future flow need of the pumps, the dialysis machine <b>30</b> specifies the desired flow rate of the dialysis fluid. The output of the fluid source <b>10</b> is regulated to meet the real-time demand of the dialysis machine <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, the dialysis machine <b>30</b> sends a command signal to a valve or other flow setting to open the valve or provide a certain flow rate. Dialysis fluid (or purified water) from the fluid source <b>10</b> is then provided at the desired flow rate. The fluid source <b>10</b> would typically produce the fluid at the peak rate needed. When the fluid demand of the dialysis machine <b>30</b> is lowered, the dialysis machine <b>30</b> sends a command to slow or stop the production of dialysis fluid. The dialysis system may be programmed to anticipate the demand of the dialysis machine <b>30</b> so that there is no lag time between the dialysis fluid demand of the dialysis machine <b>30</b> and the desired flow rate of dialysis fluid from the fluid source <b>10</b>. The connection between the dialysis machine <b>30</b> and the fluid source <b>10</b> may be provided by any type of data communication link, including wired, radio, infrared, Bluetooth, and the like.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In another embodiment, a system uses a fluid connection to convey information from the dialysis machine <b>30</b> to the fluid source <b>10</b>. When the dialysis machine <b>30</b> draws fluid at the high rate, the fluid source <b>10</b> experiences a reduced pressure on an outlet line. A pressure transducer may be used to detect this pressure drop and increase the fluid generation rate accordingly. When the dialysis machine <b>30</b> reduces the draw rate, the pressure on the outlet line of the fluid source <b>10</b> will increase, which can be detected with the same pressure sensor, leading to a reduction in flow rate. This embodiment provides another means of conveying flow rate information.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The data connection allows the flow rate of the fluid from the fluid source <b>10</b> to be synchronized with the draw rate of the dialysis device <b>30</b>. This prevents the fluid source (such as system <b>60</b>) from having to consistently run at the peak draw rate of the dialysis machine <b>30</b>. The life span of the components of the dialysis solution preparation system (such as pumps, filters, sensors, and so forth) can be extended by reducing their total use. Further, the fluid (whether dialysate or water) that is produced but not used for dialysis (and thus wasted) is limited, because it is not pumped when it is not needed.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present subject matter and without diminishing its intended advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>The invention is claimed as follows:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
