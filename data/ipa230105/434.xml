For example, wearable items may be formed from fabric. Some wearable items may include sensing circuitry. Control circuitry in the item may use the sensing circuitry to gather information on a user's health and other data. Output devices in a wearable item may provide output to a user.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">If care is not taken, fabric-based items such as these may not offer desired features. For example, a fabric-based item with sensing circuitry may not be able to gather measurements accurately, may not be able to interact with external equipment effectively, or may be difficult for a user to keep clean.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A fabric-based item may be provided with a stretchable band. The stretchable band may be formed from a ring-shaped strip of stretchable fabric having an opening configured to fit around a body part of a user. Circuitry may be coupled to strands of material in the stretchable band. The circuitry may include sensor circuitry for making measurement on the body part such as electrocardiogram measurements, blood pressure measurements, respiration rate measurements, and other measurements. When being worn on the body part of the user, the stretchable band may hold the sensor circuitry against the body part to facilitate gathering accurate measurements.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The fabric-based item may be configured to sustain relatively high temperatures such as those associated with laundering of clothing. For example, the fabric-based item may have supercapacitors for energy storage and other electrical components that can be laundered in hot water and dried in a clothes dryer without damage. To withstand damage when the fabric-based item is stretched, fabric may include strengthening strands and conductive strands may be provided with meandering paths and more slack than the strengthening strands.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Wireless communications circuitry in the fabric-based item may be used to communicate wirelessly with external electronic equipment. A coil formed from conductive strands in the fabric-based item may be used by wireless power receiving circuitry in the fabric-based item to receive wireless power. The coil may have one or more turns that run around the ring-shaped strip of stretchable fabric forming the stretchable band so that the coil surrounds a central opening in the stretchable band.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an illustrative fabric-based item in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of an illustrative item such as a band that is formed from elastic fabric in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side view of illustrative fabric with circuitry in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram of a portion of a fabric item having an antenna in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram showing how a fabric item may have multiple antennas with different respective orientations in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram showing how a fabric-based band may be coupled to a housing in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram showing how a fabric-based item may have an elastic band coupled to fabric in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of an illustrative elastic band and associated fabric showing how the band and fabric may be joined together by sewing in accordance with an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A schematic diagram of an illustrative system that may contain items with fabric is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, fabric <b>60</b> may include stretchable (elastic) strands of material such as stretchable strands <b>68</b>. Strands <b>68</b> may, for example, be formed from an elastomeric polymer that can stretch and return elastically to its unstretched state (e.g., when strands <b>68</b> are not stretched more than their elongation-to-break limits). As an example, strands <b>68</b> may be formed from synthetic rubber or spandex (a copolymer of polyoxyethylene and polyurethane, sometimes referred to as Lycra&#xae; or elastane). Stretchable strands <b>68</b> may, as an example, be characterized by a high elongation-to-break value (e.g., at least 200%, at least 300%, at least 400%, less than 800%, less than 1000%, etc.). Fabric <b>60</b> may also have strands that are less stretchable, but that add strength to fabric <b>60</b> such as strengthening strands <b>62</b>.

During stretching, loops <b>64</b> collapse. Conductive strands <b>66</b> (e.g., insulated or uninsulated wires with solid cores or polymer cores) may be intertwined with strands <b>62</b> on an upper layer of fabric <b>60</b> and an opposing lower layer of fabric <b>60</b> (e.g., by passing conductive strands <b>66</b> through loops <b>64</b>). There may be more slack in strands <b>66</b> than in strands <b>62</b>, so that when fabric <b>60</b> is stretched, strands <b>62</b> will be tensioned before strands <b>66</b>.
