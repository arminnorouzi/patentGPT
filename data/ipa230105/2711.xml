However, as there is no physical constraint on size and separation, the microtissues can grow over time or agglomerate, leading to diffusion limitations. Moreover, there is heterogeneity in the size distribution of the microtissues, which can lead to biases.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Microwell arrays that physically restrict spheroid size can be used for achieving a defined and homogenous size. They can also be incorporated in microfluidic devices to sequester spheroids in individual microwells, provide control over fluid flow and test them in a dynamic manner. However, there are several disadvantages associated with conventional microfluidic devices. Medium flow across the face of microwell (tangential) can be inadequate in providing complete medium exchange and removal of debris, especially for deeper microwells. Permanent bonding of devices can make cell loading and recovery of microtissues for downstream analysis difficult. Fabrication requires cleanrooms for soft lithography, and the fabrication material (polydimethylsiloxane; PDMS) is unsuitable due to absorption of hydrophobic reagents and leaching of small molecules. The devices do not have a standard footprint, therefore integration with imaging platforms can be challenging. Finally, such devices might be suited for testing but cannot be easily scaled up for biomanufacturing of stem cell-derived organoids in physiomimetic conditions, discouraging their widespread adoption.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there is a need for an open, long-term culture system that provides robust control on the fluidic, biophysical and biochemical microenvironment and allows for multiple characterization and functional readouts in order to optimize critical factors that positively affect the differentiation, maturation, and function of organoids.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some embodiments of the present invention are directed to a microwell perfusion plate system.

accompanying drawings, in which illustrative embodiments of the invention are shown. In the drawings, the relative sizes of regions or features may be exaggerated for clarity. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; or &#x201c;connected&#x201d; to another element, it can be directly coupled or connected to the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly coupled&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly connected&#x201d; to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. As used herein the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition, spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;under,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;over,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is inverted, elements described as &#x201c;under&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;over&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term &#x201c;under&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of over and under. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Well-known functions or constructions may not be described in detail for brevity and/or clarity.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;including,&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">It is noted that any one or more aspects or features described with respect to one embodiment may be incorporated in a different embodiment although not specifically described relative thereto. That is, all embodiments and/or features of any embodiment can be combined in any way and/or combination. Applicant reserves the right to change any originally filed claim or file any new claim accordingly, including the right to be able to amend any originally filed claim to depend from and/or incorporate any feature of any other claim although not originally claimed in that manner. These and other objects and/or aspects of the present invention are explained in detail in the specification set forth below.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">&#x201c;Cells&#x201d; and &#x201c;cell&#x201d; as used in the present invention are, in general, animal cells, particularly mammalian and/or primate cells, examples of which include, but are not limited to human, dog, cat, rabbit, monkey, chimpanzee, cow, pig, and goat. The cells may be differentiated at least in part to a particular cell or tissue type, such as liver, intestine, pancreas, lymph node, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, central nerve, peripheral nerve, skin, bone, lung, breast, testes, immune system, kidney, etc. In some embodiments, the cells are diseased cells, optionally cancer cells. In some embodiments, a cell may express (naturally or by recombinant techniques) a detectable compound, which is a compound that provides and/or generates a detectable signal that allows for differentiation and/or identification of a cell and/or cell population such as, e.g., a fluorescent compound. In some embodiments, cells may be obtained from a subject, such as, for example, a subject or patient undergoing treatment for cancer. In some embodiments, a tissue biopsied from a subject may be used to prepare one or more 3D cell cultures of the present invention, optionally with cells obtained from a minced tissue.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Cells (e.g., live cells) may be incorporated into a composition and/or hydrogel of the present invention in any suitable form, including as unencapsulated cells, or as cells previously aggregated as spheroids, or pre-formed organoids. Animal tissue cells aggregated or contained in cell spheroids can be produced in accordance with known techniques, or in some cases are commercially available (see, e.g., Insphero AG, 3D Hepg2 Liver Microtissue Spheroids (2012); Inspherio AG, 3D InSight&#x2122; Human Liver Microtissues, (2012)).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">&#x201c;3D cell culture&#x201d; or &#x201c;three-dimensional tissue construct&#x201d; as used herein refer to a plurality of live cells, optionally in a carrier media, that are arranged in a three-dimensional or multi-layered configuration (as opposed to a monolayer). An &#x201c;organoid&#x201d; as used herein refers to a composition of live cells, typically in a carrier media, arranged in a three-dimensional or multi-layered configuration (as opposed to a monolayer) and is a type of a 3D cell culture.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Suitable carrier media for a 3D cell culture include hydrogels (e.g., cross-linked hydrogels) as described herein. In some embodiments, a 3D cell culture is formed upon cross-linking (e.g., after UV initiated cross-linking) of the carrier media (e.g., hydrogel). Additional example hydrogels include, but are not limited to, those described in PCT/US2015/055699, PCT/US2016/054607, and PCT/US2017/058531, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. A 3D cell culture may comprise one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, or more) differentiated cell type(s) depending upon the particular tissue and/or organ being modeled or emulated. Some 3D cell cultures may comprise diseased cells and/or cancer cells. When the 3D cell culture comprises diseased cells and/or cancer cells, they may include tissue cells and/or may include a tissue mimic without cells, such as an extracellular matrix (or proteins and/or polymers derived therefrom), hyaluronic acid, gelatin, collagen, alginate, etc., including combinations thereof. Thus, in some embodiments, cells are mixed together with an extracellular matrix, or cross-linked matrix, to form a 3D cell culture.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, a 3D cell culture of the present invention comprises cells that are human-derived cells, and, in some embodiments, the cells consist of human-derived cells. A 3D cell culture of the present invention may express and/or produce one or more biomarkers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, or more) that are the same as a biomarker produced by the cells in vivo. For example, liver cells in vivo produce albumin and a 3D cell culture of the present invention comprising liver cells may express albumin. In some embodiments, a 3D cell culture may express a biomarker in the same amount or in an amount that is &#xb1;20%, &#xb1;10%, or &#xb1;5% of the average amount produced and/or expressed by corresponding cells in vivo. Example biomarkers include, but are not limited to, albumin, urea, glutathione S-transferase (GST) (e.g., &#x3b1;-GST), chemokines (e.g., IL-8, IL-1&#x3b2;, etc.), prostacyclin, SB100B, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), myelin basic protein (MBP), hormones (e.g., testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, insulin, glucagon, etc.), inhibin A/B, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The cells may be differentiated or undifferentiated cells, but are, in some embodiments, tissue cells (e.g., liver cells such as hepatocytes, pancreatic cells, cardiac muscle cells, skeletal muscle cells, etc.).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, a 3D cell culture of the present invention is not prepared from and/or does not comprise cells from an immortalized cell line. A 3D cell culture of the present invention may comprise and/or be prepared using high functioning cells, such as, but not limited to, primary cells and/or stem cells, e.g., embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stems and/or differentiated iPS-derived cells.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, one or more populations of cells may be labeled with a detectable compound. In some embodiments, the one or more populations of cells may be used to form a 3D cell culture as described herein. One or more different populations of cells in a 3D cell culture of the present invention may be present in substantially the same (e.g., within about &#xb1;20%) amount as the amount of cells in that population in a tissue and/or tumor in vivo. In some embodiments, when cells have been obtained from a tissue sample from a subject, sorted and/or labeled, the different populations of cells are combined in substantially the amount as the amount present in the tissue sample.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, an organoid is about 100, 200, or 300 &#x3bc;m to about 350, 400, 500, 600, or 700 &#x3bc;m in diameter in at least one dimension, such as, for example, about 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, or 700 &#x3bc;m in at least one dimension. In some embodiments, an organoid is about 1 &#x3bc;L to about 20 &#x3bc;L in volume such as, for example, about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 &#x3bc;L in volume. The organoid may comprise about 1,500, 2,000, or 5,000 to about 10,000, 25,000, or 50,000 cells in total or about 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, or 50,000 to about 75,000, 100,000, 150,000, 250,000, 500,000, 750,000, 1,000,000, 50,000,000, or 100,000,000 cells in total. In some embodiments, an organoid of the present invention may comprise about 1, 2, or 5 million to about 10, 50, or 100 million cells per mL. In some embodiments, an organoid of the present invention may comprise about 10 million cells per mL. An organoid of the present invention may be in any suitable shape, such as, e.g., any three-dimensional shape and/or multi-layered shape. In some embodiments, an organoid of the present invention is in the form of a spheroid. In some embodiments, an organoid of the present invention may be self-organized in a composition of the present invention (e.g., a cross-linked hydrogel).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">&#x201c;Growth media&#x201d;, &#x201c;liquid medium&#x201d;, and &#x201c;cell culture media&#x201d;, along with grammatical variants thereof, are used interchangeably herein and may be any natural or artificial growth media (typically an aqueous liquid) that sustains the cells used in carrying out the present invention. Examples include, but are not limited to, an essential media or minimal essential media (MEM), or variations thereof such as Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM), as well as blood, blood serum, blood plasma, lymph fluid, etc., including synthetic mimics thereof. In some embodiments, the growth media includes a pH color indicator (e.g., phenol red).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a general schematic of a microwell perfusion plate according to some embodiments.

Such methods may provide homogenous spheroid size, low cell loss, easy retrieval of spheroids, and scalability. However, such methods introduce a number of disadvantages. Well volume is optimized for monolayer culture. There is a high cell volume to surface ratio due to cells cultured as spheroids rather than monolayer. There is a high bioburden leading to frequent medium change. Spheroids tend to &#x201c;pop out&#x201d; during medium change. There is retention of cell debris in the microwells. They provide short term culture (spheroids have to be removed and cultured in another platform after formation). There is a lack of fluid flow (perfusion) leading to inadequate nutrient and oxygen exchange and waste removal. There are also inadequate mechanical forces due to the absence of fluid flow.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">The microwell perfusion plates described herein combine the advantages of microfluidics, bioreactors, and microwell platforms. The microwell perfusion plates provide an open-well plate rather than a closed organ-on-chip. The plates take advantage of a standard multi-well plate footplate to use existing imaging setups. The plates enable easy cell seeding, media sampling, and recovery of spheroids for downstream processing (e.g., bioprinting). The plates provide a reduced bioburden due to perfusion. The plates allow for easier application/change of growth factors/medium during different stages of differentiation and maturation. The spheroids can be encapsulated/embedded in the plate in the form of a sheet. The plates provide direct flow of medium rather than tangential flow (e.g., associated with microfluidic chips which provides an inadequate exchange due to lack of convective flow that can create dead zones in microwells).

A significant impediment to the development of cell-based therapies for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is the inability to generate or sustain mature human kidney organoids in culture. Recent studies have indicated that differentiation in 3D, signals from extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds and incorporation of fluid flow could have a positive impact on stem cell-derived organoid maturation. However, the controlled presentation of these physiological and extracellular matrix stimuli, their interplay and their combined roles in regulating differentiation, maturation and function of kidney organoids have not been demonstrated. Therefore, the overall objective of the proposed work is to define and optimize the synergistic effect of the different microenvironmental factors in guiding the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)&#x2014;derived nephron progenitor (NP) cells towards a mature and functional kidney organoid. The ultimate goals of this proposal are threefold: 1) engineer an open, long-term culture system that is capable of providing robust control of the fluidic, biophysical and biochemical cellular microenvironment and allows for the assessment of multiple phenotypic and functional readouts; 2) utilize this innovative platform to systematically define and optimize critical factors capable of positively effecting the differentiation and maturation of organoids from human nephron progenitor cells; and 3) assess the impact of the optimal physiomimetic 3D niche on the function of organoids. The data produced in this study will demonstrate whether the application of these techniques can overcome the current challenges in this field. Finally, although the proposed study focuses on kidney organoid biomanufacturing from progenitor cells as an alternative approach for the treatment of ESRD, the tools and technologies developed herein are versatile and translatable to other tissues and cells. Hence, this investigation offers broad applicability to tissue engineering as a whole, especially to organ-on-a-chip and 3D bioprinting.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">The limited availability of human organ donors renders kidney transplantation unlikely to provide a cure for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Consequently, there is a significant interest in alternative cellular sources for kidney regeneration and research efforts have focused intensively on generating renal organoids from stem cells. However, the major barrier is the considerably low efficiency of the differentiation process and the inability to obtain mature kidney organoids in culture. To date, most studies have indicated that kidney organoids resemble the morphological and molecular signature of trimester 1 fetal kidneys and undergo dedifferentiation as well as enrichment of stromal and off-target cell populations with longer periods in culture. Even though differentiation in 3D has been more efficient than 2D, the inherent limitations of the culture platform might be a reason for such observations. Shortcomings, such as the absence of physiological fluid flow and lack of control on organoid size, resulting in larger constructs suffering from oxygen diffusion limitations, need to be addressed. Incorporation of perfusion has been shown to improve the maturation and function of microtissues, by providing an adequate nutrient and oxygen supply and well as mechanical cues through fluid shear stress (FSS). Furthermore, decellularized kidney extracellular matrix (ECM)&#x2014;derived biomaterials could also provide a suitable platform for promoting the survival and maturation of renal cells.

However, ECM from different parts of the kidney can be rich in different biochemical factors, which can effect cell behavior. Therefore, ECM derived purely from the cortex or medulla or their different combinations can be used to determine their effect on organoid maturation and function.

The use of islet transplantation to provide a replacement for the lost insulin-producing cells has proven to be an effective therapy, resulting in restoration of insulin secretion and of glucose homeostasis, and preventing complications associated with T1D. Therefore, extensive efforts have been directed towards generating functional &#x3b2; cells or islet-like clusters (ILCs) from inexhaustible resources like human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC). However, a major barrier in generating insulin producing cells is the considerably low yield of the differentiation process and the inability to sustain mature &#x3b2; cells in culture. This inability to obtain islet maturity and maintain function in culture underscores the significance of bioengineering a physiomimetic pancreatic niche. Here, we have identified three factors that should be synergistically employed to engineer a physiologically relevant microenvironment for long-term culture, functional maturation and maintenance of ILCs; 1) use of a microwell array to produce homogenously sized ILCs and prevent agglomeration, 2) incorporation of perfusion to allow for continuous medium exchange, provide mechanical cues and removal of debris and 3) human pancreatic dECM to provide more relevant biochemical cues. The rational for including these factors in the platform is described below.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">At Stage 5 of differentiation, pancreatic progenitor (PP) cells are transferred to non-adherent growth platforms, resulting in cluster formation. As there is no physical constraint on size and separation, clusters can grow over time or agglomerate, leading to diffusion limitations. Microwell arrays that physically restrict spheroid size can be used for achieving a defined and homogenous size. However, long-term culture and differentiation of clusters in microwell arrays is generally not possible due to accumulation of cell debris, which is detrimental to cell viability and function. Therefore, clusters are transferred to standard culture platforms for continued differentiation, where they can again grow in size and agglomerate. Moreover, frequent medium changes and functionality testing (Glucose stimulated insulin secretion; GSIS) can present logistical difficulties, often requiring multiple centrifugation and resuspension steps to prevent loss of clusters during the process. Spinner flasks can also be used in order to provide a dynamic environment and prevent agglomeration of clusters but being low throughput renders them unsuitable for parallel testing of multiple growth and differentiation factors.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">Microwell arrays have also been incorporated in microfluidic devices to sequester spheroids in individual microwells, provide control over fluid flow and test islets a dynamic manner.

Moreover, there are several other disadvantages associated with conventional microfluidic devices. Medium flow across the face of microwell (tangential) can be inadequate in providing complete medium exchange, especially for deeper microwells. It has been shown that devices with islets trapped in cup shaped nozzles (open on both ends) stimulated intracellular flow, resulting in enhanced &#x3b2;-cell preservation. Additionally, fabrication of these devices generally requires cleanrooms and specialized equipment for soft lithography. The fabrication material (polydimethylsiloxane; PDMS) is unsuitable due to absorption of hydrophobic reagents, which decreases their intended concentration, and leaching of small molecules like endocrine disruptor cyclosilane into the medium. To overcome this limitation, non-porous thermoplastics like Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) have been used for fabrication. However, they are not conducive to gas exchange and a sealed PMMA microfluidic chip might not be suitable for hypoxia-sensitive islets. Furthermore, permanent bonding or sealing of devices can also make cell loading and recovery for downstream analysis difficult, discouraging their widespread adoption. Therefore, the development of an open culture platform that restricts cluster size, allows removal of cell debris, enables direct perfusion flow of medium, high-resolution real-time imaging and easier retrievability of clusters would be well-suited for manufacturing (formation, differentiation, maturation, maintenance and testing) of ILCs.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">Taken together, there is a need for an open, long-term culture system that provides robust control on the fluidic, biophysical and biochemical microenvironment and allows for multiple characterization and functional readouts in order to optimize critical factors that positively affect the differentiation, maturation and function of ILCs.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">Our approach is innovative for at least three reasons: 1) a 3D microwell-based perfusion plate that supports the formation, long-term culture, dynamic testing and simultaneous live-cell imaging of islet-like clusters (ILCs); 2) a &#x201c;gentler&#x201d; pancreas decellularization method that preserves essential compounds (Glycosaminoglycans and other small molecules), and the subsequent potent solubilized dECM powder that can be used as a medium additive; 3) combination of the two that provides the essential spatial, biochemical and biophysical cues in a dynamic milieu, to create a physiomimetic niche for manufacturing ILCs.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">As described herein, we have recently developed an open cell culture platform that combines the advantages of microfluidic chips, bioreactors and microwell arrays. This microwell perfusion platform would enable the formation and guided differentiation of homogenously sized ILCs from human embryonic stem cell (hESC)&#x2014;derived pancreatic progenitor (PP) cells, while preventing their agglomeration, which could lead to diffusion limitations. The platform geometry enables direct flow of medium (through the microwells) rather than tangential (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), eliminating the possibility of inadequate medium exchange associated with traditional microwell-based devices. Such direct fluid flow, along with the combination of the through-pore microwell and transwell membranes would also allow for the removal of cell debris and prevent its accumulation in the microwells during differentiation. Perfusion would also enable easier change of growth factors and medium during different stages of differentiation and maturation and create bioreactor-like conditions but at a higher throughput. The plate was fabricated using rapid prototyping techniques, like laser machining and hot embossing, using non-absorbent and inert materials (polystyrene; PS &#x26; acrylic; PMMA) and has a standard multiwell plate footprint. The platform is compatible with standard imaging platforms for time-resolved assessment of cellular readouts, and rapid assessment of islet functionality, such as in-plate dynamic GSIS. Moreover, the plate eliminates the need for manually counting and picking of clusters for performing GSIS and same ILCs can be tested multiple times over the differentiation period to establish a time-profile. The design being an open-well plate, rather than a closed islet-on-chip, would provide optimum oxygen exchange and allow manual access for cell seeding, sampling and recovery of ILCs for analysis or other applications like 3D bioprinting and implantation. As the fluidic connections are through the lid rather than the body of the plate, the system can be easily disconnected from the fluidics by replacing it with a regular lid for easier routine microscopy, eliminating the need to transfer the fluidic setup (pump and tubing).</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">These methods have never been combined to develop a single platform for manufacturing (formation, differentiation, maturation, maintenance and testing) of ILCs from hIPSC-derived PP cells. Moreover, the microwell perfusion plate could provide a worthwhile alternative to both bioreactor-based maturation of ILCs and to perform perifusion assay (GSIS) for research groups that lack access or technical skill. Pancreatic dECM has been proposed here as a means of providing physiologically relevant biochemical factors to the ILCs. However, following a similar template, the microwell perfusion plate could also be used as a medium throughput screening platform (ILCs-on-a-chip) for parallel testing of several other biochemical factors, individually or in combination. Through this research, we will demonstrate proof of concept and open doors to innovations in the field of islet biology and eventually diabetes treatment. This system can also be adopted for the maintenance of human islets, maturation of neonatal porcine islets as well as other organ systems.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">More points: 1) Mini-bioreactor for stem cell derived organoids; 2) One platform/device for biomanufacturing&#x2014;formation, differentiation, maturation, maintenance and testing of organoids&#x2014;streamline and semi-automate; 3) Continuous in-plate monitoring with dynamic assays and real-time imaging&#x2014;generate a time profile for organoid characteristics (phenotype, function etc); 4) parallel testing of multiple conditions&#x2014;medium throughput.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">The plate exists in two configurations &#x2014;static and perfusion&#x2014;with the through-pore microwell membrane (Polystyrene; PS) bonded onto a porous transparent transwell membrane (Polycarbonate; PC) being central to both. The body was fabricated by laser micromachining multiple PMMA layers with integrated fluidic channels and the PS and PC membranes were sandwiched between them (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>, <b>23</b></figref>) The whole assembly was then bonded onto a well of a standard six-well plate (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>, <b>26</b></figref>). The organoid culture well can accommodate 200 ILCs (one in each microwell) in order to produce enough insulin to be in the linear detection range of the Insulin ELISA. The plate offers control over parameters such as number of microwells per well and the flow rate, by changing the height of the cell culture well (hydrostatic head) and pore size of the PC transwell membrane (5, 8 or 10 &#x3bc;m). The bottom layer of outlet channel is laser cut directly on the 6 well plate and bonded with a #1 coverslip for reducing the height of ILCs from the microscope lens and providing optical accessibility for improved high-resolution imaging.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">The key design difference between the static and perfusion plates is the medium residence volume, governed by the shape of channels. It has been maximized in the static plate (&#x2dc;2 ml) to reduce the frequency of medium changes, while reduced in dynamic (&#x2dc;600 ul) to minimize the dead volume. The lid for the perfusion plate has metal couplers (27 gauge) that connect the inlet and outlet to a peristaltic pump via silicone tubing. The feed rate of the pump can be attuned to maintain a constant medium height, thus a constant flow rate. The fluidic circuit of the perfusion plate has also been fitted with switches for inflow of low or high glucose solutions for performing dynamic GSIS. This platform would result in high cluster number per unit area, minimize loss of clusters during medium change, while allowing for high retrievability of clusters, removal of cell debris, adequate oxygen exchange and separation of apical and basal medium as well as high resolution imaging and in-plate functional testing (static or dynamic GSIS) of ILCs.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">Our strategy is to combine a novel microwell-based perfusion plate with human pancreatic dECM to develop a physiomimetic 3D niche that should result in improved yield, viability and function of ILCs.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">The liquid column (hydrostatic head; height or depth of cell culture well) will dictate the hydrostatic pressure on the membrane, which needs to be high enough to drive out cell debris during medium change.

Different depths (3, 6, 7.5 and 9 mm) will be tested and the minimum depth that results in the removal of cell debris during medium change will be determined and used for further experiments.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">Access to commercial perifusion systems needed to conduct dynamic GSIS is limited to a few research institutes dedicated to diabetes research.

The use of islet transplantation to provide a replacement for the lost insulin-producing cells has proven to be an effective therapy, resulting in restoration of insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis, and preventing complications associated with T1D. Therefore, extensive efforts have been directed towards generating functional &#x3b2; cells or islet-like clusters (ILCs) from inexhaustible resources like human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC). However, a major barrier in generating insulin-producing cells is the considerably low yield of the differentiation process and the inability to sustain mature &#x3b2; cells in culture. This inability to obtain &#x3b2; cell maturity and maintain function in culture underscores the significance of bioengineering a physiomimetic pancreatic niche. Here, we have identified three design components that should be incorporated in the culture system to engineer a physiologically relevant microenvironment for long-term culture, functional maturation and maintenance of ILCs: 1) the use of a microwell array to produce homogenously sized ILCs and prevent agglomeration, 2) the incorporation of perfusion to allow for continuous medium exchange, provide mechanical cues and removal of debris and 3) human pancreatic dECM to provide more relevant biochemical cues. The rationale for including these three factors in the platform is described below.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">Conventional culture platforms. In conventional cultures, hPSCs are aggregated and cultured under suspension culture, and differentiated following sequential induction through Definitive Endoderm (DE), pancreatic progenitor (PP 1, 2) and endocrine progenitor (EN) stages. At the EN stage, the clusters are dissociated, sorted for monohormonal &#x25a1;-like cells, re-aggregated and matured further under suspension culture. Such suspension culture of the iPSCs, however, often results in uncontrolled cluster formation, which compromises mature function. As there is no physical constraint on size and separation, clusters tend to grow over time or agglomerate, leading to diffusion limitations. Microwell arrays that physically restrict spheroid size can be used for achieving and retaining defined and homogenous cluster size. However, long-term culture and differentiation of clusters in microwell arrays is generally not possible due to accumulation of cell debris, which is detrimental to cell viability and function. Therefore, clusters are transferred to standard culture platforms for continued differentiation, where they can grow in size and agglomerate. Moreover, frequent medium changes and functionality testing (glucose stimulated insulin secretion: GSIS) can present logistical difficulties, often requiring multiple centrifugation and resuspension steps to prevent loss of clusters during the process. Spinner flasks can also be used in order to provide a dynamic environment and prevent agglomeration of clusters but being low throughput renders them unsuitable for parallel testing of the effects of multiple growth and differentiation factors on &#x3b2; cell maturation and functionality.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">Microfluidic Devices. Microwell arrays have also been incorporated in microfluidic devices to sequester spheroids in individual microwells, provide control over fluid flow and test islets in a dynamic manner. Although, such devices might be suited for testing and characterization of islets, they cannot be easily adapted for long-term culture, differentiation and maturation of ILCs. Moreover, there are several disadvantages associated with conventional microfluidic devices. Medium flow across the face of microwell (tangential) can be inadequate in providing complete medium exchange, especially for deeper microwells. It has been shown that devices with islets trapped in cup shaped nozzles (open on both ends) that enabled direct intracellular flow, resulted in enhanced &#x3b2;-cell preservation. Additionally, fabrication of these devices generally requires cleanrooms and specialized equipment for soft lithography. The fabrication material (polydimethylsiloxane; PDMS) is unsuitable due to protein absorption, which decreases their intended concentration, and leaching of small molecules like endocrine disruptor cyclosilane into the medium. To overcome this limitation, non-porous thermoplastics like Polydimethyl methacrylate (PMMA) have been used for fabrication. However, they are not conducive to gas exchange and a sealed PMMA microfluidic chip might not be suitable for hypoxia-sensitive islets. Furthermore, permanent bonding or sealing of devices can also make cell loading and recovery for downstream analysis difficult, discouraging their widespread adoption. Recently, it was shown that culture of IPSC-derived kidney organoids under perfusion conditions in a fluidic chip can result in enhanced phenotypic and functional maturation of the organoids, compared to static conditions. However, the effect of perfusion and fluid flow on the maturation of ILCs has not been investigated yet. Therefore, the development of an open culture platform that restricts cluster size, allows removal of cell debris, enables direct perfusion of culture media and high-resolution real-time imaging with easier retrievability of clusters would be well-suited for manufacturing (formation, differentiation, maturation, maintenance and testing) of ILCs.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">Taken together, there is a need for an open, long-term culture system that provides robust control on the fluidic, biophysical and biochemical microenvironment and allows for multiple characterization and functional readouts in order to optimize critical factors that positively affect the differentiation, maturation and function of ILCs.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">Our approach is innovative for three reasons: 1) a 3D microwell-based perfusion plate that supports the formation, long-term culture, dynamic testing and simultaneous live-cell imaging of ILCs; 2) a &#x201c;gentler&#x201d; pancreas decellularization method that preserves essential compounds (glycosaminoglycans and other small molecules), generating a potent solubilized dECM powder (lyophilized) that can be used as a culture media additive; 3) the combination of the two that provides the critical spatial, biochemical and biophysical cues in a dynamic milieu, to create a physiomimetic niche for manufacturing ILCs.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">We have recently developed an open cell culture platform that combines the advantages of microfluidic chips, bioreactors and microwell arrays.
