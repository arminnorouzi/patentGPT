There is currently an increased interest in the cytokine storm syndrome. Thus, a Google search in 2011 resulted in 170,000 hits for cytokine storm, while a Google search for &#x201c;cytokine storm&#x201d; in 2021 gave about 6.9 million hits. A cytokine storm is not a disease in itself, but is a syndrome, which is an endpoint of different initial insults, most often by microbes, such as bacteria, fungi or viruses. The term &#x201c;hypercytokinemia&#x201d; is herein used synonymously with the term &#x201c;cytokine storm syndrome&#x201d; or just &#x201c;cytokine storm.&#x201d; Dermal hypercytokinemias refer to severe forms of dermal diseases that have demanded corticosteroidal rescue medication. Hypercytokinemias are caused by the immune system after a group of germ-line-encoded proteins, named pattern-recognition receptors, initiate an uncontrolled and excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to the initial microbial or allergic insult.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A hypercytokinemia can be systemic, but is most often local, as usually is the case for patient suffering from dermal diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and chronic urticaria. Symptoms of systemic hypercytokinemia include fever, widespread pain, shortness of breath, low blood pressure and high heart rate. The laboratory findings usually include abnormally high liver enzymes, elevated inflammatory disease markers like TNF&#x3b1; and/or IL-6 and high ferritin levels. It has been suggested that high ferritin levels may be used as a litmus test for systemic cytokine storm.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">No universally recommended treatment exists for patients with hypercytokinemia. Current experimental use includes the administration of a corticosteroid, cyclosporine and the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab, which is an injected monoclonal antibody, irreversibly targeting the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) for up to several weeks.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">What is needed for the treatment of hypercytokinemia are orally, topically and parenterally active drugs that simultaneously inhibit the release of the cytokines and chemokines that cause the often fatal condition of hypercytokinemia. Chemokines are often referred to as being types of cytokines. For the sake of simplicity, chemokines are therefore in this document often referred to as cytokines. As examples, the chemokines MCP-1 and MIP-1&#x3b1; are referred to herein as cytokines.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an aspect, a method of reducing the incidence and/or intensity of a symptom of dermal hypercytokinemia in a patient suffering from an underlying dermal condition who develops the dermal hypercytokinemia as a consequence of the underlying dermal condition comprises orally administering, intravenously administering, subcutaneously administering, intramuscularly injecting, topically administering or dermally administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of norketotifen as a free base, an isomer, an isomeric mixture, a prodrug or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein the symptom of dermal hypercytokinemia is an eruption of new dermal lesions accompanied by intense lesional and/or non-lesional pruritus.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As reported herein, norketotifen (NK) has now been found to inhibit the release of numerous mediators&#x2014;cytokines and chemokines&#x2014;from various granulocytes, such as white blood cells. The term granulocyte, as used herein, refers to a cell with secretory granules in its cytoplasm, i.e. neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, mast cells and keratinocytes.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Described herein are methods of treating dermal hypercytokinemia, specifically reducing the incidence and/or intensity of dermal hypercytokinemia or a symptom thereof, in a patient suffering from an underlying dermal condition such as a dermal viral, bacterial, mold or fungal infection, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis or chronic urticaria, the method comprising administering, to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of norketotifen, an isomer, an isomeric mixture, a prodrug, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In an aspect, the symptom of dermal hypercytokinemia is an eruption of new dermal lesions accompanied by intense lesional and/or non-lesional pruritus.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As used herein, dermal hypercytokinemia is a local hypercytokinemia caused by a local release of cytokines in or to the skin. Dermal hypercytokinemia is typically characterized by an eruption of new dermal lesions and by intense lesional and/or non-lesional pruritus. Dermal hypercytokinemia causes a significant reduction in quality of life, often in the form of unbearable pruritus.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an aspect, the patient has not been previously treated with norketotifen for the underlying dermal condition. In another aspect, the patient has been previously treated with norketotifen for the underlying dermal condition but has stopped treatment with norketotifen prior to developing the dermal hypercytokinemia.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an aspect, the norketotifen is administered topically or dermally as a rescue medication for immediate relief of the symptom of dermal hypercytokinemia.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an aspect, the method further comprises diagnosing the dermal hypercytokinemia by determining from a lesional tissue skin biopsy from the patient a 2-fold or higher increase of one or more of TNF&#x3b1;, IL-4, IL-,5, IL-13, IFNG, INF&#x3b3;, TGF&#x3b2;-1 concentrations compared to normal tissue concentrations.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further aspect, the underlying dermal condition is a dermal viral infection, a dermal bacterial infection, a dermal fungal infection, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, chronic urticaria, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Norketotifen is a potent, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent. In addition to its anti-inflammatory activity, norketotifen expresses anti-microbial effects against several types of bacteria, fungi and mold that may have infected the skin of patients suffering from dermal diseases.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Norketotifen is also a highly effective inhibitor of the release of cytokines and chemokines, such as those shown in Example 2. Advantageously, norketotifen is a small molecule and administration of norketotifen can provide for oral or topical administration and at very significant cost savings when compared with monoclonal antibodies. In addition, norketotifen is not a steroid and is therefore free from the adverse steroidal effects.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The term &#x201c;human TNF&#x3b1;&#x201d; (abbreviated herein as TNF) refers to a human cytokine that exists as a 17 kD secreted form and a 26 kD membrane associated form, the biologically active form of which is composed of a trimer of noncovalently bound 17 kD molecules. The structure of TNF&#x3b1; is described in the art (Tumor Necrosis Factor; Wikipedia). The term human TNF&#x3b1; is intended to include recombinant human TNF&#x3b1;, which can be prepared by standard recombinant expression methods or purchased commercially. Canine TNF&#x3b1; is closely related to human TNF&#x3b1;.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An advantage of using norketotifen for the treatment of dermal hypercytokinemia in a patient, e.g., a human or canine patient, suffering from a dermal microbial infection is that the risk for adverse corticosteroidal effects will be decreased or even avoided. Unlike corticosteroids which typically must be dosed at the lowest dose possible, norketotifen has surprisingly low toxicity and may be used in high oral doses and high topical concentrations (Example 4). Importantly, oral administration of norketotifen has been found to result in surprisingly high dermal concentrations of the drug. Example 3.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Thus, the use of norketotifen avoids numerous adverse effects of corticosteroids such as immunosuppression, adrenal gland atrophy; cataracts; facial hair growth; glaucoma; growth retardation in children; headache; high blood pressure; increased blood glucose and loss of diabetes control; loss of potassium; menstrual irregularity; muscle weakness; obesity; osteoporosis; puffiness of the face (moon face); slow wound healing; sodium and fluid retention causing edema and weight gain; thinning and easy bruising of the skin; ulcers in the stomach and duodenum; and other adverse steroidal effects.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The methods described herein relate to the prevention and treatment of dermal hypercytokinemia in a human and canine patients suffering from dermal viral, dermal bacterial and/or dermal fungal infections by orally administering, intravenously administering, subcutaneously administering, intramuscularly injecting, topically administering or dermally administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount or concentration of norketotifen as a free base, an isomer, an isomeric mixture, a prodrug or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In an aspect, the compound is racemic norketotifen.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Of particular note, after oral administration, norketotifen is rapidly absorbed and is surprisingly distributed to the skin, where the concentration of norketotifen can reach concentrations that are several times higher than the plasma concentration. Importantly, it was also found that the dermal residence time for norketotifen was significantly longer in the skin than in plasma as shown in Example 3.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">When compared with the plasma drug concentrations, the skin concentration of norketotifen under laboratory conditions was up to 16 times higher than the plasma concentration. Also, the duration of the high concentration of norketotifen in the skin (dermal half-life) was up to 168 hours (one week) while plasma half-life of NK was 10 to 12 hours). Patients who suffer from dermal disorders such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis or chronic urticaria will express multiple cytokines in their skin and may suffer from dermal hypercytokinemia. Leading experts have called an auto-immune dermal skin disease a product of a cytokine storm and the same investigators pointed out that inhibition of a single cytokine&#x2014;even if it is TNF&#x3b1;&#x2014;may not evoke significant activity to inhibit hypercytokinemia. However, norketotifen is the most potent mast cell inhibitor ever described and is simultaneously inhibiting the release of multiple cytokines is shown in Example 2. The unfortunate term &#x201c;mast cell inhibitor&#x201d; refers not only to mast cells, but to inhibition of the release of messenger proteins (such as cytokines and chemokines) from a variety of granulocytes.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, the term norketotifen refers to norketotifen free base, an isomer, an isomeric mixture, a prodrug, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. RS-norketotifen refers to racemic norketotifen. In an aspect, the term norketotifen stands for RS-norketotifen hydrogen fumarate. Norketotifen is an achiral molecule, but has two atropisomers, S-norketotifen and R-norketotifen, as has previously been described by Aberg et al. in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,226,934 and 7,557,128.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Isomeric norketotifen can be used, but the current inventors have found that isomeric norketotifen is rapidly racemized after administration to humans or to dogs. Example 3.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As explained in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,226,934 and 7,557,128, norketotifen had significant sedative effects when studied in an art-accepted mouse model of sedation, and further, the sedative effects were attributed to the R-isomer. It was thus proposed that only the S-isomer could be administered without sedative side effects. It has later been found by the current inventors that orally administered RS-norketotifen is free from sedative side effects in dogs (U.S. Pat. No. 8,557,846) and in humans (U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,138,431 and 9,345,697). Therefore, unlike for ketotifen, no dose-limiting sedative adverse effects exist for norketotifen, even after high oral doses of norketotifen to humans or dogs.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Norketotifen can be made using methods known in the art, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,682,930, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference for its teaching of the synthesis of norketotifen.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A prodrug of norketotifen is defined as a compound that after administration to a mammal can be converted to norketotifen. Prodrugs of norketotifen include N-substituted hydroxyalkyl or carboxyalkyloxyalkyl analogs thereof. Examples of such molecules are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,207,683. Thus, prodrugs of norketotifen include molecules of the formula</p><p id="p-0028" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="39.54mm" wi="29.04mm" file="US20230000852A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">wherein R is for example hydroxy-C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl or carboxy-C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>alkoxy-C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>alkyl. Additional prodrugs include substituents at the 8-position, the 10-position and/or in the 12 to 17 positions and/or inclusion of substituents on various positions on the piperidine ring.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable salts&#x201d; or &#x201c;a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof&#x201d; refer to norketotifen salts, which have been prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids. Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable acid as for the compound of the present invention include acetic, benzenesulfonic (besylate), benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pathothenic, phosphoric, p-toluenesulfonic, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, and the like. The hydrochloride salt and the hydrogen fumarate salt as well as the free base of norketotifen are particularly preferred.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">Embodiments disclosed herein provide for the oral and parenteral administration of norketotifen&#x2014;such as dermal, transdermal, rectal and vaginal administration of norketotifen or its pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">In an aspect, the norketotifen is administered orally in the form of a tablet, a capsule, or a syrup. In another aspect, the method further comprises co-administering none or more therapeutically active agent, selected from a group consisting of monoclonal antibody, a corticosteroid, a Jason kinas inhibitor, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">The dosage of NK to human and canine patients will follow the recommendations by the local regulatory authorities.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">Currently the recommendations by the inventors are that the oral dosage of norketotifen to a human patients suffering from dermal diseases shall start with a daily oral loading dose of from about 4 mg to about 30 mg of racemic norketotifen for 3 to 14 consecutive days, followed by a daily maintenance dose of NK, of 0.5 mg to 20 mg once or more times daily. The maintenance dosing will continue for as long as the human patient is suffering from the underlying disease. Canine patients may need oral loading doses of 4 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg of NK for 4 to 14 days, followed by a daily maintenance dose of 0.5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg for as long time as the canine patient carries the underlying disease. In an aspect, the norketotifen is administered as a maintenance dose one to six times weekly.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration of solid dosage forms of norketotifen include capsules, tablets, and liquid dosage forms, such as for example a syrup. In solid dosage forms, the therapeutically active compounds may be mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers (such as for example fumarate, sodium citrate, dicalcium phosphate), fillers (such as for example starch, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, silicic acid), binders (such as for example alginates, carboxymethylcellulose, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, acacia), humectants (such as for example glycerol), solution retarding agents (such as for example paraffin), disintegrating agents (such as for example agar-agar, calcium carbonate, starch, alginic acid, silicates, sodium carbonate), absorption accelerators (such as for example quaternary ammonium compounds), wetting agents (such as for example cetyl alcohol, glycerol monostearate), absorbents (such as for example kaolin, bentonite clay), lubricating agents (such as for example talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate), and/or other excipients, such as for example buffering agents. Solid forms of capsules, granules, pills, and tablets can have coatings and/or shells (such as for example enteric coatings) known in the art. The compositions may also be designed to release the active ingredient(s) in a certain part of the gastrointestinal tract or in a controlled release, slow-release or in a delayed-release manner. The active compound(s) can also be microencapsulated with one or more of the above-mentioned excipients or other suitable excipients.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of norketotifen include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. The liquid dosage form may also contain commonly known diluents (such as for example water, other solvents, solubilizing agents), emulsifiers, such as for example ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils, oleic acid, glycerol, polyethylene glycols, sorbitan, fatty esters, and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">The actual dosage levels of active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may be varied so as to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. Thus, the amount of drug used varies and will depend on factors such as the administration form, the severity of the disease, the frequency of dosing, and other circumstances (such as general health, body weight, age, etc.) known to the patient, the caregiver of the patient and/or the caring physician.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">In an aspect, the norketotifen can be orally or topically/dermally administered. Transdermal administration is also possible since norketotifen has been found to rapidly be absorbed into the skin and across the skin.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">The therapeutically effective oral doses of norketotifen useful for treating human patients with dermal conditions will be determined by the caring physician and are generally 1 mg to 50 mg (calculated as norketotifen free base), dosed orally as the free base or as a salt, such as for example the hydrochloride or mesylate salts or the hydrogen fumarate salt, once, twice or more times daily. In one embodiment, the treatment is once daily dosing. The therapeutically effective dose may be administered less than once daily, such as for example one to six times weekly, wherein administration is over at least a one-week period, as determined by the patient, the caretaker of the patient and/or the caring physician. In an aspect, the therapeutically effective amount of norketotifen, an isomer, an isomeric mixture, a prodrug or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for relief of dermal hypercytokinemia is administered topically or dermally at a concentration of about 0.1 percent to about 10 percent of norketotifen, calculated as norketotifen free base and administered one or more times daily. High doses of NK may be needed when NK is used as non-steroidal rescue medication for patients suffering from severe hypercytokinemia.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">In a dosing regimen, the method includes orally administering, intravenously administering, subcutaneously administering, intramuscularly injecting, topically administering or dermally administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a daily loading dose of the norketotifen, wherein the daily loading dose to the patient is administered from 3 consecutive days to 14 consecutive days or until a norketotifen-induced reduction in the symptom of dermal hypercytokinemia is observed, followed by orally administering, intravenously administering, subcutaneously administering, rectally administering, intramuscularly injecting, topically administering or dermally administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a daily maintenance dose of the norketotifen, wherein the daily loading dose and the daily maintenance dose are about 1 mg to 30 mg per day, and wherein the loading dose is at least two times greater than the maintenance dose.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">When the patient is a canine patient, the loading dose is 4 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg for 4 to 14 days, and the maintenance dose is 0.5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg once or more times daily.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">In an aspect, the norketotifen is administered as a maintenance dose one to six times weekly.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">In addition to the use of norketotifen as single-drug medication in human and canine patients, embodiments disclosed herein also provide methods for co-administration of norketotifen with a corticosteroid. Thus, as an example, norketotifen can be administered orally and the co-administered drug may also be administered orally or topically/dermally. Furthermore, norketotifen can be administered topically/dermally in combination with oral documentation to inhibit the release of cytokines from granulocytes or other cells or carriers. Thus, as an example, norketotifen may be administered orally once daily, while norketotifen in addition to the oral administration may be administered topically on the skin once or multiple times daily.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">Exemplary underlying dermal conditions include a dermal viral infection, a dermal bacterial infection, a dermal fungal infection, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis or chronic urticaria.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Psoriasis (PSO)</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0043">There are several forms of human psoriasis. Common forms of psoriasis are plaque psoriasis (the most common form of psoriasis, which causes dry, raised, red skin patches often called lesions), arthritic psoriasis (causes one or more painful joints in addition to dermal psoriatic symptoms), guttate psoriasis (most often affecting young adults and children; caused by initial bacterial infection), inverse psoriasis (mainly affecting skin folds; caused by initial fungus infection) and pustular psoriasis (rare form of psoriasis; causes clearly defined pus-filled lesions on palms of hands or the soles of feet). All forms of psoriasis are included herein under the term psoriasis.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">About 8 million Americans have psoriasis and worldwide 125 million people suffer from psoriasis. Psoriasis is not a cosmetic problem. Nearly 60 percent of people with psoriasis reported their disease to be a large problem in everyday life.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">Psoriasis is not generally thought of as a lethal disease, although a study from the UK concluded that the life expectancy for people with severe psoriasis is shorter than the lives of people without psoriasis. NK can be used as nonsteroidal rescue medication by patients suffering from severe psoriasis-related hypercytokinemia.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">The following cytokines have been reported to be over-expressed in lesional skin of psoriasis patients: TNF&#x3b1;, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, IL-18, IL-22, IL-23, IL-36, IL-37, INF&#x3b1;, MCP-1 and MIP-1a. To date, most of these cytokines (Example 4) have been tested herein and the release of all tested cytokines were inhibited by norketotifen with statistical significance.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">NK is particularly well suited for the treatment of psoriasis-related cytokine storms, which are caused by numerous cytokines and are called psoriasis-related hypercytokinemia. NK is an anti-inflammatory drug (Example 1) that potently inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from activated mast cells, activated eosinophils, activated leucocytes (Example 4) and other cells, such as keratinocytes that constitute 90 percent of all epidermal skin cells. NK can also be administered to patients at risk for development of psoriasis-related hypercytokinemia, such as patients expressing one or more early symptoms of psoriasis-related hypercytokinemia. Local lesions and local pruritus are symptoms of psoriasis and intensification of psoriatic lesions and/or intense pruritis are symptom of psoriasis-related hypercytokinemia.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">Numerous animal models of psoriasis exist. The Testerman Imiquimod model (Example 3) is considered to be the most predictive and most reliable model because imiquimod is causing the release of numerous cytokines that are identical to those released in psoriasis patients. The following cytokines are known to be involved in psoriasis, and all of them were significantly inhibited by NK:TNF&#x3b1;, IL-lb, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, INF&#x3b1;, MCP-1, MIP-1&#x3b1;.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Atopic Dermatitis (AD)</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0049">Through its inhibitory effects on the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, norketotifen will reduce the symptoms of dermal hypercytokinemia after topical/dermal applications of gels, creams or ointments containing norketotifen in concentrations ranging from about 0.5 to about 10 percent of norketotifen, calculated as free base, but also used as a salt. Those skilled in the art of topical drug application may realize that NK can also be delivered as a cataplasm (poultice) dermal delivery system that will offer rapid transdermal delivery of norketotifen in high (up to 10 percent if solubilizers such polyethylene glycol are used. Due to its significant accumulation of NK in the skin and its slow elimination from the skin (Example 5), norketotifen is likely to express dermal antimicrobial activity after systemic/oral administrations of high oral doses such as 10 to 20 milligrams, one or multiple times daily to patients suffering from dermal infections. Doses in the higher range may be needed as nonsteroidal rescue medication by patients suffering from severe AD-related hypercytokinemia. Norketotifen is a potent and dose-dependent inhibitor of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are involved in AD-related dermal hypercytokinemia (Example 2). Norketotifen is of these reasons well suited as medication for the treatment of patients suffering from AD-related dermal hypercytokinemia or for patients expressing early indication for risk for development of AD-related hypercytokinemia. Early indications for the development of AD-related hypercytokinemia include the appearance of multiple new lesions and/or the patient complaining of unusually severe pruritus. The following cytokines are known to be involved in AD-related hypercytokinemia: IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13 and TNF&#x3b1;. All of them were tested by the current inventors and the release of all of them from granulocytes were inhibited by NK (Example 2).</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria/Chronic Pruritus</heading><p id="p-0052" num="0050">Nomenclature: Urticaria is a disease, characterized by transient pruritic wheals. Pruritus is not a disease, but a symptom or a sensation. The classical definition of pruritus is &#x201c;an irritating sensation that makes you want to scratch.&#x201d; Urticaria is often diagnosed in dogs where it is often referred to as &#x201c;hives&#x201d; or &#x201c;rashes.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">Urticaria has numerous etiologies. Various receptors are involved such as TRPA1, TRPV1, PAR-2, gastrin-releasing peptides, Mas-related G-proteins, histamine receptors, nerve growth factor and Substance P. It is also known that itch is caused by a complex interface between skin, keratinocytes, cutaneous nerve fibers, pruritogenic molecules and the peripheral and central nervous systems. In recent years, pruritus-research has centered on specific cytokines (mainly IL-31) that has been shown to be involved in pruritus and a monoclonal antibody for dogs is targeting IL-31 (Cytopoint&#xae;, Zoetis) and has therapeutic effects in many pruritic canine patients.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">Cytokines involved in chronic urticaria are TNF&#x3b1;, IL-1, IL4, IL-5, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1a, IL-31, IL-13 and IFN&#x3b3;.

A psoriasiform skin condition was induced by repeated applications of an IMO-cream on the pre-shaved skin of the back of mice for 6 days, using Aldana 5% cream (IMQ-cream), at a dose of 62.5 mg per mouse, which is equal to 3.125 mg active per mouse. Starting from day 3 of dosing the skin was scored for Redness, Thickness and Scaling using a scoring system on the scale of 0 to 4, where 0=none; 1=slight; 2=moderate; 3=marked; and 4=very marked. The cumulative scores (erythema plus scaling plus thickness) served as a measure of the severity of dermal, psoriasis-like inflammation. On Day 6, about 22 hours after previous day IMQ-cream application, mice from each group were observed for 30 minutes for scratch bouts (itching). A scratch bout was defined as one or more rapid back-and-forth hind paw motions directed toward and contacting the IMQ-treated area.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0060">Group 1: (IMQ Positive Control Group): 4 mice were treated as described above.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0061">Group 2: 4 mice were given NK 10 mg/kg/day, PO, starting 3 days before the first application of IMQ.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0062">Group 3: same treatment as Group 2, but the dose of NK was 20 mg/kg/day.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0063">Group 4: same treatment as Group 3, but the dose of NK was 30 mg/kg/day.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0062" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>EFFECTS OF NK AGAINST INTENSE PRURITUS</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="112pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Group Treatment</entry><entry>Scratching bouts</entry><entry>SEM</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="112pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>IMQ 5%-topically applied (control)</entry><entry>40.23</entry><entry>31.62</entry></row><row><entry>IMQ + NK 10 mg/kg-oral dose</entry><entry>7.0</entry><entry>1.58</entry></row><row><entry>IMQ + NK 20 mg/kg-oral dose</entry><entry>4.25</entry><entry>1.03</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Conclusions</heading><p id="p-0063" num="0064">There was a dose-dependent effect of NK on scratching in mice, although the effect was not statistically significant (p&#x3e;0.05), because one positive control mouse was an obvious outlier.
