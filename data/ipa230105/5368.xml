A parking meter is set up for an individual parking space which accepts cash or other payment while a pay-and-display machine which works for multiple parking spaces rely on a customer to purchase a ticket from the machine and display the ticket on the vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Parking meters and pay-and-display machines are commonly used for regulating parking in parking lots. Parking meters have to be set up at individual parking space, and they either require regular service to empty the coins or additional costs to enable other type of payments at individual meters. Further, drivers can very often take advantage of parking meters that have time remaining. Pay-and-display machines differ from road-side parking meters in that one machine can service multiple vehicle spaces, resulting in lower set up costs. In addition, these machines generally accept payments other than cash so that costs associated with services to empty coin are lower. These machines also reduce the occurrence of drivers taking advantage of parking meters that have time remaining. However, it can get really inconvenient and time consuming for a drive to input correct information about his/her vehicle, indicate a specific space number that he or she parks. Any possible error during data entry may further propagate to enforcement, such as issuing a ticket with the incorrect plate number. Additionally, it becomes extremely troublesome when a machine fails to properly print a receipt to be displayed on the dashboard after a payment. As such, there is an unmet need to provide a simpler, faster, and more reliable parking and pay regime.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The pay stations, methods, and platforms disclosed herein enable an easy-to-use, fast, convenient, and reliable parking and pay regime. Main advantages associated with the pay stations, methods, and platforms herein include complete elimination of mistakes that can be generated at pay-and-display machine during data entry; fast and convenient identification of the parking customer and vehicles, easy-to-use and highly efficient payment via mobile payment or via pre-selected payment or pre-set payment at a remote a central server, significantly reduced cost and time in enforcement without the need to manually check the payment verifications on dashboards. Further, such pay stations or platforms reduce regular service or set-up at individual parking space, thus, greatly save the overall costs. Additional features such as parking reminder or prepaid account, that are not feasible with the traditional parking regimens are also enabled with the pay stations, methods, and platforms disclosed herein. The disclosure herein also enables the parking user to use easy-to-remember alias which are associated with actual license plate numbers so that the user do not have to remember or select the actual license plate when the user is at the parking pay station. The pay stations, methods, and platforms disclosed herein also advantageous allow a parking user who uses mobile payment for parking to get printed payment verification at the pay station, which is not feasible with traditional mobile payments. The pay stations, methods, and platforms disclosed herein can also be adapted for use in payment for various admissions other than parking so that a user could easily and conveniently pay for event, services, or other admissions just like parking and have a printed payment verification at the pay station.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, disclosed herein are multispace parking pay stations comprising: a at least one processor, a memory, a communications element, a printer, and a computer program including instructions executable by the at least one processor to create an application comprising: a software module receiving a unique identifier associated with a parking customer, the parking customer having executed a mobile payment for parking in a space associated with the pay station; a software module transmitting the unique identifier to a central parking management server and querying the central parking management server with the unique identifier to identify the parking customer and verify the mobile payment; and a software module generating and sending instructions to the printer to print a payment verification for the parking customer.

Parking meters have to be set up at individual parking space, and they either require regular service to empty the coins or additional costs to enable other type of payments at individual meters. Further, drives can very often take advantage of parking meters that have time remaining. Pay-and-display machines differ from road-side parking meters in that one machine can service multiple vehicle spaces, resulting in lower set up costs. In addition, these machines generally accept payments other than cash so that costs associated with services to empty coin are lower. These machines also reduce the occurrence of drivers taking advantage of parking meters that have time remaining. However, it can get really inconvenient and time consuming for a drive to input correct information about his/her vehicle, indicate a specific space number that he or she parks. Any possible error during data entry may further propagate to enforcement, such as issuing a ticket with the incorrect plate number. Additionally, it becomes extremely troublesome when a machine fails to properly print a receipt to be displayed on the dashboard after a payment. As such, there is an unmet need to provide a simpler, faster, and more reliable parking and pay regime.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The pay stations, methods, and platforms disclosed herein enable an easy-to-use, fast, convenient, and reliable parking and pay regime. Main advantages associated with the pay stations, methods, and platforms herein include complete elimination of mistakes that can be generated at pay-and-display machine during data entry; fast and convenient identification of the parking customer and vehicles, easy-to-use and highly efficient payment via mobile payment or via pre-selected payment or pre-set payment at a remote a central server, significantly reduced cost and time in enforcement without the need to manually check the payment verifications on dashboards. Further, such pay stations or platforms do not require regular service or set-up at individual parking space, thus, greatly save the overall costs. Additional features such as parking reminder or prepaid account, that are not feasible with the traditional parking regimens are also enabled with the pay stations, methods, and platforms disclosed herein. The disclosure herein also enables the parking user to use easy-to-remember alias which are associated with actual license plate numbers so that the user do not have to remember or select the actual license plate when the user is at the parking pay station. The pay stations, methods, and platforms disclosed herein also advantageous allow a parking user who uses mobile payment for parking to get printed payment verification at the pay station, which is not feasible with traditional mobile payments.

In some cases, the parking pay stations herein include a sensor that can directly read or scan a unique identifier associated with the parking customer or his/her vehicle. Further information of the parking customer and his/her vehicle can be obtained based on the unique identifier and query to the central parking management sever, so that data entry at the parking pay station at the time of parking can be minimized. As a result, possible errors during manual information entry can be avoided. In some cases, the parking pay stations herein communicate with a central parking management sever so that easy, fast, and convenient payment may be executed at the central parking management sever using prepaid user account or pre-registered payment method so that the parking customer is not required to provide payment method at the pay station, hence, the parking pay stations disclosed herein significantly save time and reduce possible information breach than traditional pay stations. Alternatively, disclosed herein are mobile payments that can be easily executed at parking pay stations or other digital devices associated therewith. Parking enforcement can also be greatly simplified without manual checking of payment verification on individual dashboards. Instead, the payment and parking information associated with each parked vehicle are stored and management at the central parking management sever, and the operator may easily scan license plates with hand-held device that communicates with the management sever to identify payment or non-payment of parked vehicles.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some cases, the parking pay stations, methods, and platforms herein includes a central parking management server with which parking users can create an account that also includes the license plates they own. Optionally, the parking user may also register credit card or other information with the central server to be linked to the license plate(s) they own. In some cases, when a parking user swipes a card or enters a registered account at a parking station, the parking pay station communicate with the central parking management system, optionally for payment authorization, and for searching and locating existing account registered. In some cases, any license plates linked to the registered account of the user may be displayed on the screen for the user to select. In some embodiments, the actual license plates may be replaced by user-defined alias so that the user do not need to remember or select the license plate number at the pay station but only the easy-to-remember alias. Therefore, paying is made easier, faster, and more convenient and mistakes in manual data entry are also prevented. The parking pay stations, methods, and platforms herein also advantageously provide a printed payment verification to the user which is not possible with traditional mobile payments. Further, the pay stations, methods, and platforms herein can be easily adapted for use in payment for events, activities, services, or admissions other than parking so that payments for various admissions are easier and more convenient than traditional payments.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Unique Identifier</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some cases, the pay stations, methods, and platforms disclosed herein include a unique identifier. In some cases, the unique identifier may be input at the parking pay station via a sensor or user interaction with an input device.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some cases, the unique identifier may be used to provide identification of the parking customer or identification of an account associated with the parking customer, optionally with the central parking management system/server. In some cases, such unique identification may be used locally or transmitted to a remote device for identification of a parking customer. For example, the unique identifier may be a credit card, debit card, or driver's license of the user. After parking pay station reads the unique identifier, the information of the unique identifier may be transmitted to the central management server for identification of the parking customer and additional information associated therewith.

In some cases, the camera captures images or videos) of objects, including but not limited to, parking users, customers or payee at the parking pay station, pedestrians, parked vehicles, moving vehicles, police officers, maintenance workers, missing persons, fugitives, and vandals. The captured images or videos are called camera data. In some cases, a computer network or a network communications element is configured to transmit camera data via the computer network or the network, and the application further comprises a software module performing biometric recognition on the camera data to determine the identity of the objects in the camera data. In some cases, the application further comprises a software module applying one or more computer vision algorithms to the camera data to determine one or more characteristics of the objects in the camera data. In some cases, the camera data are used to aid in the detection of vehicles, the detection of vandalism, the identification of criminals/vandals/parking users/customers/payees/missing persons/police officers/maintenance workers, or the biometric/facial recognition of the customers/payees at the parking pay station when they are making payments via the parking pay station. In some cases, the camera is integrated with other functions of the parking pay station. In certain cases when the parking pay station displays an advertisement either on a display screen or a speaker, the camera concurrently capture some camera data about the objects (i.e., people who may be watching or listening to the advertisement) in the vicinity of the display screen or the speaker. In some cases, the camera data are analyzed by the application to determine the effects of the display advertisement on the objects. In certain cases, the results of the analysis by the application comprise: the number of objects receive the advertisement, the reactions of the objects toward the advertisements. In some cases, the demographics of the objects who viewed/heard the advertisement are analyzed and correlated with the contents of the advertisement. In certain case, the analysis shows that different demographic groups react differently to the same advertisement. In other cases, the analysis shows that different demographic groups react similarly to the same advertisement. In some cases, the results of the analysis are used to improve the reception of the advertisement. In some cases, the application comprises artificial intelligence, big-data, and/or machine-learning sub-programs. In some cases, the camera data are analyzed to identify suspects for crimes or other type of misconducts, wanted fugitives, or missing persons. In certain cases, the application uses the artificial intelligence and facial recognition sub-program to identify people of interest.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0132">In some cases, the sensor is physically located on a parking pay station.

As an example, the sensor may be on a hand-held device so that an operator of the parking facility can carry to scan license plates of the parked vehicles for enforcement.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0133">In some cases, the sensor may need to be in contact or in close vicinity to the unique identifier (for example, within 1 cm) in order to properly function. In alternative cases, the sensor may remotely sense a unique identifier from greater than about 1, 5, 10, or even 50 meters in distance.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0134">In some cases, the sensor may be capable of sensing a unique identifier under different light condition or weather conditions.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0135">In some embodiments, the pay stations herein include a processor, a digital processing device, or use of the same.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0136">Communications Elements</p><p id="p-0096" num="0137">In some cases, the pay stations, methods, and platforms disclosed herein include a communications element. In some cases, the central parking management server, the hand-held device, or other target devices herein include a communications element. Such communications elements enable data transmission among different devices. Such data includes any information pertaining to the pay stations, methods, and platforms disclosed herein. Non-limiting example of such data may include but is not limited to information of the parking customer, the vehicles of the parking customer, payment, method of payment, payment verification, payment reminder, advertisement, or a combination thereof. Additionally such communications elements enable transmission of various commands, queries, request, or responses among different devices. For example, the pay station may send a query to the central parking server with the user's driver's license via the communications element to check if the user has a pre-paid account or not. As another example, a hand-held device may send a request to the central parking server with a license plate to check payment or nonpayment of the license plate.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0138">In some cases, such element is a wireless communications element, a wired communication element, or both. Non-limiting examples of the wireless communication elements include a Bluetooth element, a WIFI element, a satellite element, a microwave element, Infrared (IR) element, a ZigBee element, a mobile phone network, or a broadcast element.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0139">In some cases, such communications element is used for communication, either unidirectional or bi-directional. In some cases, such communication is among hand-held devices of parking operators, pay stations, the central sever, and other third party devices.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0140">In some cases, the communications element communicates directly with other target devices without the need for any intermediate devices. In alternative cases, the communications element communicates indirectly with other target devices via an intermediate device. As an example, the communications element of the parking pay station may transmit or receive signals from a base station or a satellite and then the base station or satellite transmits or receives signal a central parking management sever or a remote digital device.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0141">Central Parking Management Servers</p><p id="p-0101" num="0142">In some cases, the central parking management server herein communicates with one or more parking pay stations, one or more hand-held devices of the operator, and/or third party devices. In some cases, such server includes a processor, a digital processing device, an operation system, a communications element, a power source, a database, a memory, and a computer program including instructions executable by the processor to create a central parking management system/application. In some cases, the central parking management system/application includes a database.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0143">In some cases, the central parking management system or sever enables storage and retrieval of information related to parking customers and parking pay stations. In further cases, the central parking management system or sever stores an account of the parking customer, which may be uniquely associated with an account number or other information of the parking customer. In further cases, such account may be pre-paid so that payment may not be required on site when there is balance left in the prepaid account to save time. As such possible errors and security breaches that may occur during payment on site are eliminated.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0144">In some cases, the central parking management system or sever communicate with the parking pay stations and other third party devices. In some cases, the central parking management system or sever communicate with hand-held devices or other types of devices of the parking customers, the operators of the parking stations, parking enforcement personals, or a combination thereof. For example, the central server determines and sends response to queries regarding specific license plates for parking enforcement.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0145">In some cases, the parking pay station may communicate to query the central parking management server with the unique identifier to identify the parking customer. In some cases, the identification of the parking customer includes identification of a registered user ID, account, one or more payment methods, one or more vehicles associated therewith, and information associated with the vehicles, such as VIN numbers, license plates, model, make, color, or other information. After a registered account is identified at the central parking management sever, other information associated with the registered account may be used to facilitate parking data entry and payment for parking. As an example, if only one license plate of the user is registered under the users account, the central parking management system may automatically select the license plate number for parking and may send the license plate information along with other parking information such as a start time and an end time to a hand-held device of an enforcement officer. Alternatively, the central parking management sever may send a list of license plates that the parking user owns to be displayed at the parking pay station. The user then can select a license plate, optionally via a touch screen or a key pad. In other cases, the central parking management system or sever transmit information such as payment reminder, payment verification, or other information to the pay station, the mobile device of the user, the hand-held device of an operator, or other third-party devices.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0146">In some cases, the central parking management system or sever execute payment either using stored information or information transmitted from the pay parking station. As an example, the central parking management server may execute a mobile payment after the pay station transmits mobile payment information of the parking customer with other parking information, such as a start time and an end time. Alternatively, the server may directly execute a payment using a method of payment on record after the user's authorization.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0147">In some cases, the central parking management system or sever enable the user to add/edit/remove information associated with his or her account. In some cases, the central parking management system or sever generate user-specific information such as advertisement, payment reminder to be sent automatically to the user's mobile device or email account.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0148">In some cases, the central parking management system or sever includes an application, a software module, or application programmable interface (API) to enable additional features. In some cases, the central server automatically sends a parking reminder to the parking customer before or at a time when a paid parking time expires. In some cases, the central server automatically generates a notice of balance on an account associated with the parking customer to the parking customer. In further cases, the balance is displayed at the parking pay station. In other cases, the balance is sent via text, voice, and/or graphic messages.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0149">In some cases, the central server include an office portal or a software module by which frequent users can create an account, manage an account, create/edit a user profile, add/edit a payment method, register a vehicles, add/edit a vehicle's information, add/edit a frequently used parking pay station, add/edit a geolocation or region that he or she normally needs parking.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0150">In some cases, the central server determines an advertisement appropriate for the parking customer. In some cases, the advertisement is determined based, at least in part by, the identity of the parking customer, a parking history of the customer, a transaction history of the parking customer, a location of the pay station, a time of day, a day of a week, current promotions offered by nearby vendors, or a combination thereof. In some cases, advertisement is printed on the payment verification. In some cases, the advertisement is presented on a display of the parking pay station. In some cases, the advertisement is presented on a display of a mobile device of the parking customer.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0151">In some embodiments, the central management server described herein includes a processor, a digital processing device, or use of the same.
