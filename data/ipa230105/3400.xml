As the air flow passes through water-soaked porous evaporation panels, the water in the evaporation panels is evaporated without needing an external energy source. The heat required for water vaporization is provided directly by the air. In this way, the air flow is cooled and the moisture level thereof increases.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0007">The water supply system is used to control the water supply to the evaporation panels according to a setpoint, such as to maintain, e.g. a substantially constant moisture level, to increase or to reduce the moisture level in the room wherein the humidifying and cooling system is located. The control of the moisture level leads to maintaining, increasing or reducing the total exchange surface area of the system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0008">The position of the interface between the soaked portion and the dry portion of each of the evaporation panels varies during system operation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0009">The water dispersed over the evaporation panels still contains a fraction of minerals, even when same is deionized or permeated. The evaporation mechanism leads to the deposition of said minerals on the evaporation panels, more particularly at the interface between the soaked portion and the dry portion of each panel. This build-up of minerals harms the evaporation panels by reducing the porosity of the panels and thus reducing the efficiency thereof.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0010">One object of the present invention is to provide a humidifying and cooling system for the regular cleaning of the evaporation panels while maintaining a control over the humidifying level and cooling during said cleaning phases.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0011">For this purpose, the present invention relates to a humidifying and cooling system of the above-cited type, wherein the control unit comprises a plurality of control elements configured to control correspondingly, each of the supply flows, where the control elements can be controlled independently of each other between at least one evaporation configuration wherein the water supply flow-rate is substantially equal to a flow-rate of the water evaporated through the associated porous evaporation panel, and a cleaning configuration wherein the water supply flow-rate is greater than a flow-rate of the water that is evaporated through the associated porous evaporation panel that is completely soaked so as to result in water flowing out of the associated porous evaporation panel.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0012">In this way, the dispersing elements can be supplied independently of each other depending on the total exchange surface area required. In the evaporation configuration, the supply flow-rate creates a flow outside the evaporation panel at the bottom of the panel, dragging along by gravity, the minerals deposited on the evaporation panel. Said flow does not change the evaporation conditions of the evaporation panel and thus allows the evaporation panel to be cleaned. In this way, by controlling the configuration of the different control elements independently of each other, it is possible to clean the various porous evaporation panels while providing a precise control over the moisture level of the ambient air.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0013">According to different or supplementary embodiments, the humidifying and cooling system further includes one or more of
