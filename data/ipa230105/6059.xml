While such implementations may be expected to provide improvements in performance and/or reliability, no particular result is a requirement unless explicitly recited in a particular claim.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In switching converters, both power FETs and current sense FETs, which may be laterally diffused metal oxide semiconductor (LDMOS) transistors, can experience high drain/source voltage V<sub>DS </sub>during each switching event. One example is a low side FET in a buck converter, which may have a sense FET that experiences a high drain/source voltage V<sub>DS </sub>stress when the low side power FET turns off and the high side power FET turns on. Such switching events may activate parasitic BJTs and trigger premature breakdown of either the main power FET or the small sense FETs. Various examples of the present application may reduce the incidence of such premature breakdown events of the sense FETs.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a cross-section of an integrated circuit <b>400</b> that contains an LDMOS transistor <b>401</b> and an isolation tank <b>403</b> that encloses the LDMOS transistor <b>401</b>. Overlaid on the cross-section are schematic representations of several parasitic BJTs that may contribute to breakdown of the LDMOS transistor <b>401</b>. The LDMOS transistor <b>401</b> is fabricated on a substrate <b>402</b>, which in the implementation shown includes a P-type bulk silicon layer <b>404</b> and a P-type epitaxial layer <b>406</b>. An N-type buried layer (NBL) <b>408</b> has been formed between the P-type bulk silicon layer <b>404</b> and the P-type epitaxial layer <b>406</b>. An N-type drift region <b>410</b> within the P-type epitaxial layer <b>406</b> contains a shallow N-type well (SNWELL) <b>412</b> and an N-type drain region <b>414</b> within the SNWELL <b>412</b>. Also lying within the P-type epitaxial layer <b>406</b> is a shallow P-type well (SPWELL) <b>416</b> and a P-type diffused well DWELL-P <b>418</b> over the SPWELL <b>416</b>. The DWELL-P contains both an N-type source region <b>420</b> and a P-type integrated backgate contact region <b>422</b> to provide contact to a body region <b>425</b>, which may be a portion of the P-type epitaxial layer <b>406</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">At a first surface <b>423</b> of the substrate <b>402</b>, a field relief oxide <b>424</b> has been grown over a portion of the N-type drift region <b>410</b> and the SNWELL <b>412</b>. A polysilicon gate <b>426</b> lies over portions of the N-type source region <b>420</b>, the N-type drift region <b>410</b> and a channel region <b>428</b> between the N-type source region <b>420</b> and the N-type drift region <b>410</b>. The polysilicon gate <b>426</b> has also been extended over the field relief oxide <b>424</b> to provide a field plate. A gate dielectric <b>430</b>, which may be a thermally-grown gate oxide, lies under the polysilicon gate <b>426</b> and dielectric sidewall spacers <b>432</b>. The sidewall spacers <b>432</b>, which may include a deposited silicon oxide, are adjacent or on the sidewalls of the polysilicon gate.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The N-type isolation tank <b>403</b> includes both the NBL <b>408</b> and a DEEPN region <b>434</b>, which may also be referred to as an N-type sinker region <b>434</b>. The N-type sinker region <b>434</b> extends from the first surface <b>423</b> and touches the NBL <b>408</b> and may also laterally surround the LDMOS transistor <b>401</b> to enclose and isolate a portion of the epitaxial layer <b>406</b> containing the LDMOS transistor <b>401</b>. An isolation contact <b>436</b> to bias the N-type sinker region <b>434</b> and the NBL <b>408</b> may be formed in the N-type sinker region <b>434</b>, e.g., by implanting N-type source/drain dopants. Although a single transistor is shown in the N-type isolation tank <b>403</b>, one or more instances of the LDMOS transistor <b>401</b>, or other transistors, may be formed within the N-type isolation tank <b>403</b>. In the implementation shown, an electrode S connected to the N-type source region <b>420</b> and an electrode BG connected to the P-type integrated backgate contact region <b>422</b> are electrically connected together. An electrode G to the polysilicon gate <b>426</b>, an electrode D to the N-type drain region <b>414</b>, and an electrode T to the isolation tank <b>403</b> are also shown. The LDMOS transistor <b>401</b> and the isolation tank <b>403</b> in various baseline implementations generally operate without issue in typical operating regimes, but excursions from such typical operating regimes may result in undesirable operational issues and/or device failure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition to the structures and regions that define the LDMOS transistor <b>401</b> and the isolation tank <b>403</b>, three parasitic bipolar junction transistors are shown schematically in the LDMOS transistor <b>401</b>.

A second parasitic NPN transistor <b>440</b> has a collector provided by the N-type drift region <b>410</b>, an emitter provided by the N-type buried layer <b>408</b>, and a gate provided by the P-type body region <b>425</b>. A parasitic PNP transistor <b>442</b> has a collector provided by the P-type bulk silicon layer <b>404</b>, an emitter provided by the body region <b>425</b>, and a base provided by the N-type buried layer <b>408</b>. While all three parasitic transistors <b>438</b>, <b>440</b>, <b>442</b> may affect aspects of the operation of the LDMOS transistor <b>401</b> in some circumstances, without implied limitation some aspects of the present discussion address operational considerations with respect to the second parasitic NPN <b>440</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>, <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B and <b>5</b>C</figref> illustrate various aspects of prior art LDMOS circuit configurations, and are referred to concurrently in the following discussion.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a depicts a schematic diagram of a baseline integrated circuit (IC) <b>500</b> that includes a power FET M<b>0</b> and a current sense circuit <b>502</b> that includes a stack of current sense FETs M<b>1</b>-M<b>4</b>.

By serially connecting, or &#x201c;stacking&#x201d;, several current sense FETs to the source of the first current sense FET M<b>1</b>, a sense current in the range of microamps may be used to monitor the large current, typically several amps, of the power FET M<b>0</b> by a sense amplifier connected to the third circuit node N<b>3</b>. The drain of the first current sense FET M<b>1</b> is coupled to the first circuit node N<b>1</b> and the respective gates of the current sense FETs M<b>1</b>-M<b>4</b> are coupled to the control node CNTL. The isolation tank is connected to the circuit ground node. In an example implementation of a buck converter, the power FET M<b>0</b> may be implemented as the low-side power FET, so that the first circuit node N<b>1</b> is a switch node SW, the second circuit node N<b>2</b> is coupled to the ground node, and the control node CNTL is coupled to a control circuit (not shown) that drives the low-side power FET.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> schematically depicts an equivalent circuit <b>504</b> that may represent the current sense circuit <b>502</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The circuit <b>504</b> includes the current sense FET M<b>1</b> and a resistor R<b>1</b> that is coupled in series with the source of the current sense FET M<b>1</b> and represents the resistance provided by the transistors M<b>2</b>-M<b>4</b>. The isolation tank is shown connected to ground via the isolation node T. A transistor <b>506</b> represents a parasitic NPN transistor exemplified by the parasitic NPN transistor <b>440</b> that is formed in the current sense transistor M<b>1</b>. The transistor <b>506</b> has a collector formed by the drain of the current sense transistor M<b>1</b>, an emitter formed by the isolation tank, and a base formed by the body/source of the current sense transistor M<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> provides a set of characteristics that shows the collector/emitter breakdown voltage BVceo of an NPN transistor as a function of the base/emitter voltage for each of three different resistance values between the base and the emitter of the NPN transistor. (See J. Kraft, D. Kraft, B. Loffler, H. Jauk and E. Wachmann, &#x201c;Usage of HBTs beyond BV<sub>CEO</sub>&#x201d;, Proceedings of the Bipolar/BiCMOS Circuits and Technology Meeting, 2005, 2005, pp. 33-36, doi: 10.1109/BIPOL.2005.1555195, incorporated by reference in its entirety.) As the characteristics demonstrate, the collector/emitter breakdown voltage BVceo of the subject NPN transistor, such as the parasitic NPN transistor <b>506</b>, is high when the base-to-emitter voltage is low, but decreases as the base-to-emitter voltage increases. As the resistance on the source of the NPN transistor increases, the collector/emitter breakdown voltage BVceo may occur at a lower base/emitter voltage on the NPN transistor.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Relating this relationship back to the circuit <b>504</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>) and to the current sense circuit <b>502</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), the current sense circuit <b>502</b> may be used to measure the current through a low-side power FET. In such an implementation, a high base-to-emitter voltage may occur when the low-side power FET is turned off. The control node may go from about 5 V to about 0 V, turning off both the power FET M<b>0</b> and the current sense FETs M<b>1</b>-M<b>4</b>. At the same time, the first circuit node N<b>1</b> goes high and the drain voltage on the current sense FET M<b>1</b> increases rapidly and is communicated to the collector of the parasitic NPN transistor <b>506</b>. The grounded isolation tank acts as the emitter, so the parasitic NPN transistor <b>506</b> experiences a high collector/emitter voltage. The base of the parasitic NPN transistor <b>506</b> is the epitaxial layer in which the FET M<b>1</b> is formed, e.g. the P-type epitaxial layer <b>406</b>. When the current sense FETs M<b>2</b>-M<b>4</b> turned off, these transistors now act as a high-value resistor, such as is shown as R<b>1</b> in the circuit <b>504</b>, while the high drain voltage on the first current sense FET M<b>1</b> may cause a leakage current to occur. The leakage current through the equivalent high-value resistor R<b>1</b> increases the voltage at the source of the FET M<b>1</b>, which increases the potential of the epitaxial layer and results in an increase of the base/emitter voltage of the parasitic NPN <b>506</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">If the base/emitter voltage increases to a value greater than about 0.5 volts, the breakdown voltage of the LDMOS sense FET M<b>1</b> across the P-type epitaxial layer can be decreased due to the NPN <b>506</b> turning on with a forward-biased base-emitter voltage and a reverse-biased collector-emitter voltage. The NPN action with this forward-biased base-emitter voltage changes the breakdown voltage from a BVdss mechanism (breakdown voltage drain-to-source with control terminal OFF) to a BVceo mechanism (breakdown voltage of collector-emitter with base terminal open or floating). The BVceo voltage depends on the base-to-emitter voltage, which contributes to the issue. Under normal circumstances, when the base-to-emitter voltage is less than about 0.25 V, the BVceo is greater than BVdss. If, at the same time, the collector/emitter voltage exceeds the now-lowered collector/emitter breakdown voltage BVceo of the parasitic transistor, a breakdown may occur. The higher the operating supply voltage and the greater the ratio between the size of the power FET and the size of the current sense FETs, the greater chance of damage to the current sense FETs, with the first current sense FET M<b>1</b> typically being the failure point. A current that flows through the isolation tank may also damage the isolation tank. The damage induced thereby could result in a catastrophic hard circuit failure, or could instead result in a soft failure that renders the integrated circuit less effective or unpredictable. Thus, avoiding a failure through this mechanism is clearly desirable.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> depicts a current sense circuit <b>508</b>, which is a variation on the baseline current sense circuit <b>502</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The current sense circuit <b>508</b> also contains a stack of the current sense FETs M<b>1</b>-M<b>4</b>, all located in a same isolation tank <b>509</b>. In contrast to the current sense circuit <b>502</b>, the current sense FETs M<b>1</b>-M<b>4</b> of the current sense circuit <b>508</b> each have multiple fingers, shown by the notation N*(W/L), N&#x3e;1, wherein a finger is a single instance of a parallel assembly of source, drain and gate. Thus each of the FETs M<b>1</b>-M<b>4</b> includes at least two fingers, each having a width W and a length L, or a total width of N*W. The additional fingers may be added to increase the current-carrying capacity of the current sense FETs. However, in the situation above in which collector/emitter voltage breakdown BVceo may be triggered, the additional fingers may allow additional leakage current and may add to potential reliability and/or performance issues.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> depicts another baseline current sense circuit <b>510</b>, which is an additional variation on the current sense circuit <b>502</b>.

In the first stack <b>512</b>, the first current sense FET M<b>1</b> again has a drain coupled to the first circuit node N<b>1</b>, which is also coupled to the drain of the power FET (not shown). The gates of the current sense FETs M<b>1</b>-M<b>4</b> are again coupled to the control node CNTL. Additionally, each current sense FET M<b>5</b>-M<b>8</b> in the second stack <b>514</b> is coupled in parallel with a corresponding current sense FET in the first stack <b>512</b>. For example, the drain and the source of the current sense FET M<b>5</b> are connected respectively to the drain and the source of the current sense FET M<b>1</b>, the drain and the source of the current sense FET M<b>6</b> are connected respectively to the drain and the source of the current sense FET M<b>2</b>, etc. The second stack <b>514</b> may provide increased current through the current sense circuit <b>510</b> as the circuit is refined. The configuration shown is an initial configuration in which the gate of each of the FETs M<b>5</b>-M<b>8</b> is coupled to the source of the same FET, ensuring that the current sense FETs M<b>5</b>-M<b>8</b> are not initially operable. If a need for any of the current sense FETs M<b>5</b>-M<b>8</b> is determined, the gates of at least some of the current sense FETs M<b>5</b>-M<b>8</b> may be connected to the control node CNTL by reconfiguring interconnections in a subsequent layout revision, thus activating the respective current sense FET and increasing the current through the current sense circuit <b>510</b> by an incremental amount.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In recognition of various described possible failure modes of the baseline circuit configurations, the inventors have identified a number of innovations that may be employed to reduce the occurrence of or prevent such failures. Various examples of the disclosure include circuit elements that provide a bias that limits the potential between the source and the isolation tank (or the buried layer portion of the isolation tank) of the top-most FET in a current-sensing FET stack when the FETs in the FET stack are in an off-state. In some examples such biasing may be steady-state (DC), while in other examples such biasing may be active only when the FETs of the FET stack are in an off-state. Such selective modulation of the source-isolation potential allows the FET stack to operate normally during the operating phase of the associated power FET while protecting the stacked FETs from breakdown during the off, or quiescent, phase of the power FET.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>F</figref> illustrate examples that demonstrate principles of the disclosure that may reduce the likelihood of, or prevent, a failure in stacked FETs, e.g., of a switching converter sense circuit, due to exceeding the collector/emitter breakdown voltage BVceo of a parasitic bipolar transistor, and/or reduce the leakage current in such current sense circuits.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts an integrated circuit <b>100</b>A that includes a power FET M<b>0</b> and a switching converter current sense circuit <b>102</b> that is coupled to measure the current through the power FET M<b>0</b>.

A conductive path <b>101</b> electrically connects a circuit signal node ISO to a terminal T that is conductively connected to the isolation tank, e.g. an NBL and deep trench to the NBL.

As in previous implementations, the power FET M<b>0</b> has a drain coupled to the first circuit node N<b>1</b>, a source coupled to the third circuit node N<b>3</b> and a gate coupled to a control node CNTL. The current sense circuit <b>108</b> includes a first current sense FET M<b>1</b> and three additional current sense FETs M<b>2</b>-M<b>4</b> connected in series, though fewer or more than two additional current sense FETs may be used.

An input <b>117</b> to the source pull-down circuit <b>120</b> may be referred to as a protection circuit input, and is electrically connected to the control node CNTL. An inverter output <b>124</b> is coupled to a gate of the pull-down FET MPD. When the control node CNTL is in a logical high state the gates of power FET M<b>0</b> and the current sense FETs M<b>1</b>-M<b>4</b> are turned on, the pull-down FET MPD is turned off (e.g. having a high resistance greater than 1 M&#x3a9;) such that the source node S<b>1</b> is unaffected by the source pull-down circuit <b>120</b>. When the control node CNTL is in a logical low state the gates of the power FET M<b>0</b> and the current sense FETs M<b>1</b>-M<b>4</b> are turned off. The pull-down FET MPD is turned on (e.g. having a low resistance less than 100&#x3a9;) and the source node S<b>1</b> is pulled to a value near the ground node, a condition referred to without implied limitation as &#x201c;grounded&#x201d;. Thus the pull-down FET MPD is one example that provides between the source node S<b>1</b> and a circuit power node a current path configured to have a high resistance in the event that the FET M<b>1</b> is on, and configured to have a low resistance in the event that the FET M<b>1</b> is off.
