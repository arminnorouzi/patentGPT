In most cases, the leakage current of these MIS capacitors is relatively small and does not influence circuit performance. However, in certain applications, the leakage current through a MIS capacitor can be significant and unacceptable. Examples of such applications include: Low quiescent current design, ultra-low power applications like amplifiers, buffers, active filters and oscillators; Low system offset designs or high precision circuits; Circuits that require a large area of capacitor devices; and Circuits that require leakage currents which do not increase dramatically with increasing temperature.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In high accuracy amplifiers with low input offset, small extra currents introduced by capacitor leakage can lead to large equivalent systematic offsets which can make the output of amplifier inaccurate and unreliable.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">With lower quiescent currents, the leakage may become even more significant. For example, a high gain output stage in an amplifier may use a small current mirror loading of around 1 &#x3bc;A or even less for the purpose of higher output impedance. If this output node is connected to a large compensation/loading MIS capacitor, the capacitor PN junction diode reverse leakage current may increase the equivalent input offset by roughly I<sub>leak</sub>/Gm_amp, where I<sub>leak </sub>is the leakage current of the MIS capacitor and Gm_amp is the equivalent transconductance of the amplifier. For example, a leakage current of 10 nA at the output node can create a 100 &#x3bc;V input offset if Gm_amp=100 &#x3bc;S, which may be an unacceptable result for low offset implementations like instrumentation amplifiers or other high precision amplifiers.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The leakage current is may be generated by a PN junction of MIS capacitor.
