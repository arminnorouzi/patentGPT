The former strip lamps provide general lighting in the showcase and the light is diffused around. As a result, the surrounding areas of the showcase are bright, but the jewelry in the middle fail to stand out due to an inability to focus light on the position occupied by the jewels, resulting in the inability to highlight the brightness of the jewelry. This hinders attracting the attention of consumers. The latter case of pole jewelry lighting is the opposite of bar-shaped lighting. It uses a spotlight, which highlights the existence of jewelry, but the light source having same and constant brightness cannot perfectly display the scintillating reflection characteristics of jewelry. Furthermore, the light beam can damage the eyes of consumers if reflected at the right angle.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Therefore, those skilled in the art are committed to developing a jewelry lighting lamp, which brings new experience when lighting jewelry while being imperceptible to the eye, so that consumers will not notice the shadows cast by the lamp while observing the light reflected by the jewelry.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the above-mentioned defects of the prior art, the technical problem to be solved by the present invention is the light and shadow problems and glare problems that exist in order to highlight the changes in the intensity of the light source due to the flickering of the jewelry when existing lamps illuminate jewelry.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To achieve the above purposes, the present invention provides a jewelry lighting lamp comprising a lighting part, a rotating part and a mounting part, wherein, the mounting part comprises a lamp barrel, which accommodates a lighting part and a rotating part; the rotating part comprises a driving motor, which drives the lighting part relative to the lamp along the central axis of the lamp; the lighting part comprises a main light source arranged on the central axis and a secondary light source arranged around the main light source.

The luminance value of the general jewelry lamp on the irradiation surface is in the order of 10<sup>2</sup>&#x2dc;10<sup>3 </sup>cd/m<sup>2</sup>, for example: when the luminance is arranged at a height of 500 mm and the illumination Angle of the main light source <b>11</b> is 15 degrees, a spot with a diameter of 268 mm is formed. According to the light distribution curve, the brightness value B of the most marginal direction (15&#xb0;) of the irradiation surface is about 1000 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, which is the brightness B<sub>b </sub>of the main light spot <b>113</b> as the background brightness.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">At the same time, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows people's ability to discriminate brightness contrast under different background brightness. According to the brightness value range of jewelry lighting, when the vertical axis C=&#x394;B/B<sub>b </sub>is less than C<sub>pro</sub>, human eyes cannot distinguish the difference in brightness. Therefore, when the secondary light source <b>12</b> is used to illuminate the same area at the same time, and the brightness contrast C=&#x394;B/B<sub>b </sub>is less than C<sub>pro</sub>, the human eye cannot detect changes of the primary and secondary spot <b>123</b> even if the secondary light source <b>12</b> is rotating. Therefore, in the lighting part <b>1</b> of the jewelry lighting lamp of the present invention, the brightness of a single primary spot <b>113</b> is B<sub>b</sub>, and the brightness of a single secondary spot <b>123</b> is B<sub>a</sub>. As the secondary spot <b>123</b> is always within the range of primary spot <b>113</b> during the rotation process, the area illuminated by secondary spot <b>123</b> is actually the superimposed spot <b>123</b>&#x2032; formed by the primary spot and secondary spot <b>123</b>. The size of the superimposed spot <b>123</b>&#x2032; is the same as that of the secondary spot <b>123</b>, and the brightness of the superimposed spot <b>123</b>&#x2032; is B<sub>a</sub>+B<sub>b</sub>. The ratio between the luminance difference &#x394;B of the main spot <b>113</b> and the superimposed spot <b>123</b>&#x2032; and the luminance Bb of the main spot <b>113</b> was set as the luminance contrast C=&#x394;B/B<sub>b</sub>, and the luminance contrast C was less than the critical luminance contrast C<sub>pro</sub>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">When the brightness contrast ratio is less than the critical brightness contrast C<sub>pro</sub>, the human eye cannot perceive the change of the main spot since the brightness of the light spot <b>123</b> is not as small as possible. Because the jewelry cut surface reflects light, resulting in a twinkling visual effect, too little brightness weakens the desired scintillation reflection. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, since the luminance value of general jewelry lighting on the irradiation surface is in the order of 10<sup>2</sup>&#x2dc;10<sup>3 </sup>cd/m<sup>2</sup>, it is desirable to set the luminance contrast C in the range of 0.02-0.05.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">The present invention, when used to illuminate jewelry with rotating lamps and lanterns, provides background brightness centered with the main light source. The rotation of the lamp reflects light from the light source at different intervals into the human eye. The human eye observes scintillating reflection from the jewel facets while the spot produced by the secondary light source <b>12</b> is concealed, so consumers do not perceive the phenomenon of light rotation. While consumers see the dazzling light of jewelry, it also increases the attraction of jewelry, so as to improve the shopping experience.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">The present invention also provides a jewelry lighting method by the use of the jewelry lighting lamp using the main light source <b>11</b> to form a main light spot <b>113</b> having brightness B<sub>b </sub>and the range of the main light spot <b>113</b> covering the jewelry, and uses the rotating auxiliary light source <b>12</b> to illuminate the jewelry. On the polished surfaces of the jewel facets, the secondary spot <b>123</b> is always included in the main light spot <b>113</b> during rotation, the luminance of a single main spot <b>113</b> is B<sub>b</sub>, the luminance of a single secondary spot <b>123</b> is B<sub>a</sub>, the luminance of the superimposed spot <b>123</b>&#x2032; formed by overlapping the main spot <b>113</b> and secondary spot <b>123</b> is B<sub>a</sub>+B<sub>b</sub>. The luminance difference &#x394; between superimposed spot <b>123</b>&#x2032; and the main spot <b>113</b> as the ratio of the main spot <b>113</b> is defined as luminance contrast C=B<sub>a</sub>/B<sub>b</sub>, and the luminance contrast C is less than the critical brightness contrast C<sub>pro</sub>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">A better concrete embodiment of the invention is described in detail above.
