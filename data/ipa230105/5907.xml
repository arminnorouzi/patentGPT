The cost of a given integrated circuit is generally correlated to its size: larger integrated circuits are typically more costly than smaller integrated circuits.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At a given semiconductor fabrication technology node, the size of a given integrated circuit is affected by its gate density: the number of gates that can be included in a given integrated circuit area. Gate density is adversely impacted by the amount of diffusion break isolation required between active regions in the integrated circuit. A given diffusion region can be divided into multiple active regions in which transistors are formed. Different active regions can have different properties, e.g., different active regions can have different transistor types (e.g., transistors with different threshold voltages). Isolation between such active regions is required. Typically, in current semiconductor technologies, double diffusion break or even triple diffusion break isolation is used, although double diffusion break is most common. As the number of diffusion breaks used for isolation increases, the size of the isolation region increases, decreasing the gate density because the isolation regions are not being used to form actual gates that implement functionality in the integrated circuit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Single diffusion break isolation consumes less area than double diffusion break or triple diffusion break isolation, but has not been used because of the numerous technical challenges involved that reduce the isolation effectiveness of the single diffusion break isolation and the process complexity involved in creating physical isolation in such small spacing with acceptable device variability. Another concern is managing the effects of point touch violations in mask creation is complex, and causes impacts in the single diffusion break isolation that induces larger leakage currents in the isolation region. The larger leakage currents increase total power consumption.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an embodiment, an integrated circuit includes transistors in different active regions, electrically isolated using single diffusion break isolation.

In various embodiments, the substrate may have a first conductivity type (e.g., P-type (P) or N-type (N)). The conductivity type may be dependent on the impurities that are included in the substrate (e.g., through diffusion or other impurity-insertion mechanisms). That is, P diffusions use different impurities than N diffusions. The impurities are also often referred to as dopants. The initial conductivity type may be based on the impurities included in the wafer prior to the start of the semiconductor fabrication process. Generally, the conductivity type may indicate the voltage needed between the gate and source of a transistor for active current conduction to occur (for the transistor to be &#x201c;on&#x201d;). P transistors conduct with a negative gate to source voltage, whereas N transistors conduct with a positive gate to source voltage. When the voltage is not present, the transistor is said to be not actively conducting or &#x201c;off&#x201d;. However, in the off state, leakage currents do occur. The leakage currents are lower in magnitude than the conduction currents, but can be a significant source of power consumption in an integrated circuit.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an exemplary embodiment, a P semiconductor substrate may be used. In the semiconductor fabrication process, an N-well may be formed in the P substrate. Other embodiments may have an N substrate and may use a P-well, or a dual-well semiconductor fabrication process may be used. The N-well is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for simplicity. Semiconductor diffusion regions <b>12</b> may be formed within the N-well. The diffusion regions <b>12</b> may be insulated from each other using any fabrication technique (e.g., shallow trench isolation (STI)).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The diffusion regions <b>12</b> may be doped with impurities to produce highly doped N-type and P-type conduction regions (denoted as N+ and P+). In the illustrated embodiment, cross-hatched area <b>18</b> may represent a P+ region and double cross-hatched area <b>20</b> may represent an N+ region. The areas <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> may be the areas over which the dopants may be diffused. Transistors may be formed in the diffusion regions by constructing gate structures over the diffusion regions, on the surface of the substrate (e.g., the gate <b>16</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A transistor may have a threshold voltage. The threshold voltage of a transistor may be the gate to source voltage magnitude (positive or negative, based on conductivity type) at which a channel is fully formed in the transistor from the gate to the source, so that a saturation level of active current flow is possible. Once the threshold voltage is exceeded, the transistor is considered &#x201c;on.&#x201d; When the gate to source voltage is between zero and the threshold voltage, the current flow varies significantly with the magnitude of the voltage. Generally, a semiconductor fabrication process may support several transistor types, where different types have different threshold voltages. Transistors having low threshold voltages are generally faster to turn on, and support high performance. However, transistors having low threshold voltages may also be subject to higher leakage currents and thus contribute to higher power consumption.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Transistors may be designed to have different threshold voltages. The threshold voltage of the transistor may be the nominal voltage for that transistor. That is, a given instance of a transistor having a given threshold voltage may have variance in the actual threshold voltage that causes conduction (e.g., due to variations that occur in the semiconductor fabrication process across the integrated circuit). Other factors such as temperature, aging effects, etc. may affect the actual threshold voltage as well. However, the threshold voltage may be approximately the nominal voltage. A transistor (or transistor type) may be referred to as &#x201c;having&#x201d; a particular threshold voltage. This terminology refers to the nominal threshold voltage that the transistor is designed for, even though there may be some variation.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the threshold voltage of a transistor may be primarily controlled based on the materials used in the gate structure that forms the transistor in a given diffusion region. The gate structure may be formed, for example, in multiple semiconductor manufacturing process steps in which layers of various materials may be applied to produce a gate &#x201c;stack&#x201d; on the surface of the semiconductor substrate. The materials included in the gate stack for a given transistor type, and/or the order of those materials, may control the threshold voltage of the transistor. Viewed in another way, the threshold voltage may be dependent on the materials that are used to form the gate structure. Viewed in still another way, the materials used in the gate structure may be a factor in determining the threshold voltage of the transistor, and more particularly may be a primary factor or dominant factor.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Because the lowest threshold voltage transistors are also often associated with higher leakage currents, integrated circuit designers may implement designs using multiple transistor types. Low threshold voltage transistors may be used in performance-critical areas to achieve the highest speeds, and higher threshold voltage transistors may be used where a slower performing transistor still meets design requirements. Additionally, varying transistor types may be selected based on design robustness considerations, etc.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">When transistors having different threshold voltages are formed in nearby areas (e.g., adjacent standard cells), the transistors may be formed in the same diffusion region. Transistors having a given threshold voltage can be grouped in an &#x201c;active region&#x201d; of the diffusion region. Transistors in the same active region may be formed with minimum spacing according to the semiconductor fabrication process and thus may achieve high density. That is, there may not be an additional isolation needed between transistors other than following the minimum spacing rules. On the other hand, when active regions of different transistor types abut each other within a diffusion region, a diffusion break isolation may be inserted between them. Thus, a pair of active regions may logically abut each other if there are no other active regions between the two regions, even though a diffusion break isolation may have been inserted.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, a first active region in each diffusion region <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be defined to the left of the dotted line <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Transistors in this active region have a threshold voltage VTA. Various gates such as the gate <b>16</b> may be constructed in the active region to form the transistors in the active region. Another active region in each diffusion region <b>12</b> may defined to the right of the dotted line <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Transistors in this active region may have a threshold voltage VTC. VTC is different from VTA (e.g., VTC may be higher or lower than VTA). The area between the active regions between the dotted lines <b>10</b> and <b>14</b>) is the diffusion break isolation.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A diffusion break isolation includes one or more transistors having a &#x201c;dummy&#x201d; gate structure. The dummy gate may be coupled to a fixed voltage source, such as a power supply voltage, so that the transistor formed by the dummy gate is ensured to be off during operation. Accordingly, a dummy gate for an N region may be coupled to Vss (or &#x201c;ground&#x201d;), because N transistors need a positive gate to source voltage to turn on. A dummy gate for a P region may be coupled to Vdd, since a negative gate to source voltage is used to turn on P transistors. Since the dummy transistors in the diffusion break are off, they create electrical insulation/isolation between the active regions. That is, current flow between the regions is substantially prevented/minimized by the diffusion break isolation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a single diffusion break is used between the active regions, formed by dummy gate structures <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> for the N region and P region, respectively. That is, a single gate structure is used in the single diffusion break, minimizing the space occupied by the diffusion break and thus permitting higher usable gate density. The threshold voltage of the transistors in the single diffusion break is VTB, which is different from VTA and VTC. Particularly, VTB may be greater than both VTA and VTC. While the transistors are inactive during operation (providing electrical isolation between the active regions), having a higher threshold voltage also reduces the leakage current. The lower leakage current lessens the power consumption in the single diffusion break, which may improve power efficiency. Thus, the leakage current in each of the transistors formed by the dummy gates <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> is lower than the leakage current in a given transistor in the active regions (e.g., lower than a given transistor in the active regions to the left of the dotted line <b>10</b>, having the threshold voltage VTA, and lower than a given transistor in the active region to the right of the dotted line <b>14</b>, having the threshold voltage VTC).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">It is noted that, while the gates in the active regions (e.g., gate <b>16</b>) are shown as covering both the P and N portions of the active regions, the gates may be divided to form independent P and N transistors, similar to the gates <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> in the diffusion break isolation structure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates generically any type of semiconductor substrate. In an embodiment, the single diffusion breaks with higher threshold voltage transistors than the active regions they isolate may be employed in a fin field effect transistor (FinFET) process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with the fins of a FinFET processor. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the diffusion regions <b>12</b> may include multiple &#x201c;fins&#x201d; <b>26</b>. The fins <b>26</b> in the semiconductor regions <b>12</b> may rise above the surface of the substrate. The fins <b>26</b> in each region <b>12</b> may be parallel to each other and parallel to the fins <b>26</b> in other regions <b>12</b>. The fins <b>26</b> may actually be separated by insulators such as STI, and so the actual N+ and P+ regions may be in the fins <b>14</b> themselves. Depending on the FinFET fabrication process, the fins may be further grown into other shapes such as diamond or merged together through a semiconductor epitaxial process step.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">When using the single diffusion break isolation as described above, various shapes used to form masks for the semiconductor fabrication process may experience point touch violations. For example, various masks may be used to pattern the surface of the semiconductor substrate to build the gate structure stacks mentioned above. The masks may, for example, expose the active regions that are to receive a given layer of material forming the gate stack and to prevent the exposure of active regions that are not to receive the material. The masks may be used for photolithography to selectively harden a photo resist in areas that are not to be exposed, prior to the application of the material. The unhardened photo resist may be removed, and the material may be applied. The hardened photo resist may then be removed (along with any of the material atop the hardened photo resist) after the material is applied. In this manner, the material is selectively included in gate stacks as desired.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The mask shapes to either side of the single diffusion breaks can experience point touch violations as they touch at a corner of the shapes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating the point touch violation. In general, mask shapes drawn by various electronic design automation (EDA) tools become slightly rounded. On the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a rectangular shape <b>30</b> is shown (dotted lines) along with the resulting slightly rounded shape within the rectangle (solid line). On the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, two rectangular shapes <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> that touch at a corner <b>36</b> are shown. To meet various minimum spacing requirements in the semiconductor fabrication process, the resulting shapes are even more rounded.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating point touch violations in masks for various processing steps in the formation of gate structures for the integrated circuit, for an embodiment. The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may apply to the embodiment of the semiconductor substrate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, for example, with active regions having threshold voltages VTA and VTC and the single diffusion break transistors having threshold voltage VTB.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this embodiment, various VT groups may be defined based on which materials are included in each gate stack. For example, at each step another material that may be selectively included in a gate stack to set the threshold of the transistors may be applied. If a transistor of a given conduction type and desired threshold voltage includes that material (or includes that material at that point in the gate stack, if the same material is applied more than once), then an active region including those transistors participates in the application of that material. If the transistor does not include the material, it is masked from the application of that material. Thus, transistors of different threshold voltages may be part of a VT group if those transistors both receive the material to be deposited at the step corresponding to that VT group, and are not part of the VT group if they do not receive the material to be deposited.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Four VT groups are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In the first VT group <b>40</b>, the N-type transistors having threshold voltage VTA and the P-type transistors having the threshold voltage VTC require mask shapes (e.g., they do not receive the material being deposited at the step represented by the first VT group <b>40</b>). The mask shapes are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> as reference numerals <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>, respectively. These two shapes have a point touch and thus become rounded as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The rounded portions in particular affect the area that includes the dummy gate structures, shown as a heavy-lined rectangle <b>46</b>. Similarly, in a second VT group <b>50</b>, the N-type transistors having threshold voltage VTC and the P-type transistors having threshold voltage VTA require mask shapes (reference numerals <b>46</b> and <b>50</b> respectively) and experience a point touch violation. In a third VT group <b>52</b>, no mask shapes are needed, and in a fourth VT group <b>54</b> the N-type transistors of threshold voltage VTA and the P-type transistors of the threshold voltage VTC (reference numerals <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, respectively) and they experience a point touch violation.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Because the area <b>46</b> where the point touch violations occur corresponds to the dummy gate structure in the single diffusion break isolation, for which a high threshold voltage is desired, the point touch violations may be resolved by moving the shapes away from each other, exposing the area <b>46</b> to each VT group. Alternatively, if the dummy gate structure is not to receive the material applied in a given VT group, the point touch violation may be resolved by moving the shapes toward each other, creating an area of overlap (when viewed vertically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>) and covering the dummy gate structure. The materials included in the dummy gate may be a superset of the materials included in the gate structures of the VTA and VTC transistors, in an embodiment. Viewed in another way, the materials in the gate structures in the VTA transistors may be a subset of the materials in the gate structure of the dummy gate transistors. Similarly, the materials in the gate structures of the VTC transistors may be a subset of the materials forming the gate structure of the dummy gate transistors.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the VT groups <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, and <b>54</b> with the shapes adjusted. In the VT groups <b>40</b> and <b>54</b>, the shapes have been adjusted by moving them away from the area <b>46</b>. In the VT group <b>50</b>, the shapes have been adjusted by moving them toward (and overlapping) the area <b>46</b>. The point touch violations are resolved, and thus more regular shapes appear (reference numerals <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> corresponding to reference numerals <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>58</b>, respectively). Additionally, the area <b>46</b> is included or excluded appropriately in each VT group <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, and <b>54</b> to create the desired threshold voltage VTB.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">While 4 VT groups are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, generally any number of VT groups may be used in various embodiments. The number of VT groups may vary based on the number of layers of materials that may be included in a gate stack, the number of supported variations in the materials for a gate stack to create transistors of the various threshold voltages, etc.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Numerous variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art once the above disclosure is fully appreciated.
