Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments of the present disclosure now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all, embodiments of the disclosure are shown. Indeed, embodiments of the disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein, rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The deployment of service-based computing systems in a complex federated network and database platform may involve a complicated array of independent services. A complex federated network and database platform may provide access to various applications, each of the applications facilitating features that are supported by a plurality of distributed services (e.g., internal services, external services, microservices, etc.). When data is shared between applications and/or services, the dependency relationships that are formed therebetween may need to be monitored or understood by the application owners, service owners, and/or system architects. Monitoring of these services may be required for service and/or application reliability, scalability, security, regulation compliance, incident management, and many other reasons.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Without proper monitoring through observability tools, applications, features, and/or services can become vulnerable to issues, degradations, errors, incidents, or even denial of service events. Moreover, because applications, features, and/or services can be dependent on other applications, features, or services, a limitation or degradation in one may cause upstream or downstream difficulties for all. If such occurs, it can be particularly difficult to anticipate, repair, discover, or determine a root cause for such limitation or degradation and particularly for such upstream and downstream difficulties.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">With many systems engineers, architects, and service development teams distributed globally, consistent observability tools are difficult to build and regularly maintain. Observability tools that rely on simple, discrete and/or independent metrics, logs, and traces are plagued by inefficiencies and inconsistencies associated with data entry and global team distributions. Errors and/or inefficiencies may not be readily determinable or easily anticipated due to an inability to correlate metrics, logs, and traces, and/or process correlated data elements together. Such errors and/or inefficiencies may be exacerbated in circumstances where services are dependent on one another or interrelated, such that errors in a first service may directly cause or otherwise increase the likelihood of errors in another service. Additionally, the nature of an expanding complex federated network and database platforms means that applications and/or services thereof are constantly shifting, while alternative application and service options are expanding, thus making traditional observability deployment architectures less efficient over time.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Large cloud-based software platforms supported by complex federated network and database platform have become more and more reliant on thousands of services and microservices to support various features and applications of the software platform. In view of this vast network of interdependent services, features, and applications, it has become increasingly important to develop robust and scalable observability tools that can monitor and infer health status information for such services, features, and applications, as well as alert and/or initiate corrective processes based on observed data and/or determinations or inferences from observed data.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Various example observability implementations discussed herein aim to provide detection, monitoring, and/or other indications of prospective data-driven issues that may arise as a result of operations and/or interactions of an application, feature, or service. Outputs, interactions, and other software-driven processes of such applications, features, and/or services are monitored to infer health status information and/or to find root causes of incidents and anomalies associated therewith. As complexities in a federated network and database platform increase, implementing efficient, consistent, and robust observability tools for application(s), and/or service(s) thereof, becomes increasingly important and increasingly difficult.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Various embodiments of the present disclosure provide for improved federated network and database observability tools that are configured to use linked observable data elements to enable processing at various levels of granularity with respect to any particular event that was performed or that otherwise occurred in association with a particular service, multiple services, an application, multiple applications, and/or the like. The linked observable data elements provide data-driven insights at various possible levels of granularity, for example, that may be used to infer health status information of service(s), feature(s), and/or application(s).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Observable data elements generated by and/or otherwise processed across a myriad of different software application(s) and/or service(s) thereof provide enhanced observability insights with respect to events performed by a particular service and/or application, or between particular service(s) and/or application(s). Linked observable data elements as discussed herein may be consistently collected in any of a myriad of configurations that enable consistent and efficient storage, while simultaneously enabling observability insights to be provided at various levels of granularity.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Data sets of linked observable data elements, or portions thereof, may be collected and/or processed to provide any of a myriad of observability-related functions, for example, to execute user queries for observability data or perform one or more other observability action(s). In circumstances where data sets being collected and/or processed grow especially large, for example, into thousands, tens of thousands, or more of records, linked observable data elements may be efficiently identified and processed to accurately perform such operations and/or to determine accurate insights. In some example embodiments, the linked observable data elements are built on top of one or more observability protocols. Such implementations enable simplified integration with existing and/or legacy observability-implementing systems and/or tools. For example, metrics, logs, and traces known to be utilized for observability may be gathered via such observability protocols and further specially configured as linked observable data elements to enable such data to be processed for purposes of providing enhanced, event-based insights and observability action(s) described herein.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">One example federated network and database platform discussed herein supports and hosts a plurality of event-structured services (e.g., microservices embodying a software tool, a software feature, or a suite of software application tools made available by Atlassian, Inc. and configured to provide observability functionality as described herein). In this regard, such federated network and database includes any number of computing servers, databases, devices, and the like, that facilitate internal and external service functionalities. These service functionalities, alone or in combination with other services, embody corresponding internal and external features that, alone or in combination with other features, embody internal or external application-level functionality to be provided to a user.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Such internal and external service functionalities are desirably monitored through robust and efficient observability tools to enable detection, identification, triaging, predicting, and/or other processing of problems or other errors associated with such service(s). It is further desirable for supporting services and features of a particular application to similarly be monitored through robust and efficient observability tools to enable detection, identification, triaging, predicting, and/or other processing of problems or other errors associated with such supporting services and features.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one example, a user accessing a particular software application monitored via event-structured observability (e.g., Jira Software&#xae;) from a client device triggers functionality of one or more event-structured services associated with or otherwise embodying actions performed via the software application. For example, a user may trigger performance of an operation that triggers one or more data management action(s) associated with the event-structured service (e.g., creation of stored data, deletion of stored data, changing of stored data, and/or the like). Such data management action(s) may trigger changes in upstream or downstream services, features, and/or applications (i.e., changes in more than just the event-structured service with which the user operation was executed). For example, in some contexts, a data management action might trigger operations in other event-structured services associated with event-structured applications hosted by the federated network and database platform (e.g., Jira Service Desk) or another intermediary service (e.g., a credentials management or permissioning service) of the federated network and database platform.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">When errors or incidents emerge in connection with a particular software service or application, it can be difficult to identify the root cause of such errors or incidents. It can be particularly difficult to identify the root cause of such errors or incidents when it involves detailed tracing through various upstream independent service(s), and/or even upstream feature(s) and/or applications. For example, errors occurring in a single service (e.g., a user authentication service) can result in upstream errors to other services (e.g., a user account management service), features (e.g., errors in an authentication service resulting in errors in a login feature that relies on the user authentication service), and/or applications (e.g., errors in Jira Service Desk resulting in a particular service shared by both applications).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, operational engagement (either by users, a service itself, or other services) with the event-structured services causes generation and/or collections of a linked observable data elements stream. The linked observable data elements stream includes, for example, structured data embodying observable data elements that are linked together and represent various aspects of actions performed via operational engagement with the event-structured service, data transmissions associated therewith, and/or the like. The linked observable data elements are &#x201c;linked&#x201d; via one or more linking identifier(s) that enable the various linked observable data elements to be identified as associated with a particular event. Such linked observable data elements, and/or portions thereof, may be processed together with respect to providing certain event-based observability functionality as described herein. Similarly, the linked observable data elements may be stored in one or more manners, such as via different event-structured observability repositories, to enable retrieval of the various portions of such linked data at any level of granularity.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In circumstances where multiple event-structured services interact with one another in performing a particular event, a linking identifier may be shared with each of the event-structured services. The shared linking identifier enables each event-structured data service to effectively link resulting observable data elements resulting from actions associated with a particular event. Thus, the linkage between the various linked observable data elements indicates that the data is associated with the same particular conceptual event. The different portions and/or types of the linked observable data elements may be processed to provide data insights and/or initiate various actions with respect to the event at one or more levels of data granularity (e.g., by processing a single type of linked observable data element, all linked observable data elements, particularly timed linked observable data elements, and/or the like). In this regard, traditionally disparate and independent activities are associated in a manner that enables higher-level data processing actions to be performed based on the wealth of linked observable data elements without the added complexity and/or decreased data insight that traditionally results from attempts to process observability data maintained in an independent and untethered manner.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an example context, the linked observable data stream includes linked observable data elements embodying metrics data, logs data, and/or traces data, that is/are structured based on at least one observability protocol and linked via one or more linking identifiers. The linked observable data stream may include such data for events representing actions performed by an event-structured service or between event-structured services. For example, the observable linked data elements may indicate such observable data elements including data values associated with HTTP request(s), data change(s), and/or other predetermined events initiated in response to operational engagement with the event-structured service.

Various embodiments of the present disclosure desirably avoid reliance on simple, independent, and/or uncorrelated metrics, logs, and traces. Observability tools that do rely on simple, independent, and/or uncorrelated metrics, logs, and traces are not well-configured to store important service-related data for use over significant lengths of times (e.g., weeks or longer), and not well-configured to process important service-related data as such processing can routinely become computationally prohibitive due to the amount of trace lines, log length, and/or the like. Further simple, uncorrelated metrics, logs, and traces fail to provide sufficient observability insights at various levels of granularity, and generally do not provide sufficient insight to enable complex actions to be performed based on such data.
