The element size of a high withstand voltage transistor is larger than the element size of a low withstand voltage transistor. Accordingly, the chip area of the driving circuit that supplies a current corresponding to the light emission luminance becomes large, and this can cause an increase in chip cost. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2008-310076 describes that a high withstand voltage transistor is arranged between a display panel and a driving circuit and the driving circuit is formed by a low withstand voltage transistor.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a light emitting apparatus such as a display panel which is formed by a plurality of light emitting elements, a luminance variation among the light emitting elements causes a degradation in image quality. In order to suppress the degradation in image quality, it is required to decrease the variation of the driving transistor, which controls the current flowing in the light emitting element in each pixel, so that the variation of the current flowing in each light emitting element decreases. In the arrangement described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2008-310076, the transistor arranged in the display panel is a high withstand voltage transistor. Therefore, in order to decrease the variation of the driving transistor, the area of the high withstand voltage transistor needs to be increased.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Each of some embodiments of the present invention has as its object to provide a technique that suppresses a light emission variation of a light emitting element while suppressing an increase in circuit scale.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to some embodiments, a light emitting apparatus in which a pixel, that comprises a current path including a light emitting element, a driving transistor configured to supply a current corresponding to a luminance signal to the light emitting element, and a light emission control transistor configured to control light emission or non-light emission of the light emitting element, is arranged, wherein in the current path, the light emission control transistor is arranged between the light emitting element and the driving transistor, and a withstand voltage of the driving transistor is lower than a withstand voltage of the light emission control transistor, is provided.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments (with reference to the attached drawings).</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view showing an arrangement example of a light emitting apparatus of an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a view showing an arrangement example of a pixel of the light emitting apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a timing chart showing an operation example of the pixel of the light emitting apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a view showing an arrangement example of a light emission control transistor arranged in the pixel of the light emitting apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a view showing another arrangement example of the light emitting apparatus of the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a view showing an arrangement example of a pixel of the light emitting apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A to <b>7</b>C</figref> are views showing an example of an image forming apparatus using the light emitting apparatus of the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a view showing an example of a display apparatus using the light emitting apparatus of the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a view showing an example of a photoelectric conversion apparatus using the light emitting apparatus of the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a view showing an example of an electric equipment using the light emitting apparatus of the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref> are views each showing an example of a display apparatus using the light emitting apparatus of the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a view showing an example of an illumination apparatus using the light emitting apparatus of the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a view showing an example of a mobile body using the light emitting apparatus of the embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B</figref> are views each showing an example of a wearable device using the light emitting apparatus of the embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Hereinafter, embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings. Note, the following embodiments are not intended to limit the scope of the claimed invention. Multiple features are described in the embodiments, but limitation is not made to an invention that requires all such features, and multiple such features may be combined as appropriate. Furthermore, in the attached drawings, the same reference numerals are given to the same or similar configurations, and redundant description thereof is omitted.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>14</b>B</figref>, a light emitting apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram showing the outline of a light emitting apparatus <b>10</b> of this embodiment. The light emitting apparatus <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a light emitting apparatus in which a light emitting element arranged in each pixel <b>101</b> is driven by a driving circuit which is formed on a semiconductor substrate and corresponds to each light emitting element. The light emitting element can have any material constitution/structure and can use a liquid crystal, an organic light emitting diode (OLED, organic EL), an inorganic LED, or a quantum dot LED. In this embodiment, it will be described that the light emitting apparatus <b>10</b> includes, among these light emitting elements, the light emitting element using an organic EL. As will be described later, in this embodiment, a case will be described in which a driving transistor for supplying a current corresponding to a luminance signal to the light emitting element is connected to the anode of the organic EL element and all transistors are p-type transistors. However, the present invention is not limited to this. For example, the polarity and conductivity type of each transistor and those of the semiconductor layer such as a substrate on which the transistors are formed may all be reversed. Alternatively, for example, the driving transistor may be a p-type transistor and the remaining transistors may be n-type transistors. Therefore, in the following description, for example, the &#x201c;drain region&#x201d; and &#x201c;source region&#x201d; of each transistor may be reversed appropriately. Potentials to be supplied and the connection between the components can be changed appropriately in accordance with the polarities and conductivity types of the components of the light emitting apparatus <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the light emitting apparatus <b>10</b> includes a pixel array <b>100</b> and a driving unit arranged in the periphery of the pixel array <b>100</b>. A plurality of the pixels <b>101</b> two-dimensionally arranged in a matrix are arranged in the pixel array <b>100</b>, and a light emitting element <b>110</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) is arranged in each pixel <b>101</b>. The light emitting element <b>110</b> of each pixel <b>101</b> emits light with a light emission amount corresponding to an input signal voltage.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The driving unit is a circuit for driving each pixel <b>101</b>. The driving unit includes, for example, a light emission control circuit <b>200</b> and a signal output circuit <b>300</b>. In the pixel array <b>100</b>, a light emission control line <b>210</b> and a signal line <b>310</b> are arranged along the column direction for each pixel column.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The light emission control circuit <b>200</b> outputs, via the light emission control line <b>210</b>, a light emission control signal for controlling light emission or non-light emission of each pixel <b>101</b>. The signal output circuit <b>300</b> outputs, via the signal line <b>310</b>, a luminance signal (signal voltage) for controlling the luminance of each pixel <b>101</b>. The light emission control line <b>210</b> may be formed by a plurality of control lines for each pixel column.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, for each column, the light emission control line <b>210</b> may be formed by the control lines, the number of which corresponds to the number of pixel rows, and each control line may be connected to each pixel <b>101</b> in a one-to-one relationship. In this case, the pixel array <b>100</b> can be configured to be capable of controlling the number of light emitting pixels for each pixel column.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a circuit diagram showing an arrangement example of the pixel <b>101</b> arranged in the pixel array <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, each of the plurality of pixels <b>101</b> includes a current path including the light emitting element <b>110</b>, a driving transistor <b>112</b> for supplying a current corresponding to a luminance signal to the light emitting element <b>110</b>, and a light emission control transistor <b>111</b> for controlling light emission or non-light emission of the light emitting element <b>110</b>. Here, the total number of transistors arranged in the pixel <b>101</b> and the combination of the conductivity types of the transistors are merely examples, and they are not limited to this arrangement.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, one main terminal (the drain in this embodiment) of the main terminals of the light emission control transistor <b>111</b> is connected to one main terminal of the light emitting element <b>110</b>, and the connection point is referred to as a node <b>220</b>. The other main terminal (the source in this embodiment) of the main terminals of the light emission control transistor <b>111</b> is connected to one main terminal (the drain in this embodiment) of the driving transistor <b>112</b>, and the connection point is referred to as a node <b>221</b>. The other main terminal (the source in this embodiment) of the driving transistor <b>112</b> is connected to a power supply voltage Vdd. The other main terminal of the light emitting element <b>110</b> is connected to a power supply voltage Vss. The control terminal (gate) of the light emission control transistor <b>111</b> is connected to the light emission control line <b>210</b>. The control terminal (gate) of the driving transistor <b>112</b> is connected to the signal line <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The driving transistor <b>112</b> supplies a driving current, which corresponds to the signal voltage of the luminance signal supplied from the signal output circuit <b>300</b> via the signal line <b>310</b>, from the power supply voltage Vdd to the light emission control transistor <b>111</b>. The light emission control transistor <b>111</b> is controlled between a conductive state and a non-conductive state by a light emission control signal output from the light emission control circuit <b>200</b> via the light emission control line <b>210</b>. When the light emission control transistor <b>111</b> is set in the conductive state in accordance with the light emission control signal, the driving current is supplied from the driving transistor <b>112</b> to the light emitting element <b>110</b>. Thus, the light emitting element <b>110</b> emits light.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">At this time, the light emission luminance of the light emitting element <b>110</b> changes in accordance with the driving current supplied from the driving transistor <b>112</b> and flowing in the current path including the light emitting element <b>110</b>, the driving transistor <b>112</b>, and the light emission control transistor <b>111</b>. In the pixel array <b>100</b>, when causing the light emitting element <b>110</b> arranged in each pixel <b>101</b> to emit light at a constant luminance, the signal output circuit <b>300</b> outputs, as a luminance signal, a constant voltage to the control terminal of each driving transistor <b>112</b> via each signal line <b>310</b>. However, since there can be a variation of the characteristic such as a variation of a threshold voltage Vth among the driving transistors <b>112</b>, even if the same voltage is supplied to the control terminals, the driving current supplied to the light emitting element <b>110</b> may vary among the pixels <b>101</b>. It is known that, in general, the magnitude of the variation of the characteristic among the transistors is inversely proportional to the square root of the gate area of the transistor and proportional to the gate film thickness. Accordingly, in order to suppress the variation of the characteristic among the transistors, it is effective to increase the gate area and decrease the gate film thickness.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">On the other hand, when causing the light emitting operation of the light emitting element <b>110</b> at a predetermined luminance, a forward voltage Vf of several V is required. Therefore, a voltage of about 10 V may be required between the power supply voltage Vdd and the power supply voltage Vss of the pixel <b>101</b>. In general, a high withstand voltage transistor having a withstand voltage of about 10 V has a larger gate film thickness than a low withstand voltage transistor with a lower withstand voltage, or has a larger element area because it has a specific structure. Hence, the high withstand voltage transistor has a larger characteristic variation and a larger element area than the lower withstand voltage transistor.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment, the driving transistor <b>112</b> is a low withstand voltage transistor, and has a lower withstand voltage than the light emission control transistor <b>111</b> which uses a high withstand voltage transistor. The light emission control transistor <b>111</b> is only required to perform a switching operation to control light emission or non-light emission of the light emitting element <b>110</b>, so it does not largely contribute to the variation of the driving current. Therefore, although the light emission control transistor <b>111</b> uses a high withstand voltage transistor, it does not require a larger area than the driving transistor <b>112</b> having a low withstand voltage.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a timing chart illustrating an operation of the pixel <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Each of a period from time t<b>0</b> to time t<b>1</b> and a period from time t<b>2</b> to time t<b>3</b> represents a non-light emission period of the light emitting element <b>110</b>. A period from time t<b>1</b> to time t<b>2</b> represents a light emission period of the light emitting element <b>110</b>. In a period from time t<b>0</b> to time t<b>3</b>, the driving transistor <b>112</b> is constantly active and supplies the signal voltage of a luminance signal for causing the light emitting element <b>110</b> to emit light at a predetermined luminance.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the non-light emission period from time t<b>0</b> to time t<b>1</b>, the light emission control signal supplied to the light emission control line <b>210</b> becomes a voltage close to the power supply voltage Vdd, so that the light emission control transistor <b>111</b> is turned off and set in the non-conductive state. In this case, the potential of the node <b>220</b> corresponding to the drain of the light emission control transistor <b>111</b> is decreased to the potential close to the power supply voltage Vss by the forward current generated in the light emitting element <b>110</b>.
