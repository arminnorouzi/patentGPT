The entire contents of each of the above mentioned applications are hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventional freight railroad cars in North America and other parts of the world typically include a car body and two spaced apart trucks. The car body or car body under frame typically includes two spaced apart center plates that respectively rest on and are rotatably received by bolster bowls of the two trucks. The trucks rollingly support the car body along railroad tracks or rails. Each truck generally has a three piece truck configuration that includes two spaced apart parallel side frames and a bolster. The side frames generally extend in the same direction as the tracks or rails, and the bolster generally extends transversely or laterally to the tracks or rails. The bolster extends laterally through and between and is supported by the two spaced apart side frames. Each side frame typically defines a center opening and pedestal jaw openings on each side of the center opening. Each end of each bolster is typically supported by a spring group positioned in the center opening of the side frame and supported by the lower portion of the side frame that defines the center opening.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Each truck also typically includes two axles that support the side frames, four wheels, and four roller bearing assemblies respectively mounted on the ends of the axles. The truck further typically includes four bearing adapters respectively positioned on each roller bearing assembly in the respective pedestal jaw opening below the downwardly facing wall of the side frame that defines the top of the pedestal jaw opening. The wheel sets of the truck are thus received in bearing adapters placed in leading and trailing pedestal jaws in the side frames, so that axles of the wheel sets are generally parallel. The bearing adapters permit relatively slight angular displacement of the axles. The spring sets or groups permit the bolster to move somewhat with respect to each side frame, about longitudinal or horizontal, vertical, and transverse axes (and combinations thereof).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Directions and orientations herein refer to the normal orientation of a railroad car in use. Thus, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the &#x201c;longitudinal&#x201d; axis or direction is substantially parallel to straight tracks or rails and in the direction of movement of the railroad car on the track or rails in either direction. The &#x201c;transverse&#x201d; or &#x201c;lateral&#x201d; axis or direction is in a horizontal direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis and the straight tracks or rails. &#x201c;Vertical&#x201d; is the up-and-down direction, and &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; is a plane parallel to the tracks or rails including the transverse and longitudinal axes. The &#x201c;front&#x201d; or &#x201c;leading&#x201d; side of the truck means the first side of a truck of a railroad car to encounter a turn; and the &#x201c;rear&#x201d; or &#x201c;trailing&#x201d; side is opposite the leading side.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a continuing demand in the railroad industry to improve trucks including the bolsters and side frames thereof, and to reduce potential stress fractures or cracks in bolsters and side frames.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various embodiments of the present disclosure provide a new railroad car, and more particularly a new railroad car truck including one or more new side frames that each includes one or more of a plurality of different improvements that individually and in various combinations reduce, inhibit, or minimize the likelihood of stress fractures or cracks in the side frame.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In various embodiments, the present disclosure provides an improved casted single unit or one piece side frame configured to be employed in a freight railroad car truck and that includes one or more of a plurality of different improvements that individually and in various different combinations reduce, inhibit, or minimize the likelihood of stress fractures or cracks in the side frame and thus reduce maintenance expense and time out of service for the truck and the freight railroad car. Certain of these improvements also provide for or facilitate an overall lighter side frame and truck. Such reduced weight increases fuel efficiency and makes the freight railroad car more efficient.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In various embodiments, the present disclosure provides a railroad car truck including, among other components, a first such improved side frame, a second such improved side frame, and a bolster supported by the first side frame and the second side frame. In various embodiments, the present disclosure provides a railroad car including one or more such railroad car trucks.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In various embodiments, the plurality of different improvements to the side frame generally include: (1) front and rear spring seat-to-column turns that each includes a compound radius of curvature; (2) front and rear internal top anti-buckling ribs; (3) a front and rear pedestals that each include an inner compound radius of curvature; (4) internal lower and upper sidewall reinforcement areas or pads; and (5) front and rear three step transition

It should be appreciated that the side frame of the present disclosure can be used in connection with any suitable transportation device (such as freight railroad cars).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> illustrate one example embodiment of such a new railroad car, a new railroad car truck, and two new railroad car truck side frames of the present disclosure. These new side frames are generally indicated by numerals <b>200</b> and <b>1200</b>. In this illustrated example embodiment, the side frames <b>200</b> and <b>1200</b> are included in an example freight railroad car <b>10</b> configured to be positioned on conventional railroad tracks <b>20</b>. The freight railroad car <b>10</b> generally includes a car body <b>12</b>, a first truck <b>14</b>, and a second truck <b>16</b>. It should be understood that the first truck <b>14</b> and the second truck <b>16</b> are identical or substantially identical in this illustrated example embodiment. Each of the first truck <b>14</b> and the second truck <b>16</b> includes two side frames <b>200</b> and <b>1200</b> (i.e., right and left side frames that are mirror images of each other). The railroad car <b>10</b> is configured to roll along the tracks <b>20</b> via the first truck <b>14</b> and the second truck <b>16</b> in a conventional manner. The car body <b>12</b> rotatably rests on the first truck <b>14</b> and the second truck <b>16</b> in a conventional manner to navigate (e.g., accommodate, traverse, etc.) curves (not shown) in the tracks <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this illustrated example embodiment, the first truck <b>14</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) includes, among many conventional components (that are not shown or described): (1) the first side frame <b>200</b>; (2) the second side frame <b>1200</b>; (3) a bolster <b>100</b> extending between the first side frame <b>200</b> and the second side frame <b>1200</b>; (4) a first rolling assembly <b>114</b>; (5) a second rolling assembly <b>116</b>; (6) a first spring set <b>118</b>; (7) a second spring set <b>119</b>; (8) friction wedges such as first and second friction wedges <b>120</b> and <b>121</b>; (9) a bolster bowl wear liner <b>122</b>; and (10) brake assemblies including brake assembly <b>126</b>, all configured in a generally conventional manner except as described below.

The front turn <b>312</b> from the spring seat <b>310</b> provides the transition between the spring seat <b>310</b> and the vertical front column <b>400</b> that partially defines the bolster opening <b>590</b>. In this example illustrated embodiment, the front turn <b>312</b> includes two separate different radii of curvature that are tangential to one another to provide the transition from the spring seat <b>310</b> to the front column <b>400</b>.
