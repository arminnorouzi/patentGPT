Descriptions of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The bicycle cross bar adaptor is used to be installed between the seat tube and the head tube of a bicycle so that when the bicycle is carried by a bicycle rack on a vehicle, the bicycle rack supports or clamps the cross bar adaptor.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Taiwanese Utility Model No. M559826 discloses a retractable bicycle cross bar adaptor that includes a bar, a movable unit and a securing unit. The bar has multiple notches, and the movable unit is slidably connected to the bar. The movable unit includes a base, a slide and a stop, wherein the slide is slidably connected to the base so as to be in contact with the stop optionally. The stop is engaged one of the notches of the bar. The securing unit is connected to the movable unit and is connected to a bicycle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although the length of the retractable bicycle cross bar adaptor can be adjusted, it involves too many pars and the parts have complicated shapes. The slide is biased by two springs which moves the slide back and forth when the user pushes the base to allow the stop to move, such that the bar can be extended or retracted to adjust the length of the cross bar adaptor. It is noted that the movable unit and the securing unit includes many parts that have different sizes and shapes, some of the parts are tiny, therefore the manufacturing cost of the retractable bicycle cross bar adaptor is high and cannot compete with other similar products in the market.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention intends to provide a retractable bicycle cross bar adaptor to eliminate the shortcomings mentioned above.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention relates to a retractable bicycle cross bar adaptor and comprises a bar having a first tube, a second tube and a control unit. The first tube has a first end and a second end, and the second tube has a first end and a second end. The control unit is connected between the first tube and the second tube. A first hook is connected to the second end of the first tube, and a second hook is connected to the second end of the second tube. A first connection end is formed to the first end of the first tube, and a second connection end is formed to the first end of the second tube. The second connection end is slidably inserted into the first connection end. The control unit includes a first part and a second part. The first part is a tubular part and has a head formed to the first end thereof, and multiple outer threads are formed to the outer surface of the first part. Multiple plates extend from the second end of the first parts. The first part includes a passage defined axially therethrough. Multiple slots are formed alternatively between the multiple plates. The first connection end is inserted into the first part from the head of the first part and secured to the head of the first part. The second connection end is inserted into the first part from the second end of the first part and movably inserted into the first connection end. Each of the plates has a tapered outer face along the axial direction of the plate. The second part is rotatably and movably mounted to the first part. The second part presses the plates to clamp the second tube, or the second part releases the plates so that the second tube is movable relative to the first tube.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preferably, an end cap is connected to the second connection end of the second tube.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the inn diameter of the passage at of the head of the first part is larger than the outer diameter of the first connection end, so that the first connection end is inserted into the passage at of the head of the first part.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the second part includes an operation portion and a tubular section extending from one end of the operation portion. The operation portion includes inner threads formed to the inner periphery thereof so as to be engaged with the outer threads of the first part. The inner periphery of the tubular section includes an inner tapered face which is matched with the outer tapered face of the plates of the first part.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The operation of the control unit of the present invention is easy by simply rotating the second part to press the plates of the first part to secure the second tube to set the desired length of the bicycle cross bar adaptor of the present invention. By rotating the second part in an opposite direction, the plates of the first part are released so that the second tube is freely moved relative to the first part, this status allows the user to re-set the length of the bicycle cross bar adaptor of the present invention. The present invention includes a simple structure which is easily manufactured and maintained.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first tube and the second tube of the bicycle cross bar adaptor of the present invention are normal tubes with no specific machining required so as to have low manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The second part is threadedly connected to the first part, the movement of the second part is stable and reliable to press or release the plates of the first part.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention will become more obvious from the following description when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings which show, for purposes of illustration only, a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view to show the retractable cross bar adaptor of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded view of the retractable cross bar adaptor of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross sectional view to show that the plates of the first part are pressed by the second part;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross sectional view to show that the plates of the first part are released from the second part, and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows that the retractable cross bar adaptor of the present invention is used to a bicycle.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, the retractable cross bar adaptor of the present invention comprises a bar <b>10</b> having a first tube <b>20</b>, a second tube <b>30</b> and a control unit <b>40</b>.
