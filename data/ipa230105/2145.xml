In this regard, an object of the invention is to develop packagings of the type mentioned in the introduction with particular regard to an improved producibility of the packagings.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A packaging to achieve this objective is a packaging for products of the tobacco industry, wherein the packaging has a box portion and a lid which is pivotably arranged on the box portion by means of a line hinge, and wherein a packaging content is arranged in the box portion, and wherein the packaging has a collar which at least partially surrounds the packaging content at several sides and which protrudes with the packaging content from the box portion which is open at the top, characterized in that walls of the collar extend from a front side of the box portion up to the region of an opposing rear side of the box portion on which the line hinge is also located. There is accordingly provision for walls of the collar to extend from a front side of the box portion up to the region of an opposing rear side of the box portion on which the line hinge is also located.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An advantage of the collar walls in the region of the rear side of the box portion or the packaging content may involve the stability of the collar being improved thereby. This also enables larger recesses in the collar, for example, in the region of a collar front wall.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A specific feature may involve, in particular to delimit walls of the collar, forming in the material of the collar weakening lines which are configured to lead to a material weakening along the respective weakening line, wherein the collar has differently constructed weakening lines, of which at least some lead to a differing degree of material weakening.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The use of different weakening lines having a different degree of material weakening may contribute to the folding behavior of the collar being influenced in a positive manner in order, for example, to determine at which location or weakening line a blank first bends when folding.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, there may specifically be provision for the collar to have a collar front wall, collar side walls and collar rear walls which extend along corresponding walls of the box portion, in particular along a box front wall, box side walls and a box rear wall, and, in the transition from the collar side walls to the collar rear wall and/or in the transition from the collar side walls to the collar front wall for differently constructed weakening lines which lead to a differing degree of material weakening to be arranged.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a packaging with chamfered packaging edges or in a packaging with right-angled packaging edges, there may be provision for there to be arranged between the collar side walls and the collar rear wall an oblique collar edge wall which extends when viewed from above obliquely with respect to the respective collar side walls and the collar rear wall, and for the weakening lines between the collar side walls and the respective oblique collar edge wall to have a lower degree of material weakening than the weakening lines between the oblique collar edge walls and the collar rear wall.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In particular, there may be provision, in a packaging with chamfered packaging edges, for there to be arranged between the collar side walls and the collar front wall an oblique collar edge wall which extends when viewed from above obliquely with respect to the respective collar side walls and the collar front wall, and for the weakening lines between the collar front wall and the adjacent oblique collar edge wall in each case to have a lower degree of material weakening than the weakening lines between the oblique collar edge walls mentioned and the respective adjacent collar side wall.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a packaging with rounded packaging edges, there may be provision for there to be arranged in each case between the collar side walls and the collar rear wall a curved intermediate collar wall which has preferably parallel creases which are arranged with short spacings as weakening lines, and for the weakening lines in the transition from the collar side walls to the respective intermediate collar wall to have a lower degree of material weakening than weakening lines in the transition from the respective intermediate collar walls to the collar rear wall.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In particular there may be provision in packagings with rounded packaging edges for there to be arranged in each case between the collar side walls and the collar front wall a curved intermediate collar wall which has preferably parallel creases which are arranged with short spacings as weakening lines, and for weakening lines in the transition from the collar front wall to the adjacent intermediate collar walls to have a lower degree of material weakening than weakening lines in the transition from the intermediate collar walls mentioned to the adjacent collar side wall.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a preferred embodiment, weakening lines with a larger degree of material weakening may be formed, for example, by scoring the material of the collar and weakening lines with a lower degree of material weakening may be formed, for example, by creasing the material of the collar.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As already mentioned above as a possible advantage, it is conceivable, as a result of the use of the weakening lines with a differing degree of material weakening, for the folding behavior of the blank for the collar to be able to be influenced, in particular in such a manner that walls of the collar which are located at weakening lines with a lower degree of material weakening are more difficult to fold than walls of the collar which are located at weakening lines with a higher degree of material weakening.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another specific feature may involve the collar rear walls preferably extending together over at least 10% of the width of the rear wall of the box portion, preferably over at least 20%, more preferably over at least 30%.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">An advantage of such solutions may involve the collar being reinforced, but, on the other hand, not with an unnecessarily excessive amount of material being used.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, the invention relates to a method for producing a packaging for products of the tobacco industry, wherein a group of products of the tobacco industry in an inner wrapper as packaging content of the packaging and a blank for a collar of the packaging is supplied to a platform, and wherein the platform is moved back and forth in the direction of a folding turret which is arranged downstream of the platform in order to bridge the spacing therefrom, and wherein in pockets of the folding turret preferably partially folded blanks for an outer packaging of the packaging are provided in each case, and wherein the packaging content is moved together with the collar which is folded around the packaging content by means of a sliding member from the platform into a pocket facing the platform or the partially folded blank which is provided therein and subsequently the blank is folded around the packaging content and the collar to form a packaging.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Known apparatuses of this type are not capable of folding collars, as required, for example, to produce the packaging according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An object of this aspect of the apparatus is consequently to propose measures which enable a simple production of such packagings.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A method according to the invention for achieving this objective has a provision for the blank for the collar to be folded at all sides around the packaging content on the platform.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It has surprisingly been found that the platform can be adapted with relatively little complexity in such a manner that a collar which is located on all sides of the packaging content can be folded.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">There is preferably provision for the blank for the collar to be folded around the packaging content on the platform in such a manner that a collar front wall extends in the region of a front side of the packaging content, collar side walls extend in the region of narrow sides of the packaging content and collar rear walls extend in the region of a rear side of the packaging content opposite the front side.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">There is further preferably provision for the blank for the collar to be folded during transport along the platform, wherein there is preferably provision for the blank and the packaging content to be transported along the platform by an in particular common sliding member.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a preferably first folding step, the collar side walls may be folded with respect to the collar front wall, in particular by means of folding using one or more switches and in conjunction with folding elements which are associated with the switches and which are preferably positioned in a fixed manner on the platform.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this instance, there may be provision for the folding of the collar side walls to be carried out with spacing with respect to the packaging content, and afterwards for the partially folded collar to be combined with the packaging content, preferably by means of at least one guide, in particular by placing the collar front wall against the front side of the packaging content.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In particular, there may be provision, preferably in the first folding step, for the collar side walls to be folded through approximately 90&#xb0; with respect to the collar front wall so that they extend along the narrow sides of the packaging content, wherein the collar rear walls extend beyond the plane of the rear side of the packaging content.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, in a second folding step, the collar rear walls can be folded around the packaging content so that they extend along the rear side of the packaging content.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A specific feature may involve the collar which is folded around the packaging content being fixed by a preferably second sliding member in the relative position thereof with respect to the packaging content, and for the packaging content with the collar folded around it to be moved by the preferably second sliding member from the platform into a pocket facing the platform or the partially folded blank which is provided therein.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In particular, this may be carried out in such a manner that the preferably second sliding member in the region of two opposing sides fixes the folded collar in its position on the packaging content, in particular in the region of a front side which preferably faces upward and in the region of a rear side of the packaging content which preferably faces downward.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The invention further relates to an apparatus for producing a packaging for products of the tobacco industry, having a platform for supplying a group of products of the tobacco industry in an inner wrapper as packaging content of the packaging and a blank for a collar of the packaging in the direction of a folding turret which is arranged downstream of the platform, wherein the folding turret has pockets for receiving preferably partially folded blanks for an outer packaging of a packaging, and wherein a sliding member is provided in order to move the packaging content together with the collar which is folded around the packaging content from the platform into a pocket facing the platform or the partially folded blank which is provided therein.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the invention, there is provision for there to be provided in the region of the platform folding members which are configured to fold the blank for the collar around the packaging content on the platform.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">There may further be provision for the folding members to be configured to fold the blank for the collar around the packaging content on the platform in such a manner that a collar front wall extends in the region of a front side of the packaging content, collar side walls extend in the region of narrow sides of the packaging content and collar rear walls extend in the region of a rear side of the packaging content opposite the front side.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">There is preferably provision for the folding members to be configured to fold the blank for the collar during transport along the platform, wherein an in particular common sliding member is preferably provided in order to transport the blank and the packaging content along the platform.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">There may further be provision for the platform to have one or more switches and preferably fixed folding elements which are associated with the switches, for a preferably first folding step in which the collar side walls are folded with respect to the collar front wall.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Another specific feature may involve the folding elements being configured to carry out the folding of the collar side walls with spacing with respect to the packaging content and for at least one guide to be provided in order to combine the partially folded collar with the packaging content, in particular by placing the collar front wall against the front side of the packaging content.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">There is preferably provision for additional folding elements to be provided in the region of the platform in order preferably in a second folding step to fold the collar rear walls around the packaging content so that they extend along the rear side of the packaging content.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a preferred embodiment, there may be provision for the additional folding elements to be arranged below a guide path of the platform, along which the packaging content is transported with the collar, and for the folding elements to be able to be moved in opposing directions in order to fold the two collar rear walls against the rear side of the packaging content.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Another specific feature may involve a preferably second sliding member being provided in order to fix the collar which is folded around the packaging content in the relative position thereof with respect to the packaging content and for the preferably second sliding member to be configured to move the packaging content with the collar folded around it from the platform into the pocket facing the platform or the partially folded blank which is provided therein.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">This can be carried out in such a manner that the preferably second sliding member is configured in the region of two opposing sides to fix the folded collar in the position thereof on the packaging content, in particular in the region of a preferably upwardly facing front side and in the region of a preferably downwardly facing rear side of the packaging content.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Another specific feature may involve the platform having a guide path on which the packaging content rests during transport along the platform and for the guide path to have recesses, in particular in order to form a working region for folding members in order to fold the collar rear walls or to form at least one recess for retention members of the preferably second sliding member.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Other specific features will be further appreciated from the description and the drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The packaging <b>10</b> according to the invention is described below with reference to three packaging variants. All three packagings <b>10</b> are packagings <b>10</b> of the hinge/lid type. The packagings <b>10</b> accordingly have a cup-like (lower) box portion <b>11</b> and an (upper) lid <b>12</b>. The lid <b>12</b> is pivotably supported on the box portion <b>11</b>, that is to say, by means of a line hinge <b>13</b>. The box portion <b>11</b> and lid <b>12</b> form an outer packaging <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The outer packaging <b>14</b> may be formed from a conventional blank for a hinge/lid packaging. Cardboard is generally used as the material of the blank. Walls of the blank may be delimited from each other by means of embossed folding lines or stamped portions.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">A packaging content <b>15</b> is arranged in the box portion <b>11</b> (which is open at the top). In this instance, the packaging content <b>15</b> is a cigarette group <b>16</b> which is enclosed in an inner wrapper <b>17</b>. Of course, in place of cigarettes, other products from the cigarette industry can also be provided as content.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the context of the application, products of the cigarette industry are intended to be understood to be tobacco products, such as cigarettes, cigarillos and the like, but also new types of tobacco products, such as, for example, heat-not-burn products or liquid carriers for E cigarettes.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">It is conceivable for the inner wrapper <b>17</b> to be constructed as a film sealing block having a removal opening which extends in the region of the upper side and a front side of the inner wrapper <b>17</b> and which can be closed by means of a closure label <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this instance, the closure label <b>18</b> has a touching tip <b>19</b> for confirmation by the consumer. However, it is also conceivable for the touching tip <b>19</b> or the closure label <b>18</b> to be adhesively bonded to the inner side of the lid <b>12</b> so that the closure label <b>18</b> is automatically opened or closed when the lid <b>12</b> is activated accordingly.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The packaging content <b>15</b> readily protrudes in conventional manner from the box portion <b>12</b>. The packaging content <b>15</b> is at least partially surrounded by a collar <b>20</b> which is secured in the box portion <b>11</b> and the packaging content <b>15</b> protrudes therefrom.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The collar <b>20</b> is formed from a separate blank made of packaging material (for example, made from cardboard) and has in this instance substantially five walls, that is to say, a central collar front wall <b>21</b>, two adjacent collar side walls <b>22</b> and two adjacent collar rear walls <b>23</b> in each case. The walls <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> of the collar <b>20</b> extend along corresponding walls of the box portion <b>11</b>, that is to say, along a box front wall <b>24</b>, box side walls <b>25</b> and (partially) along a box rear wall <b>26</b>. Other walls or wall portions are described below.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The walls <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> of the collar <b>20</b> are delimited from each other by means of weakening lines. In this instance, they may (also) be conventional (embossed) folding lines. The weakening lines lead in the blank for the collar <b>20</b> to a material weakening which extends along the weakening line.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A particular feature involves a few weakening lines being constructed in such a manner that they lead to a more powerful material weakening than other weakening lines and in particular than the conventional folding lines. Since the arrangement is dependent on the respective packaging type, the individual packaging variants will be discussed below:</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The packaging <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a so-called oblique edge packaging <b>10</b> in which the upright packaging edges <b>27</b> of the packaging <b>10</b> are constructed to be chamfered. Such packagings <b>10</b> are also referred to as octagonal packagings <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The chamfered packaging edges <b>27</b> are formed using oblique packaging edge walls <b>28</b> which are arranged between a packaging front wall <b>29</b> and the two adjacent packaging side walls <b>30</b> and/or between the packaging rear wall <b>31</b> and the two packaging side walls <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The oblique packaging edge walls <b>28</b> may, for example, be arranged at an angle of approximately 45&#xb0; with respect to the adjacent walls <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>31</b> of the packaging <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows in the left half a corresponding portion of a blank for the collar <b>20</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In this instance, the weakening lines <b>32</b> are constructed in such a manner that a lower level of material weakening is produced than by the weakening lines <b>33</b>. The weakening lines <b>32</b> may, for example, be formed by a creasing, whereas the weakening lines <b>33</b> may be formed by a scoring.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The differing degrees of material weakening may also be formed in a different manner. It is conceivable, for example, for both weakening lines <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> to be produced in the same manner, for example, both by means of creasing or both by means of scoring. As a result of modification of the creasing or the scoring, for example, as a result of a deeper creasing or deeper and/or longer scores, different levels of material weakening can then be brought about. It is further conceivable for different methods for producing the weakening lines <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> to be combined with different modifications.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In this instance, there is provision for the material weakening to be constant over the path of a respective weakening line <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Of course, forms other than creasing or scoring can be used to form weakening lines.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> also shows that the collar <b>20</b> is adapted to the shape of the packaging <b>10</b>, that is to say, by means of additional oblique collar edge walls <b>34</b> between the respective collar side walls <b>22</b> and the collar rear walls <b>23</b>, on the one hand, and the collar front wall <b>21</b>, on the other hand.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Consequently, the weakening lines <b>33</b> are thus arranged between the collar rear walls <b>23</b> and the respective adjacent oblique collar edge wall <b>34</b> and, furthermore, between the collar side walls <b>22</b> and the front oblique collar edge wall <b>34</b>. The weakening lines <b>32</b> are arranged between the collar side walls <b>22</b> and the rear oblique collar edge walls <b>34</b> and between the collar front wall <b>21</b> and the adjacent front oblique collar edge walls <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The packaging <b>10</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a so-called round edge packaging <b>10</b>, in which the upright packaging edges <b>27</b> are constructed as rounded packaging edges <b>27</b>. Accordingly, between the packaging front wall <b>29</b> and the adjacent packaging side walls <b>30</b> and between the packaging rear wall <b>31</b> and the adjacent packaging side walls <b>30</b>, there are formed intermediate packaging walls <b>35</b> which are rounded when viewed from above. To this end, the intermediate walls <b>35</b> are provided with weakening lines <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> which preferably extend parallel and with little spacing from each other.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The blank for the collar (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, right half) has corresponding intermediate collar walls <b>36</b>. In this instance, the weakening lines <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> are arranged in a similar manner to the embodiment according to the packaging <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The packaging according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a &#x201c;conventional&#x201d; packaging <b>10</b> with right-angled packaging edges <b>27</b>. A particular feature is that, between the collar rear walls <b>23</b> and the collar side walls <b>22</b>, an oblique collar edge wall <b>37</b> which extends obliquely relative to the respective collar rear walls <b>23</b> and collar side walls <b>22</b> is arranged.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the present embodiment, no oblique collar side walls <b>37</b> are formed in the transition to the collar front wall <b>21</b>. The packaging <b>10</b> also does not have such oblique edge walls.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The arrangement of the weakening lines <b>32</b> and weakening lines follows the first two embodiments.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref> further show that the collar <b>20</b> in the region of the collar front wall <b>21</b> has a relatively large central recess <b>38</b>. A lower edge of the recess <b>38</b> is located in this instance below an upper edge (closure edge) of the box front wall <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">It can further be seen that the collar rear walls <b>23</b> extend over a large portion of the width of the box rear wall <b>26</b>. A coverage of at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80% or at least 90% is conceivable.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> further shows that, together with the cigarette group <b>16</b>, a tray <b>39</b> may be arranged in the inner wrapper <b>17</b>. The walls of the tray <b>39</b> extend in this instance in the region of the box front wall <b>24</b>, the box side walls <b>25</b> and the oblique side wall <b>37</b>. In the region of the box rear wall <b>26</b>, no wall is formed.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Furthermore, lid brakes <b>40</b> are formed on the collar <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the significant steps which are carried out during the arrangement of the collar <b>20</b> on the packaging content <b>15</b>. The collar <b>20</b> or the blank which is expanded flat and not folded is thus transported to this end together with the packaging content <b>15</b> in a transport direction.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In a (first) folding step, the collar side walls <b>22</b> are folded with respect to the collar front wall <b>21</b>. Furthermore, the collar <b>20</b> is moved into abutment with the front side of the packaging content <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In a (second) folding step, the collar rear walls <b>23</b> are folded into the region of the rear side of the packaging content <b>15</b>. Afterwards, the packaging content <b>15</b> is introduced with the collar <b>20</b> into the (partially folded) outer packaging <b>14</b>. The details will be appreciated from the following description of a corresponding apparatus.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The structure and the operation of an apparatus according to the invention are explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>17</b></figref>:</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows significant elements of the apparatus in an overview. A folding turret <b>41</b> which in this instance is driven about a vertical axis, preferably in a cyclical rotating manner is illustrated. The folding turret <b>41</b> has pockets <b>42</b> which are distributed in a uniform manner over the circumference of the folding revolver <b>41</b> and which serve to receive partially folded blanks <b>43</b> for the outer packaging <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The blanks <b>43</b> are supplied along a transport path and stamped by means of a so-called beating member <b>44</b> into a pocket <b>42</b> of the folding revolver <b>41</b> and partially folded. A packaging content <b>15</b> with the collar <b>20</b> is conveyed into the pocket <b>42</b> or the blank <b>43</b>. In this instance, a platform <b>45</b> is used.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The packaging content <b>15</b> is supplied along a transport path <b>46</b> of the platform <b>45</b> or transferred thereto. Transversely relative to the transport path <b>46</b>, a collar <b>20</b> is transported along a transverse conveyor belt <b>47</b> and transferred to the platform <b>45</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> further shows that the collars <b>20</b> are separated form a continuous material web <b>48</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The platform <b>45</b> can be moved back and forth in the transport direction according to the arrow <b>49</b> in order to bridge the spacing with respect to the transport path <b>46</b> or transverse conveyor belt <b>47</b>, on the one hand, and the folding turret <b>41</b>, on the other hand. The construction in this regard is similar to the application set out in DE 10 2014 010 615 A1 from the same Applicant, to which reference will be made for the purposes of complete disclosure.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In order to receive the packaging content <b>15</b>, the platform <b>45</b> is moved so far back that the packaging content <b>15</b> can be pushed away by means of a sliding member <b>66</b> onto the platform <b>45</b>. At the same time, the collar <b>20</b> can be transported onward along the transverse conveyor belt <b>47</b> and placed on the platform <b>45</b>. The collar <b>20</b> which is supplied to the platform <b>45</b> is then secured at the rear side by means of two projections <b>50</b> on the platform <b>45</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Afterwards, the packaging content <b>15</b> and collar <b>20</b> are pushed by means of a first sliding member <b>51</b> along the platform <b>45</b> in a transport direction <b>49</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b></figref> on show, the packaging content <b>15</b> rests in this instance on a guide path <b>52</b> of the platform <b>45</b>.
