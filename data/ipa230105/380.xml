some embodiments, an electric field generator generates an electric field at a nominal frequency and a nominal amplitude. The electric field generator is connected to an antenna that radiates the electric field. A detector measures a frequency and an amplitude of the generated electric field as the electric field interacts with a body (such as a human body) in a reactive near-field region of the electric field. For each of one or more internal components of the body, a computation unit determines a respective periodic behavior in the measured frequency corresponding to movement of the internal component. The computation unit also computes, for each of the one or more internal components, a respective rate of the movement of the internal component based on the determined respective periodic behavior in the measured frequency. A gain control circuit adjusts the nominal amplitude according to the measured amplitude.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="90.93mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="226.91mm" wi="154.77mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="121.58mm" wi="162.48mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="229.02mm" wi="134.03mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="224.03mm" wi="149.01mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="149.94mm" wi="156.38mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="182.54mm" wi="151.21mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="230.38mm" wi="123.70mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="229.70mm" wi="142.58mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="176.11mm" wi="149.18mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="193.29mm" wi="156.89mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-D00011" he="221.06mm" wi="135.81mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-D00012" he="184.07mm" wi="166.96mm" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00013" num="00013"><img id="EMI-D00013" he="121.16mm" wi="165.27mm" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00013.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00014" num="00014"><img id="EMI-D00014" he="129.03mm" wi="156.55mm" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00014.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00015" num="00015"><img id="EMI-D00015" he="115.74mm" wi="156.04mm" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00015.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00016" num="00016"><img id="EMI-D00016" he="198.37mm" wi="163.32mm" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00016.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00017" num="00017"><img id="EMI-D00017" he="243.50mm" wi="162.81mm" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00017.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00018" num="00018"><img id="EMI-D00018" he="242.65mm" wi="139.87mm" file="US20230000381A1-20230105-D00018.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser.

For the purpose of clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the embodiments has not been described in detail so that the present disclosure is not unnecessarily obscured.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Introduction</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">This introduction is included only to facilitate the more rapid understanding of the Detailed Description; the introduction is not intended to limit the concepts presented in this disclosure (including explicit examples, if any), as the paragraphs of any introduction are necessarily an abridged view of the entire subject and are not meant to be an exhaustive or restrictive description. For example, the introduction that follows provides overview information limited by space and organization to only certain embodiments. There are many other embodiments and variations thereof, including those to which claims will ultimately be drawn, discussed throughout the balance of the specification.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Many electrical circuits contain antennas and/or antenna-like structures that have the potential to intentionally or unintentionally radiate electric fields (electromagnetic energy) into the environment and/or to couple ambient environmental electromagnetic energy into the electrical circuit. When a body, such as a human body, is in close proximity to such an electrical circuit and close enough to the antennas and/or antenna-like structures, the presence of the body has the potential to influence the nature of the radiated electric field and/or to couple with the electrical circuit. The influence and/or coupling is strongest in what is known as the &#x201c;reactive near-field&#x201d; region, in contrast with the &#x201c;far field&#x201d; region where the body is only influenced by the radiative effects of the electric field but does not substantially couple with the electrical circuit. In the reactive near-field region, the influence and/or coupling can affect the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric field generated by the electrical circuit. An example of the reactive near-field is holding a hand near a radio or TV antenna (e.g., rabbit ears)&#x2014;the coupling of the body into the antenna circuitry changes the capacitance (and/or other parameters) of the circuit demodulating the received antenna signal, and thereby changes the reception.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As a rule of thumb, for electrically-short antennas (antennas whose electrical length is less than one half the wavelength of the frequency being radiated), the reactive near-field is the region near the antenna within 1/(2*&#x3c0;) of the wavelength of the signal being radiated. For example, at 10 MHz the wavelength is roughly 30 meters, and the reactive near-field is within roughly 4.75 meters of the antenna, and at 30 MHz the wavelength is roughly 10 meters and the reactive near-field is within roughly 1.6 meters of the antenna. The coupling effects are stronger the closer the body is to the antenna, and the coupling effects do not entirely disappear at distances greater than 1/(2*&#x3c0;) of the wavelength.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The effects of the body on the electric field can be quantitatively approximated by adding to a model of the electrical circuit (including any associated antennas) a model representing an equivalent circuit of the body. In the case of a human body, one example equivalent circuit model comprises time-varying reactive and dissipative impedance components that represent (a) the physiology of the human body, e.g., organs (including muscles, arteries, veins, etc.), other tissues (such as connective, fat and skin tissues), and liquids (such as blood), and (b) the physiological processes associated with a living organism, e.g., respiration, blood circulation, and peristalsis. The values of the time-varying reactive and dissipative impedance components and how they change due to physiological processes are a complex function of multiple factors including the frequency or frequencies being radiated, the type and/or nature of the antennas and/or antenna-like structures (e.g., an actual antenna vs. an unintentional radiator), the dynamic nature of the coupling between the electrical circuit and the human body (e.g., depending on distance and/or orientation of the human body), and the actual physiological parameters of the human body itself (e.g., respiration rate, heart rate, mass, and body mass index (BMI)).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The frequency of the electric field has multiple effects. First, the frequency of the electric field affects how deeply into the body the electric field penetrates (i.e., whether components of the body closer to the surface of the body produce the majority of the effects). Very high (e.g., 10 GHz) frequencies (having very short wavelengths) generally only have effects at or near the surface of a body, while lower frequencies (e.g., 10 MHz with a 30 meter wavelength) penetrate much more deeply. Second, at least in the case of a human body, the electrical properties (e.g., permittivity and/or dissipation factor) of the components of the body (e.g., organs, other tissues, and liquids) are frequency-dependent in differing ways. For example, the variation of the electrical properties of organs with frequency is different from the variation of the electrical properties of tissues with frequency, and thus the effect of organs vs. tissues on the electric field varies with the frequency of the electric field.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one existing technique, electric fields are used to observe a single organ of the body. In such a technique, small probes are placed very near the heart and are designed to observe that single organ. Such a technique is limited in its applicability and cannot, for example, be used to compute physiological parameters of multiple organs at the same time, or be used in a passive manner to observe physiological parameters of a sleeping human body that may move (e.g., change positions) relative to a stationary probe.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">One area of applicability of a device that can compute physiological parameters is to determine nighttime resting respiration rate and/or heart rate. Changes in one or more of these nighttime resting rates over a period of days have been shown to be a good predictor of the onset of, for example, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbations. Current products that attempt to compute these physiological parameters for a patient have one or more of the following problems:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0034">Require activity of the patient to use (e.g., wear, charge, aim, etc.) the device, leading to a lack of 100% compliance (e.g., accurate computations every night).</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0035">Inaccurate computations, even if the patient being observed is relatively still.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0036">Unable to operate through blankets, sheets, nighttime clothes, etc.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0037">Not operable and/or accurate independent of movement of the patient and/or of the position of the patient on a bed (e.g., sleeping on the back, vs. on the side, vs. on the stomach).</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0038">Inability to discriminate events, such as the patient changing position (e.g., rolling over) or temporarily getting out of bed.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0039">Inability to produce accurate results in the presence of other bodies, such as a human partner or a pet, in the same bed.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0040">Subject to interference from environmental factors (e.g., a ceiling fan), causing inaccuracy and/or errors.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0035" num="0041">In various embodiments, the techniques described herein are able to overcome one or more of the above problems.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Overview</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0042">While the techniques described herein are sometimes explained using a human body comprising organs, other tissues, and liquids with different electrical properties as an example, the techniques are applicable to computation of parameters of other types of bodies, including other organic bodies (e.g., plants or animals) and inorganic bodies (e.g., mechanical or electrical devices).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0043">In some embodiments, an electric field generator generates an electric field at a nominal frequency and/or with a nominal amplitude. In various embodiments, the nominal frequency is a predefined nominal frequency. In other embodiments, the nominal frequency is statically (e.g., at power-on in response to configuration information) and/or dynamically adjusted. In various embodiments, the nominal amplitude is a predefined nominal amplitude. In other embodiments, the nominal amplitude is statically and/or dynamically adjusted.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0044">The electric field is radiated through an antenna, such as a two-wire antenna, and interacts with a body (such as a human body) in the reactive near-field region of the electric field. A detector observes the electric field as it varies (due to coupling of the body with the electric field generator) and measures the electric field's frequency and/or amplitude. From the frequency and/or the amplitude measurements, one or more parameters of the body are computed. In various embodiments and/or usage scenarios, a change in the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric field is indicative of a parameter of the body. For example, an industrial application is able to use an electric field to measure the thickness of glass. In other embodiments and/or usage scenarios, the one or more parameters of the body (such as physiological parameters of the human body) are computed, such as by determining one or more respective periodicities (periodic behavior patterns) in the frequency and/or the amplitude measurements. A physiological parameter of the human body includes, for example, a rate of a physiological process (e.g., a respiration rate or a heart rate), a waveform indicating behavior of a physiological process (e.g., a respiratory waveform), a measurement of a part of the human body (e.g., a mass or a body mass index), etc. In further embodiments, the computed physiological parameters are tracked over time (e.g., over days, weeks, months, or years) to determine changes and/or trends.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0045">While the electric field is generated at the nominal frequency, interactions of the body with the electric field generator, such as due to coupling in the reactive near-field region of the electric field, cause the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric field measured by the detector to change. In other words, when a body is present in the reactive near-field region of an electric field, one or more properties of the generated electric field change (e.g., when compared to an electric field generated at the nominal frequency and/or at the nominal amplitude without a body present in the reactive near-field region) as a result of the coupling between the electric field and the body. In a first example, permittivity of the body changes the effective capacitance of a circuit used by the electric field generator due to the coupling, and thus affects the frequency. In a second example, the dissipation factor of the body changes the effective load resistance of a circuit used by the electric field generator due to the coupling, and thus affects the amplitude. Further, if the body as a whole, or internal portions of the body (e.g., organs, other tissues, or liquid in a human body) are in motion, the permittivity and/or dissipation factor change dynamically in response to the motion.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0046">In some embodiments, two or more antennas are used to provide spatial and/or frequency diversity. In a first example, two antennas are used and the one of the two antennas which exhibits the strongest coupling of the body to the electric field generator is used for the computation of the one or more parameters of the body. In a second example, both antennas are used and their signals are combined (such as with respective weighting factors according to respective signal quality measures) so as to improve the computation of at least one of the one or more parameters of the body. In a third example, two or more antennas cover different regions of a bed in order to isolate the effects of two or more bodies on the bed and/or to provide sensing coverage over a larger portion of the bed. The two or more antennas are usable to improve the computation of the one or more parameters of one of the bodies on the bed, and/or to separately compute respective one or more parameters of each of the bodies on the bed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0047">In various embodiments, one or more techniques are used to improve the computation of the one or more parameters, such as controlling the electric field generator to adjust the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric field. In a first example, adjusting the frequency of the electric field maintains the electric field at or near (e.g., within a few percent of) the nominal frequency. In a second example, adjusting the frequency of the electric field improves the quality measure (e.g., the signal-to-noise ratio) of the one or more parameters of the body (e.g., a degree to which the one or more parameters affect the frequency of the electric field). In a third example, adjusting the amplitude of the electric field compensates for effects of the body being too close to or too far from the antenna.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0048">In some usage scenarios, movement of the body with respect to a stationary antenna radiating the electric field causes a disturbance in the electric field that creates inaccuracies in the computation of the one or more parameters. In a first example, movement of a human body (e.g., rolling over) perturbs the coupling of the human body to the electric field generator, creating inaccuracies in the computation of a physiological parameter of the human body. In a second example, a pet jumping onto a bed perturbs the coupling of a human body to the electric field generator, creating inaccuracies in the computation of a physiological parameter of the human body. In some embodiments, blanking techniques detect such disturbances and eliminate a portion of the frequency and/or the amplitude measurements of the electric field from consideration in the computation of the one or more parameters.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Body Parameter Computing Device (BPCD)</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0049">In some embodiments, a Body Parameter Computing Device (BPCD) is used to compute and store and/or communicate one or more parameters of one or more bodies being evaluated. The BPCD is a non-contact device that uses measurements of electric fields interacting with the one or more bodies to compute the one or more parameters of the one or more bodies. In some embodiments, the BPCD is a single device located at a single location. In other embodiments, the BPCD comprises multiple devices, such as front-end circuitry (e.g., analog front-end circuitry) and back-end circuitry (e.g., computation and/or processing circuitry), that are optionally and/or selectively co-located. In further embodiments, one or more portions of the BPCD (e.g., the computation and/or processing circuitry) resides in the &#x201c;cloud&#x201d; (e.g., on a server reachable over a network) and/or in multiple remote devices.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0050">For a human body, the BPCD has applications to one or more of:</p><p id="p-0045" num="0051">computing physiological parameters (e.g., heart rate, respiration rate, lung expansion profile, mass, and/or BMI) of the human body; and using the computations of the physiological parameters to detect one or more symptoms and/or to predict one or more conditions and/or the onsets of those conditions. Examples of symptoms include congestion of the lungs, frequency of coughing, irregular heartbeat, a change in heart rate variability, edema, a change in an amount of blood flow to a specific organ, etc. Examples of conditions include Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbations, heart disease or other heart conditions (e.g., Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), myocardial infarction, myocarditis, etc.), aneurysms, pulmonary embolisms, hematomas, strokes, sepsis, renal disease or failure, infections (e.g., urinary tract infections, pneumonias, abscesses, etc.), tumors (including malignant cancers and benign tumors), healing of an injury (predicted from an increased amount of blood flow to a specific organ, and other illnesses and diseases.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>16</b></figref> illustrate examples of selected details of systems comprising a BPCD or portions of such systems.

Continuing the first example, measuring nighttime resting heart rate and/or respiration rate can be a predictor of a disease and/or onset of a condition related to a disease, such as COPD or CHF. In a second example, the BPCD is able to use measurements of nighttime heart rates, nighttime respiration rates, and nighttime movement to enable analysis of sleep stages. In a third example, the BPCD is able to compute the heart rate of a human body in a sitting position by, for example, measuring an effect of the femoral artery on the electric field. Continuing the third example, the heart rate measured in a sitting position has applications to driver alertness (where excessive upper body motion may be common), and to patients who are sitting up (rather than lying down) in a hospital bed. The effect of the femoral artery on the electric field is due, at least in part, to movement of the femoral artery including movement of blood (e.g., a pulse wave) in the femoral artery.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0065">In various embodiments, a nighttime resting rate of a physiological parameter of a human body, such as a nighttime resting heart rate or a nighttime resting respiration rate, refers to one or more of: an average rate of the physiological parameter during periods in which the human body is at rest and/or asleep; an average rate of the physiological parameter during periods in which the human body is determined to be in a specific sleep state, such as a deep sleep state; a lowest point in the average rate of the physiological parameter during the nighttime, where averaging, such as rolling averaging, is performed over intervals such as one minute, three minutes, five minutes, or ten minutes; a series of average rates, such as rolling averages computed over an interval, of the physiological parameter during the nighttime; any other function indicating the nighttime behavior of the physiological parameter; and any combination of the foregoing. In further embodiments, the term &#x201c;nighttime&#x201d; does not exclusively refer to hours when the sun is down, but is intended to refer to periods of time during which the human body is in bed (or on some other structure) for any purpose, such as rest, sleep, observation, and/or any other state of reduced activity (e.g., coma). Accordingly, a &#x201c;nighttime&#x201d; resting rate includes any resting rate as described herein.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0066">In some embodiments, a BPCD is operable to perform measurements more or less continuously (e.g., throughout a 24-hour day and/or for multiple days). In other embodiments, the BPCD is operable to perform measurements during certain hours of the day and/or based on a schedule (e.g., when a factory is operational, or when a human body is expected to be in bed). In further embodiments, the BPCD is operable to perform measurements when enabled, such as when turned on by a person, or when instructed to start taking measurements by a command sent over a network. In any one or more of these various embodiments, measurements of the frequency and/or of the amplitude of the electric field are gathered at a succession of time points during which the BPCD is operable to perform measurements (e.g., during a measuring period). In various embodiments, the frequency and/or amplitude of the electric field change over time due at least in part to interactions with a human body subject to the electric field (e.g., in the reactive near-field region of the electric field). In various embodiments, a computation unit computes, for any one or more internal components of the human body and using each of multiple computation points (e.g., corresponding to the measurement time points or corresponding to an averaging period or a sliding window duration) during the measuring period, a rate of movement of the internal component according to a respective periodic (including quasiperiodic) behavior in the measured frequency. In some embodiments, the rate of movement of any of the one or more internal components at the multiple computation points are used to predict a condition of the human body.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0067">A granularity of the succession of time points is, according to various embodiments, anywhere from microseconds to hours, depending, for example, on the application of the BPCD. Further, while the succession of time points are monotonic in time, they are not necessarily evenly spaced. In a first example, there are &#x201c;jumps&#x201d; in time representing periods when the BPCD is not operable to perform measurements. In a second example, the granularity of the succession of time points is dynamically changed, such as when a period with a relatively low rate of change in the frequency and/or the amplitude is determined, or when measurements of the frequency and/or the amplitude are less critical to computing overall statistics. Continuing the second example, if the BPCD determines that a human body whose physiological parameters were being computed is no longer present in the electric field (such as by determining a change in the measured amplitude), a granularity of the succession of time points is decreased until the human body returns.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Physiological Parameters</heading><p id="p-0052" num="0068">In some embodiments, a BPCD, via measurements of an electric field interacting with a human body, is enabled to compute one or more physiological parameters of the human body. (The term &#x201c;physiological parameters&#x201d; is used to refer to any quantification of an activity or a state of the human body, including normal activities such as heart rate, abnormal activities such as coughing or sneezing, other bodily activities such as movement, and/or body states such as BMI or weight.) By analyzing the phase, frequency and/or amplitude of the electric field, the BPCD is able to determine periodic (including quasiperiodic) and/or non-periodic behaviors of the human body. Examples of periodic behavior include respiration (e.g., lung and/or chest movement), and heartbeats (e.g., heart and/or blood movement). Examples of non-periodic behavior include movement of a limb of the body or other motions of the human body (e.g., arm motion, rolling over, and/or getting out of a bed or chair), and non-periodic respiratory events (e.g., coughing, sneezing, and hiccupping). From the determination of the periodic and/or the non-periodic behavior, the BPCD is enabled to compute one or more physiological parameters of the human body, such as a heart rate, a respiration rate, frequency of coughing, and/or a number of occurrences (over an interval) of a type of movement (e.g., a number of occurrences of getting out of bed, or a number of occurrences of rolling over in bed).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0069">In some embodiments, determining the periodic behavior includes determining a repeating pattern in the phase, frequency, and/or amplitude of the measurements of an electric field. In further embodiments, one or more overlapping repeated patterns are determined (e.g., one pattern for respiration and one pattern for heartbeats).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0070">In some embodiments, determining the non-periodic behavior includes determining an abrupt change in measurements of the phase, frequency, and/or amplitude of the electric field, and/or determining a disruption in the periodic behavior. For example, a detector (e.g., a differential detector) measures an amplitude of an electric field generated by an electric field generator. According to the measured amplitude, a computation unit of the BPCD determines one or more non-periodic behaviors. In further embodiments, the BPCD is enabled to use the determination of the non-periodic behavior to improve accuracy of computation of the one or more physiological parameters of the human body, the detection of one or more symptoms of conditions of the human body, and/or the prediction of one or more conditions of the human body. In a first example, determining a non-periodic behavior such as a cough (determined, for example, as a particular respiratory waveform pattern) enables the BPCD to not consider a portion of the measurements (e.g., the non-periodic behaviors) of the electric field as suitable for some computations (e.g., for respiration rate or other periodic behaviors). In a second example, computing a rate of occurrence (over a measurement interval, such as a number of hours) of a non-periodic behavior such as a cough indicates an occurrence of a symptom of the human body (such as congestion of the lungs). In a third example, computing a rate of occurrence (over a measurement interval, such as a number of hours) of a non-periodic behavior such as a breathing disruption indicates a symptom of the human body, such as sleep apnea. In a fourth example, computing a number of occurrences (over a measurement interval, such as nighttime) of the human body leaving the vicinity of the electric field indicates a symptom of the human body, such as a frequency of a need to urinate. In a fifth example, determining a degree of absorption of the electric field by the human body (e.g., from the amplitude of the electric field) is indicative of weight of the human body. While the degree of absorption is also dependent on other factors, such as position of the human body relative to the electric field, as with nighttime resting heart rate, a nighttime resting degree of absorption is computable.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0071">In some embodiments, computing the physiological parameter includes computing a function of the periodic and/or non-periodic behavior, such as an average (over some period of time, e.g., a specified number of seconds, minutes, hours, or days), a long-term average (e.g., an average, over a longer period, of averages over shorter periods, optionally with determined gaps for non-periodic behavior), or a standard deviation. In a first example, a BPCD computes a short-term average heart rate, such as by determining, over a first measurement interval (e.g., one minute), the number of peaks of the heartbeat effect observed in the measurements of the electric field. Continuing the first example, the BPCD computes a heart rate variability by determining durations of individual heartbeats, such as by determining, within a second measurement interval (e.g., five minutes, a day, a period of days, etc.), the time of occurrence of the peaks of the heartbeat effect and computing a standard deviation of the durations. Further in the first example, the BPCD computes a resting heart rate (such as a nighttime resting heart rate) by observing over a third measurement interval longer than the first measurement interval when the short-term average heart rate has reached a relative minimum value for a number of successive measurements. In a second example, the periodic behavior is a superposition of multiple sources, such as a heartbeat waveform and a respiration waveform. The BPCD is able to separate the sources (such as by frequency filtering) to compute a separate waveform for each of the sources, such as a respiration waveform and a heartbeat waveform.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0072">In various embodiments, the BPCD is enabled to compute, as a function of a function of the periodic and/or non-periodic behavior, one or more physiological parameters of the human body, such as: heart rate, respiration rate; respiratory waveform (e.g., the amount and rate of chest inflation and deflation); weight gain (e.g., due to edema); sleep patterns (e.g., a duration of and/or a number of times the human body is in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep); frequency of coughing, sneezing, hiccupping, and/or other breathing disruptions; a frequency, duration and/or an amount of a type of movement (e.g., restlessness while sleeping, or a change in behavior getting into or out of bed); any other physiological parameter of the human body observable via measurements of the electric field; computation of any of the foregoing over respective one or more intervals; variability (e.g., standard deviation) and/or any other function of any of the foregoing; changes in any of the foregoing over a period of time (e.g., over days or weeks); and any combination of the foregoing. In some embodiments, the one or more physiological parameters of the human body are used to detect one or more symptoms of one or more conditions of the human body and/or predict one or more conditions the human body, such as a condition of having a disease, a symptom of the onset of disease, or a symptom of a disease.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0073">In various embodiments, the BPCD is enabled to use machine learning models and/or neural networks (e.g., convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks) that are trained to classify the measurements of the phase, frequency, and/or amplitude of the electric field and/or statistically processed versions of the measurements of the phase, frequency, and/or amplitude of the electric field to determine any of the periodic and/or non-periodic behaviors, to compute any of the physiological parameters of the human body, to detect any of the symptoms, and/or to predict any of the conditions. In further embodiments, training the machine learning model and/or neural network uses a script executed by test subjects to produce measurements of the electric field containing the desired periodic and/or non-periodic behaviors at known times and/or for known durations.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0074">In some embodiments, the BPCD is enabled to detect, from the one or more physiological parameters, one or more symptoms (of one or more conditions) of the human body, such as symptoms of one or more of: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbations; Congestive Heart Failure (CHF); atrial fibrillation or other irregular heartbeat; breathing disorders (e.g., congestion or apnea); alertness (e.g., not falling asleep); edema; and symptoms of many other conditions. In further embodiments the BPCD is enabled, using the detected symptoms, to predict a condition (or the onset thereof) of the human body.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0075">As one example of use of a BPCD, consider early detection of Chronic</p><p id="p-0060" num="0076">Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbations (worsening in airway function and respiratory symptoms over a period of days). There is no current &#x201c;gold standard&#x201d; for predicting COPD exacerbations, though a patient questionnaire&#x2014;the COPD Assessment Test&#x2122; (CAT)&#x2014;has been shown to have some predictive value. The CAT is filled out by patients daily; eight different questions are scored on a zero to five scale, and the overall score is indicative of the patient's quality of life. By observing increasing scores, the CAT has been shown to be able to predict COPD exacerbations relatively reliably up to five days in advance. (The same study that showed the relationship between CAT scores and COPD exacerbations also showed a stronger relationship between changes in nighttime resting heart rate and COPD exacerbations.) But the CAT has issues in its use as a COPD exacerbation predictor. First, it is subjective. Second, it requires full (e.g., 100%) patient compliance, which is difficult to achieve other than in specially arranged clinical trials. A BPCD is able to answer some of the same questions as the CAT (e.g., presence of cough, sleep patterns, and/or presence of phlegm through change in lung capacity), to compute physiological parameters (e.g., resting heart rate and/or resting respiration rate) repeatedly during a monitoring period (e.g., several days), and to do so with 100% compliance (assuming the patient simply sleeps in a bed where the BPCD is installed). Because of this, the BPCD is known to be at least as good a predictor of COPD exacerbations as the CAT based on use of heart rate alone as a predictor. By combining various physiological parameters of the human body, the BPCD is believed to be a better predictor of COPD exacerbations than the CAT. In particular, by monitoring (over a period of days) physiological parameters (e.g., at nighttime) and detecting changes thereof, such as changes in heart rate, changes in respiration rate, changes in respiratory waveform (including a rate and/or volume of respiration), frequency of cough, changes in nighttime movement (e.g., restlessness), changes in behavior in getting into or out of bed, and changes in sleep patterns (such as an amount and/or frequency of REM sleep), the BPCD is able to predict a condition of the human body (e.g., the onset of a COPD exacerbation) up to a week or more in advance of the exacerbation becoming critical. In various embodiments, changes in respiratory waveform over a period of days are used, in combination with other physiological parameters, to predict the onset of a COPD exacerbation. For example, increases in slope of the rise of the respiratory waveform (e.g., faster inhalation), decreases in slope of the fall of the respiratory waveform (e.g., slower exhalation), decreases in amplitude of the respiratory waveform, decreases in volume of respiration (the area under one cycle of the respiratory waveform), increased variability in respiration (e.g., more coughing, intermittent gasping for breath), and/or increases in a nighttime resting heart rate (e.g., by at least two standard deviations) are, alone or in combination, used as factors in predicting the onset of a COPD exacerbation.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Electric Field Generator</heading><p id="p-0061" num="0077">In some embodiments, an electric field generator generates an electric field at a nominal frequency and/or with a nominal amplitude, such as 26 MHz and 2.75 Volts, or 21 MHz and 1.0 Volts. The nominal frequency and the nominal amplitude are the frequency and amplitude generated by the electric field generator when there is no external coupling (e.g., due to objects and/or bodies in the reactive near-field region of the electric field). In some embodiments, the nominal frequency and/or the nominal amplitude are a design property of circuitry of the electric field generator. In various embodiments, the nominal frequency and/or the nominal amplitude are configured initially, such as at power-on of a BPCD containing the electric field generator. In further embodiments, the nominal frequency and/or the nominal amplitude are dynamically adjusted, such as by a tuner, as explained in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0078">In some embodiments, the electric field is generated using circuitry such as an inductor-capacitor oscillator, a tank oscillator, a resistor-capacitor oscillator, a resonator (such as a narrowband resonator), or any other type of oscillatory circuit configured to be responsive to reactive near-field coupling effects. In further embodiments, the electric field is generated by circuitry, such as phase-shift circuitry, connected to a fixed frequency circuit such as a crystal oscillator. In various embodiments, the electric field generator comprises a differential oscillatory circuit, such as a differential tank oscillator. In further embodiments using a differential oscillatory circuit, the differential oscillatory circuit radiates the electric field via a differential antenna (as illustrated by antenna <b>1102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>), enabling a use of differential detection circuitry (to measure frequency and/or amplitude of the electric field) so as to be far less sensitive to (e.g., to reject) common-mode noise (e.g., a person walking near the BPCD).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0079">Using a frequency under 30 MHz advantageously avoids FCC regulations applicable to frequencies 30 MHz or higher, though the techniques described herein are usable over a wide range of frequencies, such as from under 5 MHz to over 100 MHz. In various embodiments, different nominal frequencies and/or different nominal amplitudes are used for different applications and/or usage scenarios. It is noted and understood that any specific values discussed herein (e.g., frequencies, amplitudes, etc.) are meant to be illustrative only. Other values, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant arts, are also contemplated and encompassed within the scope of this disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Antenna</heading><p id="p-0064" num="0080">In some embodiments, the electric field is radiated through an antenna, such as a two-wire antenna, a monopole antenna, a dipole antenna, a differential antenna, an interdigitated antenna, any collection of one or more radiating elements, or any combination of the preceding. In various embodiments, any type of antenna that can radiate the electric field so as to couple electrical circuitry generating the electric field (e.g., an electric field generator) with a body (for which at least one parameter is to be computed) is usable. In further embodiments, the antenna is stationary relative to the body, such as by being attached to and/or as part of a bed (e.g., a bed frame, a mattress, etc.), a covering of the bed (e.g., a bed sheet, blanket, a pillow, a mattress topper, etc.), a chair, or any other item with which the body is in relatively close proximity (e.g., within the reactive near-field region of the electric field radiated by the antenna). In various examples, the antenna is positioned on the bed such that it is not in direct contact with a human body during operation of the BPCD. For example, the antenna is positioned underneath a bed covering. While example embodiments describe implementations with respect to a &#x201c;bed,&#x201d; it is understood that this term is not intended to be limiting. Rather, a &#x201c;bed&#x201d; as that term is used herein includes any structure that is in relatively close proximity to a body and which is usable for sleeping, resting, observation, monitoring, etc. as described herein. Further, there is no implication in the use of the term &#x201c;bed&#x201d; that the body is lying down (e.g., prone or supine), and the techniques described herein are usable with the body in any position (e.g., sitting, standing, etc.).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0081">In some embodiments, the antenna is a differential antenna (e.g., as compared to an antenna with one active lead and one ground lead, a differential antenna has in-phase and out-of-phase signals transmitted by separate antenna elements). For example, the antenna is connected to a differential electric field generator and/or to a differential detector. In various embodiments and/or usage scenarios, use of a differential antenna provides greater rejection of common mode noise. For example, when computing physiological parameters of a first human body, use of a differential antenna provides greater immunity to common-mode noise, and even a second human body further away from the antenna than the first human body affects signals from the antenna largely as common-mode noise.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0082">In some embodiments, the antenna is considered to be a sensor, as it &#x201c;senses&#x201d; interactions of the body with the electric field. For example, additional embodiments described below with respect to a &#x201c;sensor strap&#x201d; are usable as an antenna. Such techniques are usable with and/or combinable with the techniques described herein. In various embodiments, a structure of the antenna is optimized for near-field coupling (vs. typical radio antennas, such as dipoles, which are optimized for far-field reception, or vs. coil antennas which are optimized for magnetic field coupling). In various embodiments, the antenna structure comprises a plurality of legs, with each leg having a plurality of traces. For example, a differential &#x201c;2c3&#x201d; antenna structure, as that term is used herein, has two parallel legs separated by a distance determined at least in part by the nominal frequency of the electric field generator and/or the desired penetration into the body. Each of the legs of the 2c3 antenna comprises multiple parallel traces (e.g., conductors), such as three traces for the 2c3 antenna, at a closer separation than the separation between the two legs. Wider separation between the legs provides a deeper penetration into a body adjacent to (e.g., lying on) the antenna, but with a lower average magnitude of the resulting electric field. Up to a point (e.g., until transmission power limits are reached), the lower average magnitude is able to be compensated by increasing a driving voltage of the electric field. In some embodiments and/or usage scenarios, the separation between the legs is between 1 and 20 inches, such as 3.5 inches or 12 inches, and the separation between the multiple parallel traces of each leg is between 0.1 and 0.5 inches, such as 0.25 inches.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0083">In general, by varying one or more factors such as spacing of legs of an antenna, a number of parallel traces of each of the legs, a width and/or a length of each of the parallel traces, and/or a degree of interdigitation (if any), the antenna is optimizable for a depth of penetration into a body vs. a broader area of coverage with a shallower depth of penetration. In some embodiments, a length and/or a width of each of the legs and/or of each of the parallel traces of the legs differs. For example, adding additional parallel traces in a particular area increases coverage in that area.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0084">In various embodiments, a length of the legs of a near-field-coupling optimized antenna is chosen to correspond to a width of a human body when lying supine. For example, a 19 inch length is sufficient for the supine width of approximately 95% of the human population. In general, shorter antenna lengths couple less to the human body (and thus have smaller coupling interactions), and longer antenna lengths potentially create additional dissipative loading (leading to increased dampening of the electric field) and/or have increased coupling with environmental factors not associated with the human body being observed. Other types of antennas, such as other configurations of interdigitated and/or differential antennas, are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0085">In some embodiments, a differential 2c3 or other antenna, such as a near-field-coupling-optimized antenna, is part of a sensor strap system attached to a bed <b>1700</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A</figref> (full view) and <b>17</b>B (enlarged view).

In various embodiments, an active guard trace uses a buffered and optionally and/or selectively (slightly) attenuated copy of a same signal being transmitted by the wire being protected. Whereas a ground shield introduces capacitance vs. the wire being protected, this type of active guard trace has minimal or no capacitive impact as there is no appreciable voltage differential (vs. the signal being guarded).

In further embodiments and/or usage scenarios, computation of one or more physiological parameters of the first human body are a function of the measurements of the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric fields radiated by the first and the second antennas. For example, by computing one or more physiological parameters of the second human body using measures of the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric field radiated by the second antenna, an effect of the second human body on the electric field radiated by the first antenna is determined and used to improve computation of one or more physiological parameters of the first human body using measurements of the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric field radiated by the first antenna. For example, by determining the effects of the second body on the second electrical field, the accuracy of computing physiological parameters of the first human body is enhanced.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0100">In various embodiments, two or more antennas are used to provide spatial and/or frequency diversity. Spatial diversity is provided, for example, by having each of the two or more antennas in a respective physical location and/or in a respective orientation and thus interacting more strongly with bodies at or near the respective physical location and/or better aligned with the respective orientation. The stronger interaction with a particular one of the antennas provides, for example, improved signal quality for measurement of a physiological parameter of one of the bodies. Frequency diversity is provided, for example, by having each of the two or more antennas radiate at a respective nominal frequency. In some of the various embodiments, measurements of the respective frequency and/or the respective amplitude radiated by each of the two or more antennas are used individually, such as for respective bodies interacting with electric fields radiated by each of the two or more antennas. In others of the various embodiments, measurements of the respective frequency and/or the respective amplitude radiated by each of the two or more antennas are combined, at least in part, to improve computation of one or more parameters of at least one body interacting with the electric field radiated by at least one of the two or more antennas. For example, computation of one or more parameters of a first body interacting with the electric field radiated by a first one of the two or more antennas is used to determine an effect of the first body on the electric field radiated by a second one of the two or more antennas and to improve computation of one or more parameters of a second body interacting with the electric field radiated by the second antenna. In some of the various embodiments, each of the two or more antennas is connected to a respective electric field generator. In others of the various embodiments, a single electric field generator is time-division multiplexed so that only one of the two or more antennas is used at a time.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0101">In some embodiments, two or more antennas are used to provide separately optimized detection of respective periodic and/or non-periodic behaviors in the measured changes in the frequency and/or amplitude of the electric field. For example, a first antenna is optimized for greater depth of penetration into a human body (e.g., using wider spacing between legs of the antenna) and is better able to measure a respiration rate than a second antenna optimized for broader coverage at a shallower depth (e.g., using closer spacing between legs of the antenna and/or more elements in each of the legs of the antenna) used to measure heart rate (e.g., via blood flow and/or skin movement). In further embodiments, each of the two or more antennas is connected to a respective electric field generator operating at a respective nominal frequency and/or a respective nominal amplitude, where the respective nominal frequency and/or the respective nominal amplitude are selected to optimize for best detection of the respective periodic and/or non-periodic behavior.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0102">According to various embodiments in which two or more antennas are used, the two or more antennas are one or more of: operated at a same nominal frequency and/or nominal amplitude; operated at different nominal frequencies and/or nominal amplitudes; operated at a same time; operated at different times, such as in a time-division multiplexed manner; operated synchronously (e.g., in a coordinated fashion); operated asynchronously (e.g., independently enabled and/or controlled); and any combination of the foregoing.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0103">In some embodiments where two or more antennas are in use (e.g., at a same time), each of the two or more antennas radiates a respective electric field at a respective nominal frequency. In various embodiments, the respective nominal frequencies are selected such that one or more of: any beat frequencies have minimal or no impact on computations of one or more parameters of at least one body interacting with at least one of the respective electric fields; separation between a pair of the respective nominal frequencies is at least as large as expected changes in frequency due to interactions of one or more bodies with the respective electric fields; and any combination of the foregoing. In further embodiments, each of the two or more antennas is connected to a respective electric field generator (e.g., electric field generator <b>104</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), and each of the respective electric field generators is connected to a respective detector (e.g., quadrature demodulator <b>108</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0104">In some embodiments, two or more antennas radiating respective electric fields at respective frequencies are used to compute respective physiological parameters of two or more organs of a human body. In other embodiments, one antenna is time-division multiplexed to radiate (in different time slots) two or more respective electric fields at respective frequencies to compute the respective physiological parameters of the two or more organs of the human body. In further of these embodiments, a first one of the respective frequencies is adjusted to improve a quality measure (e.g., a signal-to-noise ratio) for computation of the respective physiological parameters of a first one of the two or more organs, and a second one of the respective frequencies is adjusted to improve a quality measure for computation of the respective physiological parameters of a second one of the two or more organs.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0105">In some embodiments where two or more antennas are in use (e.g., at a same time), each of the two or more antennas radiates a respective electric field at a same nominal frequency. In further embodiments, each of the two or more antennas is connected to a respective phase-shifting circuit (e.g., resonant circuit <b>604</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The respective phase-shifting circuit provides one input to a respective demodulator (e.g., mixer <b>602</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), and there is a common oscillator providing a second input to all of the respective demodulators. Connecting each of the antennas to a separate isolated source (such as the output of the phase-shifting circuit) but operating all of the antennas at a same nominal frequency mitigates issues of interference and/or beat frequencies that are possible with antennas operating at different nominal frequencies.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0106">While the examples described herein have generally used one or two antennas and/or one or two bodies, the techniques described herein are applicable to any number of antennas used to measure the parameters of any number of bodies.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Detector</heading><p id="p-0085" num="0107">In some embodiments, a detector measures the frequency and/or the amplitude of an electric field as it interacts with a body (e.g., a human body) in a reactive near-field region of the electric field. That is, the detector measures the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric field as the electrical circuitry generating the electric field (e.g., an electric field generator) couples with the body. In some embodiments, the detector comprises a first detector to measure the frequency of the electric field and a second detector to measure the amplitude of the electric field. In other embodiments, a single detector is able to measure both the frequency and the amplitude of the electric field. In various embodiments, any number of detectors, each measuring the frequency and/or the amplitude of a respective electric field, are used.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0108">While the description herein refers to &#x201c;measurement of the frequency of the electric field&#x201d; or &#x201c;measurement of the amplitude of the electric field&#x201d; using the singular noun &#x201c;measurement&#x201d; (or similar phrases with other forms of &#x201c;measure&#x201d;), this includes not just a single measurement, but a series of measurements computed over time. For example, to compute a physiological parameter of a human body such as a heart rate (in the range, for example, of between 20 and 200 beats per minute), the detector measurements of the frequency and/or of the amplitude are performed at a multiple (e.g., a fraction, one, or a number greater than one) of the rate of the parameter being measured, such as at least twice as fast, or up to hundreds or thousands of times as fast. Continuing the example, the detector measurement of the frequency of the electric field as used to compute a heart rate of a human body is performed, in some embodiments and/or usage scenarios, 1000 times per second, and in other embodiments and/or usage scenarios, 10000 times or more per second.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0109">A detector to measure the frequency of the electric field is any type of detector that measures any frequency associated with the electric field, such as a detector that directly measures a frequency of a signal, or a detector that measures the relative frequency of a signal as compared to a reference such as the nominal frequency (e.g., measuring changes in the frequency of the signal as compared to the nominal frequency). In a first example, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the frequency changes due to coupling with the body are treated as a form of frequency modulation, and any suitable frequency demodulator (e.g., quadrature demodulator <b>108</b>) or frequency detector (e.g., a phase-locked loop (PLL)) is usable to generate a waveform, such as a voltage waveform or a current waveform, corresponding to the frequency changes over time. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, frequencies less than the nominal frequency produce increasingly more negative voltages, and frequencies greater than the nominal frequency produce increasingly more positive voltages. In some embodiments, a voltage waveform thus generated is further processed by an analog-to-digital converter to produce a series of values corresponding to the waveform that are further processable, such as by a digital signal processor. In various embodiments, the analog-to-digital converter is a 12-bit, a 16-bit, a 20-bit, a 24-bit analog-to-digital converter, or any other suitable analog-to-digital converter. In a second example, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a sample-and-hold device samples the electric field (as it interacts with the body in the electric field) at a specified sampling rate, and an analog-to-digital converter converts the output of the sample-and-hold device to a stream of digital information (corresponding to samples of the waveform of the electric field) that is further processable, such as by a digital signal processor. In a third example, a wideband analog-to-digital converter is able to measure the electric field directly at a high enough sampling rate to capture, with a sufficient quality measure (e.g., a signal-to-noise ratio), the changes in the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric field due to interactions with the body in the electric field.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0110">In some embodiments, for example as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the detector is connected to the electric field generator and directly measures the frequency generated by the electric field generator as it changes due to interactions with one or more bodies in the electric field radiated by the antenna (e.g., external sensor device <b>102</b> or <b>402</b>). There is no separate receiver (e.g., a separate antenna or a duplexer enabling a single antenna to both transmit and receive) to receive a signal (e.g., a reflected signal) from the generated electric field. In other words, the detector does not measure the frequency of the generated electric field by measuring a reflection or a reflected signal of the generated electric field, but instead measures the frequency of the generated electric field based on a connection to the electric field generator itself. In various embodiments, the electric field generator is connected between the antenna and the detector. In further embodiments, the detector is solely connected to any antenna indirectly via the electric field generator, and thus the detector is only able to measure the frequency of the generated electric field by measuring the frequency generated by the electric field generator. In various embodiments, the detector is configured to operate without a reference oscillator by comparing the frequency generated by the electric field generator with a phase-shifted version of itself. In further embodiments, the phase shift corresponds to a 90-degree phase shift at the nominal frequency. In some embodiments, the antenna is connected to the output of the electric field generator, while in other embodiments the antenna is connected to the phase-shifted version of the output of the electric field generator.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0111">In various embodiments and/or usage scenarios, by measuring changes (e.g., as compared to the nominal frequency) in the frequency generated by the electric field generator due to interactions with the one or more bodies in the electric field, the detector detects changes in the coupling capacitance of the one or more bodies caused by movement of internal portions (e.g., organs) of the one or more bodies. Measurements of a BPCD using a differential quadrature demodulator have shown that capacitance changes as small as one femtofarad are detectable.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0112">A detector to measure the amplitude of the electric field is any type of detector that either directly measures an amplitude of a signal, that measures the relative amplitude of a signal as compared to a reference (such as the nominal amplitude), and/or that indirectly measures the amplitude such as by measuring the gain applied by an automatic gain control circuit that maintains the measured amplitude of the electric field at or near (e.g., within a few percent of, or within a determined range of) a determined amplitude (e.g., at or near the nominal amplitude). In a first example, an analog-to-digital converter is usable to directly measure the amplitude of the electric field. In a second example, the electric field is first evaluated, such as with a sample-and-hold circuit or with a peak detector circuit, and the evaluated result is then processed by an analog-to-digital converter. The series of values produced by the analog-to-digital converter is then further processable, such as by a digital signal processor. In various embodiments, the analog-to-digital converter is an 8-bit, 12-bit, a 16-bit, a 20-bit, a 24-bit analog-to-digital converter, or any other suitable analog-to-digital converter. In a third example, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a switch (such as amplitude comparison switch <b>110</b>) selects (e.g., under control of a signal processor, such as signal processor <b>116</b>) between either the output of the electric field generator (e.g., electric field generator <b>104</b>) as it couples to one or more bodies in the electric field and an amplitude reference (e.g., the nominal amplitude and/or another amplitude reference source such as amplitude reference source <b>106</b>). The output of the switch is an input to the signal processor where an analog-to-digital converter in the signal processor is able to convert the electric field and amplitude reference signals to values for comparison. In a variation of the third example, the switch is time-based in that the signal processor, by measuring the amplitude of the electric field at a particular time (e.g., upon installation of the BPCD and/or during a quiescent period when there are no observed variations in the measurements of the electric field such as when a body is not present in the electric field), the signal processor is configured to record the amplitude measurement at the particular time as the amplitude reference. Further in the variation of the third example, in some embodiments, the signal processor is configured to periodically update the recorded amplitude reference (such as during quiescent periods when there are no observed variations in the measurements of the electric field) so as to account for any environmental changes that might affect the amplitude reference. In various embodiments, when a body is present in the electric field, the measured amplitude will be less than the amplitude reference. In some embodiments, signal processor 116 processes a difference between the measured amplitude and the amplitude reference to determine various characteristics associated with the body, such as the presence or lack of presence of the body in the electric field, a weight of the body, a weight change of the body compared to a previous weight, etc.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0113">In a combined approach, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a detector to measure the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric field comprises a sample-and-hold circuit operating at a sampling rate, followed by an analog-to-digital converter (such as a 16-bit or a 24-bit analog-to-digital converter). A series of values at the sampling rate is produced, such as 5000 values per second. (While the nominal frequency is much higher than the sampling rate, the sampling rate need only be sufficiently fast to accurately capture changes in the nominal frequency due to coupling with a body in the electric field one or more of whose parameters are being computed.) The series of values is processed by a digital signal processor which is programmed to compute the (relative) frequency (e.g., using frequency domain analysis) and/or the amplitude (e.g., using peak detection) of the electric field.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0114">The techniques described herein and in the U.S. Pat. No. 10,080,507 patent (which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes) provides detectors to measure the frequency and/or the amplitude. Such techniques are usable with and/or combinable with the techniques described herein.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Computation Unit</heading><p id="p-0093" num="0115">In some embodiments, a computation unit (e.g., a processor, such as a digital signal processor) computes (e.g., using signal processing techniques) from the detector measurements of the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric field one or more parameters of the body (such as physiological parameters of a human body). For example, in some embodiments, the computation unit uses the output of one or more analog-to-digital converters producing a series of values corresponding to the measured amplitude of the electric field and/or a series of values corresponding to the measured frequency of the electric field to compute the one or more parameters of the body.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0116">In some embodiments, the computation unit searches for periodicities (periodic behavior) in the detector measurements of the frequency and/or the amplitude that correspond to movements of the body and/or of internal portions of the body (e.g., organs of a human body). For example (though it is not nearly this simple, as explained below), movement of the lungs of a human body is observed as a relatively large frequency change with a periodicity of between 5 and 100 times per minute, and movement of the heart is observed as a relatively smaller frequency change with a periodicity of between 20 and 200 times per minute. The term periodicities (periodic behavior) as used herein includes quasiperiodicities (quasiperiodic behavior), i.e., patterns of behavior that are completely deterministic as well as those that have some degree of unpredictability. Physiological parameters, such as respiration rate and/or heart rate, may exhibit periodic behavior, but more typically exhibit quasiperiodic behavior.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0117">In some embodiments, determining the periodicities uses time domain techniques (e.g., autocorrelation and peak-picking), frequency domain techniques (e.g., Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or other transforms, and cepstral methods), and/or other techniques for determining periodicities in data (e.g., cosinor analysis). In various embodiments, any technique to determine periodicities is applicable.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0118">According to various embodiments, the computation unit computes a particular one of the one or more parameters of the body as one or more of: a rate corresponding to a frequency of the corresponding periodic behavior; any statistical function, such as a minimum, a maximum, an average, an average over a certain interval, and/or a standard deviation, of the rate; data indicating time intervals and/or durations during which the rate was computed; data indicating time intervals and/or durations during which the rate was not computed; a series of data indicative of the corresponding periodic behavior over time (e.g., that could be used to graph the corresponding periodic behavior and/or functions thereof); and any combination of the foregoing.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0119">In some embodiments, the computation unit computes a particular one of the one or more parameters of the body as a time-average over a specified interval. That is, an average rate is determined by counting occurrences of a respective periodic behavior (corresponding to the particular parameter) during the specified interval. In further embodiments, the time-average is a rolling average. For example, in various embodiments and/or usage scenarios, a resting heart rate is computed using a five-minute rolling average. In further embodiments where more than one parameter of the body is being computed, each of the parameters of the body is computed as a time-average using a respective specified interval. In various embodiments and/or usage scenarios, such as for calibration and/or to generate data for an approval process, the respective specified interval is selected to match an averaging interval used by a reference (e.g., a reference device or a trained observer) so that computed statistics are more comparable to those produced by the reference.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0120">In some embodiments, the computation unit computes a particular one of the one or more parameters of the body as a computation of a &#x201c;mass&#x201d; of the body (e.g., a relative measure of volume and/or weight, not necessarily a weight in, for example, pounds) and/or a change of mass of the body using, for example, the measured amplitude and/or changes in the measured amplitude of the electric field. In further embodiments, the computation of the mass comprises a computation of a body mass index (BMI) and/or a relative (e.g., a change) in BMI. In further embodiments, the computation of a change in mass (and/or BMI) is measured over a duration of two or more days using nighttime resting computations of the (relative) body mass and/or predetermined (e.g., set during initialization) calibration values.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0121">In some embodiments where more than one parameter of the body is being computed, the computation unit computes each of the parameters of the body separately. In other embodiments, a first one of the parameters, such as a dominant one of the parameters, is computed first, and knowledge of the first parameter is used to compute one or more subsequent parameters, thereby enabling a more accurate computation of the one or more subsequent parameters.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0122">In various embodiments, the computation unit is able to distinguish a type and/or a state of a body in the electrical field based on changes in the measured frequency and/or the measured amplitude. In a first example, a human or an animal body has a larger dissipative factor than a more structurally rigid and/or metallic object such as a suitcase. Both a suitcase and a human body may cause a similar overall change in the measured frequency, but the human body will cause a greater change in the measured amplitude due to the higher dissipative factor. Accordingly, a type of a body entering and/or present in the electric field is determinable. In a second example, lack of detection of periodic behavior in the measured frequency despite presence of a body with a relatively larger dissipative factor is indicative of an organic but non-living body, such as a cadaver. In a third example, cessation of detection of periodic behavior in the measured frequency while the body is still determined as being in the electric field is evidence of a severe medical problem (e.g., cardiac arrest).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0123">In some embodiments, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the computation unit stores and/or communicates (such as over a network) the computed one or more parameters of the body.

The network communication device optionally and/or selectively communicates the one or more parameters of the body in any manner, such as by communicating a single measurement, communicating a collection of measurements, communicating a pre-processed (e.g., statistically reduced) version of one or more measurements, communicating any of the preceding periodically, communicating any of the preceding at any other interval (e.g., an interval that is not periodic), and/or communicating any of the preceding in response to a request (e.g., a request received from the network). The server or other device maintains, such as in a database, the computed one or more parameters of the body over an extended period of time (e.g., days, weeks, months, or years) to enable observation of trends in changes of the one or more parameters. Further, the server or other device maintains such data for a plurality of bodies, e.g., for a number of patients in a patient population being monitored.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0124">In various embodiments, the computation unit comprises one or more processors (such as embedded processors, microprocessors, multi-core processors, signal processors, digital signal processors, graphics processors, field-programmable gate arrays, application-specific integrated circuits, etc.).

In a second example, the computation unit comprises two or more processors to divide work, such as a first one of the two or more processors to serve one or more detectors (e.g., to process measurements from an analog front-end), and a second one of the two or more processors to provide higher-level functions such as communication with a network. In a third example, a first portion of the computation unit comprising one or more processors is co-located with an analog front-end (to process measurements from the analog front-end such as to determine periodic and/or non-periodic behaviors in the measured frequency and/or amplitude) and communicates the measurements (or a pre-processed version thereof) over a network with a second portion of the computation unit comprising one or more processors that performs higher-level computations on the measurements (or the pre-processed version thereof), such as computations to determine a rate of movement of internal components, a physiological parameter, etc. Continuing the third example, in some embodiments the second portion of the computation unit is physically and/or logically close to the first portion of the computation unit (e.g., in a same building and/or on a same local-area network), while in other embodiments, the second portion of the computation unit is remote from the first portion of the computation unit (e.g. connected over the internet, such as when a cloud server comprises the second portion of the computation unit).</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Tuner</heading><p id="p-0103" num="0125">In some embodiments, such as illustrated and described with respect to tuner <b>820</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> and/or tuning circuitry <b>1120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, a tuner is used to adjust the nominal frequency of the electric field generator so that, for example, a center of the observed frequency measured by the detector stays at or near (e.g., within a few percent of) the nominal frequency. For example, a stationary human body lying on its back has a different effect on the electric field than a stationary human body lying on its side. In various embodiments, maintaining the center of the observed frequency measured by the detector at or near the nominal frequency enables circuitry measuring the frequency (and/or a change in the frequency) of the electric field to be operated in a region where its response is more predictable and/or more precise (e.g., more linear).

For example, instead of tuning the electric field to change the center of the observed frequency, voltage input to an analog-to-digital converter is level-shifted in a compensatory way, or the computation unit is able to adjust its interpretation of the detector measurement of the frequency (e.g., by dynamically determining a center point of frequency changes).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0128">In some embodiments, a tuner is used to adjust the nominal frequency of the electric field generator so that, for example, a computation of a parameter of a body (e.g., a rate of movement of an organ of a human body) achieves a higher accuracy by improving the quality measure (e.g., the signal-to-noise ratio) of the periodic behavior in the measured frequency and/or measured amplitude. For example, depending on a particular characteristic of the body (e.g., the body mass index of a human body), or a particular (dynamic) position of the body (e.g., a human body that has rolled over from its back to its side), adjusting the nominal frequency of the electric field generator is able to produce measurements of the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric field with a higher quality measure for the effects of the parameter of the body. In various embodiments, the quality measure for the effects of the parameter of the body is determined by a manner in which the parameter of the body causes a change in the frequency of the electric field. For example, in some embodiments, the quality measure is relative to an amount of the change in the frequency of the electric field due to the effects of the parameter of the body. Continuing the example, in further embodiments, tuning of the nominal frequency to achieve a greater degree of change in the measured frequency due to the effects of the parameter of the body improves the quality measure.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0129">In various embodiments, the nominal frequency of the electric field generator is adjusted periodically to determine if a different (e.g., a higher and/or a lower) frequency produces a more reliable computation of the parameter of the body. For example, using &#x201c;servo&#x201d; techniques, the frequency is adjusted every one minute (or every five minutes, or any other suitable period) to &#x201c;servo&#x201d; in on a more optimal frequency. If the frequency is lowered (raised) and the quality measure (e.g., the signal-to-noise ratio) improves, the frequency is lowered (raised) further. Conversely if the frequency is lowered (raised) and the quality measure worsens, the frequency is raised (lowered). In further embodiments, an amount of the raising and/or lowering is proportional to the quality measure. For example, a higher quality measure would use smaller amounts of raising and/or lowering than a lower quality measure.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0130">In some embodiments, one or more other signal quality measures are used instead of and/or in addition to the signal-to-noise ratio to control and/or to optimize the adjusting of the nominal frequency so as to improve the one or more other signal quality measures (and/or the signal-to-noise ratio). In a first example, internal autocorrelation ratios (e.g., from an autocorrelator determining periodic behavior in the measured frequency) are used to control and/or to optimize the adjusting of the nominal frequency. In a second example, internal data of any other technique used to determine periodic behavior and/or evaluate signal quality is usable in a similar fashion, for example frequency content, spectral purity, and/or change or lack of change in measured amplitude over a time interval.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0131">In some embodiments, the computation unit uses the measurement of the frequency of the electric field to control the tuner (and adjust the frequency of the electric field).

In yet further embodiments, the computation unit is enabled to adjust the nominal frequency by setting the one or more digital control bits. In some embodiments, the digital control bits control a variable device (e.g., a variable resistor, a variable capacitor, or a variable inductor) that is part of the electric field generator.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0133">In some embodiments, a time constant of adjustments to the nominal frequency of the electric field generator is selected to be long compared to changes in the frequency of the electric field due to the effects of the parameter of the body. For example, when measuring changes in physiological parameters of the human body, the time constant of adjustments is tens of seconds (e.g., 25 seconds). In further embodiments, the time constant is determined, at least in part, by a time period over which the physiological parameters are averaged.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0134">In various embodiments a time constant of adjustments to the nominal frequency of the electric field generator varies dynamically. For example, during an acquisition phase (such as when initially powered on), the nominal frequency is configured to be changed rapidly, as compared to a tracking phase where the nominal frequency is configured to be changed more slowly while the physiological parameters are being computed.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Automatic Gain Control</heading><p id="p-0113" num="0135">In some embodiments, a measured amplitude of the electric field corresponds to proximity (e.g., a distance) of a body interacting with the electric field to the antenna radiating the electric field. The dissipative component of the interaction increases with decreasing distance. If the body is too close, the electric field is potentially dampened to the point where oscillation stops. If the body is too far, the interactions are weaker (e.g., independent of frequency, the quality measure is decreased due to distance). In some embodiments, the amplitude of the electric field is adjusted in response to a quality measure (e.g., a signal to noise ratio) being above a determined or specified upper value, such as where the signal to noise ratio is sufficiently high and reducing the nominal amplitude would not result in an insufficient quality measure. In various embodiments, the amplitude of the electric field is adjusted in response to the quality measure of a determined periodic behavior being below a determined or specified limit, resulting in an insufficient quality measure. For example, an automatic gain control (AGC) circuit is used to adjust (e.g., continuously) the amplitude of the electric field, such as to maintain the measured amplitude of the electric field at or near (e.g., within a few percent of, or within a determined range of) a determined amplitude (e.g., at or near the nominal amplitude). In various embodiments, adjusting the amplitude of the electric field compensates for changes in dissipative loading effects of the body, such as from body movement and/or body orientation change with respect to an antenna radiating the electric field. In further embodiments, the AGC circuit is part of a tuner that optionally and/or selectively is also able to adjust the frequency of the electric field. In a first example, if the measured amplitude of the electric field is decreased too much (indicating the body is too close) such that the measured amplitude of the electric field is below a determined lower threshold, the AGC increases the nominal amplitude. In a second example if the measured amplitude of the electric field shows too small a decrease (indicating the body is too far, is moving away from the antenna radiating the electric field, is in the process of leaving the reactive near-field region of the electric field, or has left the reactive near-field region of the electric field) such that the measured amplitude of the electric field is above a determined upper threshold, the nominal amplitude is reset to a default value (used when there is no body within sufficient proximity to the antenna of the BPCD).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0136">In some embodiments, an amplitude adjustment is performed to improve a subsequent measurement of the frequency of the electric field. For example, an electric field is generated at a nominal amplitude using an electric field generator. The electric field is radiated through an antenna, and an amplitude of the electric field is measured as it interacts with a body in the near-field region of the electric field, in accordance with techniques disclosed herein. The nominal amplitude is adjusted according to the measured amplitude (e.g., by increasing or decreasing the amplitude to as described herein), and a modified electric field is subsequently generated using the electric field generator at a nominal frequency and the adjusted nominal amplitude. The modified electric field generated at the adjusted nominal amplitude is radiated through the antenna, and measurements are performed in accordance with the disclosed techniques (e.g., to determine one or more periodic behaviors in the measured frequency and/or to compute a respective rate of movement of an internal component of a body).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0137">In some embodiments, measurement of the amplitude of the electric field is used, at least in part, to determine and/or adjust the nominal frequency of the electric field. In various embodiments, such adjustments of the nominal frequency are used to improve a subsequent determination of a periodic behavior based on the adjusted nominal frequency and corresponding to a movement of a component of the body following the adjustment. For example, in usage scenarios where different components of the body affect the interaction of the body with the electric field differently according to distance of the body from the antenna, changing the nominal frequency in response to the distance from the antenna (as determined by measurement of the amplitude of the electric field) improves the quality measure for a parameter of the body that is being computed.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0138">In some embodiments, the computation unit uses the measurement of the amplitude of the electric field to control the electric field generator (and adjust the amplitude of the electric field). In various embodiments, analog circuitry is used to adjust the amplitude of the electric field. In other embodiments, other types of circuitry are used to adjust the amplitude of the electric field, such as digital circuitry, or circuitry with both analog and digital components.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0139">In some embodiments, the nominal amplitude of the electric field is 1.0</p><p id="p-0118" num="0140">Volts RMS, and the AGC circuit is configured to adjust the measured amplitude of the electric field from 0.5 Volts to 2.75 Volts RMS. In various embodiments, the AGC circuit is configured to adjust the nominal amplitude in response to the measured amplitude being outside of a determined range, such that the measured amplitude is maintained within a specified range (e.g., within 0.75 to 1.5 Volts RMS). In further embodiments, the AGC circuit is configured to not increase the amplitude of the electric field beyond a determined value, even if the measured amplitude is not within the specified range, if the power emitted by the electric field (e.g., a total radiated power level) exceeds a specified power limit (e.g., a determined power level).</p><p id="p-0119" num="0141">According to various embodiments, &#x201c;load detection&#x201d; (i.e., determining an absolute and/or relative amount of dissipative matter, such as a body, subject to the electric field) uses one or more of: a measurement of the amplitude of the electric field; a comparison of a measurement of the amplitude of the electric field vs. the nominal amplitude of the electric field; a measurement of an AGC control signal used to regulate the nominal amplitude of the electric field; and any combination of the foregoing. In various embodiments, load detection is able to distinguish between a human body and an object such as a suitcase. In further embodiments, lack of variation in load detection for an extended period of time is indicative of a comatose or deceased human body.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0142">In some embodiments, a time constant of adjustments to the amplitude of the electric field is selected to be longer compared to changes in the measured amplitude of the electric field due to the effects of the body interacting with the electric field (e.g., the time constant is longer than an expected duration of one or more non-periodic behaviors in the measured amplitude corresponding to movement of the body, such as rolling over in bed). For example, when measuring changes in physiological parameters of the human body, the time constant of adjustments is tens of seconds (e.g., 25 seconds). In another example, the time constant is at least ten times longer than an expected duration of non-periodic behaviors in the measured amplitude corresponding to movement of the body. In further embodiments, the time constant is determined, at least in part, by a time period over which the physiological parameters are averaged.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="2">Differential Circuitry</heading><p id="p-0121" num="0143">In some embodiments, at least a portion of the circuitry in a BPCD (e.g., the electric field generator, the antenna, and/or the detector) comprises differential circuitry. Using differential circuitry in the electric field generator, the antenna, and/or the detector for the frequency measurement advantageously improves the quality measure (e.g., the signal-to-noise ratio) of the effects of the parameters of the body on the frequency of the electric field. That is, in some implementations, a BPCD with differential circuitry achieves significant rejection of common mode electrical fields in the environment (e.g., 60 Hz power noise and/or loading interference from other bodies passing by the BPCD), and is thus more sensitive to small changes in the electric field due to the effects of a body in the electric field, such as due to movement of internal organs of a human body interacting with the electric field. In a first example, a two-wire antenna is driven by a differential oscillator (as part of or all of a differential electric field generator), and a detector measuring the frequency of the electric field uses a differential frequency demodulator to obtain a higher quality measure for the effects of the parameters of the body on the frequency of the electric field. In a second example, the detector measuring the frequency of the electric field uses a differential sample-and-hold circuit followed by an analog-to-digital converter with a differential input. Laboratory results demonstrate that a particular differential circuit implementation achieved a 50 dB higher signal-to-noise ratio than a similar single-ended implementation.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates an example of selected details of an embodiment of a portion of a system for detecting and analyzing changes in a body according to certain embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a differential analog front-end that is usable as part of a BPCD, and includes a differential antenna <b>1102</b>, a differential electric field generator <b>1104</b> (e.g., a differential oscillator such as a differential tank oscillator, a voltage-controlled differential oscillator, or a differential resonator), a differential detector <b>1108</b> (e.g., a differential quadrature demodulator and a differential low-pass filter, or a wideband analog-to-digital converter with differential input), and optional tuning circuitry <b>1120</b> (e.g., analog tuning circuitry receiving feedback from differential detector <b>1108</b> and/or digital tuning circuitry, such as a digital-to-analog converter receiving an input <b>1130</b> from a signal processor).</p><p id="p-0123" num="0145">In some embodiments, the differential oscillator oscillates at a nominal frequency.

For example, the optional tuning circuitry outputs a voltage level used to control a voltage-controlled differential oscillator. In some embodiments, the optional tuning circuitry is an analog auto-tuning circuit. In other embodiments, the optional tuning circuitry is a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and a signal processor provides a digital input to the DAC to tune the nominal frequency generated by the differential electric field generator. That is, software executing on the signal processor determines whether, when, and how much to adjust the nominal frequency and/or the nominal amplitude.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0147">In some embodiments, the output <b>1140</b> from the differential analog front-end is a waveform representing changes in the frequency of the electric field, and is processed with a differential analog-to-digital converter and then with a digital signal processor.

In other embodiments where differential detector <b>1108</b> is a wideband analog-to-digital converter, the output from the differential analog front-end is a sequence of values representing the waveform of the electric field.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="2">Blanking</heading><p id="p-0126" num="0148">In some embodiments and/or usage scenarios, the computation of a parameter of a body by the computation unit uses techniques to identify a portion of the measurements of the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric field (generated by an electric field generator) that has an inadequate quality measure (such as an inadequate signal-to-noise ratio) and/or corresponds to one or more non-periodic behaviors, and then prevent that portion of the measurements from being used in the computation of the parameter of the body (i.e., to &#x201c;blank&#x201d; out that portion of the measurements obtained during a measuring period comprising a succession of time points). For example, when determining one or more periodic behaviors, the computation unit determines the one or more periodic behaviors based on one or more time points from multiple time points during a measuring period that do not include one or more other time points corresponding to one or more non-periodic behaviors. In various embodiments, one or more quality measures (such as internal autocorrelation ratios or other internal data of techniques for determining periodic behavior, frequency content, spectral purity, change and/or lack of change in measured amplitude over a time interval, etc.) are used instead of and/or in addition to the signal-to-noise ratio. For example, in a case where the body is a human body, a portion of the measurements of the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric field that does not correspond to an expected nighttime resting behavior of the human body (e.g., a relatively stationary body) is not used in computing rates of movement corresponding to periodic behaviors such as nighttime resting rates of movement of internal organs of the human body. In one example, when computing a nighttime resting heart rate, the computation unit identifies one or more portions of the measured frequency that are not indicative of a movement of one or more organs (e.g., the heart) and/or exhibit a frequency change greater than a threshold. In various examples, when such portions are identified, the computation unit does not use the identified portions of the measured frequency in computing the nighttime resting heart rate.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0149">In various embodiments, the portion of the measurements of the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric field that have an inadequate quality measure is used for other purposes, such as to tune the nominal frequency of the electric field generator, to adjust the nominal amplitude of the electric field generator, and/or to identify a period of excessive nighttime movement (such as for analysis of sleep stages). In various embodiments, the body leaving the reactive near-field region of the electric field is determined, such as by the quality measure dropping suddenly and/or by the amplitude increasing suddenly (or otherwise increasing beyond a determined threshold), and the portion of the measurements of the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric field that correspond to a lack of (significant) presence of the body is blanked. In one example, such body presence detection is used to determine when a patient has left a bed.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0150">In a first example, if the measurement of the amplitude of the electric field is below a lower threshold (the measured amplitude is too small indicating too much coupling to and suppression of the oscillations of the electric field generator) and/or if the measurement of the amplitude of the electric field is above an upper threshold (the measured amplitude is too large indicating insufficient coupling of the body to the electric field generator), the corresponding measurements of the frequency and/or of the amplitude are blanked. In a second example, if the measurement of the frequency of the electric field does not exhibit an expected magnitude of change (e.g., an expected magnitude of change representative of movement of the lungs), and/or if the measurement of the frequency of the electric field exhibits too great a magnitude of change (possibly indicative of movement of the body as a whole vs. movement of an organ of the body), the corresponding measurements of the frequency and/or of the amplitude are blanked. In a third example, if an expected periodic behavior indicative of the effect of an organ of the body on the electric field is not found, the corresponding measurements of the frequency and/or of the amplitude are blanked. Continuing the third example, if the expected periodic behavior is not found, one or more remedial measures are optionally and/or selectively taken, such as adjusting the frequency and/or the amplitude of the generated electric field to improve a quality measure, running diagnostics, and/or logging an event corresponding to a period of missing data. In a fourth example, a second body (e.g., a suitcase or a knapsack) or a pet (e.g., a Chihuahua or a Dobermann) lands on a bed where the interactions of a sleeping human body with an electric field are being measured. The addition of the second body affects the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric field. At least a portion of the measurements where the second body sufficiently adversely affects the quality measure of the measurements of the frequency and/or the amplitude are blanked. After the initial change in the frequency and/or the amplitude of the electric field due to the addition of the second body, if the measurements of the frequency and/or the amplitude again have a sufficient quality measure, the blanking ceases, even though the second body may still be affecting the electric field. E.g., a pet joining its owner in bed is nominally only a transient disturbance, even if the pet remains on the bed.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="2">Dual Sleeper</heading><p id="p-0129" num="0151">One use case of note is computing one or more physiological parameters of a patient on a bed with a partner (e.g., a spouse).

To determine respiration rate and/or heart rate, the observed frequency changes are the result of the movement of not just the organs (the lungs and/or the heart) themselves, but of the rest of the body in response to the movement of those organs, as well as any background &#x201c;noise&#x201d; (e.g., due to borborygmus).</p><p id="p-0142" num="0164">With the respiration rate as a first example, two of the major contributors to the observed frequency changes due to respiration are movement of the lung tissue itself (expanding when inhaling, contracting when exhaling) and movement of the chest (also expanding and contracting, roughly in phase with the lung tissue. There are other factors, too, such as movement of the diaphragm (powering the lung movement), and movement of other organs in the body in response to the chest cavity movement. How much each of these contributes to the &#x201c;signal&#x201d; (the change in observed frequency) produced by respiration is a combination of multiple factors:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0165">The nominal frequency of the electric field and how deeply the signal is able to penetrate into the body. Very high (GHz) frequencies generally only penetrate &#x201c;skin deep&#x201d;, while lower frequencies (20 MHz) may penetrate multiple centimeters.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0166">The permittivity and/or dissipation factor of each of the organs, other tissues, and liquids affected by respiration. Each of the organs, other tissues, and liquids has a different permittivity, and these permittivities are frequency-dependent to different degrees. Further, some effects due to a single organ may increase permittivity, and other effects due to the same organ may decrease permittivity.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0167">The relative time(s) at which the effects occur.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0168">The type, design and location of one or more antennas used to radiate the electric field.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0143" num="0169">In the case of the respiration rate, expansion of the lungs when inhaling decreases permittivity of the lungs themselves, but the expansion of the chest cavity and the skin has an opposite effect and increases effective permittivity (e.g., due to increasing contact with and/or closeness to the antenna). (For example, due to inhaling, a larger portion of the body becomes closer to the antenna.) Since some of the multiple effects change permittivity in opposing directions, the observed changes in the measured frequency of the electric field due to movement of the lungs may vary widely depending on body position or other factors. For example, effects of the chest cavity movement may dominate when the human body is prone or supine in relation to the antenna vs. when the human body is on its side.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0170">Because the responses of the various organs, other tissues, and liquids change with frequency, in some embodiments, the nominal frequency of the electric field generator is changed dynamically to find a frequency at which the observed signal (i.e., the observed changes in the detector measurement of the frequency of the electric field) from one or more organs is most readily captured (i.e., a frequency having a better signal-to-noise ratio).</p><p id="p-0145" num="0171">As a second example, computation of the heart rate is affected by the same factors as the computation of the respiration rate, and is further complicated by being a comparatively much weaker signal. That is, when observing the &#x201c;whole body&#x201d; (or a substantial portion of the body, such as the torso) interacting with the electric field, the observed signal from the lungs is more than an order of magnitude larger than the observed signal from the heart. The observed signal from the heart is created from multiple sources, including: the heart muscle itself, the pulse wave in the blood vessels from a heartbeat, the expansion (and subsequent contraction) of the arteries due to the heartbeat, movement of the chest cavity and skin due to the heartbeat, etc. Further, many of these sources are phase shifted by a significant amount, e.g., due to the rate at which the pulse wave propagates through the arteries.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0172">In a variation of these examples, some of the factors affecting computation of the respiration rate and/or of the heart rate are mitigated by positioning the antenna adjacent to a different part of the human body and/or by using two differently-positioned antennas and switching between them based on a determined position of the human body (e.g., by selecting one of the antennas with a higher quality measure). An antenna positioned for a human body lying down on a bed may be less effective when the human body is sitting up in the bed as compared to an antenna optimized for a sitting position, such as by being positioned to measure the effects of the femoral artery on the electric field. In some embodiments and/or usage scenarios, such as measuring driver alertness, an antenna in a seat-back would be responsive to upper-body movement (e.g., steering), potentially creating excessive periods of blanking, whereas an antenna in a seat-bottom and optimized for a sitting position experiences less of the effects of the upper-body movement. In various embodiments and/or usage scenarios, two or more antennas are used in particular environments, such as hospital beds, where a position of the human body may be changed. For example, a hospital bed has a first antenna optimized for situations where the human body is lying down in the hospital bed, and a second antenna optimized for situations where the human body is sitting up in the hospital bed (such as when a head of the hospital bed is raised). Continuing the example, an antenna positioned to be near the buttocks of a human body in a sitting position is able to be sensitive to both heart rate and respiration rate via blood flow near the skin for heart rate, and via expansion and/or movement of the buttocks in response to respiration.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0173">The computation unit is able to determine the respiration rate and/or the heart rate by determining periodic behavior with certain characteristics in the detector measurement of the frequency of the electric field. For example, the respiration rate has periodicities in an expected range, and (if the effects of the respiration rate on the electric field have a sufficient quality measure) an expected range of magnitudes in changes in the detector measurement of the frequency of the electric field. Similarly, the heart rate has periodicities in a different (overlapping) expected range and a second expected range of magnitudes in changes in the detector measurement of the frequency of the electric field.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0174">In some embodiments, the computation unit computes, in addition to and/or instead of a rate, a corresponding waveform. In a first example, the computation unit produces data providing the shape of the respiratory waveform (e.g., indicating how sharp or shallow breathing is, or indicating missed breaths). In a second example, the computation unit produces data providing the shape of the heartbeat (e.g., showing the systolic and diastolic regions, similar to a Wiggers diagram).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0175">In some embodiments, results of the computation of one or more physiological parameters of one or more human bodies are tracked over a period of time, such as over a period of minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and/or years, such as to detect trends indicating changes in health. In various embodiments, results of the computation unit (e.g., resting respiration rate and/or waveforms, resting heart rate and/or waveforms, etc.), are communicated to and stored on a remotely-located device such as a server. Software running on the server is able to analyze the results and determine trends and/or present the results in various ways for human consideration. In a first example, a change in the nighttime resting heart rate of a particular one of the human bodies over a period of days may be indicative of the onset of a COPD exacerbation. In a second example, a change in body mass, particularly in the limbs, of a particular one of the human bodies over a period of days may be indicative of edema. In a third example, a change in a number of times a patient gets out of bed at night is evidence of a urological problem, such as a urinary tract infection. In a fourth example, a relative amount of blood flow to a specific part of the body is computed (e.g., by determining a magnitude of a pulse wave), and a change in the relative amount of blood flow over time is determined. The change in the relative amount of blood flow is, for example, indicative of healing processes (restoring proper blood flow), or certain disease complications (that restrict blood flow to extremities). In a fifth example, computation of nighttime heart rate, nighttime respiration rate, and/or nighttime movement is used to determine sleep stages. Body movement and/or changes in body movement have been correlated to sleep stages and/or changes in sleep stages.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0000">Remote Patient Monitoring with High Compliance</p><p id="p-0151" num="0176">An example application of a BPCD enables Remote Patient Monitoring</p><p id="p-0152" num="0177">(RPM) with high (patient) compliance. Achieving high compliance in daily (e.g., nighttime, every night) monitoring is important for various applications, such as monitoring the pulse and/or respiration rates of patients suffering from chronic diseases, such as COPD or CHF. It is also important for less severe diseases where remote monitoring is used and where high (e.g., at least <b>16</b> days per month) compliance is a requirement for various medical reimbursement codes.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0178">In some embodiments, an external sensor (e.g., an antenna in a flexible housing) of a BPCD is attached to and/or is part of a piece of furniture, such as a bed. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref> (described further below), the external sensor is in the form of a sensor strap configured to be secured to an object (e.g., a mattress, cushion, chair, conveyance, or other type of furniture). In various embodiments, the BPCD is powered from a wall socket (optionally with a battery and/or other power back-up in the event of a power outage). Because of the non-contact nature of the BPCD (where body parameters are computed through measurements of interactions of a body with an electric field generated by the BPCD), obtaining a patient's body parameters is possible without the patient deviating from his or her ordinary behaviors once the BPCD is placed in an appropriate location and connected to a power source. In contrast, other devices (e.g., wearables) have compliance issues such as requiring the patient to attach (e.g., wear) the device, and to keep the device charged. Even a weight scale requires patient interaction (e.g., standing on the scale to take a measurement) as compared to the BPCD where the only patient requirement is, for example, something done regardless (e.g., sleeping in bed). In this regard, in some embodiments and/or usage scenarios, the BPCD is said to be passive (in that, once installed, it requires no direct patient or clinician activity such as positioning, charging and/or wearing a device) and non-invasive (in that it requires minimal or no changes to the patient's lifestyle).</p><p id="p-0154" num="0179">In various embodiments, the external sensor of the BPCD is attached (as a one-time operation) to a piece of furniture (e.g., a bed) where the patient spends time (e.g., sleeping), and the BPCD is connected to a power source (e.g., a wall socket). Thereafter, when the patient uses the piece of furniture (e.g., rests or sleeps in the bed), the BPCD is configured to compute one or more body parameters of the patient without any further required actions by the patient. In general terms, the BPCD is able to perform monitoring of a patient in a manner that is non-intrusive to the patient's lifestyle.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0180">In an example of overnight monitoring, such as for monitoring nighttime resting pulse and/or respiration rates, patient compliance is achieved when the patient sleeps in a bed where the external sensor (antenna) of the BPCD is installed and operational. In some embodiments, depending on the type and/or positioning of one or more antennas of the BPCD, the patient may need to sleep on a particular side of a large (e.g., queen-size of king-size) bed for compliance. In other embodiments, a use of multiple antennas enables the BPCD to enable patient compliance with fewer or no restrictions on patient positioning within the bed.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="2">Example Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0156" num="0181">What follows is a collection of example embodiments, including at least some explicitly enumerated as &#x2018;ECs&#x2019; (Example Combinations), providing additional description of a variety of embodiment types in accordance with the concepts described in the present disclosure; these examples are not meant to be mutually exclusive, exhaustive, or restrictive; and the present disclosure is not limited to these example embodiments but rather encompasses numerous possible modifications and variations within the scope of the issued claims and their equivalents.

level="1">FURTHER EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0548" num="0573">What follows are further examples of a system comprising a BPCD. Such examples relate generally to the technical field of monitoring systems, and more particularly, to a monitoring system that detects physical changes without physical contact.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="2">Additional Background</heading><p id="p-0549" num="0574">The performance of a variety of monitoring systems may be affected by where a sensor or its parts are placed relative to a target (e.g., a human such as an adult, teen, child, or baby) that is being monitored. For example, certain monitoring systems may require a sensor to be in physical contact with a target and may further require a part (e.g., a power or data cable) to be connected from a sensor to a monitoring device. There may be other circumstances in which the sensor might be used to detect changes in occupancy of a vehicle seat. In this case the sensor might also sense vital signs&#x2014;e.g., pulse and/or respiration&#x2014;of a seat occupant without direct physical contact.</p><p id="p-0550" num="0575">Known monitoring systems require a sensor to be directly in contact with a target. For example, a traditional electrocardiogram (ECG) uses external electrodes to detect a patient's ECG signal. The external electrodes are located on the ends of cables and must be physically placed on a patient and near the patient's heart. This often necessitates the use of conductive materials that may be inconvenient to hook up and use, especially for long-term monitoring of a relatively active patient. These devices have significant limitations. For example, the patient must be physically connected to the device. If the patient wants to leave his or her bed, the device needs to be detached from, and then re-attached to the patient on his/her return, often by a highly trained staff member. The inconvenience and the delays associated with setting up such monitoring systems are also not well-suited for monitoring more active targets, for example, a baby in a crib or a person driving a vehicle. Although there are monitoring systems incorporated into devices such as wristbands and armbands they still typically need to be directly in contact with the target, and often provide inaccurate information and limited functionality.</p><p id="p-0551" num="0576">Accordingly, there is a need for a monitoring system that does not require a sensor to be directly in contact with a target. There is also a need for a monitoring system that can assist in the management of a target's health, fitness, sleep and diet by monitoring physiological changes in a person's body. There is further a need for a monitoring system suitable for long-term use that can sense changes in a target and provide timely and appropriate diagnostic, prognostic and prescriptive information.</p><heading id="h-0027" level="1">SUMMARY OF FURTHER EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0552" num="0577">Embodiments include systems and methods that allow detection of physical changes within a body without physical contact with, or attachment to, the body. A body is a mass of matter distinct from other masses. Non-limiting examples of a body include, for example, a human's body, an animal's body, a container, a car, a house, etc. These changes might be physiological events such as cardiac function in an animal or changes in the properties of a bulk material such as grain in a silo. These changes could be dimensional changes such as those caused by the function of organs in an animal, or changes in the composition of the material such as water content in lumber.</p><p id="p-0553" num="0578">A key feature of the measurement technique used in this instrument is that the measurement may be done over an extended volume such that the changes of multiple phenomena may be observed simultaneously. For example, sensing two separate but related physiological parameters (e.g., pulse and respiration) may be accomplished concurrently. The region sensed by this instrument may be changed by sensor element design within the instrument. A further extension of bulk sensing capability is the opportunity to use sophisticated computer signature recognition software, such as wavelet-based approaches, to separate individual features from the composite waveform.</p><p id="p-0554" num="0579">This application relates to U.S. Pat.

Energy storage occurs in both electric and magnetic fields created by the current.</p><p id="p-0565" num="0590">Dissipation occurs in transformation, in the material, of electrical energy into thermal energy, i.e., heat. These properties can vary over a wide range depending on the material. In many materials the properties are predominantly one type.</p><p id="p-0566" num="0591">Dissipation in some materials may be attributed to the magnetic field properties of a material and in other cases to the electric field properties. In more general cases, both of these mechanisms are present. Because of this, there is a convention in which the magnetic field storage properties and any related dissipation are combined in a vector sum and called permeability. Similarly, the vector sum of the electric field storage properties and associated dissipation is called permittivity. These vector sums are expressed as complex values in which the dissipation is the real component and field storage properties are the imaginary component. In the present disclosure, the aggregated change in properties of a body are detected and quantified by measuring changes in the body's electromagnetic properties.</p><p id="p-0567" num="0592">Although the approach described here works by sensing changes in the electromagnetic properties, i.e. changes in both electric and magnetic properties, in some applications the significant changes occur in only one set of properties. For purposes of further discussion, the instrument in embodiments described herein detects changes in permittivity. Detection of any other suitable property or combination of properties that are appreciated by a person skilled in the art is also within the spirit and limit of the disclosed subject matter. The dissipative component of permittivity often is expressed as the loss tangent of the material, while the storage term is called capacitance. Measuring these properties is accomplished by sensing the change of phase and amplitude of an electric field generated by the instrument and caused by the aggregated properties of a body within the field.</p><p id="p-0568" num="0593"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a system <b>100</b> for detecting and analyzing changes in a body according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure.

The external sensor device <b>102</b> can be constructed in many different mechanical configurations to provide appropriate coverage of the desired region. For example, in some embodiments, the external sensor device <b>102</b> can be a plurality of metallic plates. In some embodiments, the shape and/or the orientation of the external sensor device <b>102</b> can be changed as needed.</p><p id="p-0571" num="0596">In some embodiments, the external sensor device <b>102</b> is not required to physically contact the body being studied. For example, the external sensor device <b>102</b> and the supporting electronics could be installed in the driver's seat of an over-the-highway truck to detect changes in physiological indicators of driver drowsiness and thus take actions to prevent an accident. In some embodiments, the sensing process usually is done separately in two paths: (1) in a first path the changes in the real component of the vector sum, e.g., energy dissipation, are detected; (2) in a second path the changes related to the imaginary component&#x2014;a component such as a capacitance or inductance in which the phase of the current flowing in them is orthogonal to the current in the real component&#x2014;are separately processed. In some embodiments, the changes in amplitude of the electric field are detected in the first path, and the changes in frequency of the electric field are detected in the second path. Generally, as known by a person skilled in the art, the changes in phase of the electric field can be obtained by analyzing the changes in frequency of the electric field. These two signals can be combined in later signal processing to re-create the changes in the complex permittivity or kept as individual signals for separate analysis. These two paths are discussed separately below.</p><p id="p-0572" num="0597">To detect changes in the imaginary component of the complex permittivity, the output of the electric field generator <b>104</b> is connected to the quadrature demodulator <b>108</b>. The quadrature demodulator <b>108</b> detects the changes of the frequency of the output of the electric field generator <b>104</b> and produce a detected response that includes a low frequency component and a high frequency component. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a quadrature demodulator <b>108</b> according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure. The quadrature demodulator <b>108</b> includes a mixer <b>602</b> and a resonant circuit <b>604</b>. In the present disclosure, a double balanced mixer is described, but other suitable types of mixers can also be used.

The output of the resonant circuit <b>604</b> is connected to the other input port of the double balanced mixer <b>602</b>. In some embodiments, the resonant circuit <b>604</b> includes an inductor and a capacitor. In some embodiments, the resonant circuit <b>604</b> includes an inductor, a capacitor, and a resistor.

The product of the two signals creates two components in the output: one proportional to the difference between the two input frequencies and another at the sum of the two input frequencies. When there is an exact 90-degree phase difference between the two signals, the demodulator output is zero. When the phase difference is less than about +/&#x2212; 90 degrees there will be a DC component in the output of the double balanced mixer <b>602</b>.</p><p id="p-0575" num="0600">The output signal from the quadrature demodulator <b>108</b> is fed to a low pass filter <b>114</b>. The low pass filter <b>114</b> is typically an analog circuit that includes resistive, inductive and/or capacitive elements that separates the low frequency component of the quadrature demodulator <b>108</b> from the much higher frequency component generated by the quadrature demodulator <b>108</b>. The cutoff frequency of the low pass filter is selected to provide low attenuation of the desired signal components while sufficiently suppressing the high frequency terms. After filtering, the signal is connected to the signal processor unit <b>116</b> described below.</p><p id="p-0576" num="0601">Detecting changes in electric field dissipation is processed somewhat different from detecting frequency changes in electric field.

According to some embodiments, a sensor of the sensor strap system is placed/positioned to contact or juxtaposition with a sensor target (such as a human or animal subject). According to some embodiments, the sensor strap system is configured to be secured to a Base effortlessly, with minimum interference with the accessories of the Base (such as sheet cover and mattress padding etc.). According to some embodiments, the sensor strap system facilitates detection of physical and/or physiological activities/conditions of a target subject. The activities and conditions include, for example, the target subject's general movement (e.g., getting into or out of the chair or mattress), and/or the target subject's physiological state such as heart and lung activity or coughing patterns etc. During the detection, the target subject may be reclined or otherwise in contact with the sensor of the sensor strap system (e.g., sensor pad, plate, sheet, or any other suitable components of the sensor strap system). In some embodiments, the sensor of the sensor strap system is a sensor pad. In some embodiments, the sensor pad is rigid. In some embodiments, the sensor pad is flexible. In some embodiments, the sensor pad is positioned to physically contact a subject (e.g., human or animal subject).</p><p id="p-0659" num="0682">According to certain embodiments, the sensor of the sensor strap system (e.g., sensor pad or sensor plate) is secured to a body-contacting surface of an object (such as top of a mattress, or the sitting surface of a chair). However, the present disclosure is applicable to any object with a broad surface, and enough compression resistance to allow a circumferential strap to secure the sensor strap system, without causing substantial deformation to the object.</p><p id="p-0660" num="0683">According to some embodiments, the sensor strap system has means for securing itself to a bed and means for keeping the sensor (e.g., sensor pad) flat over the top surface of the bed. In some embodiments, the means for securing the system include a set of straps configured to keep the sensor pad secured on the mattress. In some embodiments, the set of straps are configured to be easily installed and removed. In some embodiments, the sensor strap system is designed to allow easy exchange of covers, such as bed sheets, so that the covers can be replaced without disrupting sensor pad's position.</p><p id="p-0661" num="0684">According to some embodiments, the sensor strap system has two sets of straps. The first set of straps (e.g., circumferential strap or straps) is designed to run around the circumference of a mattress. In some embodiments, the circumferential strap or straps incorporate various securing mechanisms such as buckles or other suitable tensioning mechanisms designed to help fixing the sensor strap system against the surfaces of the mattress (without the need to run straps underneath the mattress). The second set of straps (e.g., top strap or straps), according to certain embodiments, emerge from the sensor pad and are configured to connect to the circumferential strap or straps. In some embodiments, the top strap or straps extend to the sides of the mattress and connect with the circumferential strap or straps. In some embodiments, the connections of the top strap or straps to the circumferential straps may be permanent. In some embodiments, the connections are accomplished via detachable mechanisms such as clasps, buckles, or any other suitable mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0662" num="0685">In some embodiments, the circumferential strap or straps are made of inelastic materials such as nylon webbing. Circumferential strap or straps made with inelastic material may be coupled with certain tension adjustment mechanisms to allow the strap or straps to take up slack and make the hold more secure. In some embodiments, the circumferential strap or straps are made of an elastic material that may not need tension adjustment mechanisms or buckles to keep the sensor strap system secured. In some embodiments, the circumferential strap or straps incorporate a rigid corner piece to provide a point of reference at one corner of the mattress or other base platform.</p><p id="p-0663" num="0686">In some embodiments, the top strap or straps are made of an elastic material so that when a subject (e.g., human or animal) moves on the top of the bed, the strap or straps could flex to allow for normal elastic depression or extension. According to certain embodiments, the top strap or straps are attached to the circumferential strap or straps with permanent attachments such as stitching or permanent adhesives. In other embodiments, the top strap or straps are connected to circumferential straps via one or more adjustable mechanisms such as buckles. In some embodiments, the attachment mechanisms may be permanent such that the position of the sensor relative to the length of the bed is fixed. In other embodiments, the sensor strap system is configured to allow the sensor pad to connect/attach to different positions along the circumferential strap or straps. Such configuration allows users to adjust the position of the sensor pad along the bed.</p><p id="p-0664" num="0687">According to some embodiments, the sensor pad has electrical connections with one or more electrical conductors. These conductors may be attached to or embedded in the elastic top straps so that they can be routed to the circumferential strap or straps. In some embodiments, the conductors are made of flexible materials that can expand and contract as the top strap or straps flex. In some embodiments, the conductors may extend due to a subject depressing the top of the mattress. In one embodiment, the extension and contraction of the conductors are accomplished via a pattern (e.g., a zig-zag pattern or any other suitable patterns) of a flexible cable. In other embodiments, the conductors may be a cable (electric cable) with a slack loop which would allow the cable to extend and retract. In other embodiments, the conductors may be incorporated into the strap or straps by means of conductive threads.</p><p id="p-0665" num="0688">In some embodiments, once the electrical cable reaches the circumferential strap or straps, it travels along the strap or straps to an electronics module.
