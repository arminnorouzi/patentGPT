num="0000">An energy transportation and grid support system utilizes at least one transportable containment module capable of storing thermal or chemical energy typically produced from renewable or geothermal sources and providing connectivity with energy conversion equipment typically located in a land or sea-based operating facility. The system includes circuitry to hookup to an adjacent electricity grid for the provision of grid support and/or piping to move thermal energy typically used to drive steam turbines generating electricity. The operating facility also includes a communication arrangement to link with and exchange operations control data with a grid or heating operator and the energy transportation operator.

Unless sustainable (ie: geothermal) and renewable (ie: wind, solar) energy production grows to meet a very significant portion of global energy demand within this century, every country will be impacted by energy scarcity in the coming years. Rising fossil fuel costs driven by continuously increasing global energy demand, coupled with progressively more challenging access to reducing planetary fossil fuel reserves, not only threaten the economies of nations forced to import much of their energy, but also threaten global trade and transportation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Due to the geographical concentration of fossil fuels, the assurance of a constant energy supply in many regions of the world relies to a very significant extent on global fossil fuel deliveries and these primarily take the form of crude oil tankers which can typically carry up to 450,000 MT of oil or coal carriers up to 400,000 MT known as Chinamax ships. Hundreds of oil tankers are constructed every year with an average size of 75,000-100,000 MT with a typical lifespan of 25 years. Upon arriving at destinations, their crude oil must be piped to refineries and the resulting products are then typically trucked to points of use&#x2014;all stages consume energy and emit air pollutants and in particular, the crude oil tankers are amongst the heaviest air polluters in the world.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To prepare for future fossil fuel scarcity while also meeting hydrocarbon emission targets dictated by immediate global warming concerns, it is now common for governments to make major investments or offer significant tax incentives to spur renewable energy development (such as wind and solar, and remaining hydropower opportunities) to augment traditional sources of electrical energy (such as coal, gas and nuclear generation) and also provide financial incentives for electric ground transportation (as the growth in consumption of fossil fuels is greatest for transportation). These renewable projects often require grid upgrades and in some cases, major new transmission lines to deliver energy to consumers which equal or exceed the cost of the renewable generation facilities.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To both reduce capital costs of constructing major transmission lines, and to waste as little as possible of existing energy resources by reducing transmission losses, utilities ideally locate the production of electricity as close to major demand centers (cities, industrial complexes) as possible. For example, in the case of electrical generation via the consumption of fossil fuels and other combustibles, these feed stocks are typically shipped to generation facilities and burned as close as possible to demand centers with the downside of municipal air quality degradation. Shipping of such fossil fuels to support the electrical grid as well as home heating and transportation has grown to a global energy re-distribution industry operating thousands of ships, trains, and transport trucks.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Renewable electric energy generation (other than the combustion of ethanol and other plant-derived feed stocks) has the potential to significantly reduce further air quality degradation and ultimately to completely eliminate energy security concerns. However, as the percentage of such generation to overall electrical generation on any given continental grid grows, it poses two key challenges to distribution systems: 1) It is often not possible to locate such facilities within close proximity to demand centers; and, 2) Most renewable sources other than geothermal (which is only commercially feasible in limited areas of the planet), produce at intermittent periods which often do not coincide with demand.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The promise of a future electrical grid primarily powered by or only powered by renewable energy requires 1) an effective arrangement to locate renewable energy facilities close to demand and 2) effective energy storage facilities capable of fulfilling energy demands irrespective of oscillating renewable energy production levels.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The following table, modified from &#x201c;Materials Selection in Mechanical Design, 4th Edition&#x201d; by Mike Ashby (Granta Design), compares energy density achievable from a variety of sources of stored energy. This table details the stored energy density&#x2014;but in the case of combustible or thermal sources (Gasoline, Rocket Fuel and Thermal Graphite Storage), not what can be effectively utilised as electricity with current energy conversion methods. For example, although Gasoline's energy density is listed as 5,500 kWh/ton, when Gasoline is combusted in an internal combustion engine driving an electric generator, only a small portion of its energy potential is ultimately available as electric energy since much of the stored energy is lost in the conversion process as waste heat. Likewise, thermal energy stored in graphite must go through a conversion process to net electrical energy when used for grid support and thus, the turbine or other heat engine efficiency (typically 30-60% within such heat engine's ideal operating temperature range) determines the net energy density. Net energy from various chemical/battery storage technologies is impacted by cell life, temperature, discharge rates, and the performance of other inter-connected cells&#x2014;also dropping effective output from that predicted by ideal conditions in the table.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="105pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Energy</entry><entry>Energy Density</entry><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="105pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Store</entry><entry>kJ/kg</entry><entry>kWh/ton</entry><entry>Comment</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="105pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Gasoline</entry><entry>20,000&#x2002;</entry><entry>5,500</entry><entry>Non-renewable.

An effective arrangement is disclosed in U.S. published application 2011/0289924 A1 entitled High Density Energy Storage and Retrieval, the entire contents thereof is incorporated herein by reference. Energy stored in strategically located thermal-graphite systems may then be converted, via a host of available systems (broadly classified as heat engines which typically turn heat into mechanical motion necessary to drive electrical generators&#x2014;such engines span from large supercritical steam turbines to small Stirling engines) to electrical energy on-demand, meeting electrical demand peaks and smoothing production drops typical of renewable generation, but also due to unexpected failures of conventional nuclear and hydrocarbon powered generating facilities. Nitrogen or an ideal gas mixture, as detailed in the above mentioned patent application, is used to draw energy from graphite which cannot contain any oxygen, since graphite will ignite in oxygen.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">In addition to thermal-graphite energy storage systems, there are a host of energy storage systems available for both bulk, longer term storage (including pumped hydro, compressed air, and in some cases large-scale hydrogen fuel cell operations) and smaller, typically shorter term storage (including flywheels, batteries and other chemical storage systems including hydrogen fuel cells, and super-capacitors.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">Unfortunately, there remains the obvious requirement, common to all storage systems, for the critical provision of a suitable recharging period. Such period is effectively used when surplus energy (or the ability to generate such surplus energy on-demand) is available concurrently with suitable grid capacity to bring such surplus energy to the storage facility. Without such periods, storage systems are not recharged, and have less capacity to support the grid during times of low or zero renewable energy production. And unlike fossil fuels, when there is a shortage of renewable resources, there is no effective global transportation system which can move renewable energy to areas of need.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">Today, grid-connected &#x201c;spinning reserves&#x201d; are maintained to fill these holes in supply which cannot be met by depleted renewable storage systems&#x2014;the spinning reserves can be used to both stabilise grid voltages and recharge depleted storage systems. However, since such on-demand reserves are powered by fossil fuels, even with current fossil fuel global shipping operations, their availability in the future is uncertain in light of dwindling planetary fossil fuel reserves and increasing concerns about the air pollutants emitted during combustion of such fuels. Furthermore, powering spinning reserves with fossil fuels competes with the need for fossil fuels to be used for plastics and to power aircraft&#x2014;both uses have no apparent substitutes and will thus pay whatever the cost to ensure priority supply.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">In the absence of spinning reserves, many possible events, both predictable and unpredictable, reduce or eliminate critical storage recharging periods including:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">1) Latitude dependent, seasonal reductions in solar and/or wind energy</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0016">2) Periodic prolonged periods of little or no wind or continued cloud</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0017">3) Massive storm centers which not only block solar energy, but exceed the wind tolerances of wind turbines, concurrently eliminating both forms of renewable energy</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0018">4) Environmental and equipment disasters leading to grid connectivity failures</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0019">5) Shortage of available land area for solar and/or wind installations of sufficient output to guarantee surplus charging periods</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0020">6) Failure of nuclear or other generation due to equipment breakdown or earthquake related events</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0021">7) Failure of grid infrastructure to expand with energy demand</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0022">8) Accelerated adoption of electric ground transportation&#x2014;such vehicles, typically choosing to recharge at off-peak periods, reducing and possibly eliminating any available surplus.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0017" num="0023">There remains a need for grid support in periods, and at specific places, where the reduction or elimination of such recharging periods renders local storage systems inoperative and leaves the renewable-powered grid unstable. Currently, the only commercially viable forms of long-distance transport of energy to power grids under such conditions are pipelines, railcars, and ships designed to move fossil fuels. The present invention in a preferred embodiment provides an effective system for the storage and transportation of energy and a system for on-demand global transportation of renewable energy with adaptive grid support capability.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0024">An energy transportation and grid support system according to the present invention comprises at least one transportable containment module capable of storing thermal energy typically produced from renewable or geothermal sources and providing connectivity with energy conversion equipment typically located in a sea-based operating facility. The energy conversion equipment provides circuitry to hookup to an adjacent electricity grid for the provision of grid support and an arrangement to transfer thermal energy typically used to drive steam turbines generating electricity. The operating facility preferably includes a communication arrangement to link with and exchange operations control data with a grid or heating operator and the central energy transportation operator.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0025">In an aspect of the invention, the operating facility pulls energy from the containment module, converting to electrical energy as necessary for grid support or simply by extracting thermal energy for direct use by ancillary thermal processes.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0026">According to a further aspect of the invention, the containment module may incorporate some or all aspects of the energy conversion operation in one or both directions (charging and/or discharging operations) whereby the operating facility monitors the rates of energy pulled and pushed to the containment module to be consistent with the modules' design parameters.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0027">According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, where minimized upfront capital costs for ship, rail car, or transport truck construction is desired, the containment module size is maximised for ideal dimensions of the transport vehicle and permanently installed and connected to a dedicated operating facility. For example, in the case of sea transport, given current standardized port and navigation limits, the containment module can be maximised to fit within the tolerances of a &#x201c;Chinamax&#x201d; size ship also housing the operating facility.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0028">Preferred embodiments of the invention are shown in the drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0023" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates two Chinamax-size ships, each containing a permanently installed containment module and operating facility;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates two Chinamax-size ships, each holding removable containment modules.

For example, Iceland has year-round sustainable geothermal energy production and in the sunny arid portions of Africa, plenty of land is available with year-round sun, for solar renewable generation.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0038">According to the present invention, a fleet or network of energy transport ships <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are built to store and transport renewable and sustainable energy containing permanently installed containment modules <b>11</b>. Each module may be a single integral containment module that is designed to remain as part of the ship. Each containment module houses a graphite core typically consisting of a series of graphite bundles which preferably sits below the waterline <b>12</b> to increase ship stability to minimise motion which could damage such core. The ships also contain operating facilities <b>13</b> which include energy conversion equipment, heat transfer equipment, gas purification systems, and grid connectivity control systems in addition to communications system. These onboard operating facilities enable the ship to charge and discharge energy from the containment modules for bulk operations (steady maximum rate charging/discharging of the energy store within the containment module or modules on board for the purpose of &#x2018;loading&#x2019; before transit and &#x2018;unloading&#x2019; after transit of the energy cargo) or for grid regulation (partial output to, or draw from, the attached grid for the purpose of electricity consumption load following to ensure grid voltage stability over a longer period of time). Since energy stored within the containment module is typically in a different form than the energy used for &#x2018;charging&#x2019;, output and input energy forms are independent.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0039">The ship <b>10</b> in a preferred embodiment has a double water-tight hull <b>14</b> and the containment module includes 1 meter thick insulation inside walls <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0040">Although the size of these renewable energy storage and transport ships is not fixed, in a preferred embodiment of the current invention, the preferred embodiment fits the &#x201c;Chinamax&#x201d; specifications limiting its total cargo to 400,000 MT, its width to 65 M, length to 360 M and draft to 24 M enabling it to navigate key Chinese ports. Such renewable energy storage ship would be configured to hold 360,000 MT of graphite (core of 250 M length, 60 M width, and 22.8 M high including a 15-20% hollow gas passage volume). Raising the graphite to a maximum temperature of about 2500K, and assuming a multi-stage steam turbine operating with steam temperature of 600 degrees C., the graphite could be run down to 873K netting a temperature delta of 1627K. Using an average heat density over the graphite temperature range of 2000 J/kgK, provides a gross usable energy store of 325 GW-hr. With multi-stage turbine efficiencies of 60%, this mass of graphite nets a 195 GW-hr output and would be rated at 150 GW-hr usable storage.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0041">The present invention can be readily adapted to new heat engine designs which, in some cases, are targeting to net high efficiencies, with claims to be approaching Carnot efficiencies, at lower input temperatures. Such heat engines could be inserted into the turbine's final stage exhaust stream to net further energy output, or the containment module simply designed to operate at a lower-heat range, reducing insulation and possibly other materials costs and structural considerations.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0042">The slight positive pressure on the flat walls of the containment module is offset by the water pressure on the hull, so the costs of structural materials, in renewable energy ships with fixed containment modules are mitigated. The full radius on the ends of the graphite containment module <b>11</b> also shown in a perspective view <b>17</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> within another example ship <b>16</b> will hold the pressure without bending stresses in the tank. The top of the containment module is restrained by the cross beams that support the turbine deck (where a ship is outfitted with operating facilities) or simple cover structure, so having a flat top is again manageable. The turbines would be set on the deck, ideally about a meter below the waterline, so they will be stable at sea. The entire turbine deck is covered by an enclosed roof with sliding hatches for crane service when necessary.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0043">Although any number of turbines may be installed to effect high output rates, the ship is preferably equipped with twin turbine/generator setups, each in the 500 MW to 1 GW range giving the ship a 1-2 GW output range which exceeds most grid peaker plants and is typical of undersea grid interconnects between countries. To extract the energy from the graphite, circulating fans push cooler gas exiting heat exchangers through the graphite (the air or steam moving through the turbines is heated through such sets of heat exchangers which are heated by a separate gas loop through the graphite). Some of the cooler gas entering the containment module is mixed with heated gas exiting the graphite gas loop.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0044">A variable mixing valve can thus ensure that the gas exiting the graphite is not too hot for the heat exchanger materials. The motor drives of these fans consume a small portion of the energy output, so the rate of gas flow through the graphite is controlled to minimise such energy use based on varying turbine demands and graphite temperature.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0045">The multi-stage turbines can utilise additional thermal energy stored in the graphite, once the graphite core has fallen below 873K, by operating only their final low temperature stage, with a corresponding generator output rate reduction. Running the low temperature stage in one turbine to power the ship to and from its destination, by producing electricity for electric propulsion units, would be a normal operating procedure&#x2014;on the return to its charging facility, this additional energy use doesn't impact the &#x2018;rated&#x2019; storage available for commercial use. Note that this increased temperature delta achievable by running only the low temperature stage of the turbine as the graphite cools could be paired in a dual twinned turbine/containment module setup where initially one turbine would be operated until its graphite had been cooled to the point where its output drops and then the second turbine/graphite twin starts only when electrical demands exceed the lower output of the reduced first turbine and as necessary runs in parallel with the first until it too sees an output drop.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0046">This setup could be used in cruise ships where maximum output is only needed during cruising and not while in port, typically each day. It could also be used for container ships, passenger ferries, and other shipping where renewable energy use was preferred over fossil fuel combustion.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0047">For further safety while at sea, and as illustrated in many of the perspective ship views, each ship may be outfitted with a small smokestack and backup diesel generators to supply power to electric propulsion units. Diesel or other generators may also be used during movement of ships which have unloaded all removable containment modules, as more fully described later in this document.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0048">The dual turbine design of the preferred invention offers a number of other advantages&#x2014;as noted for example, in times of low energy demand, only one turbine needs to be operated. The two turbines also offer redundancy both while the ship is travelling between destinations, and while producing energy for grid support. In the event of unexpected failure or maintenance outage of one turbine or associated generator, the ship can continue to produce power at a reduced rate.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0049">One Meter thick insulation having one or more layers of heat reflective graphite foil, high temperature tolerant graphite felt, or graphite foam, which may be optionally surrounded by lower temperature tolerant ceramic or glass fiber insulation batting, surrounds the graphite immediately inside the containment module, reducing thermal losses to less than 7% per month. This enables ships to support grids for prolonged periods when little demand is present&#x2014;as might be the case during an unexpectedly windy period in places such as Norway where the majority of renewable energy is from wind installations.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0050">Unlike crude oil tankers, in the unlikely event that such renewable energy transport ship were struck broadside by another ship or run aground and sunk or otherwise exposed the graphite to sea water, no chemical pollution and the corresponding long-term environmental damage would occur. However, there would be some steam released and heating of the water around the wreck. Over the days following such an accident the ship, assuming it sank while fully charged, would boil off one billion pounds of sea water, producing a steam cloud that would fill roughly a 1 kilometer cube. Since such steam production would happen relatively slowly, and since there would be no oil or other significant contaminants onboard, such event would not be seen as a major environmental disaster.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0051">The operating facility on the ship also includes control systems which constantly monitor the grid and can react in an automated fashion while also receiving both generation and recharge commands from remote grid operators. When surplus energy is available on the grid, even for short times, where the ship is attached, it pulls energy to partially or fully recharge the graphite core by electrically driving resistive or optionally, inductive or plasma heaters. Likewise, when the attached grid needs support, the ship's turbines convert the thermal energy stored in the core to mechanical energy which spins generators to output electricity. Therefore in addition to the transport of energy, grid support to allow selective charging of the storage and selective energy removal from the storage is provided.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0052">Unlike fossil-fuel powered grid peaker plants which cannot absorb excess energy and for correct emissions control, must operate within a fairly narrow output range, the renewable energy storage ship has a unique ability to dynamically vary input and output rates and instantaneously alternate between taking energy from the attached grid like a sponge, and pushing energy onto the grid as required. No other commercially-viable large-scale, bulk energy storage system can do this&#x2014;although it is noted that if cost were not a factor, advanced battery systems could be constructed, but given today's battery technologies such would weigh roughly four times as much as graphite-based storage for the equivalent electricity output, would require massive fail-safe air conditioning and environmental support systems, would suffer reduced lifespan under such frequent charge/discharge cycling, and would represent a very significant environmental catastrophe in the event of fire or wreak. Furthermore, the advantages of the present invention include the fact that such renewable energy ship can take surplus energy off the grid even when it is fully charged.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0053">The energy storage ship design of the present invention satisfies three key use conditions (flexible charge, discharge and over charge) via an integrated automated control system. By using modified electronics originally developed for electric car battery recharging and axial flux AC motor or brushless 3 phase DC motor control, the ship has the ability to dynamically vary the degree it is pulling energy from the grid by selectively energising heaters within the containment module. For short periods, assuming appropriate grid connectivity, it can take many times its output rate as input energy by energising all heaters at 100%. Normally, energy used for recharge purposes is rotated amongst all heaters registering graphite temperatures lower than the average graphite temperature so that the load on the grid dynamically follows surplus availability and pulls down voltage spikes such that the graphite core is evenly reheated wherever possible and time is given for heat to conduct from a heater into surrounding graphite. At any given time, only 1%, 5%, 25% etc. of the heaters may be engaged, and in many cases, not to the full duty cycle of the given heater. The circuitry for any given heater is thus also not run at its maximum current, increasing lifespan by decreasing circuit temperature.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0054">In cases where a renewable-fed grid is swinging from surplus to deficit energy, as is typical of intermittent wind levels or clouds moving across the sky over a solar grid (or in cases of smaller grids, and even shipboard grids such as those found on cruise ships, where loads swing as individual systems such as HVAC cycle), a message can be transmitted to the ships control system from the grid operator asking for high adaptability availability. In this case, the circulation fans which move gas through channels in the core, will spin up to bring the heat exchanges to operating temperature and one or more turbines will spin to speed with lightly loaded generators. Electricity generated will be routed back into the heaters combining with electricity coming off the grid in periods of sunshine or high wind. However, as soon as the clouds begin to cover the solar field (or solar cells throughout a city) or wind level fall and grid voltages begin to drop, the ship's control systems will automatically, and progressively reduce its load on the grid to match solar production fall off&#x2014;then, as required, start pushing energy onto the grid from the turbine while proportionally increasing the speed of the gas recirculation fan and retuning the gas mixing valve within the containment module to ensure that appropriate heat energy is available at the heat exchanger for turbine power as generation load increases. When the cloud clears and solar production surges (or wind production resumes after a lull), the control systems will dynamically and quickly reduce power output to the grid by rerouting electrical energy from the turbine/generator back into the graphite heaters and then also begin to take any surpluses off the grid, again adding this energy to generator energy going back into the graphite. At the same time, the control system will throttle back the gas recirculation fan and retune the gas mixing valve to reduce turbine/generator output.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0055">In the special case where the graphite has been completely recharged, the renewable energy ship can continue to take power from the grid by continuing to drive its heaters in parallel with the gas recirculation fans to bring the heat exchangers up in temperature. The steam being heated by the heat exchangers will, however, not be used to generate electricity and in this case be directed to the condensers which use sea water for cooling. Essentially, surplus energy on the grid which cannot be absorbed by the graphite will end up passing through the condensers and into the sea around the ship. Although in many cases it is preferable to simply shut down wind turbines or disconnect solar cells from the grid to reduce surplus energy&#x2014;this may not always be an option, especially in cases where cloud cover suddenly breaks over large solar fields.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0056">It is particularly advantageous for the renewable energy storage ship to be able to periodically recharge, even if only partially, while connected and providing grid support. Upon arrival at the buoy (with the grid connect) or alongside a pier, fully charged to connect to the local grid, the ship offers 150 GWh of energy which, assuming it averages 1 GW output each day for 10 hours, enables it to support the grid along with a sister ship, also attached to the grid at this port, for approximately 2 weeks. Assume for the moment that this is a port of a major metropolitan center and two such renewable energy storage ships are grid connected, typically arriving and departing for recharging in a staggered fashion. If during the two week period however, higher than expected wind or sun enables periods of partial re-charging, the ships might suffer a net depletion much less than forecast. Now consider a similar dual ship setup located at a port a few hundred miles away which experiences significantly higher grid demands than forecasted due to overcast, calm days and nights where local renewable generation is failing to perform. By examining weather patterns and near-term predictions, the central renewable transportation operations facility dispatches a ship to the second location earlier than originally scheduled to compensate for the severe local renewable generation shortfall. However, due to travel distances, it then commands one of the ships at the nearby first port which has been able to maintain a high charge by recharging locally during periods of surplus energy, to go from the first to the second port where one of the ships assumes as much of the load as possible to drain its charge before detaching to return to its home recharging port. Later the fully charged ship arrives and takes the place of the second partially depleted ship which can then go to the first port where conditions continue to enable periodic recharging.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0057">As previously mentioned, the operations facility onboard ship also includes a gas purification system which not only filters the gas circulating within the graphite core, but also continuously tests for contaminants and mixture ratios. Since the gas is made up of components of air, equipment onboard can replenish gas components as needed.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0058">Now looking at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, this recyclable energy storage ship shown in side view in <b>20</b> and an alternate design shown in prospective view <b>22</b> holds removable containment modules <b>21</b> and <b>23</b>. Although this storage ship also includes an operating facility complete with turbines, some such ships with removable modules do not contain such facility and can only transport the containment modules from facility to facility. The containment modules <b>21</b> and <b>23</b> hold insulated graphite cores and have embedded, closed circuit, gas circulation loops and related fan or fans, gas pressure and filter control systems, and heat exchangers such that no external connection of the gas loop to external devices are necessary except in special maintenance intervals, via service ports, when gas replenishment/recomposition may be necessary. This prevents oxygen or other contaminants from getting into the closed system from attached equipment in the field and prevents elements of the gas mixture protecting the integrity of the graphite from escaping during field operations. The turbine side of the heat exchanger includes field couplings, protected by covers during transport, available for connection with operating facilities, as are electrical connectors such that the operating facility can provide power for gas circulation fans and receive real-time data including fan RPM, temperature and pressure from within the containment module.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0059">In order for a Chinamax ship with multiple, smaller removable containment modules to carry the same energy as one with a single module, the module size will necessarily be higher due to the increased non-storage volume necessary to not only structurally ensure the integrity of each module, but to individually incorporate appropriate insulation and other systems into each removable module and leave spare room between modules for inspection. Thus, as the effective storage density declines, the center of gravity of such a ship will be higher, resulting in more roll in heavy seas, which in turn requires additional structural materials in each core. Since the overall displacement of a Chinamax ship cannot increase beyond the specific established limits, the waterline <b>24</b> is effectively fixed and reductions to the storage capacity of the ship will be made to accommodate additional structural and systems weight.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0060">The key advantage of removable containment modules is two-fold:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0061">1) Upon a depleted ship returning to a charging port, the containment modules are swapped with charged modules, significantly reducing time at the charging port; and,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0062">2) Removable containment modules may be dropped at shore facilities where energy can be stockpiled and then transferred and connected to local, land-based turbine/generator sets for grid support&#x2014;thereby avoiding possible intermittent late arrival of renewable energy storage ships in the event of bad weather or unexpectedly high periods of demand.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0055" num="0063">Removable containment modules can also be offloaded on offshore platforms where operating facilities including turbines or other heat engines can produce electricity on demand for use on the platform, or transferred, via electric cable, to the mainland.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0064">Removable containment modules, sized appropriately, can further be transferred to rail cars or trucks for deployment in both temporary and permanent generating facilities or to power transportation.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0065">Before depleted containment modules are recharged, service ports on the side of the containment module enables the recharge facility to pressure-test the module, then test the existing gas for impurities which will indicate module health, and then replace the gas within such containment module while driving the fan or fans inside the containment module. During such automated process which occurs in an oxygen-free environment, the performance of the fan or fans is also tested by analysing the electronic signature of the fan motor and corresponding flow rate of gas. This renewal of the gas, before the containment module is recharged, ensures that every such module is up to specification before superheating the embedded graphite.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0066">Also using the service ports, rather than charging the removable containment modules via electric input to internal heater systems, the removable containment modules could also be dropped at solar-thermal land or sea-based facilities, or a ship or transport with permanently installed modules could be parked such that access to these service ports is facilitated. High-temperature solar collectors (or other heat source) would charge graphite-based containment modules by directly accessing the service ports, running high temperature gas from solar collectors (or related external heat exchangers) directly into the graphite through gas passages usually used to bring gas to the internal heat exchangers within the containment modules during discharge cycles. In this reverse charging situation, gas mixing valves in the containment module close to isolate the graphite gas flow path from the internal heat exchanger and fan apparatus, enabling the reverse-direction flow of gas from the solar thermal installation to heat the graphite core, driven by external fans installed at the solar-thermal facility. The gas mixing values are also able to direct a small portion of such gas flow through the internal heat exchanger, such that shipboard (or other transit-board) energy conversion equipment (turbines, other heat engines) can produce electricity, in the event that either the solar-thermal installation has no native power supply to drive fan apparatus and the necessary electronic monitoring systems, or that such supply of electricity is more expensive than that produced from the energy conversion equipment.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0067">In typical solar-thermal installations, the operating temperature of the solar-thermal panels will likely be less than the ideal maximum graphite core temperature requiring a boosting of the heat output from the solar-thermal panels before input to the containment modules during later stages of charging. Such heat boosting apparatus would normally not be included within the containment modules, to keep module cost and complexity to a minimum. However, certain heat-boosting designs might preferably be installed in close or direct proximity to the graphite core, and therefore could be installed within the containment modules. Any metal piping of gas from such heat boosters or other external heat sources (which could include fossil fuel combustion or super-heated geothermal sources) or their respective heat exchangers to the special service ports on the containment modules must be lined with graphite foam as the gas at maximum graphite temperatures must not directly contact metal.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0068">Graphite in the containment modules is typically made up of bundles <b>30</b> of graphite columns as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In the preferred embodiment, each column <b>31</b> has one or more holes bored <b>32</b> where heaters <b>33</b> are inserted. The advantage of embedding the heating resistors within the graphite is that the gas circulating fan need not be continuously running while heating. Heater circuitry can measure current in each heating resistor and from this value, estimate the ability of a given resistor to input more energy into the graphite at a given precise location&#x2014;such variations in the core temperature is expected, as will be apparent from the nature of the gas flow through the bundles <b>30</b> which cools portions of any given bundle adjoining incoming gas flows faster than portions near exiting gas flows. Alternately, heating resistors or inductive and plasma heaters may be distributed elsewhere within the containment module and using the gas circulating fan, distribute the heat throughout the graphite core. The disadvantage of this approach is that the fan will experience higher operating temperatures that it does during discharging and its duty cycle thus significantly lengthened&#x2014;both factors increasing the maintenance load.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0069">The heater <b>33</b> extends up through a top ceramic manifold <b>34</b> and rests on a lower ceramic manifold <b>39</b> and consists of an electrical conductor <b>35</b> that carries electrical current, such as tungsten or other metal commonly used for furnace heater elements. The thin section is the higher resistance section where most of the energy is dissipated and most of the heating takes place. The larger diameter section is for lower dissipation in the leads. The thin section may be straight or may be bent to increase the length of the conductor, such as spirally wound on one or both leads. The resistive section extends most of the way through the graphite core, stopping short of the bottom by about the radius of the ceramic covering <b>36</b>, so that the conductor does not contact the support structure <b>39</b> beneath the core.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0070">The conductor <b>35</b> is shown encased in two types of ceramic material, the lower section <b>37</b> being a ceramic with high thermal conductivity that aligns with the graphite core top and bottom surfaces. The upper section <b>38</b> is a ceramic with relatively lower thermal conductivity which meets the lower section <b>37</b> and extends up through the top manifold and gas conduit plumbing space into the insulation and aligns at or slightly below the insulation layer covering the top of the graphite storage within the containment module. The electrical leads extend above the thermal insulation of the storage where they can be clamped on to the electrical distribution conductor network at relatively low temperature. The diameter of the ceramic covered heater element is approximately one inch and its length will match the graphite core height, typically up to 20-40 feet plus the thickness of the top ceramic manifold, space above that for gas conduit routing, and then additional length to extend up through a portion of the insulation.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0071">The ceramic heater assembly may be wrapped with supporting fibers for added strength for handling prior to assembly, and/or it may be infused with reinforcing fiber of shorter length, as is common in fiber reinforced molding materials.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0072">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, finer details of one embodiment of the upper and lower manifold plates are illustrated. The upper manifold plate <b>410</b> (illustrated in dual perspective view top and bottom sides) sits on top of the column assembly of graphite columns and directs the gas flow coming in one port <b>411</b> to the downward passages through the graphite columns&#x2014;note the dividing ridge <b>414</b> which separates incoming from exiting gas and meets the top of the graphite columns. At the bottom of the assembly, the lower or base manifold plate <b>420</b> (illustrated in dual perspective view top and bottom sides) directs the gas flow from the downward flowing passages to the appropriate upward flowing passages. Once the gas has flowed back up those passages, it is consolidated in the right half of the top plate <b>410</b> and flows out the port <b>412</b> into the mating conduit.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0073">These manifold plates <b>410</b> and <b>420</b> may be constructed of ceramic for more precise control of shaping for more complex gas flow arrangements which might include multiple gas input and output ports <b>411</b> and <b>412</b> and multiple dividing ridges <b>414</b> for very large bundles, or may be machined from graphite which contributes to the total mass of material available for storing energy. Note the small holes <b>413</b> in the Top Manifold <b>410</b> are the passages for heater rods <b>33</b> to be installed down into the core assembly and from which they can be removed for maintenance in the event of a heater rod failure. All the graphite passages through which gas flows are coated with a ceramic slurry to seal the surface so that graphite dust is not eroded from the surfaces during high gas flow operation. This slurry is fired to result in &#x201c;green&#x201d; ceramic prior to assembly of the graphite storage unit. During initial operation of the completed storage assembly, temperature ramps slowly cure the ceramic to its fully fired state giving full strength, and allowing mating ceramic surfaces to bond together providing gas seals between mating surfaces.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0074">The simplified upper illustration <b>410</b> shows only resistive heater rod openings <b>413</b> for seven (7) columns of graphite and the accompanying gas passages; larger top <b>414</b> and bottom manifold assemblies of dozens or more graphite columns contain as many holes as resistors, with the input and output gas ports located between such holes. Since the entire storage containment vessel is pressurized to the level of the flowing gas, minor gas seepage around the openings is tolerated.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0075">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the top view of a single round graphite column <b>51</b> is illustrated with one bore hole <b>52</b> for the resistor tube heater. Each block has a resistor tube inserted through its length. The blocks could be the full length of the height of the core, or they could be assembled as a stack of blocks of shorter length optimize the manufacturing and assembly process. The whole assembly could be oriented so that the resistors and gas passages are vertical or horizontal, depending on the needs and space constraints of an application.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0076">Round graphite columns bundled in groups <b>53</b> of seven to create gas passages <b>54</b> from subsections of the storage which may be assembled into subassemblies which may be wrapped with graphite fiber cloth <b>55</b> which is secured by infusing ceramic material around the fibers to provide structural strength for convenience in handling and assembly, and to provide greater stiffening to resist sheer forces and possible shock loading in mobile applications including rough seas or earthquakes in the case of land installations. These subassembly bundles are then assembled into the form of the containment modules <b>56</b> and again wrapped with graphite fiber cloth and ceramic binder before being wrapped with insulation and then lowered into the containment module to rest on a formed ceramic plate sitting above the base insulation. Specially formed plates at the top and bottom of the graphite column assembly will direct gas flow through the spaces between the columns as required for a specific thermal storage arrangement. Such top and bottom plates may be formed from graphite or from ceramic materials. In a preferred embodiment.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates alternate graphite column designs <b>61</b> and <b>62</b>. These hexagonal blocks have gas passage cut-outs which require additional machining, but allows precise control of gas passage shaping and location. Multiple cut outs <b>63</b> on each face can allow for extensive control of the number of gas passages <b>64</b> and the ratio of heating resistors <b>65</b> to gas passages for each block when assembled into a bundle <b>66</b>. For completion of the hexagonal pattern to allow efficiency in packing and ease of assembly, a second complementary form of block <b>67</b> is required which fills in the irregular surface created by the hexagonal columns and provides a rounded corner to the assembly such that graphite fiber can be tightly wound around the assembly.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0078">Whereas the round graphite columns have the advantage of lowest cost post processing to obtain the finished block, the intercolumn gas passages which are formed by the assembly are defined by circular geometry to exactly 1-.pi./4, or 21.5% of the core volume. In applications in which higher capacities are advantageous, such as space constrained ship containers for mobile thermal energy storage, higher core densities can be achieved by increasing the number of passages and reducing their diameter using the hexagonal technique which permits customization of the gas passage geometry. That customization comes at the cost of additional post processing to machine the specific shape required.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0079">Graphite dust circulating with the gas and will increase maintenance cycles. The abrasive nature of the dust will wear fan blades and bearing surfaces as well as the interior surface of heat exchangers. The dust will also tend to build up in the heat exchanger. To minimize dust, after the columns of graphite are installed in the containment module, the graphite can be sprayed with a fine slurry of SiC of high purity. When heated in situ the SiC will bond to the carbon to form a skin that will prevent erosion. Boron nitride or boron carbide could also be used and commercially available boron-nitride paints can be sprayed on the individual graphite blocks as long as the minimum crystal size is under 1 micron. When it is dried it can be handled, and when it is fired in situ, it bonds to the carbon molecules for long term stable operation.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0080">Comparing the round columns <b>51</b> of graphite with the hexagonal columns <b>61</b> reveals their strengths and weaknesses. Special wands will insert into gas passages <b>54</b> and <b>64</b> to spray the coatings on the graphite. However, the uniform and circular nature of passages <b>64</b> are preferable over passages <b>54</b> for the application of such coatings. Furthermore, the consistent size of such passages <b>64</b> is also preferential. But hexagonal columns <b>61</b> cannot be wrapped in bundles for additional strength and still tightly packed without the complementary blocks <b>67</b> which add to manufacturing costs by introducing an additional milled component. If wrapped and loosely packed, or only wrapped on the outer circumference of the graphite core within the containment module, the carbon fibre wrap must crease as it passes around pointed corners which will significantly weaken the wrap. Thus in cases where designs such as <b>61</b> are employed, the complementary blocks <b>67</b> with rounded sides will typically be included for outer bundle walls so that wraps can be applied without failure.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0081">It is important to note that there are no metals in the core as at maximum operating temperatures of 2500K, anything in the core will be exposed to this high temperature for extended periods from weeks to months.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0082">Allowance will be made for thermal expansion by placing graphite felt between bundles.

The underwater cable from the buoy to the grid must be capable of not only accepting the power transferred from the ship as limited by its turbine/generator sets, but also to be sized to ideally carry recharge energy at a rate meeting the ship's maximum energy input. This rate will typically be many times the output rate, as it is solely limited by the number of resistor tubes and the driving electronics. Since each resistor may be independently controlled and monitored by electronics in the operations facility, the failure of any one circuit or resistor heater will have only a extremely minor effect on the storage.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0084">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a containment module transfer system enables ships to drop modules for recharging, powering a grid, or storage. Although removal of charged containment modules could be performed using overhead cranes after docking of the renewable energy transport ship, the weight and potential for shock to larger modules offering the maximum energy density storage makes these very large scale modules costly to manufacture and lift from a floating ship at dock.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0085">According to the preferred embodiment of the invention, the under hull removal of a large, macro-sized module <b>81</b> is preferable to overhead crane systems. The macromodule <b>81</b> for a Chinamax ship would have approximate dimensions of 250 M.times.4 M less than the beam of the ship.times.1.5 M more than the draft and is designed to be just slightly buoyancy positive, with the heat exchanger interface unit <b>82</b> rising above the surface of the water. When this seaworthy macro module is attached to the ship <b>80</b> it loads the rest of the hull with about 1 M kg which lowers it in the water only slightly as illustrated by the waterline <b>84</b>. When the module is released from the ship that weight is carried by the sub-sea platform <b>83</b>, acting as an elevator controlled via ballast tanks so that there is negligible loading to the sea floor other than massive anchoring pylons which stabilize and level the whole system using automated control winches pulling cables <b>85</b> attached to the exterior corners of the platform.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0086">During unloading of the macro containment module, the sub-sea platform <b>83</b> is raised against the ship <b>80</b> to raise the entire ship in the water and clamps on the sub-sea platform grip the macro module. With the macro module now joined with the sub-sea platform, the attachment bolts or clamps securing the macro module <b>81</b> to the ship <b>80</b> are released, releasing the ship. The platform <b>83</b> is then slowly lowered until the ship is floating free (with a shallower draft as illustrated by the slightly lower water line <b>86</b>), yet still guided by rails extending down from the ship to guide the macro module until the platform is lowered and the module clears the ship. The ship then motors away using flywheel or other short-term renewable storage or relying on a brief period of diesel generator output, to the next such station where the process is reversed to load it with a completely charged energy storage module or another depleted module for a return trip for recharging.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0087">The sub-sea platform then rises, slightly pushing the macro module above its floating point and a tender ship or tugboat tethers to the macro module. The clamps holding the macro module to the platform are released. The platform then lowers, enabling the macro module to float freely. As soon as it is clear of the undersea elevator, the next ship can have access to the elevator for unloading or another macro module can be placed above the platform for capture by the platform and the start of a loading process.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0088">The loading process is similar to unloading&#x2014;the platform with the macro containment module pulls the module down and the ship moves above. The ship would ideally be held stationary directly above the platform via thrusters and GPS instruments typically used at sea. The platform then rises and rails extended down from the ship guide the macro module into place and the platform continues to rise until the module is firmly seated. Bolts or clamps then grip the module and the platform lowers, slowly the ship bears the partial weight of the macro module, with the remainder being born by its buoyancy.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0089">Macro modules are moved by tender ships/tugboats to and from weather protection docks for recharging, discharging, or storage. Access to the heat exchanger, and service port interfaces is protected by sealed doors which open above sea level for connections with energy conversion equipment.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0090">The exchange of macro modules will typically occur in calm bays or during times of calm seas in more open areas. In the event of heavy weather, many of the renewable energy transport ships will have operating facilities <b>87</b> onboard so that they can attach to grid connected moorings to directly link with the grid in the event that macro modules cannot be unloaded.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0091">In a further aspect of the present invention, such containment module transfer systems could also be used to move smaller containment modules into compatible ships which use these stores of renewable energy for propulsion and shipboard activities. These ships would incorporate an undersea berth for such modules such that the module could be moved into the berth while the ship was anchored, docked at a pier, or held stationary via thrusters. Alternatively, slightly positive buoyancy modules with variable ballast systems could be floated and locked into stern or side channels in such ships.
