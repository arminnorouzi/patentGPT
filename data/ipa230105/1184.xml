Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The human body is controlled by patterns of electrical impulses transmitted through nerve fibers. In case of a chronic neurological disease, these electrical patterns may be affected. As an example, people may suffer from chronic migraines, pain, or mental disorders, among others. A migraine may affect electrical impulses in the brain. Bioelectronic devices may use mild electrical impulses to influence nerve activity and potentially address the issues in the electrical patterns. The bioelectronic devices may provide an implanted neurostimulation system for those suffering from migraines.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Unfortunately, it can be difficult to determine how to best provide a therapy for a patient and each patient may be different. In some cases, each patient may go through a trial-and-error approach to determine the best way to receive therapy. The bioelectronic devices may have to be configured for each therapy session and it may take months for a therapeutic effect to be established. Each patient may have to schedule and attend weeks or months of follow-up visits to iteratively adapt and try to arrive at an effective therapy.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The hearing industry has greatly benefited from auditory self-tests. Patients may take tests on their own and respond to stimuli that scan a wide frequency range and vary in amplitude depending on patients' responses.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is with these issues in mind, among others, that various aspects of the disclosure were conceived.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is to be understood that both the following summary and the detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.

The computing device may obtain feedback information from the patient and automatically adjust at least one of the adjustable parameters based on the feedback information from the patient. In one example, each electrode may have different stimulation settings and be automatically configured by the computing device based on the feedback. In addition, as an example, two of the electrodes of the electrode array may generate electrical impulses at a time based on the automatic configuration to provide treatment to the patient. The patient may provide feedback by pointing to a particular location on their head and the computing device may determine one or more electrodes associated with the particular location. The feedback provided by the patient may indicate unwanted side effects and/or may indicate paresthesia.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one example, a method may include configuring, by a computing device, stimulation settings for each electrode in an electrode array in physical contact with a patient, the stimulation settings having adjustable parameters comprising frequency, pulse width, and amplitude, obtaining, by the computing device, feedback information from the patient, and automatically adjusting, by the computing device, at least one of the adjustable parameters based on the feedback information from the patient.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another example, a therapy configuration system may include at least one processor and a memory device in communication with the processor, the at least one processor to configure stimulation settings for each electrode in at least one electrode array in physical contact with a patient, the stimulation settings having adjustable parameters comprising frequency, pulse width and amplitude, obtain physiological feedback information from the patient, and automatically adjust at least one of the adjustable parameters based on the physiological feedback information from the patient.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another example, a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium may have instructions stored thereon that, when executed by at least one computing device cause the at least computing device to perform operations, the operations comprising configuring stimulation settings for each electrode in an electrode array in physical contact with a patient, the stimulation settings having adjustable parameters comprising frequency, pulse width, and amplitude, obtaining feedback information from the patient, and automatically adjusting at least one of the adjustable parameters based on the feedback information from the patient.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other aspects, features, and benefits of the present disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed written description of the preferred embodiments and aspects taken in conjunction with the following drawings, although variations and modifications thereto may be effected without departing from the spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the disclosure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The accompanying drawings illustrate embodiments and/or aspects of the disclosure and, together with the written description, serve to explain the principles of the disclosure.

This specification discloses one or more embodiments that incorporate features of the invention. The embodiment(s) described, and references in the specification to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;an example embodiment&#x201d;, etc., indicate that the embodiment(s) described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. When a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, persons skilled in the art may effect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the several figures, like reference numerals may be used for like elements having like functions even in different drawings. The embodiments described, and their detailed construction and elements, are merely provided to assist in a comprehensive understanding of the invention. Thus, it is apparent that the present invention can be carried out in a variety of ways, and does not require any of the specific features described herein. Also, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the invention with unnecessary detail. Any signal arrows in the drawings/figures should be considered only as exemplary, and not limiting, unless otherwise specifically noted.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention, since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first element could be termed a second element, and, similarly, a second element could be termed a first element, without departing from the scope of example embodiments. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. As used herein, &#x201c;at least one of A, B, and C&#x201d; indicates A or B or C or any combination thereof. As used herein, the singular form of a word includes the plural, and vice versa, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, the references &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are generally inclusive of the plurals of the respective terms.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It should also be noted that in some alternative implementations, the functions/acts noted may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two figures shown in succession may in fact be executed substantially concurrently or may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality/acts involved.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, ranges are used herein in shorthand, so as to avoid having to list and describe each and every value within the range. Any appropriate value within the range can be selected, where appropriate, as the upper value, lower value, or the terminus of the range.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The words &#x201c;comprise&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprises&#x201d;, and &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; are to be interpreted inclusively rather than exclusively. Likewise the terms &#x201c;include&#x201d;, &#x201c;including&#x201d; and &#x201c;or&#x201d; should all be construed to be inclusive, unless such a construction is clearly prohibited from the context. The terms &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; or &#x201c;including&#x201d; are intended to include embodiments encompassed by the terms &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; and &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d;. Similarly, the term &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; is intended to include embodiments encompassed by the term &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d;. Although having distinct meanings, the terms &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;, &#x201c;having&#x201d;, &#x201c;containing&#x201d; and &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; may be replaced with one another throughout the description of the invention.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">&#x201c;About&#x201d; means a referenced numeric indication plus or minus 10% of that referenced numeric indication. For example, the term &#x201c;about 4&#x201d; would include a range of 3.6 to 4.4. All numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term &#x201c;about.&#x201d; Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth herein are approximations that can vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of any claims, each numerical parameter should be construed in light of the number of significant digits and ordinary rounding approaches.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Wherever the phrase &#x201c;for example,&#x201d; &#x201c;such as,&#x201d; &#x201c;including&#x201d; and the like are used herein, the phrase &#x201c;and without limitation&#x201d; is understood to follow unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">&#x201c;Typically&#x201d; or &#x201c;optionally&#x201d; means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Conventional approaches to providing neurotherapy are complex and tedious for both patients and those providing care for patients such as nurses. It can be difficult to determine how to best provide therapy for a patient and each patient may be different based on a myriad of factors. In some cases, each patient may go through a trial-and-error approach to determine the best way to receive therapy. The bioelectronic devices may have to be configured for each therapy session and it may take months for a therapeutic effect to be established. Each patient may have to schedule and attend weeks or months of follow-up visits to iteratively adapt and try to arrive at an effective therapy.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Current solutions are time-consuming, complex, and not intuitive. As an example, for each patient, a bioelectronic device may have a plurality of contacts with a patient. Each contact of the bioelectronic device may be selected one at a time or a few at a time may be selected and stimulation settings (e.g., voltage and frequency) are tested with a patient.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Conventionally, a computing device may be held near or against a patient at an implantable pulse generator to transfer associated settings from the computing device to the implantable pulse generator. The patient or caregiver may determine whether paresthesia is felt (and where) and/or adverse events (e.g., pain sensation, muscle recruitment). This may be repeated up to fifty times if there are eight contacts for the implantable pulse generator and repeated at six different current levels. In addition, this may have to be repeated for both occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) and supraorbital nerve stimulation (SONS). Paresthesia may be a &#x201c;champagne bubbles&#x201d; sensation experienced by the patient associated with effective therapy.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Follow-up visits may occur every few months and involve a nurse having limited time for repeated setup and configuration procedures. Even further, changes can only be made every few months and the patient cannot optimize as the therapeutic effect unfolds. As an example, it may not be possible to try six different current levels because this could be harmful to the patient and their therapy. Thus, settings for each patient may be suboptimal because they may provide too much stimulation or not enough stimulation.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Currently, the nurse or another operator may select each current value or contact associated with the implantable pulse generator and the patient may provide feedback by indicating paresthesia (associated with therapeutic effect) or side-effects (muscle recruitment or pain). The nurse may have to manually record each instance of feedback. This may be repeated, for example, six times for each current and for each of eight contacts. The nurse may have to manually select each contact and manually adjust the frequency, pulse width, and amplitude. In addition, the nurse may have to indicate whether the patient experienced paresthesia or side effects for each test during setup. This is not efficient for nurses or operators or patients and can be wasteful and ineffective. Patients may experience too much stimulation or too little stimulation and it can take an extremely long time to setup the implantable pulse generator.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to an example, a self-programming stimulation settings system may include a computing device such as a mobile computing device (e.g., smartphone or tablet device) that may be a patient computing device. The computing device may communicate with at least one electrode array that may be an implantable impulse generator to provide neurostimulation therapy for a patient. The computing device may send settings information to the at least one electrode array based on feedback from the patient and automatically program and configure the at least one electrode array based on the feedback. The feedback may be captured by the computing device using an image capture device associated with the computing device.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As an example, the image capture device may capture a frown provided by the patient or a grimace provided by the patient. Alternatively, the patient may point to a particular location on their head and the computing device may determine one or more electrodes associated with the particular location. The point by the patient may indicate that the patient feels paresthesia or feels side-effects. Alternatively or additionally, the at least one electrode array may register the particular location using capacitive sensing.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The computing device also may capture information or data associated with other biomarkers such as a heart rate of the patient. The heart rate may be determined by the computing device or another device and sent to the computing device. The computing device may generate current using various electrode configurations until paresthesia is confirmed by the patient. In addition, the computing device may store information associated with the electrode configurations in memory or in storage to generate a patient diary or patient history for future use and store configuration for settings that provide good therapy outcomes.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a self-programming stimulation settings system <b>100</b> according to an example embodiment.
