The increase in the overlapping area between the metal layers may cause an increase of a signal line load (RC load) and a decrease of yield. The increase in the step difference of the film layers of the display panel is not conducive to a good characteristic of an OLED device, and a life and an efficiency of the OLED device may be reduced due to an unevenness of a substrate. Therefore, a thick organic film layer may be used as an insulating layer between the metal layers. Such an organic film layer may increase a spacing between the metal layers to reduce a signal interference between overlapping portions of the metal layers, and may also be used as a planarization layer to reduce the step difference of the film layers.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows an example of a film layer structure of a display substrate according to the embodiments of the present disclosure. A display substrate <b>100</b> may include a base substrate <b>10</b>, a thin film transistor <b>20</b>, a first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b>, a first protective layer PVX<b>1</b>, a first conductive layer (e.g., a metal layer) <b>30</b>, and a second planarization layer PLN<b>2</b>. The thin film transistor <b>20</b> may be arranged on the base substrate <b>10</b>. The first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> may be arranged on a side of the thin film transistor <b>20</b> away from the base substrate <b>10</b>. The first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> may be arranged on a side of the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> away from the base substrate <b>10</b>. The first conductive layer <b>30</b> may be arranged on a side of the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> away from the base substrate <b>10</b>. The display substrate <b>100</b> is provided with a first via hole <b>40</b> penetrating the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b>. The first via hole <b>40</b> may serve as an exhaust path. With the exhaust path, a gas (e.g., water vapor) released from the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> may pass through the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> to discharge during a process of manufacturing the display substrate. The second planarization layer PLN<b>2</b> may be arranged on a side of the first conductive layer <b>30</b> away from the base substrate <b>10</b>. The first via hole <b>40</b> is connected from the second planarization layer PLN<b>2</b> to the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b>. The first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> is in contact with the second planarization layer PLN<b>2</b> through the first via hole <b>40</b>. This allows a gas from the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> to be smoothly discharged to the second planarization layer PLN<b>2</b> for a further discharge. An orthographic projection of the first via hole <b>40</b> on the base substrate <b>10</b> does not overlap an orthographic projection of the first conductive layer <b>30</b> on the base substrate <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, a second protective layer PVX<b>2</b> may be further provided. The second protective layer PVX<b>2</b> is arranged on a side of the first conductive layer <b>30</b> away from the base substrate <b>10</b> and on a side of the second planarization layer PLN<b>2</b> facing the base substrate <b>10</b>. In other words, the second protective layer PVX<b>2</b> may be located between the second planarization layer PLN<b>2</b> and the first conductive layer <b>30</b>. In this case, the first via hole <b>40</b> may penetrate the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> and the second protective layer PVX<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, the aforementioned first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> is a thick organic film layer, and a thickness may reach, for example, tens of micrometers, such as 20 micrometers. When the first conductive layer <b>30</b> is formed by deposition (especially by sputtering), if the first conductive layer <b>30</b> is directly deposited on the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b>, the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> may be damaged and peeled off during the deposition of the first conductive layer <b>30</b>, which may contaminate a chamber for depositing the first conductive layer <b>30</b>. In order to avoid this situation, after forming the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b>, an inorganic film layer (that is, the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b>) may be formed to protect the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b>, and then the first conductive layer <b>30</b> may be deposited and patterned. Then, an inorganic protective film (that is, the second protective layer PVX<b>2</b>) for protecting the first conductive layer <b>30</b>, as well as the second planarization layer PLN<b>2</b>, an anode layer AN and a pixel defining layer PDL may be further fabricated.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">When fabricating according to the aforementioned process, a high temperature baking process of the second planarization layer PLN<b>2</b> and a high temperature annealing process of the anode layer AN usually cause a continuous release (or called exhaust) of water vapor in an organic film of the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b>. The first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> is enclosed by the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b>, the second protective layer PVX<b>2</b> and even the first conductive layer (for example, metal layer) <b>30</b>. Without providing a path for the exhaust of the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b>, the water vapor released from the planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> may cause a defect such as bulging or film breaking (film layer falling off) of the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b>, the second protective layer PVX<b>2</b> and even the anode layer AN. This defect not only affects a normal light emission of a pixel, but is also unfavorable to a reliability of the display panel. Therefore, the embodiments of the present disclosure provide the first via hole <b>40</b> penetrating the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> and the second protective layer PVX<b>2</b>. The first via hole <b>40</b> may allow the water vapor released from the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> to pass through the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> and the second protective layer PVX<b>2</b> to discharge during the process of manufacturing the display substrate (for example, during the high temperature baking process of the second planarization layer PLN<b>2</b> or the high temperature annealing process of the anode layer AN), which may avoid the above-mentioned defect such as bulging and falling off of the film layer.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the display substrate may further include a second planarization layer PLN<b>2</b>. As an example, the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> and the second protective layer PVX<b>2</b> are relatively dense inorganic layers, for example, made of a material such as SiNx. The first protective layer PVX<b>1</b>, the second protective layer PVX<b>2</b> and the first conductive layer <b>30</b> are all film layers through which water vapor may not easily pass. The second planarization layer PLN<b>2</b> may be, for example, an organic layer (for example, made of resin) through which water vapor may pass.

The orthographic projection of the first via hole <b>40</b> on the base substrate <b>10</b> not overlapping the orthographic projection of the first conductive layer <b>30</b> on the base substrate <b>10</b> means that the first via hole <b>40</b> may avoid the first conductive layer <b>30</b> so that the released gas may be discharged smoothly.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, a second via hole <b>70</b> penetrating the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> and the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> may be further provided, and the first conductive layer <b>30</b> is electrically connected to the second conductive layer <b>80</b> through the second via hole <b>70</b>.

In some embodiments, a plurality of first via holes <b>40</b> may be provided.

The first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> may be formed, for example, by laying an organic adhesive (such as resin) having a leveling property, and therefore contains a lot of moisture. For example, a process of drying the base substrate may be performed prior to fabricating the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b>, and a baking process may be performed to remove most of the moisture after the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> is fabricated. However, some water vapor may still remain after the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> is formed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, when patterning the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b>, a hole may be dug at a position corresponding to the drain electrode <b>26</b> (or source electrode), to form the second via hole <b>80</b> for electrically connecting the first conductive layer <b>30</b> and the drain source <b>26</b> in a subsequent step.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> shows the step of fabricating the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b>, that is, step S<b>30</b>. The first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> mainly functions to protect the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> from being damaged or peeled off by the deposition process of the first conductive layer when the first conductive layer (for example, metal layer) <b>30</b> is subsequently deposited. If a part of the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> is peeled off, the peeled part is a foreign matter in the device and may contaminate the chamber and affect the yield. As an example, a thickness of the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> may be, for example, 50 nm to 100 nm, which is much thinner than the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, when patterning the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b>, the hole is only dug at the position corresponding to the drain electrode <b>26</b> (or source electrode) to form a via hole structure for electrically connecting the first conductive layer <b>30</b> and the drain electrode <b>26</b>, without fabricating a hollow portion for forming the first via hole <b>40</b>. This may prevent the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> from being partially exposed in the subsequent deposition of the first conductive layer due to the formation of the exhaust path, so as to prevent the exposed part of the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> from contaminating the chamber for deposition.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> shows the step of fabricating the first conductive layer <b>30</b>, that is, step S<b>40</b>. In the film layers on the display substrate, the first conductive layer <b>30</b> has a relatively complex structure and may overlap much with a thin film transistor circuit. One of important purposes of providing the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> is to suppress a signal interference between the first conductive layer <b>30</b> and the thin film transistor circuit in other layers. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, when depositing the first conductive layer <b>30</b>, the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> is completely covered by the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> without being exposed, and thus may not contaminate the deposition chamber. In this step S<b>40</b>, a via hole structure (that is, the second via hole <b>70</b>) for electrically connecting the first conductive layer <b>30</b> and the drain source <b>26</b> is formed.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> shows the step of fabricating the second protective layer PVX<b>2</b>, that is, step <b>50</b>. In this step, not only the via hole for electrically connecting the anode layer AN and the first conductive layer <b>30</b> is designed, but also the first via hole <b>40</b> for exhausting the gas released from the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> is formed. Since the first via hole <b>40</b> needs to penetrate the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> and the second protective layer PVX<b>2</b> (for example, at a position <b>43</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>), it is necessary to continuously etch through the two protective layers in step <b>50</b> in order to form the first via hole <b>40</b>. However, it is only needed to etch through the second protective layer PVX<b>2</b> (for example, at a position <b>44</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>) in order to form the via hole electrically connecting the anode layer AN and the first conductive layer <b>30</b>. This means that two depths of etching are required in step <b>50</b>. Then, in order to ensure that both the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> and the second protective layer PVX<b>2</b> are etched away at the position <b>43</b>, there may necessarily have an over-etch amount at the position <b>44</b>. That is, a part of the first conductive layer <b>30</b> may be etched away after the second protective layer PVX<b>2</b> is etched away. This over-etch amount needs to ensure that the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> and the second protective layer PVX<b>2</b> are etched through to form the first via hole <b>40</b>, and further ensure that a good electrical connection between the anode layer AN and the first conductive layer <b>30</b> is not hurt.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Therefore, the thickness of the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> and the thickness of the first conductive layer <b>30</b> need to be set according to characteristics of different materials. For example, it is assumed that the first conductive layer <b>30</b> includes three metal sub-layers sequentially made of titanium, aluminum and titanium. In this case, the above-mentioned over-etch amount needs to ensure that the titanium layer on top of the first conductive layer <b>30</b> is not etched through, otherwise the exposed aluminum layer may be easily oxidized to reduce the electrical connection performance. In some embodiments, the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> and the second protective layer PVX<b>2</b> are made of SiNX or SiO<sub>x</sub>. A gas for etching SiNX or SiO<sub>x </sub>generally has a poor corrosivity to metal titanium, and the over-etch amount may be small. However, in the process of etching the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> and the second protective layer PVX<b>2</b>, the etching process may include a physical atom bombardment, which may cause a damage to a surface of the metal titanium, but in this case, a thickness of 300 angstroms or more of the titanium layer may cope with a conventional over-etch amount of the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b>. As an example, when the thickness of the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> is within 100 nm (such as 50 nm), the electrical connection performance may be ensured as long as the titanium layer has a thickness of 50 nm or more. For another example, when the thickness of the first protective layer PVX<b>1</b> is 150 nm, the electrical connection performance may be ensured as long as the titanium layer has a thickness of 70 nm or more.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some further embodiments, the method may further include step S<b>70</b>, in which an anode layer is formed on a side of the second planarization layer away from the base substrate, where the orthographic projection of the first via hole on the base substrate does not overlap an orthographic projection of the anode layer on the base substrate.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref> shows the steps of forming the second planarization layer PLN<b>2</b>, the anode layer AN and the pixel defining layer PDL. High temperature processes are involved in the process of fabricating the second planarization layer PLN<b>2</b>, the anode layer AN and the pixel defining layer PDL, and these high temperature processes may cause the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> to release gas again. Therefore, the first via hole <b>40</b> is important for these steps. As clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref>, the first via hole <b>40</b> avoids the first conductive layer <b>30</b> and the anode layer AN.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>G</figref> shows a step of forming a luminescent material layer EL, which may be formed on a side of the anode layer AN away from the base substrate <b>10</b>. In the process of fabricating the luminescent material layer EL, the temperature is generally low and typically does not exceed the temperature in the baking process of the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b>. In addition, after a series of previous high-temperature processes, the water vapor in the first planarization layer PLN<b>1</b> is almost eliminated, and the subsequent exhaust may hardly cause a film bubble issue.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> show an alternative example of the method of manufacturing the display substrate according to the embodiments of the present disclosure.
