tracker actuating systems for adjusting the orientation of the solar system to track the location of the sun.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Solar cells and solar panels are most efficient in sunny conditions when oriented towards the sun at a certain angle. Many solar panel systems are designs in combination with solar trackers, which follow the sun's trajectory across the sky from east to west to maximize the electrical generation capabilities of the systems. The relatively low energy produced by a single solar cell requires the use of thousands of solar cells, arranged in an array, to generate enough energy to be usable, for example, as part of an energy grid. As a result, solar trackers have been developed that are quite large, spanning hundreds of feet in length.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Adjusting massive solar trackers requires power to drive the solar array as it follows the sun. As will be appreciated, the greater the load, the greater the amount of power necessary to drive the solar tracker. An additional design constraint of such systems is the rigidity required to accommodate the weight of the solar arrays and at times significant wind loading.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, the torsional excitation caused by wind loading exerts significant force upon the structure for supporting and the mechanisms for articulating the solar tracker. As such, increasing the size and number of components to reduce torsional excitation is required at varying locations along the length of the solar tracker. The present disclosure seeks to address the shortcomings of prior tracker systems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an aspect, this disclosure features a solar tracking system including a solar array.

directed to solar tracking systems and methods for articulating a solar tracking system. The solar tracking system includes a solar array, support beams that support the solar array, a torque tube, which includes a helical portion, coupled to the support beams, a base that rotatably supports the helical portion of the torque tube, and an articulation system that rotates the torque tube relative to the base. The articulation system includes an outer tube, a screw rod, a nut that mates with the screw rod and rotates and translates along a length of the screw rod as the screw rod rotates; an inner tube fixedly coupled between the nut and the torque tube, and a motor that causes the screw rod to rotate. Helical grooves or slots are disposed on an inside portion of the outer tube and respective ridges or ribs are disposed on an outside portion of the nut. The ridges mate with the helical grooves which guide the rotation of the nut as the nut is translated or driven along a length of the screw rod when the screw rod is rotated by the motor.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As can be appreciated, utilizing a torque tube having helical grooves together with the screw drive assembly having an outer tube with helical grooves for guiding the rotation of the nut on the screw rod of the present disclosure decreases the play of the nut on the threads of the screw rod, increases the overall stiffness of the articulation system, and inhibits back-driving of the articulation system due to wind loads or static loads such as wildlife, snow, or other objects. The increases stiffness further enables the various components of the solar tracking system to be optimized, thus reducing the amount of material required and reducing costs.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Aspects of the present disclosure are now described in detail with reference to the drawings in which like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding elements in each of the several views. In the drawings and in the description that follows, terms such as front, rear, upper, lower, top, bottom, and similar directional terms are used simply for convenience of description and are not intended to limit the disclosure. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail to avoid obscuring the present disclosure in unnecessary detail.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, a solar tracking system capable of tracking the location of the sun provided in accordance with the present disclosure is illustrated and generally identified by reference numeral <b>10</b>. The solar tracking system <b>10</b> includes a solar array <b>20</b>, a plurality of support beams <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b></figref>) that are configured to support the solar array <b>20</b>, a plurality of torque tubes <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b></figref>) that are configured to support the plurality of support beams <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b></figref>), a plurality of bases <b>50</b> that are configured to rotatably support the plurality of torque tubes <b>40</b>, and an articulation system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b></figref>) that is configured to rotate the plurality of torque tubes <b>40</b>, and therefore the solar array <b>20</b>, relative to the base <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the articulation system <b>100</b> may be coupled to the South end portion of the solar array <b>20</b>. In other aspects, the articulation system <b>100</b> may be coupled to the North end portion of the solar array <b>20</b>. Coupling the articulation system <b>100</b> to an end portion of the solar array <b>20</b> allows for easy access to the articulation system <b>100</b> and its controller when, for example, cabling is provided to the articulation system <b>100</b> or maintenance is performed on the articulation system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the solar array <b>20</b> includes a plurality of photovoltaic modules <b>22</b>, each of which is mechanically and electrically coupled to one another, although it is contemplated that each photovoltaic module <b>22</b> may be mechanically and/or electrically insulated from one another. In aspects, the photovoltaic modules <b>22</b> may be any suitable photovoltaic module capable of generating electrical energy from sunlight, such as monocrystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, thin-film, etc. The photovoltaic modules <b>22</b> define a top surface <b>22</b><i>a </i>and an opposite, bottom surface <b>22</b><i>b. </i>As can be appreciated, the top surface <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the photovoltaic modules <b>22</b> includes the photovoltaic cells (not shown) while the bottom surface <b>22</b><i>b </i>includes any suitable means for fixedly or selectively coupling the photovoltaic modules <b>22</b> to the plurality of support beams <b>30</b>, such as mechanical fasteners (e.g., bolts, nuts, etc.), adhesives, welding, etc. In aspects, the photovoltaic cells may be disposed within a suitable frame (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>) which includes suitable means for fastening the photovoltaic modules <b>22</b> to the plurality of support beams <b>30</b>. In this manner, the frame may include fastening means on a bottom surface thereof, or clamps or other suitable fasteners (e.g., Z-brackets, C-clamps, angle brackets, etc.) may be utilized to abut a portion of the frame and selectively or fixedly couple the frame to the plurality of support beams <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, each base of the plurality of bases <b>50</b> is substantially similar and, thus, only one base <b>50</b> will be described in detail hereinbelow in the interest of brevity. The base <b>50</b> is shown generally as being an I-beam, although it is contemplated that any suitable type of beam may be used, such as a U-channel, Box tubes, round tubes, etc. Each base <b>50</b> includes a first end portion <b>50</b><i>a </i>that is configured to be anchored in the ground or to a stationary object and a second, opposite end portion <b>50</b><i>b </i>that is configured to selectively or fixedly couple to a portion of the articulation system <b>100</b>, as will be described in further detail hereinbelow. It is contemplated that the base <b>50</b> may be formed from any material suitable for use outdoors and ground contact, such as steel (e.g., galvanized, stainless, etc.), aluminum, composites, polymers, etc.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although generally illustrated as being supported at a geometric center of rotation, it is contemplated that the solar array <b>20</b> may be rotatably supported at a center of mass. In this manner, the mass of the solar array <b>20</b> is balanced about the plurality of bases <b>50</b> and the torque required to rotate the solar array about the plurality of bases remains substantially consistent, with little to no variation in the torque required to articulate the solar array <b>20</b> through its range or motion. As such, the amount of energy required to articulate the solar array <b>20</b> is reduced and the various components required to support the solar array <b>20</b> may be substantially similar (e.g., no need to design certain components to take a larger load than others), thereby reducing design time and reducing the number of differing components in the solar tracking system <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the torque tube <b>40</b> includes a first linear portion <b>40</b><i>a, </i>a helical portion <b>104</b>, a second linear portion <b>40</b><i>b, </i>and an end portion <b>102</b> along the longitudinal axis A-A. The first and second linear portions <b>40</b><i>a, </i><b>40</b><i>b </i>of the torque tube <b>40</b> define a generally rectangular profile, although it is contemplated that the first and second linear portions <b>40</b><i>a, </i><b>40</b><i>b </i>of the torque tube <b>40</b> may define any suitable profile capable of transmitting torque to the solar array <b>20</b>, such as square, oval, hexagon, hexalobe, etc.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some aspects, the helical portion <b>104</b> may be a separate helical torque tube and the first and second linear portions <b>40</b><i>a, </i><b>40</b><i>b </i>may be first and second linear torque tubes, respectively. Accordingly, the helical torque tube may selectively or fixedly engage the first and second linear torque tubes. It is contemplated that first and second torque tubes may be coupled to respective end portions of the helical tube using any suitable means, such as fasteners, friction fit, adhesives, welding, etc.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The articulation system <b>100</b> according to aspects of the present disclosure includes the helical portion <b>104</b> of the torque tube <b>40</b>, a support structure <b>110</b>, an active articulation system <b>140</b> including a screw drive assembly, and a passive articulation system <b>160</b>. The helical portion <b>104</b> follows a helical arc wound about the longitudinal axis A-A such that the helical portion <b>104</b> completes approximately one revolution (e.g., twisted approximately 90 degrees over its length). In one non-limiting aspect, the helical portion <b>104</b> may define a helical arc that is wound about the longitudinal axis A-A approximately 100 degrees, although it is envisioned that the helical portion <b>104</b> may complete any number of revolutions (e.g., greater or less than one revolution) depending upon the installation needs of the solar tracking system <b>10</b>. As can be appreciated, the pitch of the helical portion <b>104</b> (e.g., the length over which the helical portion <b>104</b> completes one revolution) determines the amount of force required to translate, and thereby rotate, the helical portion <b>104</b> through a respective support cam, as will be described in further detail hereinbelow. As such, the pitch of the helical portion <b>104</b> may be adjusted and/or optimized to require smaller or larger motors, components, etc. In this manner, a larger pitch (e.g., longer helical portion <b>104</b>) would require less force to cause rotation of the torque tube <b>40</b>. However, the limited space in which the articulation system <b>100</b> may be placed in the solar tracker system <b>10</b> limits the length of the pitch, and in one non-limiting aspect, the pitch utilized causes the torque tube <b>40</b> to rotate approximately 100 degrees over a length of approximately 35 inches.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The support structure <b>110</b> is disposed at one of the ends of the solar array <b>20</b> and includes a horizontal beam <b>112</b> and a vertical beam <b>114</b>. It is contemplated that the horizontal beam <b>112</b> and the vertical beam <b>114</b> may be any suitable beam, such as an I-beam, C-channel, box tube, circular tube, etc. In non-limiting aspects, the horizontal beam <b>112</b> and the vertical beam <b>114</b> may be the same type of beam or different beams. The horizontal beam <b>112</b> is selectively or fixedly coupled to the base <b>50</b> using any suitable means, and in one non-limiting aspect is coupled to the base <b>50</b> by shear plates. The vertical beam <b>114</b> is selectively or fixedly coupled to the horizontal beam <b>112</b> using any suitable means, and in one non-limiting aspect is coupled to the horizontal beam <b>112</b> by shear plates. Aspects of the solar tracker system <b>10</b> of this disclosure may incorporate one or more features of the torque tube, the support structure, and the passive articulation system disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 16/002,273, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the active articulation system <b>140</b> includes an electric motor <b>502</b>, a mount assembly <b>504</b>, an outer tube <b>506</b>, a sleeve <b>508</b>, and a torque tube connector <b>510</b> fixedly coupled to the sleeve <b>508</b> via fastener <b>708</b>. In aspects, the fastener <b>708</b> may include or be replaced by a rivet, an adhesive, a weld, or any other suitable means for fixedly coupling the torque tube connector <b>510</b> to the sleeve <b>508</b>. The mount assembly <b>504</b> is used to mount the electric motor <b>502</b> to the power screw driver assembly and to mount the power screw driver assembly on the support structure <b>110</b>. The torque tube connector <b>510</b> is coupled to the end portion <b>102</b> of the torque tube <b>40</b>. In some non-limiting aspects, the torque tube connector <b>510</b> is a hollow tube having the same general shape as the end portion <b>102</b> of the torque tube <b>40</b> and having a size greater than the size of the end portion <b>102</b> so that the torque tube connector <b>510</b> and the end portion of the torque tube <b>40</b> can mate together and be fastened together using any suitable means, e.g., through welding or using nuts and bolts.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the articulation system <b>100</b> in an extended state where the torque tube <b>40</b> is positioned such that the tube support <b>120</b> supports the torque tube <b>40</b> between the helical portion <b>104</b> and the second linear portion <b>40</b><i>b. </i><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates the articulation system <b>100</b> in a retracted state where the torque tube <b>40</b> is positioned such that the tube support <b>120</b> supports the torque tube <b>40</b> between the helical portion <b>104</b> and the first linear portion <b>40</b><i>a. </i>As the articulation system <b>100</b> retracts from the extended state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) to the fully retracted state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), the sleeve <b>508</b> slides over the outer tube <b>506</b>. In other words, the outer tube <b>506</b> telescopes into the sleeve <b>508</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is a side view of the drive assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, shown in a retracted position.

The helical ridges <b>716</b> and grooves <b>718</b> may complete approximately one revolution. For example, the helical ridges <b>716</b> and grooves <b>718</b> may be twisted approximately 90 to 100 degrees over the length of the outer tube <b>506</b>. Although it is envisioned that the helical ridges <b>716</b> and grooves <b>718</b> may complete any number of revolutions (e.g., greater or less than one revolution) depending upon the installation needs of the solar tracking system <b>10</b>. In aspects, the number of revolutions of the helical ridges <b>716</b> and grooves <b>718</b> matches or is approximately equal to the number of revolutions of the helical portion <b>104</b> of the torque tube <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref> is a partial cross-sectional, side view of the drive assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, illustrating the screw drive subassembly. The screw drive subassembly includes a lead screw or screw rod <b>728</b> having a non-threaded portion <b>728</b><i>a </i>and a threaded portion <b>728</b><i>b. </i>The threaded portion <b>728</b><i>b </i>of the screw rod <b>728</b> may define any suitable threadform (e.g., square, trapezoidal, buttress, etc.) capable of supporting and transmitting large loads, although other threadforms are also contemplated, such as triangular threadforms (e.g., uniform thread standard, etc.). In aspects, the screw rod <b>728</b> may be a ball screw, a glidescrew, a leadscrew, etc. In one non-limiting aspect, the threaded portion <b>728</b><i>b </i>of the screw rod <b>728</b> defines a trapezoidal threadform such as an acme threadform and may have self-locking or anti-backdrive properties sufficient to inhibit the screw rod <b>728</b> from rotating under the static weight of the solar array <b>20</b> and the support beams <b>30</b> (e.g., the static weight of the solar array <b>20</b> and the support beams <b>30</b> applies a torque to the torque tube <b>40</b>, which may generate an axial force on the screw rod <b>728</b>). Additionally, the anti-backdrive properties of the screw rod <b>728</b> inhibit the screw rod <b>728</b> from rotating when an external force is applied to the solar tracking system <b>10</b>, such as wind, snow, wildlife, etc.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The screw drive assembly also includes a nut <b>726</b> with a threaded inner surface that mates with the threaded portion of the rod <b>728</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>D and <b>7</b>E</figref>, the nut <b>726</b> includes a first portion <b>726</b><i>a </i>having a larger diameter than a second portion <b>726</b><i>b. </i>The outer surface of the first portion <b>726</b><i>a </i>of the nut <b>726</b> includes grooves <b>816</b> and ridges <b>818</b> that mate with ridges <b>716</b> and grooves <b>718</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The non-threaded portion <b>728</b><i>a </i>of the rod <b>728</b> is coupled to a shaft of the electric motor <b>502</b>. Thus, when the electric motor is activated to cause the shaft to rotate in a first direction, the rotating threaded portion <b>728</b><i>b </i>of the rod <b>728</b> applies a force to the threads of the nut <b>726</b> to cause the nut <b>726</b> to translate to the right while the helical ridges <b>716</b> and grooves <b>718</b> of the outer tube <b>506</b> cause the nut <b>726</b> to also rotate. The helical ridges <b>716</b> and grooves <b>718</b> of the outer tube <b>506</b> may cause the nut <b>726</b> to rotate in the first direction (e.g., a clockwise direction) or in a second different direction (e.g., a counter-clockwise direction) when the nut <b>726</b> translates to the right. When the electric motor is activated to cause the shaft to rotate in the second direction, the rotating threaded portion <b>728</b><i>b </i>of the rod <b>728</b> causes the nut <b>726</b> to translate to the left while the helical ridges <b>716</b> and grooves <b>718</b> of the outer tube <b>506</b> cause the nut <b>726</b> to also rotate.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>F and <b>7</b>G</figref>, the screw drive assembly also includes an inner arm tube or inner tube <b>730</b> having a first end portion <b>731</b> and a second end portion <b>732</b>. The first end portion <b>731</b> of the inner tube <b>730</b> is coupled to the second portion <b>726</b><i>b </i>of the nut <b>726</b>. For example, the first end portion <b>731</b> of the inner tube <b>730</b> may be fastened to the second portion <b>726</b><i>b </i>of the nut <b>726</b> via the apertures or holes <b>820</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>E</figref>) in the second portion <b>726</b><i>b </i>using a fastener, e.g., a bolt. The second end portion <b>732</b> of the inner tube <b>730</b> is coupled to the torque tube connector <b>510</b>. Thus, translation and rotation of the nut <b>726</b> causes the torque tube connector <b>510</b> to translate and rotate via the nut <b>726</b> applying a translation and rotation force to the inner tube <b>730</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>C</figref>, when the drive assembly is in the fully retracted state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> and the electric motor <b>502</b> rotates the screw rod <b>728</b> in a first direction, the nut <b>726</b> translates to the right and rotates clockwise, thus causing the inner tube <b>730</b> and the torque tube connector <b>510</b> to translate to the right and rotate clockwise. In this manner, the drive assembly extends from a fully retracted state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, to a partially extended state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, to a fully extended state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>. In aspects, as the drive assembly extends from the fully retracted state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> to the fully extended state shown in FIG. <b>8</b>C, the torque tube connector <b>510</b> rotates from a first angle <b>802</b> with respect to the vertical axis <b>801</b>, to a vertical position <b>804</b>, to a second angle <b>806</b> with respect to the vertical axis <b>801</b>, which drives the rotation of the torque tube <b>40</b>, and thus the solar array <b>20</b>. The first and second angles <b>802</b>, <b>806</b> may be any angles suitable for producing electricity by the solar array <b>20</b> as the sun travels East to West. The first and second angles <b>802</b>, <b>806</b> may be angles that maximize the production of electricity by the solar array <b>20</b>. In one aspect, the first angle is &#x2212;45 degrees and the second angle is +45 degrees.

In this manner, the drive assembly retracts from a fully extended state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>, to a partially extended or partially retracted state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, to a fully retracted state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref> show a double roller bearing assembly including a first roller bearing assembly <b>901</b> and a second roller bearing assembly <b>902</b> disposed around the non-threaded portion <b>728</b><i>a </i>of the screw rod <b>728</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>).
