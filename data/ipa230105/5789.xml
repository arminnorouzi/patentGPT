Obviously, the described embodiments are only a part of the embodiments of the disclosure, but not all of them. Based on the embodiments in the disclosure, all other embodiments obtained by those skilled in the art without any creative effort shall fall within the protection scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the embodiments of the disclosure, the term &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used to mean &#x201c;serving as an example, embodiment, or illustration&#x201d;. Any embodiment described as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; need not be construed as being superior or better than other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The terms &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; in the text cannot be understood as indicating or implying relative importance or implicitly indicating the number of indicated technical features, but are only used for descriptive objectives. Thus, the features defining &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; may explicitly or implicitly include one or more of the features. In the description of the embodiments of the disclosure, unless otherwise specified, &#x201c;multiple&#x201d; means two or more.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Hereinafter, some terms in the embodiments of the disclosure will be explained to facilitate the understanding of those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">(1) High selectivity ratio: selectivity ratio refers to the how much faster the etching rate of a material is compared to another material under the same etching conditions, which is defined as the ratio of the etching rate of the etched material to that of another material. High selectivity means that only the layer of material, which is desired to be etched, is etched. A high-selectivity etching process does not etch the lower layer of material (the etching stops when the etching reaches the appropriate depth) and the protective photoresist is not etched.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">(2) Annealing: annealing is a metal thermal treatment process, which refers to slowly heating the metal to a certain temperature, keeping the temperature for enough time, and then cooling the metal at an appropriate speed. The objective is to reduce hardness, improving machinability; reduce residual stress, stabilizing size and reducing the deformation and crack tendency; refine grain and adjust structure, eliminating structure defects. To be precise, annealing is a heat treatment process for materials, including metal materials and non-metal materials.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">(3) Thermal expansion coefficient: the object expands and contracts due to temperature changes. Its change ability is expressed by the change of the length value caused by the unit temperature change under equal pressure (p is constant), that is, the coefficient of thermal expansion. The thermal expansion coefficient of each object is different, and the unit of thermal expansion coefficient of general metal is 1/degree (Celsius).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a process of manufacturing TSV, it is usually necessary to grind until the copper layer is exposed. In this process, both silicon and copper materials need to be ground simultaneously. Nevertheless, the material of silicon is relatively fragile and is prone to crack. However, under the conditions of high temperature and electric field, copper can easily diffuse into the semiconductor silicon wafer, and the phenomenon of copper contamination to the surface or cracks of the nearby silicon layer is likely to occur, resulting in low yield.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Various embodiments of the present disclosure provide a semiconductor device and a manufacturing method thereof, which avoids copper contamination on the surface of the side silicon layer or cracks in the process of manufacturing TSV, resulting in low yield. The method includes: providing a semiconductor base, where a first medium layer is formed on a first surface; patterning the first medium layer to form a groove extending along the base in the base; forming a first auxiliary layer and a first metal layer sequentially in the groove, where the first metal layer is located on the side of the first auxiliary layer towards the first medium layer; thinning the base on the second surface of the base to expose the first auxiliary layer; removing the first auxiliary layer to form a first opening; and forming a second metal layer on the second surface of the base, where the second metal layer fills the first opening. In the method, the first auxiliary layer is first filled at the bottom of the groove after the groove is formed. Since the depth of the groove will not be exactly the same, when thinning of the base is subsequently performed on the second surface of the base until the first auxiliary layer is exposed, the case in which the grinding reaches the substrate and the first metal layer at the same time to cause cracks in the substrate will not occur, which can prevent copper contamination to the surface or cracks of the nearby silicon layer, thereby improving the yield of TSV manufacturing.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a flowchart of a manufacturing method of a semiconductor device provided by an embodiment of the disclosure.
