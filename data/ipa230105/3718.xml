Also provided herein, in certain embodiments, are methods of screening or identifying an inhibitor of IL1&#x3b1;.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Inflammation is a common pathogenesis of many diseases, including cardiovascular and bowel diseases, diabetes, arthritis, and cancer. Inflammation is a biological response of the immune system that can be triggered by a variety of factors, including pathogens, damaged cells and toxic compounds. These factors may induce acute and/or chronic inflammatory responses in the heart, pancreas, liver, kidney, lung, brain, intestinal tract and reproductive system, potentially leading to tissue damage or disease. Chen et al., Oncotarget. 9(6): 7204-7218 (2018).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In response to tissue injury, the body initiates a chemical signaling cascade that stimulates responses aimed at healing affected tissues. These signals activate leukocyte chemotaxis from the general circulation to sites of damage. Id.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">IL1&#x3b1; is a cytokine of the interleukin 1 family that is encoded by the IL1A gene in humans. In general, Interleukin 1 is responsible for the production of inflammation. IL1&#x3b1; inhibitors are being developed to interrupt those processes and treat diseases. Blocking the activity of IL1&#x3b1; has the potential to treat various diseases or conditions including skin diseases such as acne. See, e.g., Valente Duarte de Sousa, Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs. 23 (10): 1389-410 (2014).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a need in the art to assess effects (including a pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetic effect) of IL1&#x3b1; inhibitors as well as identifying additional IL1&#x3b1; inhibitors for therapeutic or other uses.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">3.

Definitions</p><p id="p-0127" num="0148">As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the terms &#x201c;treat,&#x201d; &#x201c;treating,&#x201d; and &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; refer to an action that occurs while a patient is suffering from a disease or disorder (e.g., such as a disease or disorder related to inflammation), which reduces the severity of the disease or disorder or retards or slows the progression of the disease or disorder.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0149">The term &#x201c;responsiveness&#x201d; or &#x201c;responsive&#x201d; when used in reference to a treatment refers to the degree of effectiveness of the treatment in lessening or decreasing the symptoms of a disease or disorder being treated. An improvement in a disease or disorder can be characterized as a complete or partial response. &#x201c;Complete response&#x201d; refers to an absence of clinically detectable disease with normalization of any previously abnormal measurements. &#x201c;Partial response&#x201d; refers to at least about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, or about 90% decrease in any measurable parameters of a disease or disorder.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0150">As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the term &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; of a compound is an amount sufficient to provide a therapeutic benefit in the treatment or management of a disease or disorder, or to delay or minimize one or more symptoms associated with the presence of the disease or disorder. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound means an amount of therapeutic agent, alone or in combination with other therapies, which provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment or management of the disease or disorder. The term &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; can encompass an amount that improves overall therapy, reduces or avoids symptoms or causes of the disease or disorder, or enhances the therapeutic efficacy of another therapeutic agent. The term also refers to the amount of a compound that is sufficient to elicit the biological or medical response of a biological molecule (e.g., a protein, enzyme, RNA, or DNA), cell, tissue, system, animal, or human, which is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor, or clinician.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0151">The term &#x201c;likelihood&#x201d; generally refers to an increase in the probability of an event. The term &#x201c;likelihood&#x201d; when used in reference to the effectiveness of a patient response can mean the increase of indicators, such as mRNA or protein expression, that may evidence an increase in the progress in treating a disease or disorder.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0152">The term &#x201c;predict&#x201d; generally means to determine or tell in advance. When used to &#x201c;predict&#x201d; the effectiveness or responsiveness of a treatment, for example, the term &#x201c;predict&#x201d; can mean that the likelihood of the outcome of the treatment can be determined at the outset, before the treatment has begun, or before the treatment period has progressed substantially.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0153">The term &#x201c;monitor,&#x201d; as used herein, generally refers to the overseeing, supervision, regulation, watching, tracking, or surveillance of an activity. For example, the term &#x201c;monitoring the response of a subject to a treatment&#x201d; refers to tracking the effectiveness or responsiveness in treating a disease or disorder in a patient. The monitoring can be performed, for example, by following the expression of mRNA or protein biomarkers.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0154">A &#x201c;biological marker&#x201d; or &#x201c;biomarker&#x201d; is a substance whose detection indicates a particular biological state, such as, for example, the responsiveness to a treatment. In some embodiments, biomarkers can be determined individually. In other embodiments, several biomarkers can be measured simultaneously. In some embodiments, a &#x201c;biomarker&#x201d; indicates a change in the level of mRNA expression that may correlate with the progression of a disease, or with the susceptibility of the disease to a given treatment. In some embodiments, the biomarker is a nucleic acid, such as mRNA or cDNA. In additional embodiments, a &#x201c;biomarker&#x201d; indicates a change in the level of polypeptide or protein expression that may correlate with the risk or progression of a disease, or patient's susceptibility to treatment. In some embodiments, the biomarker can be a polypeptide or protein, or a fragment thereof. The relative level of specific proteins can be determined by methods known in the art. For example, antibody based methods, such as an immunoblot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or other methods can be used.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0155">The terms &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; and &#x201c;protein,&#x201d; as used interchangeably herein, refer to a polymer of three or more amino acids in a serial array, linked through peptide bonds. The term &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; includes proteins, protein fragments, protein analogues, oligopeptides, and the like. The term &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; as used herein can also refer to a peptide. The amino acids making up the polypeptide may be naturally derived, or may be synthetic. The polypeptide can be purified from a biological sample. The polypeptide, protein, or peptide also encompasses modified polypeptides, proteins, and peptides, e.g., glycopolypeptides, glycoproteins, or glycopeptides; or lipopolypeptides, lipoproteins, or lipopeptides.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0156">The term &#x201c;expressed&#x201d; or &#x201c;expression&#x201d; as used herein refers to the transcription from a gene to give an RNA nucleic acid molecule at least complementary in part to a region of one of the two nucleic acid strands of the gene. The term &#x201c;expressed&#x201d; or &#x201c;expression&#x201d; as used herein also refers to the translation from the RNA molecule to give a protein, a polypeptide, or a portion thereof.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0157">The term &#x201c;expression level&#x201d; refers to the amount, accumulation, or rate of a biomarker molecule or a gene set. An expression level can be represented, for example, by the amount or the rate of synthesis of a messenger RNA (mRNA) encoded by a gene, the amount or the rate of synthesis of a polypeptide or protein encoded by a gene, or the amount or the rate of synthesis of a biological molecule accumulated in a cell or biological fluid. The term &#x201c;expression level&#x201d; refers to an absolute amount of a molecule in a sample or a relative amount of the molecule, determined under steady-state or non-steady-state conditions.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0158">An mRNA that is &#x201c;upregulated&#x201d; is generally increased upon a given treatment or condition, or in certain patient groups. An mRNA that is &#x201c;downregulated&#x201d; generally refers to a decrease in the level of expression of the mRNA in response to a given treatment or condition, or in certain patient groups. In some situations, the mRNA level can remain unchanged upon a given treatment or condition. An mRNA from a patient sample can be &#x201c;upregulated&#x201d; when treated with a drug, as compared to a non-treated control. This upregulation can be, for example, an increase of about 5%, about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 100%, about 200%, about 300%, about 500%, about 1,000%, about 5,000%, or more of the comparative control mRNA level.

Exemplary fluorescent dyes include, but are not limited to, xanthene dyes, fluorescein dyes (e.g., fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM), 6 carboxy-2&#x2032;,4&#x2032;,7&#x2032;,4,7-hexachlorofluorescein (HEX), 6-carboxy-4&#x2032;,5&#x2032;-dichloro-2&#x2032;,7&#x2032;-dimethoxyfluorescein (JOE)), rhodamine dyes (e.g., rhodamine 110 (R110), N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine (TAMRA), 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX), 5-carboxyrhodamine 6G (R6G5 or G5), 6-carboxyrhodamine 6G (R6G6 or G6)), cyanine dyes (e.g., Cy3, Cy5 and Cy7), Alexa dyes (e.g., Alexa-fluor-555), coumarin, Diethylaminocoumarin, umbelliferone, benzimide dyes (e.g., Hoechst 33258), phenanthridine dyes (e.g., Texas Red), ethidium dyes, acridine dyes, carbazole dyes, phenoxazine dyes, porphyrin dyes, polymethine dyes, BODIPY dyes, quinoline dyes, Pyrene, Fluorescein Chlorotriazinyl, eosin dyes, Tetramethylrhodamine, Lissamine, Napthofluorescein, and the like.</p><p id="p-0432" num="0453">In some embodiments, the mRNA sequences comprise at least one mRNA of a biomarker provided herein.</p><p id="p-0433" num="0454">The nucleic acids may be present in specific, addressable locations on a solid support, each corresponding to at least a portion of mRNA sequences that are differentially expressed upon treatment of a compound in a cell or a patient.</p><p id="p-0434" num="0455">A typical mRNA assay method can contain the steps of 1) obtaining surface-bound subject probes; 2) hybridizing a population of mRNAs to the surface-bound probes under conditions sufficient to provide for specific binding; (3) post-hybridization washing to remove nucleic acids not specifically bound to the surface-bound probes; and (4) detecting the hybridized mRNAs. The reagents used in each of these steps and their conditions for use may vary depending on the particular application.</p><p id="p-0435" num="0456">Hybridization can be carried out under suitable hybridization conditions, which may vary in stringency as desired. Typical conditions are sufficient to produce probe/target complexes on a solid surface between complementary binding members, i.e., between surface-bound subject probes and complementary mRNAs in a sample. In certain embodiments, stringent hybridization conditions may be employed.</p><p id="p-0436" num="0457">Hybridization is typically performed under stringent hybridization conditions. Standard hybridization techniques (e.g., under conditions sufficient to provide for specific binding of target mRNAs in the sample to the probes) are described in Kallioniemi et al., Science 1992, 258:818-821 and International Patent Application Publication No. WO 93/18186. Several guides to general techniques are available, e.g., Tijssen, <i>Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes, </i>Parts I and II (Elsevier, Amsterdam 1993). For descriptions of techniques suitable for in situ hybridizations, see Gall et al., <i>Meth. Enzymol. </i>1981, 21:470-480; Angerer et al., <i>Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods, </i>Vol 7, pgs 43-65 (Plenum Press, New York, Setlow and Hollaender, eds. 1985). Selection of appropriate conditions, including temperature, salt concentration, polynucleotide concentration, hybridization time, stringency of washing conditions, and the like will depend on experimental design, including source of sample, identity of capture agents, degree of complementarity expected, etc., and may be determined as a matter of routine experimentation for those of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0437" num="0458">Those of ordinary skill will readily recognize that alternative but comparable hybridization and wash conditions can be utilized to provide conditions of similar stringency.</p><p id="p-0438" num="0459">After the mRNA hybridization procedure, the surface bound polynucleotides are typically washed to remove unbound nucleic acids. Washing may be performed using any convenient washing protocol, where the washing conditions are typically stringent, as described above. The hybridization of the target mRNAs to the probes is then detected using standard techniques.</p><p id="p-0439" num="0460">Other methods, such as PCR-based methods, can also be used to detect the expression of a biomarker provided herein. Examples of PCR methods can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,927,024, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Examples of RT-PCR methods can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 7,122,799, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. A method of fluorescent in situ PCR is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,186,507, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0440" num="0461">In some embodiments, quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) can be used for both the detection and quantification of RNA targets (Bustin et al., <i>Clin. Sci. </i>2005, 109:365-379). Quantitative results obtained by qRT-PCR are generally more informative than qualitative data. Thus, in some embodiments, qRT-PCR-based assays can be useful to measure mRNA levels during cell-based assays. The qRT-PCR method is also useful to monitor patient therapy. Examples of qRT-PCR-based methods can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,101,663, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0441" num="0462">In contrast to regular reverse transcriptase-PCR and analysis by agarose gels, qRT-PCR gives quantitative results. An additional advantage of qRT-PCR is the relative ease and convenience of use. Instruments for qRT-PCR, such as the Applied Biosystems 7500, are available commercially, so are the reagents, such as TaqMan&#xae; Sequence Detection Chemistry. For example, TaqMan&#xae; Gene Expression Assays can be used, following the manufacturer's instructions. These kits are pre-formulated gene expression assays for rapid, reliable detection and quantification of human, mouse, and rat mRNA transcripts. An exemplary qRT-PCR program, for example, is 50&#xb0; C. for 2 minutes, 95&#xb0; C. for 10 minutes, 40 cycles of 95&#xb0; C. for 15 seconds, then 60&#xb0; C. for 1 minute.</p><p id="p-0442" num="0463">To determine the cycle number at which the fluorescence signal associated with a particular amplicon accumulation crosses the threshold (referred to as the C<sub>T</sub>), the data can be analyzed, for example, using 7500 Real-Time PCR System Sequence Detection software vs. using the comparative C<sub>T </sub>relative quantification calculation method. Using this method, the output is expressed as a fold-change of expression levels. In some embodiments, the threshold level can be selected to be automatically determined by the software. In some embodiments, the threshold level is set to be above the baseline but sufficiently low to be within the exponential growth region of an amplification curve.</p><p id="p-0443" num="0464">Other methods, such as RNA sequencing-based methods, can also be used to detect the expression of a biomarker provided herein. In certain embodiments, the RNA expression profile of biomarkers is measured by high-throughput sequencing (e.g., whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA sequencing or RNAseq)).

IL1&#x3b1;, a member of the IL1 family of cytokines, is a potent inflammatory cytokine that is released early during the inflammatory response and function to further activate the process. IL1&#x3b1; has also been recently shown to mediate the skin injury induced inflammatory response (SID 2019 Abstract/Poster, MJ Turner, Indiana U). In this example, expression of IL1&#x3b1; was shown elevated in ex vivo skin biopsy explant-based assay. In summary, skin biopsies were obtained from healthy piece of skin and were cultured ex vivo (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, level of IL1&#x3b1; was elevated in culture supernatant of skin biopsy explant cultured ex vivo for 4 hours or 24 hours following skin injury (induced by biopsy procedure).</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">6.2.

Briefly, skin biopsies were obtained from healthy piece of skin and were cultured ex vivo with or without anti-IL1&#x3b1; antibody (R&#x26;D, clone 4414). The readouts to monitor inflammatory response were gene expression level in skin biopsy and cytokine level in the culture supernatant. The effects of using different biopsy size to set up the ex vivo biopsy explant culture model were evaluated. While larger skin biopsy is preferred from experimental purpose (increased cytokine secretion level with larger skin biopsy), small skin biopsy is preferred for clinical implementation. To assess the impact of skin biopsy size on the ability to measure effects of IL1&#x3b1; blockade, 3 mm, 4 mm and 6 mm skin biopsy were compared. Luminex analysis of the culture supernatant showed that the level of GCSF, CXCL1, IL6 and IL8 were very low in control (data not shown), were elevated following 4 hours of culture and were significantly reduced by treatment with anti-IL1&#x3b1; antibody (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). While treatment with anti-IL1&#x3b1; antibody significantly reduced cytokine level in all the biopsy size evaluated, the dynamic range (difference between 4 hr and 4 hr+anti-IL1&#x3b1;) was much smaller in 3 mm biopsy size. On the other hand, the range was larger and was similar between 4 mm and 6 mm biopsy size. Thus, 4 mm biopsy size was used in the subsequent development of the assay.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">6.3.

To evaluate the effects of lidocaine injection on the ex vivo biopsy explant culture model, experiments were set up utilizing skin that has been injected with 1 mL of 1% lidocaine or with 1 mL of PBS (control). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the result suggested that lidocaine can potentially impact the ability of anti-IL1&#x3b1; to reduce level of cytokines in culture supernatant, including GCSF, CXCL1 and IL8 at 4-hour time point; % reduction by anti-IL1&#x3b1; in the lidocaine group showed a trend of being lower compared to the PBS group (though not statistically significant). However, similar % reduction by anti-IL1&#x3b1; treatment was observed in both groups at 24-hour time point.

Culture supernatant were collected for cytokines measurement while the skin biopsies were used for gene expression analysis. Luminex analysis of the culture supernatant showed the induction of various cytokines following 24 hour of culture (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>) and that treatment with anti-IL1&#x3b1; can reduce the level of a subset of cytokines (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>).

Bermekimab was tested at various doses (10000, 1000, 100, 10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01 ng/mL; no lidocaine injection was used in this experiment). Commercially available anti-IL1a from R&#x26;D (clone 4414, 10 ug/mL) that was utilized to establish the assay and in the studies described above was also included in this experiment. Culture supernatant were collected for cytokines measurement using Luminex while the skin biopsies were used for gene expression analysis in Nanostring. Measurement of cytokine level in the supernatant showed that bermekimab can reduce the level of GCSF, CXCL1, IL6 and IL8 in a dose responsive manner (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>), and the corresponding IC50 values were calculated. While bermekimab can also reduce the level of IL6, IC50 values can be calculated only in 1 out of the 3 donors evaluated.

Assessing the pattern of gene expression and protein production in the skin biopsies allows measurement of PD effect of bermekimab or anakinra (which serves as a positive control) on molecular events that have an established dependence on IL-1&#x3b1;. At each skin biopsy collection visit, one skin biopsy is processed immediately as per skin biopsy lab manual and the second skin biopsy is cultured ex vivo for 24 hours to establish the stimulation baseline for each participant (the stimulus is the skin biopsy procedure itself). The third and fourth skin biopsies are collected after bermekimab administration and 1 skin biopsy specimen is processed immediately as per skin biopsy laboratory manual and the second skin biopsy specimen is cultured ex vivo for 24 hours. The effects of bermekimab or anakinra dosing on gene and protein expression patterns induced as a result of the tissue injury from the skin biopsy collection procedure are determined by comparing changes relative to baseline in predefined gene expression signatures and secreted proteins in the supernatants.
