APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0086431, filed Jul. 1, 2021, which application is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a sealing device of a closure module for a vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are several types of doors for vehicles. Examples of the doors may include a swing type that is mainly applied to a car, a sliding type that is mainly applied to a medium-sized van, and a hatchback type that is mainly applied to a tail door of a van or an RV vehicle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, as a future mobility for extending a life space, a PBV (Purpose Built Vehicle) that is a purpose based mobility is emerging. For example, when PBVs forming shoe stores or clothing stores are docked with a hub, the hub becomes a shopping center. The expandability of functions and designs is considerably large according to the purpose of the PBV. The PBV is neither public transport such as a bus nor a personal car, but is a new type of mobility. The PBV is utilized as a flexible space in which the purpose of the hub itself is changed depending on the purpose of the PBV that is docked with the hub.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For higher utilization of the PBV, a frame structure capable of changing a door type according to the purpose is required. For instance, when there is a space restriction such as when only a passenger gets off or a ceiling is low, it is necessary to apply a sliding type door or an opposing type door. On the other hand, in the case of loading bulky luggage, it is necessary to apply a door type that widens an opening. Among types of tail doors, a clamshell type door that is split in a middle to be separately opened upwards and downwards requires a smaller force and occupies a smaller rear space as compared to when opening or closing one large tail door. In addition, when both an upper door and a lower door are opened, an opening can be widened, so the clamshell type door is spotlighted.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example of a conventional door sealing structure for a vehicle, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a door sealing structure for a vehicle in which a carrier is eliminated from and tape is applied to the door sealing structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the general vehicle door is equipped with a door weather strip no and a body sealing tube <b>120</b> to seal a gap between the door and a vehicle body. Here, in the case of the body sealing tube <b>120</b> mounted on a roof side panel <b>130</b> of the vehicle body, a carrier <b>140</b> of a steel material or stainless steel material is accommodated to be clamped to a flange of the roof side panel <b>130</b>, or is attached to the flange of the roof side panel <b>130</b> through a tape <b>150</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The door sealing structure of the vehicle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is problematic in that both the body sealing tube <b>120</b> and the door weather strip no are applied, so cost and weight are increased. Further, as the carrier <b>140</b> is used, this causes an increase in weight and cost.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, when the door sealing structure of the vehicle fixes the body sealing tube <b>120</b> to the roof side panel <b>130</b> using the tape <b>150</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a tensile force and a compressive force are generated in the tape <b>150</b> at a corner of the body sealing tube <b>120</b>, so the attaching force of the tape <b>150</b> is reduced, and consequently the body sealing tube <b>120</b> is separated from the tape <b>15</b>o.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">When the length of the tape <b>150</b> increases so as to secure the attaching force of the tape iso, the tensile force and the compressive force generated in the tape <b>150</b> are also increased, so a reduction in the attaching force of the tape <b>150</b> continuously occurs.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, the conventional vehicle door usually clamps the body sealing tube <b>120</b> to the roof side panel <b>130</b> using the carrier <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The foregoing is intended merely to aid in the understanding of the background of the present disclosure, and is not intended to mean that the present disclosure falls within the purview of the related art that is already known to those skilled in the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure relates to a sealing device of a closure module for a vehicle.
