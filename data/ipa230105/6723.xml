Hereinafter, an example where the wireless communication system <b>10</b> uses a cellular network will be mainly described, but it may be understood that example embodiments are not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The wireless communication system <b>10</b> may support unicast, multicast, and/or broadcast, and particularly, the wireless communication system <b>10</b> for supporting multicast and broadcast may be referred to as supporting multicast/broadcast services or multimedia broadcast multicast services (MBMS). For example, unicast transmission may denote transmission provided from a base station <b>12</b> to a terminal (for example, <b>14</b>_<b>1</b>), multicast transmission may denote transmission provided from the base station <b>12</b> to a plurality of terminals of one group (i.e., a multicast group (for example, <b>14</b>)), and broadcast transmission may denote transmission provided from the base station <b>12</b> to a plurality of terminals of a multicast group (for example, <b>14</b>) and a plurality of terminals of another multicast group.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Unicast transmission may be provided based on transmission parameters which are determined to ensure valid reception by a terminal. On the other hand, in a multicast/broadcast service, transmission may be provided based on transmission parameters which are determined to ensure valid receptions by a plurality of terminals, and thus, transmission parameters (for example, a modulation order, a code rate, etc.) may be determined based on a worst channel among channels associated with a plurality of terminals. In the multicast/broadcast service, a plurality of channel conditions formed by the base station <b>12</b> and a plurality of terminals may differ and may be frequently changed. Conventionally, it may be difficult for a base station to efficiently obtain the plurality of channel conditions, thus increasing overhead for determining transmission parameters and reducing the efficiency of the multicast/broadcast service.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In contrast, in one or more example embodiments, the base station <b>12</b>, as described below with reference to the drawings, may simultaneously obtain a plurality of channel conditions, used for determination of transmission parameters in the multicast/broadcast service, on a feedback channel shared by a plurality of terminals, instead of obtaining the channel conditions from the plurality of terminals and may obtain a worst channel condition (i.e., a lowest channel condition). Therefore, the efficiency of the multicast/broadcast service may be considerably enhanced, and particularly, transmission parameters for multicast transmission MC may be determined within a certain time regardless of a variation of the number of terminals included in a multicast group <b>14</b>, which receives the multicast transmission MC.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Hereinafter, in example embodiments, multicast transmission will be mainly described, but it may be understood that example embodiments apply to broadcast transmission.
