As used herein, term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of the related listed items.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the Specification (SPEC) of a DDR4 chip, the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of an ALERT signal output by a command/address parity alert system (C/A Parity Alert) is specified to be between 60 ns and 120 ns. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a parity check alert circuit of a common DDR4 chip. In this circuit design, after an error occurs in the parity check, a PAR_Error_Flag signal may be output to enable a ring oscillator, so that the ring oscillator generates a clock signal CLK having a fixed period of T&#x2032;. Then, according to the SPEC requirements of the tPAR_ALERT_PW, the number of stages N&#x2032; of a counter is determined. Through such circuit design, the parity check alert circuit outputs logic 1 while the PAR_Error_Flag signal is received, and then outputs logic 0 after the counting of the counter ends. The final result is the pulse width of the output ALERT signal tPAR_ALERT_PW=T&#x2032;&#xd7;N&#x2032;, where T&#x2032; is the period of the clock signal generated by the ring oscillator, and N&#x2032; is the number of stages of the counter.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">However, although the pulse width of the ALERT signal output by this circuit design does not change with changes of the operating frequency of the chip, it may change with the change of a process. During manufacturing of semiconductor devices, due to the difference of their positions on the same wafer, or the difference in parameters of field effect transistors thereof between different batches of wafers, different deviations in process may be generated. The process is generally divided into three processes including Slow-Slow (SS) process, Typical-Typical (TT) process, and Fast-Fast (PB) process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is pulse width deviations of an ALERT signal under different processes. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, under the case of a particularly large process variation, the period T&#x2032; of the clock signal CLK generated by the ring oscillator may be very different. For example, in the FF process, the period T&#x2032; of the clock signal CLK generated by the ring oscillator is relatively small, but in the SS process, the period T&#x2032; of the clock signal CLK generated by the ring oscillator is relatively large. As a result, under the magnification of the number of stages N of the counter, the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of the ALERT signal under the SS process easily exceeds the 60 ns-120 ns interval specified by the SPEC, and the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of the ALERT signal under the FF process is also easily smaller than the 60 ns-120 ns interval specified by the SPEC.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For this purpose, the following technical schemes of the embodiments of the present application are proposed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments of the present application provide a signal generating circuit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a structure schematic diagram of a signal generating circuit provided by an embodiment of the present application.

When the flag signal changes from a first level to a second level, the target signal is changed from a third level to a fourth level, and after the target signal maintains the fourth level for a target time length, the target signal is changed from the fourth level to the third level. The generating circuit <b>330</b> is further configured to determine the target time length according to the internal clock signal and the control signal.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Here, the target time length during which the target signal output by the generating circuit <b>330</b> is maintained at the fourth level is the pulse width of the target signal output by the generating circuit <b>330</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the embodiment of the present application, the clock circuit <b>310</b> generates the internal clock signal through external clock information, so that the internal clock signal of the signal generating circuit is not affected by the process. Based on this, the pulse width of the target signal output by the signal generating circuit provided in the embodiment of the present application is not affected by the process.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the embodiment of the present application, the control signal is generated according to the frequency of the external clock signal, and thus the control signal is a signal related to the frequency of the external clock signal. Therefore, when the frequency of the external clock signal (the frequency of the internal clock signal) changes, the control signal may also change accordingly, and thus the pulse width of the target signal may be adjusted through the internal clock signal and the control signal.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further, in the embodiment of the present application, the pulse width of the target signal is adjusted through the internal clock signal and the control signal, so that the pulse width of the target signal is controlled within a certain range, and thus the change of the pulse width of the target signal with the frequency is weakened or eliminated, thereby enabling the pulse width of the target signal to be stable.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Embodiments of the present application provide a signal generating circuit, and the signal generating circuit is configured to generate a target signal and adjust the pulse width of the target signal, so that the target signal is stabilized within a certain range. The signal generating circuit may be widely used in semiconductor memories, such as Double Data Rate 2 (DDR2), DDR3, DDR4, Low Power Double Data Rate 2 (LPDDR2), and LPDDR3, which are listed in detail herein.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments of the present application, the frequency of the external clock signal does not change with variations in temperature and process. Therefore, the pulse width of the target signal in the embodiment of the present application is not affected by the temperature and process.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments of the present application, the flag signal is a check flag signal, and the check flag signal is used to represent a parity check error or a redundancy check error.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments of the present application, the clock circuit <b>310</b> is specifically configured to shield the external clock signal based on the flag signal to generate the internal clock signal.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments of the present application, the clock circuit <b>310</b> includes logic AND gate(s); the logical AND gate is configured to receive the flag signal and the external clock signal to generate the internal clock signal. Specifically, the logic AND gate shields the external clock signal when a check error does not occur based on the flag signal, to generate the internal clock signal. Namely, the internal clock signal is an external clock signal when the check error occurs. Therefore, the power consumption of the generating circuit when it does not need to generate the target signal is reduced. Specifically, when the parity check error does not occur, the logic AND gate may shield the external clock signal, so that no internal clock signal is input to the generating circuit, and thus the power consumption of the generating circuit when it does not need to generate the parity check alert signal may be reduced. In the present application, the frequency of the internal clock signal is the same as the frequency of the external clock signal.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments of the present application, the controlling circuit <b>320</b> includes a mode register <b>321</b> and a calculator <b>322</b>. The mode register <b>321</b> is configured to store a delay (tCCD) between adjacent column address strobe signals, and output a first code to represent the delay tCCD between adjacent column address strobe signals. The calculator <b>322</b> is configured to receive the first code, multiply the first code by a coefficient to output as the control signal. In some embodiments of the present application, the control signal is obtained by multiplying the first code by the coefficient. Here, the first code is a code that represents the delay tCCD between the adjacent column address strobe signals. In a specific example, the mode register <b>321</b> is a Mode Register 6 (MR6) in DDR4.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">CCD is short for CAS to CAS Command Delay, and tCCD is a delay time from Column Access Strobe (CAS) to CAS, which is used to trigger an access operation. The access operation may be, for example, writing or reading operation. In some examples, the delay tCCD from CAS to CAS may be determined before a semiconductor device is manufactured, and may be equal to (BL/2), where BL is a burst length. A single clock period T may be used as a unit for indicating the number of clock periods in the clock signal. In other words, 1T may indicate one clock period of the clock signal. A DDR device usually uses a two-period command, for example, a read command is followed by a CAS command to trigger access. Therefore, tCCD is usually understood as timing between successive access commands Additional bank group (a group of independently or separately addressable memory banks) is achieved in DDR4 so as to improve the performance with respect to tCCD. By using the separate memory bank groups, the access may be performed across the different memory bank groups. Therefore, DDR4 achieves tCCDS and tCCDL timing (where &#x201c;S&#x201d; is short, and &#x201c;L&#x201d; is long). tCCDL is used to access the same memory bank group; and tCCDS is used to access different memory bank groups. tCCDL is greater than or equal to tCCDS. Herein, tCCDL changes according to the frequency of the external clock signal, and tCCDS does not change. In this case, tCCDL and tCCDS may be set differently according to the value of the mode register.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, under the condition that the signal generating circuit is applied to the DDR4 chip, the mode register <b>321</b> is configured to store delay tCCDL between adjacent column address strobe signals, and output a first code L to represent the delay tCCDL between the adjacent column address strobe signals. The calculator <b>322</b> is configured to receive the first code L, and multiply the first code L by a coefficient to output as the control signal. In some embodiments of the present application, the control signal is obtained by multiplying the first code by the coefficient.

Because the setting of tCCDL is increased according to increasing of the frequency of the external clock signal, and the change trend thereof with the frequency of the internal clock signal is opposite to the change trend of the period of the internal clock signal with the frequency of the internal clock signal, so that the control signal generated on the basis of tCCDL may effectively compensate the change of the pulse width of the target signal with the frequency of the internal clock signal.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Here, the coefficient N is an amplification coefficient of the first code L.

When the flag signal changes from the first level to the second level, the counter starts to count the internal clock signal, and after the count value reaches the target value represented by the control signal, the target signal is controlled to change from the fourth level to the third level. When the flag signal is used to represent the parity check error, after the parity check error occurs, the flag signal PAR_Error_Flag is output, and the flag signal PAR_Error_Flag is valid at high level, so that when the flag signal PAR_Error_Flag changes from the low level to the high level, the generating circuit controls the target signal to change from the low level to the high level, and at the same time, the counter starts to count the internal clock signal, and after the count value reaches the target value represented by the control signal, the generating circuit controls the target signal to change from the high level to the low level.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the flag signal is used to represent the parity check error.

Therefore, the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of the parity check alert signal may be adjusted by the signal generating circuit provided in the embodiments of the present application, so that the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of the parity check alert signal is controlled within a certain range, and thus the change of the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of the parity check alert signal with the frequency is weakened or eliminated, thereby enabling the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of the parity check alert signal to be stabilized within the interval specified by the SPEC. It should be noted that the ALERT signal is not a signal that is finally output through an alert_n pin, and the ALERT signal needs to pass through a plurality of inverters or output buffer circuits before it is output to the alert_n pin of the chip. In a specific example, the ALERT signal may be output to the alert_n pin of the chip after passing through an odd number of inverters, so as to guarantee that the alert_n signal output by the alert_n pin is valid at low level.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Here, the stage number of the counter is the target value N&#xd7;L represented by the control signal.

Therefore, the pulse width of the ALERT signal output under the FF process corner and the SS process corner has little changes. That is, under the control of both the internal clock signal and the control signal, the pulse width of the target signal may be controlled within a certain range, and thus the change of the pulse width of the target signal with the frequency of the internal clock signal is weakened or eliminated, so that the pulse width of the target signal is stabilized within the interval specified by SPEC. In some embodiments of the present application, the first level is a low level, the second level is a high level, the third level is a low level, and the fourth level is a high level. Thus, when the flag signal changes from the low level to the high level, the target signal is changed from the low level to the high level, and the target signal changes from the high level to the low level after maintaining the high level for the target time length. Here, the flag signal is a check flag signal, and the check flag signal is valid at high level. When the check flag signal is at the high level, it represents that a check error occurs; and when the check flag signal is at the low level, it represents that no check error occur. In some embodiments of the present application, the target time length is determined according to the period of the internal clock signal and the target value represented by the control signal, and the period of the internal clock signal and the target value represented by the control signal have opposite change trends with respect to the frequency of the internal clock signal, and thus the target time length (the pulse width of the target signal) hardly changes with the change of the frequency of the internal clock signal.
