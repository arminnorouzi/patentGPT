Some customers can enter a store with the intention of purchasing items. Typically, guests enter a store, collect items they wish to purchase, and then proceed to a checkout lane to purchase the items they have collected. Occasionally guests may intentionally or unintentionally leave a store without paying for some items, though. For example, some guests may forget about items that are located underneath other items, such as items located in the bottom of a shopping cart, and may leave the store without processing those items as part of a checkout procedure. In other instances, guests may intentionally leave a store without paying for items, and may take measures to hide their activity, such as concealing items inside of a bag or clothing, or potentially swapping barcodes with other items of lower value so that that the guest goes through the checkout process, but pays for the lower value item identified by the barcode even though they are leaving with the higher value physical item. Leaving a store without paying for the full value of the item may be considered shoplifting or stealing, and may be considered a shortage with regard to inventory levels in stores.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Stores may be equipped with various technology that is capable of providing information on shoppers who leave a store with stolen items. For example, stores may have a camera security system installed that can capture video and/or images of guests who are in stores. A person, such as a security officer, may actively and continuously monitor the camera security system in an attempt to identify potential shortages and/or other security events. As mentioned above, shoplifters can hide their activities so as to avoid detection, which can frustrate efforts of security officers to stop or otherwise prevent such activity.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The document generally describes devices, systems, and methods for generating readily digestible and useful watch lists of guests who pose specific security threats to specific retail environments, such as a store, based on objective observations and determinations based on prior guest activity within retail stores. For example, the disclosed technology can provide for building case files of guests who pose specific security threats, scoring the guests based on their activity, ranking the guests based on their scores, and providing the digestible watch list of ranked guests who pose specific security threats to in-store employees. The watch lists can be used by in-store employees whose jobs are directed to safety and security operations in the retail environment. The watch lists can include a list of the guests who pose the most significant and likely security threat for that particular retail environment, such as guests who have a history of stealing items, getting into physical altercations, and/or other security-related threats within a retail environment. The watch lists can be generating based on a combination of data from different devices and systems.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since the watch list can be culled to a set of the guests who pose the most significant security threat, the in-store employees can more easily digest or remember the customers on the watch list, thereby making their efforts to identify those guests and to mitigate potential future security events involving those guests more effective. For example, the watch list can include a top <b>10</b> guests who pose specific security threats rather than a list of all guests who pose specific security threats. Therefore, the in-store employees can more easily monitor customers in the retail environment and identify the customers that are included in the watch list.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some implementations, the in-store employees can receive an updated watch list every day. The in-store employees can use the updated watch list to monitor customers in the store for that day. The watch list can be dynamically updated based on data and system-based inferences. For example, case files can be generated for each guest who poses a specific security threat that indicate the specific previous activity that guest performed that was deemed to be a security threat (e.g., theft, assault, battery).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A threat score can be assigned to each case file. The threat score can be determined based on a number of factors and data from different devices and systems. For example, the scores can be based on a quantity and/or value of items taken, types of items that are taken, acceleration and/or deceleration of theft, etc. The data can be received from devices such as cameras, POS terminals, etc. The threat score can also be determined based on system-based inferences. For example, a computing system can predict that a particular customer may continue to steal items during a predetermined time period. Accordingly, the threat score can be higher for this guest relative to other guests.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The threat scores can be dynamically updated based on continuous monitoring of the customer. For example, if a particular customer stole items once and did not steal items again over a predetermined period of time, the particular customer's threat score can be reduced. As another example, if a customer continuously steals items over the predetermined period of time, then that customer's threat score can be increased since they present a bigger threat to the retail environment. Customers with higher threat scores, or threat scores within a predetermined threshold range, can be added to the digestible watch list and ranked based on threat score. Accordingly, the in-store employees can focus on monitoring the customers with the highest threat scores in order to prevent such customers from engaging in more activity in the retail environment that poses potential security threats (i.e., theft, assault, battery).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As mentioned above, a watch list can be generated for each retail environment. The watch lists can be annotated with summary videos. The summary videos can include data or other information about the guests who pose specific security threats that can be used by the in-store employees to objectively identify, monitor, and/or intervene with the guests. For example, the summary video can include an image of the guests, their movements, their past actions, and objective identifiers such as credit card numbers. The summary videos can therefore help the in-store employees to better monitor and identify the guests who pose specific security threats if they return to the retail environment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, the disclosed technology can be used proactively to objectively identify guests who pose specific security threats before a security event occurs. Security events can include shoplifting, sweet hearting, other forms of theft, assault, battery, and other security-related disturbances. The disclosed technology can correlate data from a variety of different systems and devices located throughout stores to provide greater analysis and insights regarding security events.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Particular embodiments described herein include a method for generating a watch list of users who pose specific security threats to a store, the method including: retrieving, by a computer system and from a data store, case files associated with a store, each of the case files documenting activity that poses a security threat by a user at the store, predicting, by the computer system and based on applying one or more prediction models to each of the case files, future activity associated with the case file, the prediction models having been trained, using machine learning, to predict future activity based at least in part on a type of activity that poses a security threat documented in the case file, a quantity of stolen items associated with the case file, theft velocity, and a cost of stolen items associated with the case file, determining, by the computer system, a threat score for each of the case files based at least in part on the predicted future activity associated with the case file, ranking, by the computer system, the case files associated with the store into a candidate list from highest threat score to lowest threat score, generating, by the computer system and based on applying one or more culling models to the ranked candidate list, a watch list for the store that includes a subset of the case files in the ranked candidate list, the culling models having been trained, using machine learning, to identify the subset of the case files posing a greatest current threat to the store, the greatest current threat to the store corresponding to a threshold time period, generating, by the computer system, summary videos for each of the subset of the case files in the watch list, and transmitting, by the computer system to a user device, the watch list and the summary videos for presentation in a graphical user interface (GUI) display at the user device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some implementations, the method can optionally include one or more of the following features. For example, the method may also include receiving, by the computer system and from one or more devices in the store, at least one of recent unstructured data and device-based inferences associated with one or more of the case files, adjusting, by the computer system, the threat scores of the one or more case files based on the at least one of recent unstructured data and device-based inferences, and adjusting, by the computer system, the rankings of the case files in the candidate list based on the adjusted threat scores of the one or more case files. The one or more devices in the store can include at least one of a camera, location-based signaling device, RFID reader, and point of sale (POS) terminal. The recent unstructured data can include at least one of a video feed of a user associated with a case file engaging in activity that poses a security threat in the store, location-based coordinates of the user associated with the case file moving throughout the store, location-based coordinates of a shopping cart used by the user while at the store, and a transaction receipt. The device-based inferences can include a presumption, based on the recent unstructured data, that the user associated with the case file recently engaged in new activity that poses a security threat within another threshold time period.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some implementations, adjusting, by the computer system, the threat scores of the one or more case files based on the at least one of recent unstructured data and device-based inferences can include: increasing the threat scores based on the at least one of recent unstructured data and device-based inferences having a threat level indication above a predetermined threshold and decreasing the threat scores based on the at least one of recent unstructured data and device-based inferences having a threat level indication below the predetermined threshold.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As another example, determining, by the computer system, a threat score for each of the case files can include: assigning a threat score above a threshold score value based on determining that the predicted future activity associated with the case file exceeds a threshold suspicion level and assigning a threat score below the threshold score value based on determining that the predicted future activity associated with the case file is less than the threshold suspicion level. In some implementations, determining, by the computer system, a threat score for each of the case files can include: assigning a threat score above a threshold score value based on determining that activity that poses a security threat documented in the case file occurred at stores within a threshold distance from the store and assigning a threat score below the threshold score value based on determining that the activity that poses a security threat documented in the case file occurred at stores outside of the threshold distance from the store.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some implementations, determining, by the computer system, a threat score for each of the case files can include: assigning a threat score above a threshold score value based on determining that the user associated with the case file has not been apprehended and assigning a threat score below the threshold score value based on determining that the user associated with the case file has been apprehended. Sometimes, determining, by the computer system, a threat score for each of the case files can include: assigning a threat score below a threshold score value based on determining that activity that poses a security threat in the case file involves theft of one or more of a first predetermined category of items and assigning a threat score above the threshold score value based on determining that activity that poses a security threat in the case file involves theft of one or more of a second predetermined category of items. The first predetermined category of items can include at least one of necessity items and items costing less than a threshold cost value, the necessity items including at least one of produce, toothpaste, tooth brushes, and first aid supplies. The second predetermined category of items can include at least one of non-necessity items and items costing more than the threshold cost value, the non-necessity items including at least one of TVs, computers, and clothing.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As another example, determining, by the computer system, a threat score for each of the case files can include: assigning a threat score above a threshold score value based on determining that a quantity of stolen items associated with the case file exceeds a threshold quantity value and assigning a threat score below the threshold score value based on determining that the quantity of stolen items associated with the case file is less than the threshold quantity value. Sometimes, determining, by the computer system, a threat score for each of the case files can include: assigning a threat score above a threshold score value based on determining that activity that poses a security threat documented in the case file increased over a predetermined timeframe and assigning a threat score below the threshold score value based on determining that activity that poses a security threat documented in the case file decreased over the predetermined timeframe. Moreover, determining, by the computer system, a threat score for each of the case files can also include: assigning a threat score above a threshold score value based on determining that a theft frequency associated with the case file is within a predetermined frequency range and assigning a threat score below the threshold score value based on determining that theft frequency associated with the case file is outside of the predetermined frequency range.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As yet another example, generating, by the computer system and based on applying one or more culling models to the ranked candidate list, a watch list further can include: classifying the case files in the candidate list into one or more groups using random forest ranking, the one or more groups being based at least in part on threat score, severity of activity that poses a security threat documented in the case files, quantities of items stolen in the case files, costs of items stolen in the case files, and predicted future activity associated with the case files, and populating the watch list with case files from a subset of the groups, the subset of the groups including case files that pose a greatest current threat to the store. Sometimes, the summary videos can include, for each of the subset of the case files, at least one of data and device-based inferences associated with the case file that objectively identify the user associated with the case file. The summary videos for each of the subset of the case files can also be a compilation of at least one of an image of the user's appearance, a video of the user's gait, a video of the user's body movement, a license plate number associated with the user's vehicle, and a credit card number used by the user during one or more transactions in the store.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">One or more embodiments described herein can include a system for generating a watch list of users who pose specific security threats to a store, the system including: one or more devices that may include cameras, RFID readers, location-based signaling devices, mobile devices, and point of sale (POS) terminal checkout lanes, the one or more devices being positioned throughout a store and configured to generate unstructured data and system-based inferences about activity in the store, a data store, and a computing system in communication with the one or more devices and the data store. The computing system can retrieve, from the data store, case files associated with the store, each of the case files documenting activity that poses a security threat by a user at the store, predict, based on applying one or more prediction models to each of the case files, future activity associated with the case file, the prediction models having been trained, using machine learning, to predict future activity based at least in part on a type of activity that poses a security threat documented in the case file, a quantity of stolen items associated with the case file, theft velocity, and a cost of stolen items associated with the case file, determine a threat score for each of the case files based at least in part on the predicted future activity associated with the case file, rank the case files associated with the store into a candidate list from highest threat score to lowest threat score, generate, based on applying one or more culling models to the ranked candidate list, a watch list for the store that includes a subset of the case files in the ranked candidate list, the culling models having been trained, using machine learning, to identify the subset of the case files posing a greatest current threat to the store, the greatest current threat to the store corresponding to a threshold time period, generate summary videos for each of the subset of the case files in the watch list, and transmit, to a user device, the watch list and the summary videos for presentation in a graphical user interface (GUI) display at the user device.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The system can optionally include one or more of the following features.

Sometimes, the computing system can determine a threat score for each of the case files based on assigning a threat score above a threshold score value based on determining that activity that poses a security threat documented in the case file occurred at stores within a threshold distance from the store and assigning a threat score below the threshold score value based on determining that the activity that poses a security threat documented in the case file occurred at stores outside of the threshold distance from the store.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The devices, system, and techniques described herein may provide one or more of the following advantages. For example, the disclosed technology provides for combining and correlating different forms of data, information, and system-generated inferences using objective factors. Labeling and classification techniques can be used to correlate the different types of information, which, at first blush, may not appear related to each other. As a result, security events can be more accurately identified and associated with guests who pose specific security threats. A case file generated for each guest who poses a specific security threat to a retail store, and each guest can be assigned a threat score indicating a threat level that the customer presents to the retail environment. Customers having threat scores within a threshold range can be ranked and returned to in-store employees in the form of a watch list. Such data-driven watch lists can be used to more effectively and accurately identify guests who pose a greatest security threat, monitor them, and potentially take action when warranted (i.e., alert retail security personnel to verify receipt upon exit, alert law enforcement when guest with outstanding security incidents is identified). As a result, potential future security events can be mitigated or otherwise prevented in the retail environment. Furthermore, such data-driven watch lists can be used to objectively monitor the guests who pose specific security threats. The in-store employees can therefore avoid using subjective factors and/or bias to identify guests who pose specific security threats based on human observations.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As another example, the watch lists can be short and digestible, thereby making it easier for the in-store employees to memorize or otherwise keep track of guests who pose specific security threats. The watch lists can identify the guests who pose the greatest security threat (e.g., customers having the highest threat scores). The watch lists therefore can be culled, instead of containing all guests who pose potential security threats, and the lists can be specific to individual retail stores. Culled watch lists can help the in-store employees more effectively focus on monitoring those customers presenting more substantial or significant threats to the retail environment. In some implementations, the in-store employees can receive updated watch lists every day. These watch lists can be easier to remember and digest since they may only list the guests who pose specific security threats that pose the biggest threat to the retail environment that day.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As another example, stitching together disparate pieces of data and information can be advantageous to predict likelihood of future activity of guests who pose specific security threats. Such data-driven, objective predictions can be used by the in-store employees to monitor the guests who pose specific security threats and take actions to resolve previous outstanding security events involving the guest and/or to prevent/mitigate potential future security events involving the guests. This can be advantageous to reduce or otherwise prevent security events from occurring in the retail environment.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The disclosed technology can also provide for dynamically updated watch lists. The watch lists can be updated based on new data and/or system-based inferences. The in-store employees can use the dynamically updated watch lists to monitor customers who ae current threats to the retail environment. In other words, the in-store employees can focus on monitoring customers who pose the biggest threats to the retail environment on any given day. The in-store employees may not be caught up monitoring customers who no longer present the biggest threats to the retail environment and instead can focus their efforts on preventing security events that may arise from the customers posing the biggest threats.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As yet another example, the disclosed technology can provide for generating summary videos that can be used by the in-store employees to more accurately monitor the guests who pose specific security threats. The summary videos can be included with the digestible watch list. The summary videos can include data and system-based inferences that objectively identify each guest who poses a security threat. Therefore, the in-store employees can use the summary videos to learn about the guests who pose specific security threats on the watch list. Using the summary videos, the in-store employees can more objectively remember, monitor, identify, and/or potentially intervene with (i.e., check receipt upon exit of store, alert law enforcement, apprehend) the guests who pose specific security threats that are on the watch list.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Associating unstructured data (e.g., raw data such as video feeds, images, location information) and system-based inferences (e.g., inferred conclusions such as a customer bypassing a scanner with a product) can also be advantageous to build robust, accurate, unbiased case files. Such case files can be assigned threat scores, as described throughout, and used to determine how whether a customer presents a big enough threat to a store to be put on the watch list for that store. The case files can identify guests who pose specific security threats without relying on subjective or biased visual observations made by the in-store employees. As a result, human-made bias in identifying and monitoring guests who pose specific security threats can be mitigated or otherwise avoided. Using objective identifiers, a guest who poses a security threat can be more easily identified. For example, the customer can change clothes or their hair color, which would make previous visual observations of that customer ineffective to identify the customer the next time they enter the store. However, if the customer uses the same credit card, phone, or car, identifiers associated with each of those can be used to positively and objectively identify the customer, even if they change their outward appearance.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.

Case files can be generated for each guests who pose specific security threats. The case files can be assigned scores indicating a likely threat that the associated customer presents to the retail environment. The scored customers can then be ranked from highest threat score to lowest threat score. Guests who pose specific security threats having threat scores within a predetermined threshold range can be added to the watch list and provided to in-store employees whose jobs are related to security and safety in a retail environment. Therefore, the watch list can be culled and can include the customers posing the biggest threats to the retail environment. The culled watch list can be easier for in-store employees to digest, memorize, and/or remember. The in-store employees can use this watch list to effectively and objectively monitor and/or apprehend customers that pose the biggest threats to the retail environment.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to the figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram of generating a watch list for a store environment. A computer system <b>102</b> can be in communication (e.g., wired and/or wireless) with a case files data store <b>104</b> and an in-store employee device <b>126</b> via network(s) <b>128</b>. In some implementations, the computer system <b>102</b> can be in communication with multiple in-store employee devices. The computer system <b>102</b> can also be a remote computing system in communication with in-store employee devices that are associated with a plurality of retail environments or stores. For example, the computer system <b>102</b> can be a central computing system configured to generate a watch list for each of the plurality of stores in a network of stores. The watch list generated for a particular store can then be transmitted to each in-store employee device that is located at or otherwise associated with the particular store. In some implementations, each of the plurality of stores in the network of stores can include a computer system that is configured to generate a watch list for that particular store.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The in-store employee device <b>126</b> can be a mobile device such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop, and/or computer. An in-store employee can use the device <b>126</b> in order to monitor activity in the store environment, including guests who pose specific security threats. The in-store employee can be tasked with ensuring safety and security in the store environment. For example, the in-store employee can be security and safety personnel. In some implementations, the device <b>126</b> can be in communication with a camera security system in the store environment. The in-store employee can view an image data feed from the camera security system at the device <b>126</b>. The in-store employee can use the device <b>126</b> in order to identify guests who pose specific security threats, monitor them, and take some response action to such customers when they are engaged in or believed to be engaging in activity that poses a security threat.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the computer system <b>102</b> can retrieve case files from the case files data store <b>104</b> (step A, <b>106</b>). Case files can be generated by the computer system <b>102</b> and/or one or more other computing systems. A case file, as described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, can be generated for each customer in the store environment who engages in activity that poses a security threat, such as theft, shoplifting, sweethearting, battery, assault, etc. A case file can indicate information about the customer and activity that poses a security threat that the customer engaged in. For example, the case file can include objective identifiers that can be used to objectively identify the customer (e.g., MAC address, credit card number, license plate, etc.). The case file can also include data and/or system-based inferences about prior activity that poses a security threat of the customer. The case file can include image data (e.g., still images, video) depicting the customer as they engaged in the prior activity that poses a security threat. As described herein, the case file can be used to assess a threat level that the customer poses to the store environment. The customer may be added to a watch list for the in-store employee(s) depending on the customer's case file and threat level.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The computer system <b>102</b> can then determine a threat level for each of the retrieved case files (step B, <b>108</b>). As described herein, threat level scores can be determined based on information in the case files (e.g., refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-D</figref>). The threat level scores can be determined and updated based on (i) newly received data, such as images of the customer stealing another product at another time, and/or (ii) newly generated system-based inferences, such as a point of sale (POS) terminal determination that the customer swapped barcodes on products and therefore did not pay an actual price of a purchased product. A customer's threat level score can, for example, be higher than threat scores of other customers when the customer steals products that cost more, steals products more frequently within a predetermined time period, engages in battery, assault, or other physical contact with employees or other customers, has been apprehended in the past, etc. A customer's threat level score can, for example, be lower than threat scores of other customers when the customer steals infrequently or once within a predetermined time period, steals low-cost products, etc.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The computer system <b>102</b> can then generate a candidate list based on the scored case files (step C, <b>110</b>). In other words, the computer system <b>102</b> can compile all of the scored case files into a list. The computer system <b>102</b> can put all of the scored case files into the candidate list. Thus, the candidate list can include all the case files that are scored. The candidate list may therefore include customers who pose a significant threat to the store environment as well as customers who pose a minimal threat to the store environment. The candidate list can include all the case files, regardless of recent or new activity that the customers associated with the case files may be engaging in. In some implementations, the computer system <b>102</b> can put case files having a threat level score within a predetermined range into the candidate list. In some implementations, the computer system <b>102</b> can also rank all of the case files in the candidate list based on their determined threat level scores. The case files can be ranked from highest to lowest threat level score.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The computer system <b>102</b> can also predict future activity that poses a security threat for each case file in the candidate list (step D, <b>112</b>). The computer system <b>102</b> can apply one or more machine learning models to each case file to predict activity that poses a security threat. These predictions can be based on frequency of activity that poses a security threat, severity of activity that poses a security threat, types of items stolen, quantity of items stolen, value of items stolen, prior convictions, etc. Thus, the predictions can be generated based on associating an abundance of different data and system-based inferences in the case file. Using the abundance of different data and the system-based inferences, the computer system <b>102</b> can predict a likelihood that the associated customer will engage in future activity that poses a security threat with more accuracy. Predictions of future activity that poses a security threat can be used to rank the case files, as described further below.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The computer system <b>102</b> can receive recent data associated with one or more of the case files in the candidate list (step E, <b>114</b>). Step E can at any time before or during steps A-D. The data can be received from one or more devices in the store environment, such as a camera, POS terminal, RFID reader, and/or location based signaling device. The data can also include system-based inferences made by the one or more devices in the store environment. The received data can include images of a customer associated with one of the case files stealing another item, an inference by the POS terminal indicating that a customer likely engaged in ticket swapping, etc. The recent data that is received in step E (<b>114</b>) can be used by the computer system <b>102</b> to rank the case files, as described below.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Based on the predicted future activity and/or received recent data, the computer system <b>102</b> can rank the case files in the candidate list (step F, <b>116</b>). The computer system <b>102</b> can rank the case files from highest to lowest threat level score (e.g., refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-B</figref>). The computer system <b>102</b> can also weigh one or more of the threat level scores based on the predicted future activity and/or received recent data.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, if recently received data indicates that a customer associated with a first case file was involved in another shoplifting event, then the computer system <b>102</b> can determine that the customer associated with the first case file poses a bigger threat to the store environment in comparison to a customer who has not recently engaged in another shoplifting event. Accordingly, the threat level score for the first case file can be weighted more than the threat level score of other case files. The first case file can be ranked higher in the candidate list than the other case files.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As another example, if the computer system <b>102</b> predicts that the customer associated with the first case file is not likely to engage in future activity that poses a security threat within a predetermined timeframe, then the computer system <b>102</b> can weigh the threat level score of the first case file less than the threat level score of other case files. The first case file can be ranked lower in the candidate list than the other case files.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The computer system <b>102</b> can generate a watch list (step G, <b>118</b>). The watch list can be a culled version of the candidate list of ranked case files (e.g., refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). Generating the watch list can include applying one or more machine learning models to the candidate list of the ranked case files. The models can be trained to identify which case files are associated with customers that pose the biggest threats to the store environment. For example, using the models, the computer system <b>102</b> can generate the watch list including case files having the highest ranked threat level scores. The watch list can also include case files having threat level scores within a predetermined threat level range. The watch list can also include a predetermined quantity of the ranked case files, such as top <b>10</b> ranked case files. The quantity of case files in the watch list can vary based on one or more factors, such as a business of the particular retail store, a severity or threat level associated with each of the ranked case files in the candidate list. As a result, a digestible watch list can be generated. A digestible watch list can be used by in-store employees to more easily and effectively monitor customers and apprehend the guests or customer who pose the greatest security threat to the retail store, its employees, and/or other guests.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The computer system <b>102</b> can also generate summary videos for each of the case files in the watch list (step H, <b>120</b>). As described herein, the summary videos can include pieces of information from the case files that can be used by the in-store employees to objectively monitor and potentially intervene with (i.e., verify purchases upon exit, call law enforcement, apprehend) the guests who pose specific security threats. For example, the summary videos can include a compilation of images, videos, transaction receipts, license plate numbers, credit card numbers, etc. that uniquely and objectively identify the customer associated with the case file. The in-store employees can study the summary videos whenever they receive the watch list to learn about which guests who pose specific security threats they need to be monitoring that day. The summary videos can be short and concise, thereby presenting only relevant information needed to quickly and objectively identify the guests who pose specific security threats. Thus, the summary videos can be advantageous to assist the in-store employees to quickly and effectively monitor guests who pose specific security threats, identify the guests, and intervene with (i.e., apprehend or otherwise stop) the guests from engaging in activity that poses a security threat in the store environment.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some implementations, guests can be objectively identified in a particular store and across a network of stores based on whether the guests connect to WIFI or other internet services that are provided in the stores. Using the MAC address of the guest's mobile device and a combination of other signals that are detected in the store, such as RFID and WIFI signals, the guest's location can be triangulated. The guest's MAC address can then be used as an objective identifier to identify the guest whenever they go to other stores.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The computer system <b>102</b> can then transmit the watch list with summary videos to the in-store employee device <b>126</b> (step I, <b>122</b>). The watch list and summary videos can be transmitted to the device <b>126</b> every day. In some implementations, the watch list and summary videos can be transmitted at predetermined times. In yet some implementations, the watch list and summary videos can be transmitted whenever either of the watch list and/or the summary videos are updated by the computer system <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The in-store employee device <b>126</b> can output the watch list with the summary videos step J, <b>124</b>). For example, the device <b>126</b> can output the watch list with the summary videos upon receiving them from the computer system <b>102</b>. In some implementations, the device <b>126</b> can output the watch list with the summary videos at some predetermined time after receiving them from the computer system <b>102</b>. For example, the device <b>126</b> can receive the watch list in real-time once the list is generated or updated by the computer system <b>102</b>, however the device <b>126</b> may not output the updated watch list until the next day. Thus, every day, the in-store employee(s) can view the same version of the watch list as the prior day or an updated version of the watch list. This can be advantageous so as not to confuse the in-store employee(s) and to make it easier for the employee(s) to digest, memorize, and/or remember the guests who pose specific security threats on the watch list.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some implementations, as described further in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> below, the computer system <b>102</b> can provide a watch list to the device <b>126</b> that includes all of the ranked case files in the candidate list. The device <b>126</b> can output the full/complete watch list so that the in-store employee(s) can review all guests who pose security threats. The computer system <b>102</b> can also group the ranked case files in the candidate list and assign each of the groups to one or more in-store employees. Instead of transmitting all of the case files to each of the devices <b>126</b> of the in-store employees, the computer system <b>102</b> can transmit the groups of case files that each of the in-store employees are assigned.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Steps A-J (<b>108</b>-<b>124</b>) can be continuously performed in a feedback loop. For example, the computer system <b>102</b> can continuously be updating threat level scores of one or more case files, generating new watch lists for one or more stores, and updating watch lists for one or more stores. For example, new watch lists can be generated any time that new case files are created for customers in a particular store. Existing watch lists for one or more stores can be updated whenever case files associated with those one or more stores are updated. Moreover, watch lists can be generated and/or updated whenever new data and/or system-based references are received about one or more case files. Dynamically generating and updating can be advantageous to provide in-store employees with digestible and most current watch lists. These watch lists can assist the in-store employees in more effectively performing their jobs and/or monitoring guests who pose specific security threats in the respective stores.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram of generating case files for security events in a store environment <b>200</b>.

The devices <b>210</b>A-N can be configured to identify when customers pass the devices <b>210</b>A-N or are nearby the devices <b>210</b>A-N. The devices <b>210</b>A-N can generate timestamps indicating when a customer passes or is nearby. Moreover, the devices <b>210</b>A-N can communicate with mobile devices of customers to identify locations of such customers in the store <b>200</b> and to associate the generated timestamps with the customers. For example, customer <b>220</b>A has mobile device <b>212</b>A. Mobile device <b>212</b>A can be a cell phone, smartphone, laptop, tablet, or other mobile computing device that the customer <b>220</b>A may bring with them to the store. If the customer <b>220</b>A moves towards or comes into range with the location-based signaling device <b>210</b>A, the location-based signaling device <b>210</b>A can ping the mobile device <b>212</b>A and receive a mobile device identifier, such as a MAC address. The MAC address can be correlated with a timestamp generated by the device <b>210</b>A that indicates the customer <b>220</b>A was nearby. Thus, the location of the customer <b>220</b>A in the store <b>200</b> at a particular time can be documented by the device <b>210</b>A using an objective identifier, the MAC address of the mobile device <b>212</b>A.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The RFID readers <b>214</b>A-N can also be positioned in various locations throughout the store <b>200</b>. For example, RFID reader <b>214</b>A is positioned at an end of the shelf <b>226</b>B. RFID reader <b>214</b>B is placed at or part of POS checkout lane <b>206</b>A. RFID reader <b>214</b>N is positioned along the shelf <b>226</b>D. RFID readers <b>214</b>A-N can be placed in various other locations throughout the store <b>200</b>. The RFID readers <b>214</b>A-N can be configured to detect when an RFID tag comes within a vicinity or range of the readers <b>214</b>A-N. RFID tags can be attached to shopping carts, baskets, and other equipment used in the store <b>200</b>. For example, the customer <b>220</b>A can be pushing a shopping cart <b>218</b> around the store <b>200</b>. The shopping cart <b>218</b> can have an RFID tag <b>216</b>, which can be used to identify the shopping cart <b>218</b>. Each shopping cart in the store <b>200</b> can have a unique RFID tag. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, as the customer <b>220</b>A pushes the shopping cart <b>218</b> past or near the RFID reader <b>214</b>A, the reader <b>214</b>A can detect the RFID tag <b>216</b> on the shopping cart <b>218</b>. The reader <b>214</b>A can, for example, determine that the shopping cart <b>218</b> was near the shelf <b>226</b>B at a time at which the reader <b>214</b>A detected the RFID tag <b>216</b>. Similarly, when the customer <b>220</b>A moves the shopping cart <b>218</b> to the POS checkout lane <b>206</b>A, the RFID reader <b>214</b>B can detect the RFID tag <b>216</b> and identify that the shopping cart <b>218</b> is at the POS checkout lane <b>206</b>A at a particular time.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, one or more of the devices and/or systems <b>208</b>A-N, <b>210</b>A-N, <b>214</b>A-N, and <b>206</b>A-N can capture data (step A, <b>228</b>). For example, the cameras <b>208</b>A-N can continuously capture image and/or video data in their designated locations. The location-based signaling devices <b>210</b>A-N can generate timestamps and indications of when customers, such as the customer <b>220</b>A, passes by or comes into a range of the devices <b>210</b>A-N. The RFID readers <b>214</b>A-N can similarly generate timestamps and indications of when shopping carts having RFID tags, such as the shopping cart <b>218</b> having the RFID tag <b>216</b>, come within range of the readers <b>214</b>A-N. The POS checkout lanes <b>206</b>A-N can also capture data such as scanned items, images of items in a customer's shopping cart, and transaction receipts/bills.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">One or more of the devices and/or systems <b>208</b>A-N, <b>210</b>A-N, <b>214</b>A-N, and <b>206</b>A-N can also generate inferences based on the captured data (step B, <b>230</b>). In some implementations, one or more of the devices may not generate inferences. One or more of the devices may only generate inferences when the devices determine there may be activity that poses a security threat based on the captured data.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">For example, the customer <b>220</b>A can scan products at the POS checkout lane <b>206</b>A. The POS checkout lane <b>206</b>A can include a camera configured to capture image data of an area around the POS checkout lane <b>206</b>A. Using edge computing, the POS checkout lane <b>206</b>A can analyze the image data and match it to barcodes of the products that the customer <b>220</b>A scanned. The POS checkout lane <b>206</b>A can determine that there is a mismatch between products that appear in the image data and products that are scanned. The mismatch can indicate that the customer <b>220</b>A may be shoplifting. Accordingly, the POS checkout lane <b>206</b>A can generate an inference that the customer <b>220</b>A may be engaged in activity that poses a security threat.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As another example, the RFID reader <b>214</b>A can identify that customer <b>220</b>A passing by the shelf <b>226</b>B with the shopping cart <b>218</b> at a first time. The customer <b>220</b>A can continue moving between the shelves <b>226</b>B and <b>226</b>C. Once the customer <b>220</b>A reaches the end of the shelves <b>226</b>B and <b>226</b>C, the customer <b>220</b>A can decide to turn around, walking back the same way that they came. Thus, when the customer <b>220</b>A reaches the end of the shelves <b>226</b>B and <b>226</b>C, the RFID reader <b>214</b>A can identify the shopping cart <b>218</b> at a second time. Using edge computing, the RFID reader <b>214</b>A can determine an amount of time that passed between the first time and the second time. The RFID reader <b>214</b>A can infer, based on the amount of time that passed, whether the customer <b>220</b>A spent longer between the shelves <b>226</b>B and <b>226</b>C than expected. If the customer <b>220</b>A spent longer than expected, the RFID reader <b>214</b>A can infer that the customer <b>220</b>A may be engaged in activity that poses a security threat.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Alone, the RFID reader <b>214</b>A's inference may not positively identify that the customer <b>220</b>A in fact engaged in activity that poses a security threat. However, in combination with image data from the camera <b>208</b>B, for example, the computer system <b>102</b> can determine that the customer <b>220</b>A spent a longer time than expected between the shelves <b>226</b>B and <b>226</b>C because the customer <b>220</b>A was looking at their mobile device <b>212</b>A. Thus, the customer <b>220</b>A did not in fact engage in activity that poses a security threat. As another example, in combination with the image data from the camera <b>208</b>B, the computer system <b>102</b> can determine that the customer <b>220</b>A spent a longer time because the customer <b>220</b>A was trying to swap barcodes on two products. Thus, the computer system <b>102</b> can positively identify that the customer <b>220</b>A engaged in activity that poses a security threat.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, one or more of the devices and/or systems <b>208</b>A-N, <b>210</b>A-N, <b>214</b>A-N, and <b>206</b>A-N can transmit data to the computer system <b>102</b> (step C, <b>232</b>). The data can include unstructured data that is captured by the devices and/or systems <b>208</b>A-N, <b>210</b>A-N, <b>214</b>A-N, and <b>206</b>A-N. The data can also include inferences that are generated by the devices and/or systems <b>208</b>A-N, <b>210</b>A-N, <b>214</b>A-N, and <b>206</b>A-N. The data can be transmitted at predetermined times. In some implementations, the data can be transmitted when requested by the computer system <b>102</b>. In yet some implementations, the data can be transmitted as it is captured. For example, the cameras <b>208</b>A-N can transmit live feeds of images and/or videos that are captured. As another example, the location-based signaling devices <b>210</b>A-N can transmit location data whenever movement is detected within ranges of such devices <b>210</b>A-N. The RFID readers <b>214</b>A-N can also transmit data whenever RFID tags <b>216</b> of shopping carts <b>218</b> are detected within ranges of such devices <b>214</b>A-N. Moreover, the POS checkout lanes <b>206</b>A-N can transmit data, such as receipts, credit card information, scanned items, and inferences, whenever a transaction is made at such checkout lanes <b>206</b>A-N.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The computer system <b>102</b> can also retrieve data from a data store <b>104</b>. The data can include historic unstructured data, historic system-based inferences, structured data, and other data pertaining to security events and activity that poses a security threat in the store <b>200</b>. All of the data that is received by the computer system <b>102</b> can be used to determine whether security events occurred and to generate case files for identified security events.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Thus, the computer system <b>102</b> can aggregate the data (step D, <b>234</b>). The computer system <b>102</b> can compile and filter all of the data that was received. The computer system can also apply one or more machine learning-trained models to the unstructured data to add structure that data. Adding structure to the data can include labeling the data and classifying the data based on those labels. For example, a model can be trained to identify, from image data, a person peeling a barcode off of a product. The model can be applied to the image data received from the cameras <b>208</b>A-N. Using the model, the computer system <b>102</b> can identify a moment in which the customer <b>220</b>A in fact removed a barcode from one product and put it on another product. The computer system <b>102</b> can label this moment in the image data and classify it as a barcode swap or other activity that poses a security threat classifier.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Similarly, a model can be trained to identify, from POS transaction data and inferences, whether the customer <b>220</b>A did not scan all products in the shopping cart <b>218</b> and/or whether the customer <b>220</b>A scanned barcodes that do not match the products in the shopping cart <b>218</b> or otherwise at the POS checkout lane <b>206</b>A. Using the model, the computer system <b>102</b> can label and classify the POS transaction data as indicative of a security event, such as shoplifting.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As another example, a model can be trained to stitch together different image data from the cameras <b>208</b>A-N. Thus, the computer system <b>102</b> can apply the model to all of the received image data and output a continuous image feed tracking the customer <b>220</b>A as they move throughout the store <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The computer system <b>102</b> can then create connections amongst the aggregated data (step E, <b>236</b>). The computer system <b>102</b> can apply one or more machine learning-trained models to the aggregated data. For example, the models can be trained to correlate aggregated data based on their labels and/or classifications. Thus, if image data and POS transaction data both are labeled as barcode swap, the computer system <b>102</b> can determine that these two pieces of data correlate with each other.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As another example, the computer system <b>102</b> can create connections by correlating the aggregated data with the customer <b>220</b>A. For example, using one or more models, the computer system <b>102</b> can correlate (1) a timestamp of an RFID reading from the RFID reader <b>214</b>A with (2) image data of the customer <b>220</b>A swapping a barcode on a product near the shelf <b>226</b>B, and (3) a receipt from the POS checkout lane <b>206</b>A. By correlating (1)-(3), the computer system <b>102</b> can positively identify that a barcode swap occurred and the customer <b>220</b>A is involved in shoplifting. Moreover, by connecting and correlating (1)-(3), the computer system <b>102</b> can objectively identify the customer <b>220</b>A by a credit card number or a customer number from the receipt. Such objective identification can be used to track the customer <b>220</b>A in the future and potentially stop the customer <b>220</b>A from committing any additional crimes.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The computer system <b>102</b> can categorize the connected data (step F, <b>238</b>). Categorizing the data can include determining a severity of the activity that poses a security threat that is inferred from connecting the data. For example, the computer system <b>102</b> can determine whether the customer <b>220</b>A's shoplifting amounts to a crime according to state law, local laws, federal law, store policies, and/or other protocol and procedures. Categorizing the data can be location-based and/or store site specific. For example, a business can have multiple stores <b>200</b> across the country. The stores <b>200</b> located in a first state can have certain rules about dealing with activity that poses a security threat that the stores <b>200</b> in a second state may not have. In some implementations, categorizing the data can also include determining whether the connected data actually represents product shortages that are not tied to criminal activity or other security events.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Once the data is categorized, the computer system <b>102</b> can generate case files (step G, <b>240</b>). A case file can be generated per identified security event/activity that poses a security threat. When multiple case files are generated that involve the same customer, the case files can be linked together. In some implementations, a case file can be generated per customer that is involved in identified security events/activity that poses a security threat. Thus, the case file can include an aggregate of all the security events associated with that customer. Whenever a security event is identified, it can be added to the customer's case file.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The computer system <b>102</b> can store the case file(s) in the data store <b>104</b> (step H, <b>242</b>). The case file(s) can be retrieved by the computer system <b>102</b> and used in further analysis. For example, the computer system <b>102</b> can transmit an alert to an in-store employee device <b>126</b> (step I, <b>244</b>). The computer system <b>102</b> can determine whether the case file indicates a security event that warrants intervention or review the in-store employees. The computer system <b>102</b> can apply one or more machine learning trained models to the case file(s). Using the models, the computer system <b>102</b> can assess a severity of the security event(s) outlined in the case file(s). The computer system <b>102</b> can assess the severity of the security event(s) relative to rules based on jurisdiction, state law, federal law, store policies, and/or other protocol and procedures.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">If the computer system <b>102</b> determines that the in-store employees should be alerted, then the computer system <b>102</b> can generate one-click security reports that get reported out. The reports can be generated based on the case file(s). The reports can provide a snapshot of the security event and objective identifiers that can be used to identify the customer involved in the security event. Thus, the reports can include necessary information that can be used by the in-store employees to objectively and unbiasedly identify and stop the customer <b>220</b>A at a time that the security event occurs or at a future time.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As described herein, the steps A-I (<b>228</b>-<b>244</b>) can be performed by the computer system <b>102</b> before generating a watch list for the store <b>200</b> (e.g., refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). One or more of the steps A-I (<b>228</b>-<b>244</b>) can also be performed at the same or similar time as the computer system <b>102</b> generates or updates the watch list for the store <b>200</b>. For example, the computer system <b>102</b> can simultaneously generate case files using the steps A-I (<b>228</b>-<b>244</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and generate or update watch lists using the steps A-J (<b>106</b>-<b>124</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As another example, in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the computer system <b>102</b> can receive recent data associated with case files (step E, <b>114</b>) after devices and/or systems such as the cameras <b>208</b>A-C and the POS checkout lane <b>206</b>A capture data (step A, <b>228</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and/or generate inferences (step B, <b>230</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). As yet another example, the computer system <b>102</b> can receive new case files whenever they are generated using the steps A-I (<b>228</b>-<b>244</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and then generate or update a watch list with the new case files using the steps A-J (<b>106</b>-<b>124</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-D</figref> is a flowchart of a process <b>300</b> for scoring a case file. As described herein, the process <b>300</b> can be performed by the computer system <b>102</b>. One or more blocks of the process <b>300</b> can also be performed by another device, computer, computing system, server, and/or network of computers and/or servers. For illustrative purposes, the process <b>300</b> is described from the perspective of a computer system.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The process <b>300</b> can be performed to assign a threat level score to each case file associated with a particular store. Threat scores can be specific to particular stores. For example, a case file can be associated with one customer who was involved in shoplifting in a first store and a second store. The computer system can assign this case file <b>2</b> threat scores, where a first threat score is associated with a threat level that the customer poses to the first store and a second threat score is associated with a threat level that the customer poses to the second store. The first and second threat scores can be different. The first and second threat scores can vary depending on one or more factors relevant to each of the stores, such as types of items stolen, quantity of items stolen, cost of items stolen, prior thefts in the store(s), location of the store(s), jurisdiction of the store(s), etc. In some implementations, the first and second threat scores can be the same. In yet some implementations, the case file can be assigned one threat score that quantifies a threat level that the customer poses to all stores in a network of stores and/or all stores within a predetermined distance/geographic area from a store where the customer engaged in activity that poses a security threat (e.g., shoplifting).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Referring to the process <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-D</figref>, the computer system can select a store from a plurality of stores in <b>301</b>. As mentioned above, the computer system can determine threat scores for case files associated with each store. The determined threat scores can then be used to generate a watch list for the particular store. In-store employees in the particular store can focus on monitoring customers on the watch list for that particular store rather than customers that may pose threats to a variety of stores. This can be advantageous to assist the in-store employees in more easily and effectively reviewing and remembering which customers pose threats to the particular store. The watch list can therefore help the in-store employees focus their efforts on preventing or otherwise mitigating security events that may occur in the particular store.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some implementations, the computer system can select a group or subset of stores from the plurality of stores in <b>301</b>. The computer system can determine threat scores for the selected group of stores. Stores can be grouped together based on geographic location/proximity to each other, in-store policies and/or procedures, local jurisdiction rules, etc. As an example, in some implementations, stores in the group may be geographically close to each other. Customers may go to all the stores in the group. All the stores in the group may also rotate the same in-store employees and/or have the same safety and security policies and procedures. It can be advantageous in such an illustrative example to identify threat levels, by the computer system that guests who pose specific security threats pose to this group of stores rather than each individual store. After all, the guests who pose specific security threats can pose the same threat to the group of stores and it can be preferred to provide the in-store employees with one watch list of guests who pose specific security threats that applies to the group of stores. The one watch list can be less confusing for the in-store employees to memorize or otherwise digest. The in-store employees can therefore digest the one watch list and apply that watch list to the group of stores that the in-store employees work at.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Once the computer system selects a store from the plurality of stores, the computer system can retrieve case files associated with the selected store (<b>302</b>). The computer system can retrieve the case files from the case files data store <b>104</b> described herein (e.g., refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>6</b></figref>). Each of the case files can be associated with both a customer and a particular store. Each case file can represent one security event/activity that poses a security threat (e.g., shoplifting) that the customer engaged in at the particular store. Each case file can also represent all of the security events that the customer engaged in at one or more stores. For example, the case file can represent all security events that the customer engaged in at a particular store. As another example, the case file can represent all security events that the customer engaged in at multiple stores. In such an example, the same case file can be retrieved each time that the computer system selects a different store and scores the case file for that selected store.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The computer system can then select a case file in <b>304</b>. Accordingly, the computer system can assign a threat level score to the selected case file. As described herein, the threat level score can be a numeric value. The numeric value can be in a range of values, such as 0-100. One or more other ranges of numeric values can be used by the computer system. In some implementations, the threat level score can be a string value indicating a threat level. The string values can include but are not limited to: minimal threat, no threat, smallest threat, mid level threat, large threat, biggest threat, etc.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The computer system can determine whether new evidence is associated with the case file (<b>306</b>). For example, the computer system can determine whether additional data and/or system-based inferences have been added to the case file since a last time that the computer system scored that case file. As another example, the computer system can determine whether it has received additional data and/or system-based inferences that correspond to the selected case file. As described throughout, the new evidence can be received from one or more devices and/or systems positioned throughout a store environment. The new evidence can include image data, received from one or more cameras, of the customer associated with the case file swapping barcodes on items in the selected store. The new evidence can also include an inference made by a POS checkout lane in the selected store that the customer engaged in ticket swapping. The new evidence can also include data indicating activity that poses a security threat of the customer in other stores in a network of stores.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">If there is new evidence associated with the case file, then the computer system can determine whether the new evidence increases a current threat level associated with the case file (<b>308</b>). For example, the computer system can apply one or more machine learning models to the new evidence to assess a severity of activity that is represented by the new evidence. For example, a threat level of a case file can be low where the associated customer stole toiletries. However, if the new evidence indicates that the customer stole an expensive item (e.g., a TV) since the last time the threat level was calculated for that case file, the computer system can determine in <b>308</b> that this most recent theft makes the customer a greater threat to the store. After all, the customer is continuing to steal items at the store and is stealing more expensive items. Accordingly, the computer system can increase the threat score for the case file in <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In implementations where the case file has not yet been assigned a threat score, the computer system can assign a threat score that is above a predetermined threshold in <b>310</b>. Scores below the predetermined threshold can indicate a smaller threat to the store while scores above the predetermined threshold can indicate a bigger threat to the store. The predetermined threshold can be different based on the store.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">On the other hand, if the new evidence does not increase the threat level associated with the case file in <b>308</b>, then the computer system can determine that the threat level score should not be changed. The computer system can proceed to block <b>312</b>, described below. As an example, if the new evidence indicates that the customer has not stolen any items since the last time the threat level was calculated for that case file, the computer system can determine in <b>308</b> that the customer does not pose as much of a threat to the store. In this example, the computer system can determine that the new evidence is neutral, and therefore does not affect or otherwise cause a change to be made to the current threat level for that case file. In implementations where a threat score has not yet been assigned to the case file, the computer system can assign a low threat score to the case file. As described above, the low threat score can be below the predetermined threshold. In yet some implementations, the computer system may not assign any threat score to the case file if the case file does not yet have a threat score and the computer system determines that the new evidence does not increase a threat level associated with the case file.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring back to block <b>306</b>, if the computer system determines that there is no new evidence associated with the selected case file, then the computer system can proceed to block <b>312</b>. The threat score associated with the case file does not need to be changed since no new evidence warrants re-assessing the threat level posed by the case file.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In <b>312</b>, the computer system can retrieve prediction model(s). The prediction model(s) can be retrieved from a data store, such as models data store <b>600</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>. The prediction model(s) can be used by the computer system to assess a threat level of the selected case file. For example, the prediction model(s) can be used to predict whether the customer associated with the selected case file is likely to engage in activity that poses a security threat at a future time and/or during a predetermined timeframe. The prediction model(s) can also be used to assess data, system-based inferences, and/or new evidence associated with the case file to determine the threat level score for the case file. The prediction model(s) can be trained using machine learning techniques and algorithms, such as a convolution neural network (CNN), and training datasets that associate different types of data, system-based inferences, and/or evidence with different threat levels. In some implementations, the computer system can select the prediction model(s) based on information contained in the case file. For example, if new evidence is associated with the case file, the computer system can select one or more prediction models that can be used to predict a likelihood that, based on the new evidence, the customer is likely to engage in future activity that poses a security threat. In some implementations, the computer system can select the same prediction model(s) for all case files associated with the selected store. For example, the selected store can have a policy that requires all case files to be assessed with the same prediction model(s). Each store can have different policies about which prediction models are selected and used to score the case files.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Using the retrieved prediction model(s), the computer system can predict a likelihood of future activity that poses a security threat associated with the selected case file (<b>314</b>). Predictions of likelihood of future activity that poses a security threat can be data-driven and therefore based on objective factors rather than human-based observations and/or subjective determinations. Therefore, threat level assessment of customers may be less biased, more effective, and/or more accurate. As an example, likelihood of future activity that poses a security threat can be predicted based on whether the customer has engaged in activity that poses a security threat since a last time that the threat score was assessed for the case file. Increased velocity of theft or other activity that poses a security threat over a predetermined timeframe can also result in an increased likelihood that the customer will engage in future activity that poses a security threat. Infrequent, sporadic, or one-time theft or other activity that poses a security threat over the predetermined timeframe can result in a decreased likelihood that the customer will engage in future activity that poses a security threat. As another example, if the customer has been apprehended for their prior actions and continued to engage in activity that poses a security threat thereafter, there can be an increased likelihood that the customer will engage in future activity that poses a security threat.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The predicted likelihood of future activity that poses a security threat can be a numeric value. This prediction can also be a Boolean value and/or a string value. As non-limiting examples, the numeric values can include a range of numbers such as 0-100, where 0 can be a lowest likelihood of future activity that poses a security threat and 100 can be a highest likelihood of future activity that poses a security threat. As another non-limiting example, Boolean values can include True and False, where True indicates a likelihood of future activity that poses a security threat and False indicates no or low likelihood of future activity that poses a security threat. As yet another non-limiting example, string values can include &#x201c;lowest likelihood of future activity that poses a security threat,&#x201d; &#x201c;highest likelihood of future activity that poses a security threat,&#x201d; &#x201c;some likelihood of future activity that poses a security threat,&#x201d; etc.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Next, the computer system can determine whether the predicted likelihood of future activity that poses a security threat exceeds a threshold level in <b>316</b>. The threshold level can be determined on a store-by-store basis. For example, one store can have a higher threshold level than another store. The higher threshold level can be based on jurisdiction, state, and/or local laws and policies with regards to reporting and responding to security events. The threshold level can also vary depending on one or more other factors, such as types of items stolen, types of future activity that poses a security threat, severity of future activity that poses a security threat, severity of already-reported activity that poses a security threat, type of already-reported activity that poses a security threat, etc. For example, the threshold level can be lower for activity that poses a security threat that involves battery, assault, or other physical interaction with employees and other customers. Even if there is a low likelihood of future activity that poses a security threat, the customer who steals and is involved in social interaction may pose a greater threat to the store in the future, thus the threshold level can be lower. In other words, if the customer assaulted an in-store employee during a theft and the computer system predicts a moderate likelihood that the customer will engage in future activity that poses a security threat, the customer may still pose a greater threat to the store than a customer who engages in theft without any assault but is predicted to likely engage in more activity that poses a security threat. After all, the threshold level for theft with assault can be lower than a threshold level for just theft, thereby requiring a greater likelihood that theft alone will result in the customer engaging in future activity that poses a security threat before the customer can be considered a greater threat to the store.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Accordingly, if the computer system determines that the predicted likelihood of future activity that poses a security threat exceeds the threshold level in <b>316</b>, then the computer system can increase the threat score for the case file (<b>318</b>). In other words, since the customer is more likely to engage in future activity that poses a security threat, the customer poses a greater threat to the store. Hence, the case file's threat score should be increased. The computer system can then proceed to block <b>320</b>, described below.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">As described herein, the threat score can be increased using a variety of different incremental adjustments.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Returning to <b>316</b>, if the computer system determines that the predicted likelihood of future activity that poses a security threat does not exceed the threshold level, then the computer system can proceed to block <b>320</b>. In other words, the computer system can determine that it is unlikely that the customer will engage in future activity that poses a security threat or that the likelihood is very low (e.g., below the predetermined threshold level). Thus, the computer system can determine that the threat score associated with the case file does not need to be increased or otherwise adjusted. In some implementations, the computer system can optionally decrease the threat score associated with the case file.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In <b>320</b>, the computer system can determine whether activity that poses a security threat in the case file occurred in stores that are within a threshold distance from each other. The threshold distance can be different on a store-by-store basis. For example, a network of stores in a city can have a smaller threshold distance than a network of stores in a rural area. If the selected store is in a city, then the smaller threshold distance can be used. Therefore, the computer system can determine whether the customer engaged in activity that poses a security threat at stores in the network of stores within the smaller threshold distance (e.g., a 5 mile radius from the selected store). The threshold distance can also be determined based on one or more other factors, such as store policies, enterprise policies, state/local/jurisdiction policies and procedures, etc. Moreover, the threshold distance can vary depending on size of a region, whether regions are defined by cities, towns, or other geographic areas, whether customers are able to move around easily to travel to different stores or whether customers are unable to move around easily and therefore can travel to fewer stores, and how many stores are nearby a particular score. A customer can be considered a greater threat to the selected store if the customer engaged in activity that poses a security threat in nearby stores in the network of stores.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">As mentioned, the case file can include all activity that poses a security threat associated with a particular customer. Sometimes, the customer can engage in activity that poses a security threat in one store but sometimes the customer can also engage in activity that poses a security threat in plurality of different stores. If the stores are geographically closer to each other, then the computer system can determine that the customer poses a greater threat to the selected store. In other words, the selected store can be geographically proximate to the other stores where the customer engaged in activity that poses a security threat and therefore it can be likely that the customer will also engage in activity that poses a security threat at the selected store. If, on the other hand, the selected store is geographically far away from all the other stores where the customer engaged in activity that poses a security threat, it can be less likely that the customer will pose a threat to the selected store.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">For example, if the case file indicates that the customer shoplifted multiple times in stores in state A and shoplifted once in the selected store, which is located in state B, then the computer system can determine that the customer does not pose a great threat to the selected store in state B. If anything, the customer may pose a greater threat to each of the stores in state A where the customer previously shoplifted. If the stores in state A are geographically close to each other, the customer may pose an even greater threat to those stores since it can be more likely that the customer will continue to shoplift from those stores.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Accordingly, if the computer system determines that the activity that poses a security threat in the case file occurred in stores within the threshold distance (<b>320</b>), the computer system can increase the threat score for the case file in <b>322</b>. The computer system can then proceed to block <b>324</b>, discussed below. In other words, the computer system can determine that the customer poses a big enough threat to the store to warrant increasing the threat score associated with the customer's case file. The customer engaged in activity that poses a security threat in stores that surround the selected store, and therefore poses a greater threat to the selected store. The customer can also pose a security threat to surrounding stores and/or regions. For example, if the threat score is increased for the case file because the suspicious activity in the case file occurred in stores within a threshold distance, then the case file can also be identified for the other stores within the threshold distance as posing a potential threat to those stores. As a result, in-store employees at the other stores can also become aware of the customers who pose threats in surrounding stores. In some implementations, the threat score can also be increased more for stores that are closer to where the suspicious activity occurred in comparison to stores that are farther away from the suspicious activity.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">If the computer system determines that the activity that poses a security threat in the case file occurred in stores that are not within the threshold distance (<b>320</b>), the computer system can proceed to block <b>324</b>. In other words, the computer system can determine that the customer does not pose a big enough threat to the store to warrant increasing the threat score associated with the customer's case file. The customer may have engaged in activity that poses a security threat in other stores, but these stores may be far away from the selected store, thereby indicating that the customer does not pose a great threat to the selected store.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In <b>324</b>, the computer system can determine whether the customer associated with the case file has been apprehended. Apprehending the customer can include one or more in-store employees stopping the customer while they are in the act of engaging in activity that poses a security threat. Apprehending the customer can also include preventing the customer from leaving the store after they commit the activity that poses a security threat. Apprehending the customer can also include some form of detainment of the customer by the in-store employee(s) and/or law enforcement. In yet some implementations, apprehending the customer can merely include monitoring the customer and/or providing them with a warning that their activity is a security threat.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some implementations, if the customer is currently apprehended, the customer may no longer pose a significant threat to the store (e.g., or may pose a lesser threat to the store until a time at which the customer is no longer apprehended). If the customer has been apprehended in the past but is not currently apprehended, then the customer may also pose a less significant threat to the store. However, in some implementations, if the customer was been apprehended in the past and recently engaged in more activity that poses a security threat, then the customer may pose a more significant threat to the store. This can indicate that the customer was not deterred from engaging in the activity that poses a security threat based on being previously apprehended.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Accordingly, if the computer system determines that the customer has been apprehended, the computer system can decrease the threat score for the case file in <b>326</b>. The computer system can then proceed to block <b>328</b>, discussed below. In other words, the computer system can determine that the customer poses less of a threat to the store and therefore does not warrant increasing the threat score of the associated case file. The threat level score can be decreased because the customer may be less likely to commit activity that poses a security threat if the customer has already been apprehended for past activity. In examples described above where the customer was apprehended and continued to engage in activity that poses a security threat, the threat score of the associated case file can be increased.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">If the computer system determines that the customer has not been apprehended (<b>324</b>), the computer system can proceed to block <b>328</b>. In other words, the computer system can determine that because the customer has not been apprehended in the past, it is uncertain whether that means the customer is a greater threat to the store or whether the customer has not engaged in severe enough activity to warrant being apprehended. Thus, no adjustment may be made to the threat score of the associated case file.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In <b>328</b>, the computer system can determine whether the activity that poses a security threat in the case file involves theft of one or more of a first predetermined category of items. The first predetermined category of items can vary based on store. The first predetermined category of items can include items that, although stolen, may not be the most expensive items in the store. In other words, the first predetermined category of items can include items that, when stolen, may not make the customer appear as a greater threat to the store. For example, the first predetermined category of items can include necessity items, such as fresh produce, fresh meats, tooth paste, tooth brushes, Band-Aids, etc. If a customer steals a necessity item, the customer may pose less of a threat to the store because the customer is stealing an item that they may need to live. As another example, if the first predetermined category of items includes items that all cost less than $5, a customer who steals one or more of such items may not pose a great threat to the store (e.g., unless, for example, a cost of a total quantity of such items that are stolen exceeds a threshold value).</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Thus, if the computer system determines that the activity that poses a security threat involves theft of items from the first predetermined category of items (<b>328</b>), then the computer system can decrease the threat score for the case file in <b>330</b>. As described above, the computer system can determine that the customer poses a lesser threat to the store. The computer system can proceed to block <b>332</b>, described below.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">On the other hand, if the computer system determines that the activity that poses a security threat does not involve items from the first predetermined category of items (<b>328</b>), the computer system can proceed to block <b>332</b>, without adjusting the threat score of the case file.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In <b>332</b>, the computer system can determine whether the activity that poses a security threat in the case file involves theft of one or more of a second predetermined category of items. The second predetermined category of items can vary based on store. The second predetermined category of items can include items that are the most expensive items in the store or having prices that exceed a threshold value. The second predetermined category of items can also include items that are frequently stolen at the particular selected store and/or across a network of stores. In other words, the second predetermined category of items can include items that, when stolen, may make the customer appear as a greater threat to the store.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">For example, the second predetermined category of items can include electronics costing more than a threshold value, such as TVs, computers, and smartphones. If a customer steals a TV, the customer may pose a greater threat to the store since the customer may steal additional items that exceed the threshold value of the items in the second category. Theft of the TV can also indicate that the customer may steal more items from the store, regardless of whether those items are in the second predetermined category of items.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Thus, if the computer system determines that the activity that poses a security threat involves theft of items from the second predetermined category of items (<b>332</b>), then the computer system can increase the threat score for the case file in <b>334</b>. As described above, the computer system can determine that the customer poses a greater threat to the store. The computer system can proceed to block <b>336</b>, described below.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">On the other hand, if the computer system determines that the activity that poses a security threat does not involve items from the second predetermined category of items (<b>332</b>), the computer system can proceed to block <b>336</b>, without adjusting the threat score of the case file.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In <b>336</b>, the computer system can determine whether a quantity of items stolen by the customer exceeds a threshold level. As described throughout this disclosure, the threshold level can be different on a store-by-store basis. The threshold level can also be based on a type of item(s) stolen by the customer. For example, the threshold level can be higher for necessity items such as tooth brushes and tooth paste than a threshold level for electronics such as TVs and computers. In this example, the customer would have to steal more necessity items than TVs for the theft of necessity items to pose the customer as a bigger threat to the store.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Accordingly, if the computer system determines that the quantity of items stolen exceeds the threshold level (<b>336</b>), the computer system can increase the threat score for the case file in <b>338</b>. The computer system can then proceed to block <b>340</b>, discussed below. In other words, the computer system can determine that the customer poses a big enough threat to the store to warrant increasing the threat score associated with the customer's case file.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">If the computer system determines that the quantity of items stolen does not exceed the threshold level (<b>336</b>), the computer system can proceed to block <b>340</b>.

The predetermined timeframe can vary. The predetermined timeframe can change based on the selected store. For example, in some implementations, the predetermined timeframe can be a week, a month, and/or multiple months. The computer system can determine whether the activity that poses a security threat increased more than a predetermined range during the timeframe. This determination can also refer to a activity that poses a security threat velocity. In other words, if the activity that poses a security threat continues or otherwise increases over the predetermined timeframe (e.g., theft velocity increases), then the computing system can determine that the customer associated with the case file poses a bigger threat to the store. On the other hand, if the activity that poses a security threat occurs less or otherwise stops during the predetermined timeframe (e.g., theft velocity decreases), then the computing system can determine that the customer associated with the case file poses a smaller threat to the store.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Accordingly, if the computer system determines that the activity that poses a security threat in the case file increased (<b>340</b>), the computer system can increase the threat score for the case file in <b>342</b>. The computer system can then proceed to block <b>344</b>, discussed below. In other words, the computer system can determine that the customer poses a big enough threat to the store to warrant increasing the threat score associated with the customer's case file.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">If the computer system determines that the activity that poses a security threat in the case file did not increase (<b>340</b>), the computer system can proceed to block <b>344</b>. In other words, the computer system can determine that the customer does not pose a big enough threat to the store to warrant increasing the threat score associated with the customer's case file.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In <b>344</b>, the computer system can determine whether theft frequency of the case file is within a predetermined range. The predetermined range can vary based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to policies of the selected store, type of items stolen, quantity of items stolen, price of items stolen, and/or local/jurisdiction rules and laws. In some implementations, the block <b>344</b> can be the same as the block <b>340</b>. In some implementations, the block <b>340</b> can refer to different types of activity that poses a security threat, including but not limited to theft, assault, battery, and other events that can comprise safety and security of the store.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In <b>344</b>, the computer system can determine whether theft incidents in the case file occurred frequently enough to warrant increasing the threat score of the case file. For example, if the customer associated with the case file only stole items once, this theft frequency can be lower than the predetermined theft frequency range and therefore may not warrant increasing the threat score for the case file. After all, the customer may not pose a big enough threat to the store. On the other hand, if the customer stole items multiple times and, for example, the stolen items cost more than a predetermined value, then the customer's theft frequency may fall within the predetermined theft frequency range. In such a scenario, the threat score for the case file can be increased since the customer may pose a bigger threat to the store.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Accordingly, if the computer system determines that the theft frequency is within the predetermined range (<b>344</b>), the computer system can increase the threat score for the case file in <b>346</b>. The computer system can then proceed to block <b>348</b>, discussed below. In other words, the computer system can determine that the customer poses a big enough threat to the store to warrant increasing the threat score associated with the customer's case file.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">If the computer system determines that the theft frequency is not within the predetermined range (<b>344</b>), the computer system can proceed to block <b>348</b>.

Outputting the threat score can include storing the threat score in a data store. The outputted threat score can then be used by the computer system in order to rank the case files in a watch list.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The computer system can then determine whether there are more case files to score (<b>350</b>). If there are more case files to score, the computer system can return to block <b>304</b>, select a case file, and repeat <b>304</b>-<b>346</b> until no more case files need to be scored.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">If there are no more case files to score, the computer system can return to block <b>301</b> and select a store from the plurality of stores. The computer system can then repeat blocks <b>302</b>-<b>348</b> for each case file associated with the newly selected store. The computer system can repeat the process <b>300</b> until all case files associated with all the stores in the plurality of stores have been scored. In some implementations, if there are no more case files to score for the selected store in <b>348</b>, the process <b>300</b> can stop. For example, the computer system may only score case files for a particular store rather than all the stores in the plurality of stores. The computer system may receive, from a device at the particular store (e.g., an in-store employee device), a request for scored and ranked case files associated with the particular store. Thus, the computer system may perform the process <b>300</b> for just the particular store. In yet some implementations, the computer system may continuously perform the process <b>300</b> for all of the stores in the plurality of stores. The computer system can also perform the process <b>300</b> at predetermined times and/or when new case files are generated and/or existing case files are updated.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Moreover, blocks <b>306</b>-<b>346</b> can be performed in any order. In some implementations, only some of the blocks <b>306</b>-<b>346</b> may be performed. For example, one or more of the blocks <b>306</b>-<b>346</b> can be performed for scoring case files at a first store while one or more of the same or other blocks <b>306</b>-<b>346</b> are performed for scoring case files at a second store. The blocks <b>306</b>-<b>346</b> can therefore be performed based on a store-by-store basis. In some implementations, one or more of the blocks <b>320</b>-<b>346</b> can be performed by the computer system to predict the likelihood of future activity that poses a security threat (<b>306</b>). For example, the computer system can predict the likelihood of future activity that poses a security threat of a case file based on whether the activity that poses a security threat in the case file occurred in stores within the threshold distance (<b>320</b>), whether the customer associated with the case file was apprehended (<b>324</b>), whether the activity that poses a security threat in the case file involved theft of a first and/or second category of items (<b>328</b>, <b>332</b>), the quantity of items stolen (<b>336</b>), theft velocity (<b>340</b>), and/or theft frequency (<b>344</b>).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-B</figref> is a flowchart of a process <b>400</b> for ranking case files in a candidate list. The process <b>400</b> can be performed for each store in a plurality of stores. The process <b>400</b> can be performed each day, such that a new updated candidate list can be generated and used to create daily watch lists for the stores. The process <b>400</b> can also be performed at predetermined times, such as every couple days and/or whenever a case file is generated, scored, and/or updated. Moreover, a candidate list can be generated per store, based on case files that are associated with that store. The candidate list can then be used to generate a final watch list for the particular store, as described above and in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The watch list can be a culled or otherwise shortened version of the candidate list, where the watch list includes case files that pose the greatest threats to the store rather than all the case files that are scored for the store.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">As described herein, the process <b>400</b> can be performed by the computer system <b>102</b>. One or more blocks of the process <b>400</b> can also be performed by another device, computer, computing system, server, and/or network of computers and/or servers. For illustrative purposes, the process <b>400</b> is described from the perspective of a computer system.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Referring to the process <b>400</b> in both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-B</figref>, the computer system can receive case files and associated threat scores for a store in <b>402</b>. For example, the computer system can retrieve the case files and their associated threat scores from a data store, such as the case files data store <b>104</b> (e.g., refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>6</b></figref>). In some implementations, the computer system can perform the process <b>400</b> after scoring all the case files associated with the store in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-D</figref> (e.g., refer to block <b>350</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>). Thus, the computer system can use the outputted case file threat scores in block <b>348</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> to perform the process <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The computer system can rank the received case files in a candidate list from highest to lowest threat score in <b>404</b>. The candidate list can therefore include all case files that have been scored by the computer system in the process <b>300</b> (e.g., refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-D</figref>). The highest threat score can indicate that a customer associated with the case file poses a greatest threat to the store while the lowest score can indicate that a customer associated with the case file poses a smallest threat to the store. It can be advantageous to rank the case files from highest to lowest threat score in order to determine, by the computer system, which customers pose the greatest threat to the store and therefore should be monitored by in-store employees. As described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the case files with the highest threat scores can be culled into a watch list. The watch list can then be used by in-store employees to monitor the customers associated with the case files who pose the greatest threats to the store.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Optionally, the computer system can also select a case file at the top of the candidate list (<b>406</b>) and compare the selected case file to other case files in the candidate list (<b>408</b>). Such a comparison can be advantageous to add more or less weight to threat scores of one or more case files. Weighting the case files can be advantageous to determine which customers should be monitored at a current time and which customers may not need to be monitored until a later time, such as a next day or a week later. As an illustrative example, although a first case file can have a higher threat score than a second case file (e.g., because in the aggregate, the first case file is associated with a customer who engaged in continuous thefts over a predetermined timeframe), a customer associated with the second case file may pose a greater threat to the store at the current time (e.g., today, or the day that the candidate list and watch list are generated) because the customer associated with the second case file engaged in theft of items exceeding a predetermined quantity and/or value just one day prior to the current time. Therefore, for the current time, the second case file can be given more weight and ranked higher on the candidate list than the first case file.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Accordingly, based on comparing the selected case file to the other case files in the candidate list, the computer system can adjust a ranking of the selected case file relative to the other case files in <b>420</b>. Adjusting the ranking of the selected case file can include moving the selected case file up or down in the candidate list. The selected case file can be moved up and down relative to one or more other case files. Adjusting the ranking of the selected case file may not include adjusting or otherwise modifying the actual threat score associated with the selected case file because, as mentioned above, the case files are weighted in order to determine which customer poses a greatest threat to the store at the current time. The threat score can be adjusted or modified using the process <b>300</b>, whenever new data or evidence is received and associated with the case file.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">The computer system can determine whether there are any additional case files in the candidate list that can be compared/weighted relative to each other (<b>422</b>). If yes, then the computer system can select the next case file to be compared with the other case files and repeat blocks <b>406</b>-<b>420</b> until there are no more case files in the candidate list to compare/weigh. If no, then the computer system can output the ranked candidate list in <b>424</b>. Outputting the ranked candidate list can also include storing the ranked candidate list in a data store, such as a lists data store <b>630</b>, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>. In implementations where the computer system does not perform blocks <b>406</b>-<b>422</b>, the computer system can output the candidate list (<b>424</b>) after ranking the case files from highest to lowest threat score in <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Referring back to block <b>408</b>, the computer system can compare the selected case file to the other case files in the candidate list using one or more factors and/or conditions. For example, the computer system can determine whether the selected case file includes theft of items within a first predetermined category of items (<b>410</b>). As described in reference to the process <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-D</figref>, the first predetermined category of items can include necessity items or other items that may be more critical for survival, such as fresh produce, toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc. (e.g., refer to block <b>328</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>). In this example, if the selected case file involves theft of necessity items, then the selected case file can be ranked lower than one or more other case files that do not involve theft of necessity items. After all, the customer associated with the selected case file may pose less of a threat to the store if the customer stole one or more items that they need to survive.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">As another example, the first predetermined category of items in <b>410</b> can include items that are frequently stolen or otherwise are non-necessity items (e.g., refer to block <b>332</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>). This category can include items such as TVs and other electronics. In this example, if the selected case file involves theft of one or more non-necessity items, then the selected case file can be ranked higher than one or more other case files that do not involve theft of non-necessity items or case files that involve theft of fewer non-necessity items than the selected case file.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The computer system can also optionally compare the case files based on whether the selected case file involves theft of items in a second predetermined category of items (<b>412</b>). The second predetermined category of items can include items that cost less than a predetermined threshold value. In this example, if the selected case file involves theft of items that each cost less than the predetermined threshold value and/or in the aggregate cost less than the predetermined threshold value, then the computer system can rank the selected case file lower than one or more other case files where theft does not include items in the second predetermined category of items (e.g., the items cost more than the predetermined threshold value).</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">As another example, the second predetermined category of items can include items that cost more than a predetermined threshold value. In this example, if the selected case file involves theft of items that each cost more than the predetermined threshold value and/or in the aggregate cost more than the predetermined threshold value, then the computer system can rank the selected case file higher than one or more other case files where theft does not include items in the second predetermined category of items (e.g., the items cost less than the predetermined threshold value).</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">The computer system can also optionally compare the case files based on whether the selected case file involves theft that occurred infrequently over a predetermined timeframe (<b>414</b>). If a customer associated with the selected case file sporadically stole items from the store over the predetermined timeframe, then the customer may pose less of a threat to the store at the current time. Therefore, the case file can be ranked below one or more case files where theft occurred more frequently over the predetermined timeframe. Similarly, if the customer associated with the selected case file stole items frequently over the predetermined timeframe in comparison to one or more other case files, then the selected case file can be ranked above the one or more other case files since the customer most likely poses a bigger threat to the store at the current time.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The computer system can also optionally compare the case files based on whether the selected case file has a theft velocity that decreases over a predetermined timeframe (<b>416</b>). If a customer associated with the selected case file stole large quantities or routinely stole items in a beginning of the predetermined timeframe and then rarely stole or stopped stealing items towards the end of the predetermined timeframe, then the customer likely poses less of a threat to the store at the current time. Therefore, the computer system can rank the selected case file lower than other case files where theft velocity remained constant and/or increased over the predetermined timeframe. Similarly, if the customer associated with the selected case file stole small quantities or rarely stole items in a beginning of the predetermined timeframe and then stole greater quantities or stole more frequently towards the end of the predetermined timeframe, then the customer likely poses a greater threat to the store at the current time. Therefore, the computer system can rank the selected case file above other case files where theft velocity remained constant and/or decreased over the predetermined timeframe.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">The computer system can also optionally compare the case files based on whether the selected case file includes past activity that poses a security threat that has a low threat level (<b>418</b>). A customer who engages in physical interaction, such as battery or assault, can pose a greater threat to the store than a customer who never engaged in physical interaction but routinely stole items from the store. Therefore, the case file associated with the customer who engaged in physical interaction can be ranked higher than the case file associated with the customer who never engaged in physical interaction but routinely stole items. After all, it can be preferred for in-store employees to focus on monitoring the customer who engages in physical interaction over the customer who steals more items because the former can cause more harm than the latter.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">The computer system can also compare the selected case file to the other case files in the candidate list using one or more other factors and/or conditions.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart of a process <b>500</b> for generating a watch list for in-store employees. As described herein, the process <b>500</b> can be performed to generate a watch list for each store in a network of stores. Therefore, the process <b>500</b> can be performed on a store-by-store basis. The process <b>500</b> can be performed whenever a candidate list is generated in the process <b>400</b> (e.g., refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-B</figref>). The process <b>500</b> can also be performed at predetermined times, such as before the start of a new day, every couple days, and/or whenever case files are generated, updated, and/or scored. In some implementations, for example, a new watch list can be generated each day for a store. As described herein, the watch list can be a culled version of the candidate list, wherein the watch list includes the case files from the candidate list having the highest threat scores and/or the case files that are weighted more than other case files in the candidate list. The watch list can then be used by in-store employees to focus on monitoring customers associated with the case files in the watch list. As a result, the in-store employees can more easily digest and remember the case files in the watch list instead of having to digest and remember all the case files that are scored for the particular store.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">As described herein, the process <b>500</b> can be performed by the computer system <b>102</b>. One or more blocks of the process <b>500</b> can also be performed by another device, computer, computing system, server, and/or network of computers and/or servers. For illustrative purposes, the process <b>500</b> is described from the perspective of a computer system.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Referring to the process <b>500</b>, the computer system can retrieve a candidate list of ranked case files for a particular store in <b>502</b>. The candidate list can be retrieved from a data store, such as the lists data store <b>630</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">The computer system can also retrieve one or more culling models from a data store in <b>504</b>. For example, the culling models can be retrieved from models data store <b>600</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>. The culling models can be trained, using machine learning techniques, to determine which ranked case files should be included in the final watch list. The culling models can be trained to, for example, select a quantity of the top ranked case files to include in the watch list. The quantity of the top ranked case files can be based on severity of activity that poses a security threat in each of the ranked case files. As an illustrative example, if one or more of the top ranked case files include theft of low cost items, then the computer system can determine that a greater quantity of the top ranked case files can be included in the final watch list. After all, the in-store employees may not be burdened having to remember and/or monitor customers who engaged in less threatening activity that poses a security threat. On the other hand, if one or more of the top ranked case files include theft of high cost items and/or serious activity such as physical interaction, then the computer system can determine that a smaller quantity of the top ranked case files should be included in the final watch list. After all, it can be preferred to not overburden the in-store employees with a long watch list of case files. Instead, the in-store employees can focus on fewer but more prominent threats that they should be monitoring and/or addressing.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Thus, the computer system can apply the culling model(s) in <b>506</b>. Based on application of the culling model(s), the computer system can generate the watch list in <b>508</b>. Generating the watch list can include random forest ranking techniques (<b>510</b>). For example, using random forest ranking, the computer system can classify case files into one or more groupings. One or more of those groupings can then be included in the generated watch list. The groupings can be made based on severity, type of activity that poses a security threat, theft velocity, quantity of items stolen, cost of items stolen, etc. As an illustrative example, case files can be classified into groups based on theft velocity. A group that includes case files having the highest theft velocities can be included in the watch list. It can be preferred, for example, for the in-store employees to focus on monitoring customers that have higher theft velocities than other customers at a current time. As another illustrative example, case files can be classified into groups based on quantity of items stolen at one time. A group that includes case files with the greatest quantities of items stolen at one time can be included in the watch list. It can be preferred, for example, for the in-store employees to only focus on monitoring customers that steal large amounts of items at once in comparison to other customers who steal smaller amounts of items at once but may steal more often.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The generated watch list can be a shortened version of the candidate list. As described herein, the watch list may only include top threats to the particular store. The computer system can then generate a summary video for each of the case files on the watch list in <b>512</b>. The summary video can be a compilation of one or more pieces of data associated with the case file. For example, the summary video can include objective identifiers, images or videos of a customer associated with the case file performing some activity that poses a security threat, etc. The summary video can be a short trailer or other display of information that can be used by the in-store employees to quickly and easily learn about each of the customers whose case files are included in the watch list. For example, a summary video can include images of the customer that can be used to objectively identify the customer. The summary video can also include videos depicting the customer's movements and/or gait in the store. The summary video can also include a license plate number of the customer's vehicle or a credit card number of the customer. This type of information may be more digestible for the in-store employees to remember and recall when performing safety and security tasks in the store.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">The computer system can then transmit the watch list and summary videos to the in-store employee device in <b>514</b>. The computer system can transmit the watch list and summary videos at the start of a new day. As a result, a new and/or updated watch list can be used by the in-store employees for that day. The computer system can transmit the watch list and summary videos at one or more other times. For example, the watch list and summary videos can be transmitted at any time during the day, but may not be displayed to the in-store employees at the in-store employee device until the start of the next day. Displaying the watch list and the summary videos immediately upon receipt from the computer system can cause the in-store employees to become confused or otherwise unable to digest and remember customers on a watch list for that day as well as on a watch list for the next day. Therefore, it can be preferred to display the new or updated watch list to the in-store employees at the start of the next day that the watch list is intended for. Moreover, in some implementations, transmitting the watch list and the summary videos can also include storing the watch list and/or the summary videos in a data store, such as the lists data store <b>630</b> and/or the case files data store <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-B</figref> are system diagrams of components that can be used to perform the disclosed techniques. Referring to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-B</figref>, the computer system <b>102</b>, models data store <b>600</b>, case files data store <b>104</b>, and lists data store <b>630</b> can be in communication (e.g., wired and/or wireless) via the network(s) <b>128</b>. One or more of the data stores <b>600</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>630</b> can be same data stores. The data stores <b>600</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>630</b> can include cloud based storage systems or servers, local databases, remote databases, and/or one or more other storage components or repositories for storing data and information. In some implementations, the computer system <b>102</b> can be a central server or system (e.g., computer, computing system, computer server, etc.) configured to score case files and generate watch lists for every store in a network of stores. In some implementations, each store can have its own computer system <b>102</b>. In yet some implementations, the computer system <b>102</b> can comprise a plurality of devices and/or computing systems. One or more of the plurality of devices and/or computing systems can be edge computing devices that perform processing with less computational resources and computing power in order to reduce or otherwise avoid clogging network bandwidth. As a result, scoring case files and/or generating watch lists can be performed by the computer system <b>102</b> more efficiently and quickly.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">The computer system <b>102</b> can include one or more components to perform the techniques described herein, such as a case file generator <b>602</b>, a threat score determiner <b>604</b>, and a watch list generator <b>608</b>.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">The case file generator <b>602</b> can be configured to generate case files and associate those case files with both customers and stores. The case file generator <b>602</b> can perform one or more of the operations described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For example, the case file generator <b>602</b> can compile unstructured data as well as system-based inferences that are received from one or more devices and/or systems in a store (e.g., refer to step D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The generator <b>602</b> can also add structure to the unstructured data and system-based inferences using one or more structuring models. The generator <b>602</b> can use labels and/or action classifiers to identify structured data that may indicate different types of activity that poses a security threat, such as barcode swapping, mismatched labels, and shoplifting. Moreover, the case file generator <b>602</b> can make associations between/amongst the labeled and classified data (e.g., refer to step E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). As described herein, the generated case files can be robust and accurate collections of structured and associated data. The case files can include objective identifiers that can be used to identify particular customers. In some implementations, a case file can be generated per security event that is identified. In some implementations, a case file can be generated per customer, and each security event that is identified can be added to that customer's case file. As described herein, the case files can also be associated with particular stores where the activity that poses a security threat occurred.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">Still referring to the case file generator <b>602</b>, the generator <b>602</b> can also determine a severity of the security event(s) in the case file. Assessing severity can be based on one or more factors, such as a single incident, aggregate of incidents, acceleration of incidents, deceleration of incidents, dollar amount involved in an incident or incidents, quantity of items involved in an incident or incidents, and/or type of items in an incident or incidents.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">Once the case file generator <b>602</b> generates case files, the case files can be stored in the case files data store <b>104</b>. The case files data store <b>104</b> can store a plurality of case files <b>618</b>A-N. Each of the case files <b>618</b>A-N can include information such as objective identifiers, a summary video, threat score, labeled data, aggregate severity, prior incidents, historic alerts, security reports, and a current incident <b>620</b>. The current incident <b>620</b> can further include information such as a timestamp, location of the incident, quantity of items involved in the incident, type of items involved in the incident, dollar amount of the items involved in the incident, and/or severity of the incident. In some implementations, the current incident <b>620</b> can be new evidence that is received and associated with the particular case file. As described herein, this new evidence can be used to update one or more of a threat score of the particular case file and a ranking of the case file relative to other case files in a watch list. Information stored in the case files data store <b>104</b> can be used by one or more components of the computer system <b>102</b> to assess a threat score for each case file and/or to rank the case files in a watch list.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">Still referring to the computer system <b>102</b>, the threat score determiner <b>604</b> can be configured to determine a threat score for each of the case files for a particular store.

The process <b>800</b> can be performed to provide the in-store employees with all case files that arise to some level of suspicion without overburdening any one of the in-store employees to digest large quantities of case files on the watch list. The process <b>800</b> can be performed by the computer system <b>102</b>. The process <b>800</b> can also be performed by any other computer, device, system, cloud-based service, and/or network of computers or devices. For illustrative purposes, the process <b>900</b> is described from a perspective of a computer system.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">Referring to the process <b>800</b>, the computer system retrieves a candidate list of ranked case files for a store in <b>802</b>, as described throughout this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">The computer system determines whether a quantity of case files in the candidate list exceeds a threshold quantity (<b>804</b>). The threshold quantity can vary depending on one or more factors. For example, the threshold quantity can be different for each store and/or region. In some implementations, the threshold quantity can be same or similar across multiple stores in a region and/or regions. Where a particular store receives low levels of traffic because shoppers have the ability to travel to other stores (e.g., there is a significant quantity of stores in a particular region), the threshold quantity can be higher for the particular store. After all, because there is not much traffic in the particular store, in-store employees, like safety and security personnel, can have the ability and time to review more case files in a watch list than employees in a store where there is significantly more traffic. On the other hand, if the particular store is routinely trafficked and/or busy, it may be more challenging for in-store employees to carefully and effectively review all the case files in the watch list when they are on the clock. Example threshold quantities can include but are not limited to 11, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100, etc. case files.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">In some implementations, the threshold quantity can be a quantity of case files that typically may be included in a watch list. For example, a culled watch list can contain 10 case files that can be reviewed and studied by an in-store employee. The threshold quantity can be 10 or 11 case files. As a result, if the candidate list includes more than 10 case files, then the computer system proceeds to block <b>806</b>.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">If the quantity of case files in the candidate list exceeds the threshold quantity, the computer system can divide the case files into groups in a watch list (<b>806</b>). This can be based on at least one of quantity of case files and quantity of in-store employees (e.g., safety and security personnel). As an example, the candidate list can include 100 case files and the threshold quantity can be 10 (which is representative of 10 case files per watch list). The computer system can divvy up the case files into groups of 10, such that there are 10 groups of 10 case files each in the watch list. In some implementations, the computer system can allot ranked case files <b>1</b>-<b>10</b> in a first group, the next ranked case files <b>11</b>-<b>20</b> in a second group, and so on until all 100 case files are grouped. In some implementations, the computer system can randomly allot case files to different groups in the watch list. The computer system can also divide the case files into groups that do not contain equal numbers of case files. For example, one group can have 5 case files while another group has 10 case files. In yet some implementations, the computer system can divide the case files into groups based on one or more factors, such as type of suspicious activity identified for each of the case files, suspicion level or threat level assigned to each case file, velocity and/or frequency of suspicious activity associated with each case file, etc.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">The computer system then assigns each of the groups of case files in the watch list to in-store employees in <b>808</b>. Sometimes, one or more employees may receive the same group of groups of case files. Sometimes, each employee may be assigned a different group of case files. In yet some implementations, one or more groups can contain overlap in some or all of the case files. Overlap in case files and/or group assignments can be beneficial to ensure that case files are being accurately analyzed by the in-store employees.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">To assign the groups of case files to the in-store employees, the computer system can receive schedules indicating which and how many employees are working shifts. The groups can be assigned to the currently working employees and/or the employees who will be starting their shifts. Thus, when an employee starts their shift, they can receive a group of case files from the watch list that, as part of their job, they should analyze. The employee can therefore focus on monitoring the store for shoppers that are objectively identified in the case files making up the group that the employee was assigned.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">In <b>810</b>, the computer system generates summary videos for each case file. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> for further discussion.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">Referring back to <b>804</b>, if the quantity of case files in the candidate list does not exceed the threshold quantity, the computer system can proceed to block <b>810</b>, in which the computer system generates summary videos for each case file. After all, the candidate list may include a digestible quantity of case files (e.g., 10 case files in total) that can be used by the in-store employees to objectively monitor shoppers at the store. Since the candidate list includes a digestible quantity of case files, the case files may not need to be divided into groups in a watch list. Instead, the candidate list of case files can be the watch list that is transmitted and reviewed by one or more in-store employees.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">The computer system transmits at least one of the watch list, the summary videos, and/or the assignments for each group of case files in the watch list to in-store employee devices (<b>812</b>). In some implementations, each in-store employee can receive the full/complete watch list containing all of the case files that were ranked into the candidate list. Each in-store employee can also receive the particular group of case files in the watch list that they were assigned. Thus, the in-store employee can focus on digesting their group of case files, however they may also review and analyze any of the other case files in the full/complete watch list. In some implementations, each in-store employee may only receive the group of case files that they were assigned, instead of the full/complete watch list.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">In some implementations, the computer system can transmit the full/complete watch list along with the assignments to a master device, such as a computing device of an in-store manager. The in-store manager can then provide the groups of case files to each of the in-store employees.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">Moreover, as described above, the computer system can also transmit the summary videos with the case files. The in-store employees can review and analyze the case files using the summary videos, as described throughout this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">While this specification contains many specific implementation details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the disclosed technology or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features that may be specific to particular embodiments of particular disclosed technologies.
