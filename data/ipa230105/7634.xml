id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Embodiments of a User Equipment (UE), Generation Node-B (gNB) and methods of communication are disclosed herein. The UE may receive a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) that schedules a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) in a slot, and on a component carrier (CC) of a plurality of CCs. The PDCCH may include a total downlink assignment index (DAI) and a counter DAI for hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) feedback of the PDSCH. The total DAI may indicate a total number of pairs of CCs and slots for the HARQ-ACK feedback. The UE may encode the HARQ-ACK feedback to include a bit that indicates whether the PDSCH is successfully decoded. A size of the HARQ-ACK feedback may be based on the total DAI, and a position of the bit may be based on the counter DAI.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000"

Some embodiments relate to cellular communication networks including 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) networks, 3GPP LTE (Long Term Evolution) networks, 3GPP LTE-A (LTE Advanced) networks, New Radio (NR) networks, and 5G networks, although the scope of the embodiments is not limited in this respect. Some embodiments relate to hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) techniques, including HARQ techniques based on codeblock groups. Some embodiments relate to grant free operation, including grant free uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Base stations and mobile devices operating in a cellular network may exchange data. As demand for mobile services and high data rates increases, various challenges related to reliability and capacity may arise. In an example scenario, a large number of users may demand access to the network, which may result in an increase in overhead and a corresponding decrease in overall efficiency. In another example scenario, a target latency for a user and/or application may be relatively low, and it may be challenging for the system to deliver in an efficient manner. Accordingly, there is a general need for methods and systems to implement communication between the base station and the mobile devices in these and other scenarios.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a functional diagram of an example network in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a functional diagram of another example network in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of an example machine in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a user device in accordance with some aspects;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a base station in accordance with some aspects;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary communication circuitry according to some aspects;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example of a radio frame structure in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> illustrate example frequency resources in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates the operation of a method of communication in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates the operation of another method of communication in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates example ACK/NACK modes in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates an example hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) technique in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates another example HARQ technique in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates another example HARQ technique in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates another example HARQ technique in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> illustrates examples of grant-free NOMA transmission in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> illustrates additional examples of grant-free NOMA transmission in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> illustrates another example of grant-free NOMA transmission in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> illustrates example elements that may be transmitted in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>C</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>D</figref> illustrate example time resources and frequency resources in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref> illustrate additional examples of time resources and frequency resources in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> illustrates an example of usage of multi-access (MA) signatures in accordance with some embodiments; and</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>C</figref> illustrate example resource pools in accordance with some embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The following description and the drawings sufficiently illustrate specific embodiments to enable those skilled in the art to practice them.

In addition, it may be a local mobility anchor point for inter-eNB handovers and also may provide an anchor for inter-3GPP mobility. Other responsibilities may include lawful intercept, charging, and some policy enforcement. The serving GW <b>124</b> and the MME <b>122</b> may be implemented in one physical node or separate physical nodes. The PDN GW <b>126</b> terminates an SGi interface toward the packet data network (PDN). The PDN GW <b>126</b> routes data packets between the EPC <b>120</b> and the external PDN, and may be a key node for policy enforcement and charging data collection. It may also provide an anchor point for mobility with non-LIE accesses. The external PDN can be any kind of IP network, as well as an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) domain. The PDN GW <b>126</b> and the serving GW <b>124</b> may be implemented in one physical node or separated physical nodes.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the eNBs <b>104</b> (macro and micro) terminate the air interface protocol and may be the first point of contact for a UE <b>102</b>.

It may be split into two parts: the S1-U, which carries traffic data between the eNBs <b>104</b> and the serving GW <b>124</b>, and the S1-MME, which is a signaling interface between the eNBs <b>104</b> and the MME <b>122</b>. The X2 interface is the interface between eNBs <b>104</b>. The X2 interface comprises two parts, the X2-C and X2-U.

As used herein, the term low power (LP) eNB refers to any suitable relatively low power eNB for implementing a narrower cell (narrower than a macro cell) such as a femtocell, a picocell, or a micro cell. Femtocell eNB are typically provided by a mobile network operator to its residential or enterprise customers. A femtocell is typically the size of a residential gateway or smaller and generally connects to the user's broadband line. Once plugged in, the femtocell connects to the mobile operator's mobile network and provides extra coverage in a range of typically 30 to 50 meters for residential femtocells. Thus, a LP eNB might be a femtocell eNB since it is coupled through the PDN GW <b>126</b>. Similarly, a picocell is a wireless communication system typically covering a small area, such as in-building (offices, shopping malls, train stations, etc.), or more recently in-aircraft. A picocell eNB can generally connect through the X2 link to another eNB such as a macro eNB through its base station controller (BSC) functionality. Thus, LP eNB may be implemented with a picocell eNB since it is coupled to a macro eNB via an X2 interface. Picocell eNBs or other LP eNBs may incorporate some or all functionality of a macro eNB. In some cases, this may be referred to as an access point base station or enterprise femtocell.

In some embodiments, a downlink resource grid may be used for downlink transmissions from a gNB <b>105</b> to a UE <b>102</b>, while uplink transmission from the UE <b>102</b> to the gNB <b>105</b> may utilize similar techniques. The grid may be a time-frequency grid, called a resource grid or time-frequency resource grid, which is the physical resource in the downlink in each slot. Such a time-frequency plane representation is a common practice for OFDM systems, which makes it intuitive for radio resource allocation. Each column and each row of the resource grid correspond to one OFDM symbol and one OFDM subcarrier, respectively. The duration of the resource grid in the time domain corresponds to one slot in a radio frame. The smallest time-frequency unit in a resource grid is denoted as a resource element (RE). There are several different physical downlink channels that are conveyed using such resource blocks. With particular relevance to this disclosure, two of these physical downlink channels are the physical downlink shared channel and the physical down link control channel.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As used herein, the term &#x201c;circuitry&#x201d; may refer to, be part of, or include an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group), and/or memory (shared, dedicated, or group) that execute one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable hardware components that provide the described functionality.

Although some of the elements shown in the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>22</b></figref> may be included in a 3GPP LTE standard, 5G standard, NR standard and/or other standard, embodiments are not limited to usage of such elements that are included in standards.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In some embodiments, for an LTE protocol, the scheduling unit is one subframe with one or two TBs (two TBs for MIMO) where each TB consists of one or several code blocks (CBs). HARQ-ACK feedback is per TB, and TB-level retransmission is supported by separate HARQ-related/MCS information per TB in a DL assignment. For NR, with increased transmission bandwidth up to 100 MHz or even up to GHz in above 6 GHz frequency bands, the maximum TB size can he more than an order of magnitude larger than the maximum CB size. Then, a relatively much larger number of CBs per TB is expected compared with LTE. When a UE incorrectly detects only a few CBs per TB, unnecessary retransmission overhead increases roughly proportionally to the number of CBs per TB. Considering that the proper scheduling and HARQ-ACK feedback/retransmission mechanism for eMBB may vary with the TB size, available physical resource for mini-slot/slot, and potential URLLC traffic, 3GPP agreed to support CBG-based DL transmissions for NR by dividing a TBS into CBGs and allow separate HARQ operations on a per CBG level to improve the HARQ efficiency. The support of CBG-based PDSCH transmissions for up to 16 DL carriers in NR systems increases significantly the amount of UCI that needs to be transmitted in a single subframe, including the number of HARQ-ACK bits. This problem becomes even more serious for TDD systems where multiple DL CCs/slots associate with one UL subframe for HARQ-ACK transmission. Various solutions are proposed hereafter to minimize the HARQ-ACK overhead thereby extending the coverage of CBG-based operations in case of CA scenarios.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In various aspects disclosed herein relate to HARQ-ACK payload reductions for CBG-based transmissions. These schemes may ensure a same understanding between a gNB <b>105</b> and the UE <b>102</b> on the size of HARQ-ACK codebook, HARQ-ACK bits ordering and may also provide more efficient HARQ-ACK feedback on UL.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In some embodiments (which may be related to HARQ-ACK payload reduction in some cases, although the scope of embodiments is not limited in this respect), three ACK/NACK feedback modes may be supported for CBG-based transmission by higher layer configuration or L1 signaling (i.e. Downlink control information (DCI) format) for one or two codewords (CWs) case. Note that, commonly for all modes, the UE <b>102</b> may decode the multiple CBs within a CBG and determine an ACK or a negative acknowledgement (NACK) for each CBG of each CW. Then, subsequent steps may be conducted for each mode respectively as follows.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In some embodiments, for Mode-1, cross-CBG ACK/HACK bundling may be used. In this mode, ACK/HACK bundling may be performed per CW across all CBGs by a logical AND operation. It may result in 1 or 2 ACK/NACK bits per PDSCH transmission and essentially fallback to per-TB basis HARQ-ACK feedback. A non-limiting example of mode-1 is shown as <b>1000</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In some embodiments, for Mode-2, cross-CW ACK/NACK bundling may be used.
