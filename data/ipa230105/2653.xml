The bonding resin is also useful for example in composites, molding compounds and foundry applications.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Lignin, an aromatic polymer is a major constituent in e.g. wood, being the most abundant carbon source on Earth second only to cellulose. In recent years, with development and commercialization of technologies to extract lignin in a highly purified, solid and particularized form from the pulp-making process, it has attracted significant attention as a possible renewable substitute to primarily aromatic chemical precursors currently sourced from the petrochemical industry.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Lignin, being a polyaromatic network has been extensively investigated as a suitable substitute for phenol during production of phenol-formaldehyde adhesives. These are used during manufacturing of laminate and structural wood products such as plywood, oriented strand board and fiberboard. During synthesis of such adhesives, phenol, which may be partially replaced by lignin, is reacted with formaldehyde in the presence of either basic or acidic catalyst to form a highly cross-linked aromatic resins termed novolacs (when utilizing acidic catalysts) or resoles (when utilizing basic catalysts). Currently, only limited amounts of the phenol can be replaced by lignin due to the lower reactivity of lignin.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One problem when preparing resins comprising lignin is the use of formaldehyde, when the lignin is used in formaldehyde-containing resins, such as lignin-phenol-formaldehyde resins. Formaldehyde based resins emit formaldehyde, which is a toxic volatile organic compound. The present and proposed legislation directed to the lowering or elimination of formaldehyde emissions have led to the development of formaldehyde free resin for wood adhesive applications.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Jingxian Li R. et al. (Green Chemistry, 2018, 20, 1459-1466) describes preparation of a resin comprising glycerol diglycidyl ether and lignin, wherein the lignin is provided in solid form. One problem with the technology described in the article is a long pressing time and high pressing temperature. The 3 plies plywood sample was pressed at 150&#xb0; C. temperature for 15 minutes to fully cure the resins.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Engelmann G. and Ganster J. (Holzforschung, 2014, 68, 435-446) describes preparation of a biobased epoxy resin with low molecular weight kraft lignin and pyrogallol, wherein the lignin component consists of an acetone extraction from Kraft lignin.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It has now surprisingly been found that it is possible to easily prepare a bonding resin in which the use of formaldehyde can be avoided. It has also been found that an improved bonding resin can be achieved by providing lignin in the form of an aqueous solution comprising ammonia and/or an organic base. By providing the lignin in the form of an aqueous solution comprising ammonia and/or an organic base, the step of milling of lignin particles can be avoided, avoiding lignin lump formation and the use of dispersing agent.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It has been found that when lignin is provided in form of an aqueous solution comprising ammonia and/or organic base, the phenolic hydroxyl groups in the lignin structure are deprotonated and free to react with the epoxide groups. This improves the reactivity and performance of the binder. Therefore, providing the lignin in the form of a an aqueous solution comprising ammonia and/or an organic base speeds up the reaction significantly and hence reduces the pressing time and enables the use of a lower pressing temperature for curing the bonding resin, when manufacturing for example laminates, mineral wool insulation, glass wool insulation and wood products such as plywood, oriented strandboard (OSB), laminated veneer lumber (LVL), medium density fiberboards (MDF), high density fiberboards (HDF), parquet flooring, curved plywood, veneered particleboards, veneered MDF or particle boards. The bonding resin is also useful for example in composites, molding compounds and foundry applications.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, by providing lignin in the form an aqueous solution of lignin comprising ammonia and/or an organic base the risk of degrading for example glass wool and mineral wool fibers is minimized.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is thus directed to a method for preparing a bonding resin, wherein an aqueous solution of lignin comprising ammonia and/or an organic base is mixed with one or more crosslinker selected from glycerol diglycidyl ether, polyglycerol diglycidyl ether, polyglycerol polyglycidyl ether, glycerol triglycidyl ether, sorbitol polyglycidyl ether, alkoxylated glycerol polyglycidyl ether, trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether, trimethylolpropane diglycidyl ether, polyoxypropylene glycol diglycidylether, polyoxypropylene glycol triglycidyl ether, diglycidylether of cyclohexane dimethanol, resorcinol diglycidyl ether, isosorbide diglycidyl ether, pentaerythritol tetraglycidyl ether, ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether having 2-9 ethylene glycol units, propylene glycol diglycidyl ether having 1-5 propylene glycol units, diglycidyl-, triglycidyl- or polyglycidyl-ether of a carbohydrate, diglycidyl-, triglycidyl- or polyglycidyl-ester of a carbohydrate, diglycidyl-ether or diglycidyl ester of salicylic acid, vanillic acid, or 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, an epoxidized or glycidyl substituted plant-based phenolic compound (such as tannin, cardanol, cardol, anacardic acid) or epoxidized plant-based oil (such as rapeseed oil, linseed oil, soy bean oil), tris(4-hydroxyphenyl) methane triglycidyl ether, N,N-bis(2,3-epoxypropyl)aniline, p-(2,3-epoxypropoxy-N,N-bis(2,3-epoxypropyl)aniline, diglycidyl ether of bis-hydroxymethylfuran, and/or diglycidyl ether of terminal diol having a linear carbon chain of 3-6 carbon atoms, and a crosslinker having functional groups selected from glycidyl amine, diglycidyl amine, triglycidyl amine, polyglycidyl amine, glycidyl amide, diglycidyl amide, triglycidyl amide, polyglycidyl amide, glycidyl ester, diglycidyl ester, triglycidyl ester, polyglycidyl ester, glycidyl azide, diglycidyl azide, triglycidyl azide, polyglycidyl azide, glycidyl methacrylate, diglycidyl methacrylate, triglycidyl methacrylate, or polyglycidyl methacrylate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One aspect of the present invention is a method for preparing a bonding resin, wherein an aqueous solution of lignin comprising ammonia and/or an organic base is mixed with one or more cross-linkers and/or one or more glycidyl ethers, wherein the cross-linker has an epoxy index above 4 eq/kg.

Other glycidyl ethers having two to nine alkylene glycol groups (such as 2-4 alkylene glycol groups or 2-6 alkylene glycol groups) can be used, such as diethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, triethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, dipropylene glycol diglycidyl ether and tripropylene diglycidyl ether. As the chain lengths between two glycidyl ether groups gets longer, the resin becomes more flexible, which may negatively influence its performance. It results in an adhesive during curing. Other suitable crosslinkers include crosslinkers having functional groups selected from glycidyl amine, diglycidyl amine, triglycidyl amine, polyglycidyl amine, glycidyl amide, diglycidyl amide, triglycidyl amide, polyglycidyl amide, glycidyl ester, diglycidyl ester, triglycidyl ester, polyglycidyl ester, glycidyl azide, diglycidyl azide, triglycidyl azide, polyglycidyl azide, glycidyl methacrylate, diglycidyl methacrylate, triglycidyl methacrylate and polyglycidyl methacrylate. Typically, the bonding resin according to the present invention is and applied to the surfaces of for example veneers, such as in the manufacture of plywood. When the veneers are pressed together under heating, the cross-linking in the bonding resin takes place, resulting in an adhesive.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">An aqueous solution of lignin comprising ammonia and/or an organic base can be prepared by methods known in the art, such as by mixing lignin and ammonia and/or organic base with water. The pH of the aqueous solution of lignin comprising ammonia and/or an organic base is preferably in the range of from 10 to 14.

The bonding resin may also comprise plasticizer. As used herein, the term &#x201c;plasticizer&#x201d; refers to an agent that, when added to lignin, makes the lignin softer and more flexible, to increase its plasticity by lowering the glass transition temperature (Tg) and improve its flow behavior. Examples of plasticizers include polyols, alkyl citrates, organic carbonates, phthalates, adipates, sebacates, maleates, benzoates, trimellitates and organophosphates.

Alkyl citrates include for example triethyl citrate, tributyl citrate, acetyl triethyl citrate and trimethyl citrate. Organic carbonates include for example ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, glycerol carbonate and vinyl carbonate.
