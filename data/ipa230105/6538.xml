Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Circuits and related techniques disclosed herein relate generally to gallium nitride (GaN) power conversion devices. More specifically, devices, circuits and related techniques disclosed herein relate to GaN integrated circuits where a gate driver integrated circuit (IC) can be utilized to harvest energy from an input pulse width modulated (PWM) signal for powering the gate driver IC, eliminating a need for a power supply for the gate driver IC. In some embodiments, the gate driver IC can be integrated with a GaN power transistor in a package to form an integrated GaN power device where the integrated GaN power device can be a pin to pin compatible replacement for a discrete silicon power MOSFET and its driving circuits. In various embodiments, the gate driver IC can store the harvested energy from the PWM signal and continue to function and drive the GaN power transistor even when the PWM signal is in a low state as explained further in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the gate driver IC can include various protection circuits to keep the GaN power transistor in its safe operating area as summarized here and described in more detail below. More specifically, in some embodiments, the IC may include a pull-down transistor for pulling down the gate voltage of the GaN power transistor. The pull-down transistor may be integrated into the IC or integrated within the same die as the GaN transistor. The IC may drive the gate of the pull-down transistor as explained further in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In various embodiments, the IC can include a pull-up transistor. The pull-up transistor can enable a PWM signal to drive the gate of the GaN power transistor to a high state. In some embodiments, the IC may include clamping circuits that can protect the GaN power transistor and the internal circuitry of the IC. The clamping circuits can enable relatively high operating voltages for the PWM, for example 10 to 30 V, while allowing the gate of the GaN transistor to be kept within its safe operating region, for example, below 6.0 V. As appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure, the operating voltages can be set to any suitable value. The operation of the pull-up transistor and the clamping circuits are described in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the IC may include a saturation current protection circuit. The saturation current protection circuit may sense a voltage at the drain of the GaN power transistor and trigger a protection circuit to prevent the GaN transistor from entering or staying into its saturation region. As understood by those skilled in the art, the GaN transistor may operate normally in its linear operating region, however if the GaN transistor enters into its saturation operating region, the drain current can increase with a corresponding drain voltage increase, which is undesirable in power conversion applications. In some embodiments, the saturation protection circuit can use a depletion mode (D-mode) GaN transistor to sense the drain voltage of the GaN transistor and shut down the GaN transistor when saturation is sensed. The saturation protection circuit is discussed in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In various embodiments, the IC may include a turn-on dv/dt control circuit by utilizing an external resistor in series with the PWM signal. DV/dt control circuits are discussed in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-C</figref> and <b>8</b>. In various embodiments, the IC may include a turn-off dI/dt control circuit by utilizing package bondwire inductances.

In this way, a capacitance of the gate <b>208</b> can be charged causing the GaN power transistor <b>202</b> to go into a conductive state. By setting a value for the impedance element <b>804</b>, a user can control a turn-on dV/dt of the GaN power transistor <b>202</b>. In this way, ringing and oscillations can be prevented, thereby keeping the GaN power transistor <b>202</b> in its safe operating area (SOA). The pull-up transistor <b>814</b> can act as a clamp to keep the GaN power transistor <b>202</b> in its SOA. The clamp circuit <b>853</b> can set a voltage at the gate <b>816</b> in such a way that a large portion of the input signal voltage may drop across the drain <b>818</b> to source <b>820</b>. For example, a GaN power transistor may have a 7 V rating. The disclosed dV/dt control circuit can keep the GaN power transistor in its SOA when the input signal <b>278</b> may be, for example, at 10 to 20 V. As appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure, disclosed turn-on dV/dt control circuits can control the dV/dt for other voltage values at the input signal, for example, 1 to 50 V. Further, as appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, disclosed turn-on dV/dt control circuits may utilize external impedance elements to control the dV/dt. In various embodiments, the impedance element can include one or more passive components. In some embodiments, the impedance element can be a resistive element, while in other embodiments impedance element can include a resistive element and a capacitive element, where the capacitive element is coupled in parallel to the resistive element. In various embodiments, the impedance element may include a network of resistive and capacitive elements. In some embodiments, gate <b>816</b> may be controlled by other logic circuits instead of the clamp circuit <b>853</b>. In various embodiments, clamp circuit <b>853</b> can be similar to the clamping circuit <b>295</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">When signal <b>278</b> goes low, a charge on the gate <b>208</b> can discharge through the body diode <b>819</b>, impedance element <b>808</b> and unidirectional current conductor <b>810</b>. In this way, the charge of the gate <b>208</b> can be discharged, thus a voltage at the gate <b>208</b> can go low causing the GaN power transistor <b>202</b> to go into a non-conductive state. By setting a value for the impedance element <b>808</b>, a user can control a turn-off dV/dt of the GaN power transistor <b>202</b>. In this way, ringing and oscillations can be prevented, thereby keeping the GaN power transistor in the non-conductive state. Furthermore, the logic and control circuit <b>812</b> can sense a voltage at the gate <b>208</b>. When the voltage drops to a value below a threshold, the logic and control circuit <b>812</b> may turn on the pull-down transistor <b>822</b> after a relatively small period.

Circuit <b>900</b> can be used to mitigate the relatively high parasitic inductances of TO-247 or TOLL packages. Circuit <b>900</b> can include a GaN power transistor <b>926</b> with a source <b>928</b>, a gate <b>924</b> and a drain <b>922</b>. In some embodiments, the GaN power transistor can be connected within its package by connecting bondwires between GaN transistor die and its package. The bondwires can have inductances associated with them. Circuit <b>900</b> shows an inductance <b>920</b> of a bondwire with an inductance value L. For example, bondwire inductance can be created by a down-bond between a source <b>928</b> of the GaN power transistor <b>926</b> and a package pad. Element <b>918</b> represents inductance of package to the printed circuit board. The bondwire inductance L of <b>920</b> can be utilized to sense rate of change of current as a function of time (dI/dt) in the source of the GaN power transistor <b>926</b>. When the GaN power transistor is turned off, the current through the source of the GaN power device decreases. This can cause a value of a voltage across inductance <b>920</b>, which is given by L&#xd7;dI/dt to change rapidly. The voltage across inductance <b>920</b> is sensed by resistors <b>914</b> and <b>916</b>. Resistor <b>914</b> is connected a cathode <b>919</b> of a diode <b>912</b> and resistor <b>916</b> is connected to an anode <b>917</b> of diode <b>912</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">The sensed voltage is fed back into a source <b>910</b> of a pull-down transistor <b>904</b>. A drain <b>902</b> of the transistor <b>904</b> can be connected to a gate <b>924</b> of the GaN power transistor <b>926</b>. In some embodiments, the pull-down transistor <b>904</b> can be a silicon transistor, while in other embodiments, it can a GaN transistor, which can be integrated within the same die as that of the GaN power transistor <b>926</b>. A voltage at the source <b>910</b> of the pull-down transistor <b>904</b> can increase when a voltage across inductance <b>920</b> increases because the voltage across inductance <b>920</b> is fed back into source <b>910</b> with a positive polarity. When the voltage at source <b>910</b> of the pull-down transistor <b>904</b> increases, the gate-to-source voltage (V<sub>gs</sub>) can decrease, which can cause pull transistor <b>904</b> to have less drive. This in turn can reduce a turn-off speed of the GaN power transistor <b>926</b>. The more voltage that is developed across inductance <b>920</b>, the less drive pull-down transistor <b>904</b> can have, which in turn can slow down the turn-off of the GaN power transistor <b>926</b>. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that transistor <b>904</b>, resistors <b>914</b> and <b>916</b> and diode <b>912</b> can be formed in GaN and integrated within the same die as that of GaN power transistor <b>926</b>, or can be form in silicon, or some components may be formed in GaN while other components are formed in silicon.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">In some embodiments, feedback of voltage across inductance <b>920</b> can be used to modulate a voltage on gate <b>906</b> of the pull-down transistor <b>904</b> in order to reduce the pull down drive and to slow down turn-off of GaN power transistor <b>926</b>. The source <b>910</b> of transistor <b>904</b> can be connected to source <b>928</b> of GaN power transistor <b>926</b>, while a voltage at gate <b>906</b> of pull-down transistor <b>904</b> is modulated in order to adjust the drive capability of the pull-down transistor <b>904</b>. In various embodiments, inductance L of inductance <b>920</b> can vary because of manufacturing variations. Circuit <b>900</b> can compensate for the variations of the value of inductance L. For example, if value of inductance L decrease, the signal developed across inductance <b>920</b> decreases as well, however this signal will be adequate to provide a feedback into the pull-down transistor <b>904</b> since the value of L&#xd7;dI/dt of the GaN power transistor has decreased also.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">In some embodiments, the turn-off dI/dt control can control a voltage spike across the driver as well as across drain-source of the power transistor <b>926</b>. The turn-off dI/dt control can mitigate these spikes irrespective of the value of the inductance L. For example, if value of inductance L decrease, then turn-off dI/dt control system can mitigate higher dI/dt. The turn-off dI/dt control can mitigate the voltage spikes so long as L&#xd7;dI/dt turns on the feedback loop which includes resistor <b>916</b>, diode <b>912</b> and resistor <b>914</b>. In various embodiments, diode <b>912</b> can provide feedback of the positive voltage across the bondwire inductance <b>920</b> (i.e., node <b>930</b> being positive relative to node <b>932</b>). In this way, the turn-off dI/dt control system can prevent voltage ringing being feedback into the system, which can cause high frequency oscillation. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the described turn-off dI/dt control system and circuit can be utilized in any power conversion circuit including a power transistor, including, but not limited t, GaN and/or silicon power transistors when a bondwire inductance <b>920</b> is available.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0000">Gate Driver Circuit with Hysteresis</p><p id="p-0096" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates schematic of a gate driver circuit <b>1000</b> with hysteresis according to an embodiment of the disclosure.

Comparator <b>1094</b> can monitor a voltage at the gate of the GaN power transistor <b>1024</b> through the resistor divider. When gate of the GaN power transistor <b>1024</b> is low, a drain <b>1016</b> of Transistor <b>1010</b> is low, thus Transistor <b>1010</b> can turn on and charge the gate of the GaN power transistor <b>1024</b>.
