The tunnel construction is carried out in rock and soil mass, and such a working environment is full of high complexity and uncertainty as well as sudden disasters. Therefore, how to ensure the safety of the construction has always been a difficult problem for the engineers. It becomes more important to distinguish the lithology of surrounding rock for tunnel construction in the long-term engineering practice and exploration. A large number of engineering examples have proved that the lithology of surrounding rock and cross-section rock plays an important role in the grading of surrounding rock strength, selection of construction methods, and advanced prediction of disasters during tunnel construction. The lithology of surrounding rock even determines the cost of tunnel construction and the safety of later operation to a certain extent. Therefore, the lithology of the surrounding rock and the cross section is necessarily identified during the tunnel construction to ensure the tunnel safety and quality.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The inventors found that lithology of surrounding rock is mainly identified by manual work at present. Due to the differences in the experience and level of the staff and the existence of personal subjectivity, the results of lithology identification are often quite different, the accuracy cannot be guaranteed, and the actual needs of a project cannot be well met. Moreover, due to the tough and harsh environment of a tunnel, manually identifying the lithology by the staff is very intensive and takes a long time, and it is difficult to guarantee the efficiency.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to solve the above problems, a first aspect of the present disclosure provides a system for identifying lithology based on images and XRF mineral inversion.
