The aluminum-air battery is an air battery using oxygen in air as a cathode active material. The aluminum-air battery of the present embodiment comprises a cathode (air electrode) <b>1</b>, an anode <b>2</b> constituted to contain aluminum, and an electrolyte <b>3</b> arranged between the cathode <b>1</b> and the anode <b>2</b>, in the same manner as conventional aluminum-air batteries. Unlike conventional aluminum-air batteries, the aluminum-air battery of the present embodiment does not require one side of the cathode <b>1</b> to be exposed to the atmosphere. Instead, an open hole H is formed in the anode <b>2</b> to release the gas generated in the anode <b>2</b> into the atmosphere and to take in oxygen from air for use in the cathode reaction in the cathode <b>1</b>. Note that the electrolyte <b>3</b> may be either electrolytic solution or solid electrolyte. The electrolytic solution refers to a case in which the electrolyte <b>3</b> is in a liquid form. Also, the solid electrolyte refers to a case in which the electrolyte <b>3</b> is in a gel form or solid form.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Configuration of Cathode</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0026">The cathode <b>1</b> is constituted by a co-continuous body having a three dimensional network structure formed by an integrated plurality of nanostructures having branches. The co-continuous body is a porous body and has an integrated structure. The nanostructure is a nanosheet or nanofiber. Since the integrated plurality of nanostructures have branches, in the co-continuous body having a three dimensional network structure, the branched portion between the nanostructures is deformable, providing a stretchable structure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0027">The nanosheet may be constituted by, for example, at least one of carbon, iron oxide, manganese oxide, zinc oxide, molybdenum oxide, and molybdenum sulfide. The elements of these materials may be constituted by 22 kinds of elements (C, O, H, N, P, K, S, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, B, Zn, Cu, Mo, Cl, Si, Na, Se, Co, Al, and V) indispensable to the growth of plants.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0028">It is important that the nanosheet has electrical conductivity. The nanosheet is a sheet-like substance having a thickness of 1 nm to 1 &#x3bc;m and having planar longitudinal and lateral lengths that are 100 or more times the thickness. Examples of the nanosheet made of carbon include graphene. The nanosheet may be a roll-like sheet or wave-like sheet, may be curved or bent, or may have any shape.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0029">The nanofiber may be constituted by at least one of carbon, iron oxide, manganese oxide, zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, molybdenum oxide, molybdenum sulfide, and cellulose (carbonized cellulose). The elements of these materials may be constituted by 16 kinds of essential elements (C, O, H, N, P, K, S, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, B, Zn, Cu, Mo, and Cl) indispensable to the growth of plants.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0030">It is important that the nanofiber also has electrical conductivity. The nanofiber is a fibrous substance having a diameter of 1 nm to 1 &#x3bc;m and a length that is 100 or more times the diameter. The nanofiber may be a hollow fiber or coil-like fiber, or may have any shape. Note that, when the nanofiber is constituted by cellulose, the cellulose is provided with electrical conductivity by carbonization, as will be mentioned later.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Method for Producing Cathode (Brief Description)</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0031">A method for producing the cathode <b>1</b> will be briefly described. For example, the co-continuous body, which is to be the cathode <b>1</b>, can be fabricated by at first obtaining a frozen body by freezing a sol or gel in which the nanostructures are dispersed (a freezing step), and drying this frozen body in a vacuum (a drying step). A predetermined bacterium can produce a gel in which nanofibers made of any of iron oxide, manganese oxide, silicon, and cellulose are dispersed (a gel production step).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0032">Also, the co-continuous body may be obtained by allowing a predetermined bacterium to produce a gel in which nanofibers made of cellulose are dispersed (a gel production step), and heating and carbonizing this gel in an inert gas atmosphere (a carbonization step).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0033">The co-continuous body constituting the cathode <b>1</b> has, for example, an average pore size of preferably 0.1 to 50 m, and more preferably 0.1 to 2 m. This value of the average pore size is a value determined by a mercury press-in method.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0034">For the cathode <b>1</b>, it is not necessary to use an additional material, such as a binder for a case in which carbon powder is used, and this is advantageous in both cost and environmental conservation.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Electrode Reactions at Cathode and Anode</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0035">Electrode reactions in the cathode <b>1</b> and the anode <b>2</b> will be described. Here, as a reaction example, aluminum is used for the anode <b>2</b>. When using an anode that will be an n-valent metal ion, there occurs a reaction that releases n electrons. In the cathode reaction, oxygen in the air and the electrolyte <b>3</b> come in contact with each other on the surface of the cathode <b>1</b> having electrical conductivity, and thus a reaction indicated by &#x201c;&#xbd;O<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O+2e<sup>&#x2212;</sup>&#x2192;2OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> . . . (1)&#x201d; progresses. On the other hand, in the anode reaction, a reaction &#x201c;Al+3OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup>&#x2192;Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>+3e<sup>&#x2212;</sup> . . . (2)&#x201d; progresses in the anode <b>2</b> in contact with the electrolyte <b>3</b>, and the metal constituting the anode <b>2</b> releases electrons and is dissolved in the electrolyte <b>3</b> as a metal ion.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0036">Through these reactions, discharge between the cathode <b>1</b> and the anode <b>2</b> can be carried out. The overall reaction is &#x201c;2Al+3H<sub>2</sub>O+3/2O<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;2Al(OH)<sub>3 </sub>. . . (3)&#x201d;, and this reaction produces aluminum hydroxide. The theoretical electromotive force is about 2.7 V. The compounds involved in the reactions described above are shown along with the components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0037">As described above, in the aluminum-air battery, the reaction indicated by the formula (1) progresses on the surface of the cathode <b>1</b>, and therefore, it is presumably favorable to generate a large amount of reaction sites inside the cathode <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0038">The cathode <b>1</b> can be fabricated by a publicly known process such as molding carbon powder with a binder. As mentioned above, in the aluminum-air battery, it is important to generate a large amount of reaction sites inside the cathode <b>1</b>, and it is thus desirable that the cathode <b>1</b> should have a large specific surface area. For example, in the present embodiment, the specific surface area of the co-continuous body constituting the cathode <b>1</b> is preferably 200 m<sup>2</sup>/g % or more, and more preferably 300 m<sup>2</sup>/g or more.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0039">When the specific surface area of a conventional cathode <b>1</b> fabricated by molding carbon powder with a binder into a pellet is increased, the binding strength between the carbon powder particles is decreased and the structure is deteriorated. This makes stable discharge difficult and the discharge capacity is decreased.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0040">In contrast, according to the cathode <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, constituted by the co-continuous body having a three dimensional network structure formed by an integrated plurality of nanostructures having branches as mentioned above, the conventional problems mentioned above can be solved and the discharge capacity can be increased.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Further Configuration of Cathode</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0041">The further configuration of the cathode <b>1</b> will be described. The cathode <b>1</b> may support a catalyst. The catalyst may be constituted by at least one metal among iron, manganese, zinc, copper, and molybdenum, or a metal oxide of at least one metal among calcium, iron, manganese, zinc, copper, and molybdenum. Note that the elements of these materials may be constituted from metals included in 16 kinds of essential elements indispensable to the growth of plants, and may have catalytic ability. As the metal, iron, manganese, and zinc are preferable, and an oxide formed of one of these metals or a complex oxide formed of two or more of these metals is preferable. In particular, manganese oxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>) is suitable. Manganese oxide is preferable because it exhibits particularly excellent catalytic performance in the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0042">In addition, it is also preferable that the metal oxide, which is to be the catalyst, should be an amorphous hydrate. For example, it may be a hydrate of the transition metal oxide. More specifically, it may be a manganese oxide (IV)-n hydrate. Note that n is the number of moles of H<sub>2</sub>O based on 1 mol of MnO<sub>2</sub>. Excellent battery performance can be obtained by allowing the surface of the co-continuous body constituting the cathode <b>1</b> to support the manganese oxide hydrate as nanosized fine particles in a highly dispersed state.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0043">For example, excellent battery performance can be exhibited by using, as the cathode <b>1</b>, the co-continuous body of the cathode <b>1</b> onto which a manganese oxide hydrate (MnO<sub>2</sub>.nH<sub>2</sub>O) is highly dispersed and attached (added) as nanosized fine particles. The content of the catalyst contained in the cathode <b>1</b> is 0.1 to 70% by weight, and is preferably 1 to 30% by weight based on the total weight of the cathode <b>1</b>. The battery performance is greatly improved when a transition metal oxide is added as the catalyst to the cathode <b>1</b>. The cathode <b>1</b> and the electrolyte <b>3</b> come in contact with each other, and an oxygen gas in the atmosphere is supplied at the same time, thereby forming a triphasic interface of electrolyte-electrode-gas (oxygen) as mentioned above. If the catalyst is highly active in this triphasic interface site, oxygen reduction (discharge) on the electrode surface smoothly progresses, and the battery performance is greatly improved. At this time, since the interaction between the catalyst and oxygen, which is the cathode active material, is strong, the catalyst can adsorb many oxygen species onto its surface or can occlude oxygen species in oxygen vacancies.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0044">As described above, the oxygen species adsorbed onto the surface of the metal oxide constituting the catalyst or occluded in the oxygen vacancies are used in an oxygen reduction reaction as the oxygen source (an active intermediate reactant) of the above formula (1), and the above reaction readily progresses. Examples of materials that effectively function as the catalyst include a metal oxide such as manganese oxide. Instead of the metal oxide, a metal itself can also be used as the catalyst, and the metal functions in the same manner as the above metal oxide.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0045">In the aluminum-air battery, as mentioned above, it is desirable that the reaction sites [the triphasic portions of electrolyte-electrode-air (oxygen) described above], which cause the electrode reaction, should be present as many as possible in order to increase the battery efficiency. From such a viewpoint, it is important that a large amount of the triphasic portions are also present on the surface of the catalyst, and it is preferable that the specific surface area of the catalyst should be large. The specific surface area of the catalyst made of a metal or metal oxide may be 0.1 to 1,000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and preferably 1 to 500 m<sup>2</sup>/g. Note that the specific surface area is obtained by a publicly known BET method using N<sub>2 </sub>adsorption.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0046">The cathode <b>1</b> to which the catalyst is added can be produced by a method for producing the cathode <b>1</b>, which will be mentioned later.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Anode</heading><p id="p-0047" num="0047">Next, the anode <b>2</b> will be described.

Citric acid, malic acid, and oxalic acid are used as fertilizers.

Therefore, it is particularly preferable to use citric acid, malic acid, oxalic acid, or a salt formed therefrom as the electrolyte <b>3</b> because they not only exert no influence even when the electrolyte leaks out into soil, but also function as a fertilizer.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0051">In addition, as another material constituting the electrolyte <b>3</b>, an aromatic anion exchange polymer solid electrolyte or inorganic laminar compound based solid electrolyte, having ionic conductivity by which metal ions and hydroxide ions pass through the electrolyte, may be used.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="2">Others</heading><p id="p-0052" num="0052">Note that, in addition to the configuration described above, the aluminum-air battery can include structural members such as a separator, a battery case, and a metal foil (for example, a copper foil), and elements required for general aluminum-air batteries.

Next, in step S<b>102</b>, a co-continuous body is obtained by drying the obtained frozen body in a vacuum (a drying step).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0056">Hereinafter, more detailed description will be given for each step. The freezing step of step S<b>101</b> is a step of maintaining or constructing a three dimensional network structure by using a plurality of nanostructures as the raw material of a stretchable co-continuous body having the three dimensional network structure formed of the nanostructures integrated through a noncovalent bond.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0057">Here, the gel means a solid dispersion medium having lost fluidity due to the three dimensional network structure of the nanostructures, which are the dispersoids. Specifically, the gel means a dispersion system having a shear elastic modulus of 102 to 106 Pa. The dispersion medium of the gel may be an aqueous medium such as water (H<sub>2</sub>O), or an organic medium such as a carboxylic acid, methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH), ethanol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH), propanol (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>OH), n-butanol, isobutanol, n-butylamine, dodecane, an unsaturated fatty acid, ethylene glycol, heptane, hexadecane, isoamyl alcohol, octanol, isopropanol, acetone or glycerin, and two or more kinds thereof may be mixed.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0058">Next, the sol means a colloid formed of a dispersion medium and the nanostructures, which are the dispersoids. Specifically, the sol means a dispersion system having a shear elastic modulus of 1 Pa or less. The dispersion medium of the sol may be an aqueous medium such as water, or an organic medium such as a carboxylic acid, methanol, ethanol, propanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, n-butylamine, dodecane, an unsaturated fatty acid, ethylene glycol, heptane, hexadecane, isoamyl alcohol, octanol, isopropanol, acetone or glycerin, and two or more kinds thereof may be mixed.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0059">The freezing step of step S<b>101</b> is performed by, for example, accommodating the sol or gel in which the nanostructures are dispersed in an appropriate container such as a test tube, and cooling the surrounding of the test tube in a coolant such as liquid nitrogen, thereby freezing the sol or gel accommodated in the test tube. The approach of freezing is not particularly limited as long as the dispersion medium of the gel or sol can be cooled to the freezing point or lower, and the dispersion medium may also be cooled with a freezer or the like.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0060">By freezing the gel or sol, the dispersion medium loses fluidity and the dispersoids are fixed, thereby constructing the three dimensional network structure. Also, in the freezing step, the specific surface area can be adjusted freely by adjusting the concentration of the gel or sol, and the specific surface area of the obtained co-continuous body is increased as the concentration of the gel or sol is decreased. If the concentration becomes 0.01% by weight or less, however, it becomes difficult for the dispersoids to construct the three dimensional network structure. Therefore, it is suitable that the concentration of the dispersoids should be 0.01 to 10% by weight.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0061">By constructing the three dimensional network structure having a large specific surface area with the nanostructures such as nanofibers or nanosheets, this structure has excellent stretchability when compressed or extended because the pores play the role of a cushion. Specifically, the co-continuous body desirably has a distortion of 5% or more, and more desirably 10% or more at the elastic limit.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0062">If the dispersoids are not fixed by freezing, the dispersoids are aggregated along with the evaporation of the dispersion medium in the subsequent drying step, and therefore, a sufficiently high specific surface area cannot be obtained and it becomes difficult to fabricate the co-continuous body having the three dimensional network structure.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0063">Next, the drying step of step S<b>102</b> will be described. The drying step is a step of, from the frozen body obtained in the freezing step, taking the dispersoids (a plurality of microstructures that have been integrated) maintaining or constructing the three dimensional network structure out of the dispersion medium.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0064">In the drying step, the frozen body obtained in the freezing step is dried in a vacuum, thereby sublimating the frozen dispersion medium from the solid state. For example, the drying step is performed by accommodating the obtained frozen body in an appropriate container such as a flask, and evacuating the inside of the container. Since the frozen body is placed in the vacuum atmosphere, the sublimation point of the dispersion medium is lowered, and this allows even a substance that is not sublimated at ordinary pressure to be sublimated.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0065">The degree of vacuum in the drying step varies depending on the dispersion medium to be used, and is not particularly limited as long as it enables sublimation of the dispersion medium. For example, when water is used as the dispersion medium, the degree of vacuum must be set such that the pressure is 0.06 MPa or less, but the drying time is prolonged because heat is deprived of as latent heat of sublimation. For this reason, it is suitable that the degree of vacuum should be 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>to 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>Pa. Furthermore, upon the drying, heat may also be applied by using a heater or the like.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0066">In a method for performing drying in the atmosphere, the state of the dispersion medium is changed from solid to liquid, and subsequently from liquid to gaseous, and therefore, the frozen body is changed into a liquid state and becomes fluidic again in the dispersion medium, thereby demolishing the three dimensional network structure of a plurality of nanostructures. For this reason, it is difficult for the drying in the atmospheric pressure atmosphere to fabricate a stretchable co-continuous body.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="2">Method 2 for Producing Cathode</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0067">Next, a method 2 for producing the cathode <b>1</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow chart for describing the method 2 for producing the cathode <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0068">At first, in step S<b>201</b>, a gel in which nanofibers made of any of iron oxide, manganese oxide and cellulose are dispersed is produced by a predetermined bacterium (a gel producing step).

In particular, the discharge capacity of salts not containing magnesium ions was large.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0191">The improvement in characteristics as described above is presumably because, by using the electrolytic solution containing no chloride ion, corrosion of the anode <b>2</b> by chloride ions could be suppressed. Also, the reason for small discharge capacities of electrolytic solutions containing magnesium ions or calcium ions is presumably because the pH of the aqueous solution becomes higher as the battery reaction progresses, at which time magnesium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide with low solubility is deposited, inhibiting the battery reaction.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0192">As mentioned above, according to Example 8, the use of salts not containing chloride ions, magnesium ions, or calcium ions achieves improvement in the discharge capacity.

In Comparative Example 1, a cylindrical aluminum-air battery was fabricated using the same cathode as in Example 1 and an anode not having open holes. The conditions of a discharge test for the battery were the same as in Example 1. The average discharge voltage of the aluminum-air battery according to Comparative Example 1 is as shown in Table 1.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0197">As shown in Table 1, the average discharge voltage of Comparative Example 1 was 0.20 V, the value of which is smaller than that in Example 1. Also, when the cathode <b>1</b> of Comparative Example 1 was observed after the measurement, the cathode inside the separator was completely submerged in water. Furthermore, it was observed that, due to the hydrogen generated from the anode <b>2</b> by contact with the electrolytic solution, a gap was created between the separator and the anode <b>2</b>, and the anode part not in contact with the separator was not used for the battery reaction, resulting in a decrease in the reaction area, which not only caused the resistance of the battery, but also caused a reduction in the capacity.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0198">From the above results, it was confirmed that the aluminum-air batteries of the present embodiment and Examples 1 to 9 are superior to the conventional aluminum-air batteries in terms of voltage and capacity.</p><heading id="h-0042" level="2">Effects</heading><p id="p-0208" num="0199">As described above, the present invention uses the cathode <b>1</b> constituted by a co-continuous body having a three dimensional structure formed by an integrated plurality of nanostructures having branches, and therefore, there is no need to use a binder to form a cathode as in the past.

As a result, the structure of the battery cell can be simplified.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0200">In addition, according to the present invention, since the anode <b>2</b> and the housing <b>4</b> are constituted by a naturally degradable material, the disposal of the air battery at the time of use and disposal becomes easier. Specifically, the air battery of the present invention does not contain any metal elements other than the elements used in fertilizers for soil or metals contained in rain water and sea water, and is also naturally degradable, which extremely decreases the environmental load.
