In the optical receiver circuit <b>1000</b>A, when the optical signal LA incident from the rear surface of the PD chip <b>10</b> is received by a light-receiving unit (a light-receiving element) of the PD element, an electrical signal is generated. A high-frequency signal due to a photocurrent of the electrical signal is transmitted from the light-receiving unit of the PD chip <b>10</b> via the anode electrode pad <b>11</b> and the bonding wire <b>51</b> to a transmission system which extends to the signal pad <b>21</b> of the TIA chip <b>20</b>.

However, due to the presence of the through-hole <b>41</b> into which the optical signal LA is to be incident, the return path is blocked and the return current flows so as to bypass the through-hole <b>41</b>. When a return current flows so as to bypass the return path in this manner, the problem described above arises.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a plan view showing another implementation example related to a conventional optical receiver circuit <b>1000</b>B for high-speed transmission. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a sectional view taken along a XIV-XIV direction of the optical receiver circuit <b>1000</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref>, the optical receiver circuit <b>1000</b>B differs from the optical receiver circuit <b>1000</b>A in that the optical receiver circuit <b>1000</b>B is configured to receive an input of optical signals LB of multiple channels with a back-illuminated PD chip <b>100</b> and output multichannel electrical signals of multiple channels.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the optical receiver circuit <b>1000</b>B, a front surface of a metalized PD submount <b>400</b> is mounted with the PD chip <b>100</b> and a chip capacitor <b>300</b>.

Therefore, signal wirings of the bonding wires <b>51</b> and <b>54</b> form a coplanar line, and even when the bonding wire <b>51</b> is slightly extended, an increase in impedance due to inductance of the bonding wire <b>51</b> is suppressed. As a result, preferable high-frequency characteristics can be produced.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0072">In addition, in the optical receiver circuit <b>1000</b>C, since a return current flows without bypassing a return path, high-frequency transmission characteristics do not degrade and the likelihood of occurrences of unnecessary resonance, radiation noise, and the like decreases.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0073">Specifically, for example, when the optical signal LA incident from the rear surface of the PD chip <b>10</b>C is received by a light-receiving unit (a light-receiving element) of the PD element, an electrical signal is generated. A high-frequency signal due to a photocurrent of the electrical signal is transmitted from the light-receiving unit of the PD chip <b>10</b>C via the anode electrode pad <b>11</b> and the bonding wire <b>51</b> to a transmission system which extends to the signal pad <b>21</b> of the TIA chip <b>20</b>. In this case, a return current flows in an opposite direction to a direction of transmission of the high-frequency signal of the photocurrent with respect to the transmission system.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0074">The return current is first routed through the bonding wire <b>54</b> which connects the anode electrode-side ground pad <b>13</b> of the PD chip <b>10</b>C and the ground pad <b>23</b> of the TIA chip <b>20</b> to each other. The return current is next routed through the bonding wire <b>53</b> which connects the anode electrode-side ground pad <b>13</b> and the cathode electrode-side ground pad <b>14</b> of the PD chip <b>10</b>C to each other. Furthermore, the return current is routed through the bonding wire <b>55</b> which connects the cathode electrode-side ground pad <b>14</b> of the PD chip <b>10</b>C and the ground potential of the PD submount <b>40</b> to each other and flows through the ground potential. As a result, the return current flowing through the ground potential of the PD submount <b>40</b> is no longer required to bypass the return path that is created by the through-hole <b>41</b> and, accordingly, occurrences of unnecessary resonance and radiation noise are suppressed and preferable high-frequency transmission characteristics are produced.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0075">In addition, the cathode electrode-side ground pad <b>14</b> of the PD chip <b>10</b>C and the ground potential of the PD submount <b>40</b> are electrically connected to each other by the bonding wire <b>55</b>. Therefore, there is no longer a constraint to make the gap between the PD chip <b>10</b>C and the TIA chip <b>20</b> wide enough to prevent interference with a capillary tool of a wire bonding device. Accordingly, the length of the bonding wire <b>51</b> which electrically connects the anode electrode pad <b>11</b> of the PD chip <b>10</b>C and the signal pad <b>21</b> of the TIA chip <b>20</b> to each other can be freely controlled.

Moreover, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, an abscissa represents normalized frequencies with a frequency corresponding to a transmission rate of a desired optical communication system as a reference value <b>1</b> and an ordinate displays a ratio of normalized light with respect to an electric conversion based on the transmission frequency characteristics of lane <b>1</b> as a gain dB.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> reveals that a ratio between the transmission frequency characteristics of lane <b>1</b> depicted by the bold line and characteristics of crosstalk from adjacent lane <b>0</b> depicted by a thin solid line represents a distance of 20 dB or more in terms of a difference value of normalized light/electric conversion gain with respect to the normalized frequency. In this manner, when ratios of crosstalk characteristics tend to differ from each other, high-frequency transmission characteristics are sustained in a stable manner and occurrences of unnecessary resonance and radiation noise are suppressed. As a result, in the optical receiver circuit <b>1000</b>E, the bonding wires <b>510</b> and <b>520</b> are not required to function as an antenna as in the case of the optical receiver circuit <b>1000</b>B, quality degradation of high-frequency transmission characteristics due to crosstalk is avoided, and quality is maintained in a highly reliable manner.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0112">Focusing on frequency characteristics, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> showing the optical receiver circuit <b>1000</b>B reveals that transmission frequency characteristics in the channel of lane <b>1</b> decline at a normalized frequency before reaching the reference value <b>1</b> and frequency characteristics have been degraded. By comparison, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> showing the optical receiver circuit <b>1000</b>E reveals that transmission frequency characteristics in the channel of lane <b>1</b> remain flat with respect to a normalized frequency until the reference value <b>1</b> is reached and frequency characteristics have been significantly improved.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0113">Specifically, in the optical receiver circuit <b>1000</b>B, a ratio between the transmission frequency characteristics in the channel of lane <b>1</b> and characteristics of crosstalk from an adjacent channel (a channel of lane <b>2</b>) approaches approximately 5 dB in a most degraded state. By comparison, in the optical receiver circuit <b>1000</b>E, since crosstalk is significantly suppressed, a ratio between the transmission frequency characteristics in the channel of lane <b>1</b> and characteristics of crosstalk from an adjacent channel (a channel of lane <b>0</b>) is separated by 20 dB or more. Accordingly, even in the optical receiver circuit <b>1000</b>E of multiple channels, preferable high-frequency transmission characteristics can be produced while suppressing occurrences of unnecessary resonance and radiation noise and reducing inter-channel crosstalk, and preferable transmission quality can be realized.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0114">When it is difficult to provide the bonding wire <b>550</b> which connects the cathode electrode-side ground pad <b>140</b> and the ground potential of the PD submount <b>400</b> to each other, a similar countermeasure to that of the first embodiment and the second embodiment may be performed.

In other words, an optical receiver circuit for multiple channels can be applied to configurations other than the configuration of four channels described in the third embodiment and, even in such cases, similar operational advantages are produced.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0117">In any case, in the optical receiver circuit for multiple channels, the light-receiving unit (light-receiving element) of the PD element and the TIA of the TIA chip <b>200</b> are respectively provided in plurality. In such a configuration, the first electrical conductor (including wiring patterns) is constituted by first electrical conductors of which the number is twice that of the plurality of light-receiving elements and each of which corresponds to each light-receiving element.
