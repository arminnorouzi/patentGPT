The contact surfaces where the engagement click <b>63</b> comes into contact with the groove sections <b>53</b>, that is, the first inclining surface <b>531</b>, the second inclining surface <b>532</b>, the first inclining surface <b>633</b>, and the second inclining surface <b>634</b>, can therefore incline with respect to the sliding direction of the slide plate <b>50</b>. Therefore, even in the state in which the engagement click <b>63</b> is urged by the torsional spring <b>65</b>, when the slide plate <b>50</b> is moved in the direction X<b>1</b> or X<b>2</b>, the engagement click <b>63</b> readily moves along the first inclining surface <b>531</b> or the second inclining surface <b>532</b> of any of the groove sections <b>53</b>, whereby the slide plate <b>50</b> is allowed to readily slide. Furthermore, the first inclining surface <b>531</b> and the second inclining surface <b>532</b> have the same inclination angle, so do the first inclining surface <b>633</b> and the second inclining surface <b>634</b> correspondingly. The slide plate <b>50</b> can therefore be moved in the directions X<b>1</b> and X<b>2</b> with a force having substantially the same magnitude. The user can therefore shorten and extend the band length with the force having substantially the same magnitude, whereby operability of the band length adjustment can be improved.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Since the guide grooves <b>44</b> are formed in the buckle cover <b>40</b>, and the plate section <b>51</b> of the slide plate <b>50</b> is inserted into the guide grooves <b>44</b>, the slide plate <b>50</b> moves stably without rattling. The band length can thus be adjusted in a stable, smooth manner. The guide grooves <b>44</b> are formed in the direction X<b>1</b> only to a position halfway along the first sidewall section <b>42</b> and the second sidewall section <b>43</b>, whereby the movement of the slide plate <b>50</b> in the direction X<b>1</b> can be restricted. The movement restriction prevents the slide plate <b>50</b> from colliding with and damaging the swing arm <b>60</b> and other components.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The slide plate <b>50</b> is provided with the movement restriction section <b>54</b>, which can restrict the movement of the slide plate <b>50</b> in the direction X<b>2</b>. The movement restriction prevents the engagement click <b>63</b> of the swing arm <b>60</b> from coming off the slide plate <b>50</b> or the slide plate <b>50</b> from coming off the buckle cover <b>40</b> when the slide plate <b>50</b> is pulled out and the band length is adjusted.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Variations</heading><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The present disclosure is not limited to the embodiment described above, and variations, improvements, and other modifications to the extent that the advantage of the present disclosure is achieved fall within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">For example, a first inclining surface <b>531</b>B and a second inclining surface <b>532</b>B, which form each of groove sections <b>53</b>B of a slide plate <b>50</b>B, may have inclination angles different from each other with respect to the sliding direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>. For example, an inclination angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b> of the first inclining surface <b>531</b>B is 40 degrees, and an inclination angle &#x3b8;<b>2</b> of the second inclining surface <b>532</b>B is 60 degrees. In this case, a first inclining surface <b>633</b>B and a second inclining surface <b>634</b>B of an engagement click <b>63</b>B of a swing arm <b>60</b>B are configured to be contactable with the first inclining surface <b>531</b>B and the second inclining surface <b>532</b>B.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Let &#x3b8;<b>1</b> be the inclination angle of the first inclining surface <b>531</b>B, which comes into contact with the first inclining surface <b>633</b>B of the engagement click <b>63</b>B when the slide plate <b>50</b>B is moved in the direction X<b>1</b> to shorten the band length. Let &#x3b8;<b>2</b> be the inclination angle of the second inclining surface <b>532</b>B, which comes into contact with the second inclining surface <b>634</b>B of the engagement click <b>63</b>B when the slide plate <b>50</b>B is moved in the direction X<b>2</b> to extend the band length. Since the inclination angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b> is smaller than the inclination angle &#x3b8;<b>2</b>, the slide plate <b>50</b>B can be moved more readily when the band length is shortened than when the band length is extended.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The relationship in magnitude of the inclination angles between the inclining surfaces of the groove sections <b>53</b> may be reversed from the relationship in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, in which case the slide plate <b>50</b>B can be moved more readily when the band length is extended than when the band length is shortened.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The configuration that restricts the rotation of the swing arm <b>60</b> in the second rotational direction R<b>2</b> is not limited to the configuration in which the restriction strip <b>64</b>, which comes into contact with the folding member <b>2</b>, is provided.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">For example, the folding member <b>2</b> is provided with a protruding element that comes into contact with the linkage wall <b>612</b> when the folding member <b>2</b> is accommodated in the buckle cover <b>40</b> to restrict the rotation of the swing arm <b>60</b> in the second rotational direction R<b>2</b>. A configuration that allows the rotation restriction without providing the restriction strip <b>64</b> of the swing arm <b>60</b> may therefore be employed.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The relative positional relationship between the swing arm <b>60</b> and the slide plate <b>50</b> along the axis-Z direction may be reversed. The groove sections <b>53</b> of the slide plate <b>50</b> are formed in the direction Z<b>2</b>, and the engagement click <b>63</b> of the swing arm <b>60</b> is caused to protrude in the direction Z<b>1</b>. The swing arm <b>60</b> and the slide plate <b>50</b> may be so configured that the engagement click <b>63</b> engages with the groove section <b>53</b> when the front end of the swing arm <b>60</b> moves in the direction Z<b>1</b>, and that the engagement click <b>63</b> disengages from the groove section <b>53</b> when the front end of the swing arm <b>60</b> moves in the direction Z<b>2</b>. In this case, the rotation of the swing arm <b>60</b> can be restricted by accommodating the folding member <b>2</b> in the buckle cover <b>40</b> and causing the folding member <b>2</b> to come into contact with the arm section <b>62</b> of the swing arm <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The configuration that locks the folding member <b>2</b> is not limited to the configuration using the hook <b>21</b> including the click <b>23</b> and the sliding lock member <b>80</b>. For example, the folding member <b>2</b> may be provided with a lock pin having a shaft section and an umbrella section located at the front end of the shaft section and having a diameter greater than that of the shaft section, and a button unit provided in the buckle cover <b>40</b> may be used to lock or unlock the lock pin. That is, the folding member <b>2</b> only needs to be locked with the folding member <b>2</b> accommodated in the buckle cover <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the embodiment described above, the torsional spring <b>65</b> produces the urging force for rotating the swing arm <b>60</b> and the urging force for moving the lock member <b>80</b> to the locked position, and the urging forces may instead be produced by separate springs. Furthermore, a spring that moves the lock member <b>80</b> to the locked position and a spring that urges the first button <b>71</b> and second button <b>72</b> in opposite directions may be provided separately.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The engagement click <b>63</b> of the swing arm <b>60</b> and the groove sections <b>53</b> of the slide plate <b>50</b> do not necessarily have a triangular cross section. For example, an engagement click or groove sections having an arcuate cross-sectional shape may be used. Furthermore, the movement of the slide plate may be locked when the engagement click engages with a groove section, and the movement of the slide plate may allow the swing arm to pivot when the rotation of the swing arm in the second rotational direction R<b>2</b> is not restricted.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The slide plate <b>50</b> is not necessarily guided along the guide grooves <b>44</b> of the buckle cover <b>40</b>.

The slide plate has a plurality of groove sections provided along the longitudinal direction. The swing arm includes an engagement click engageable with any of the groove sections of the slide plate and is supported rotatably in a first rotational direction in which the engagement click engages with any of the groove sections and in a second rotational direction in which the engagement click separates from the groove section. The spring urges the swing arm in the first rotational direction. The folding member restricts rotation of the swing arm in the second rotational direction when the folding member is accommodated in the buckle cover, and cancels the restriction of the rotation of the swing arm in the second rotational direction when the folding member is detached from the buckle cover.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the buckle according to the aspect of the present disclosure, when the folding member is detached from the buckle cover to cancel the restriction of the rotation of the swing arm in the second rotational direction, the engagement click of the swing arm can be separate from the groove section of the slide plate. Therefore, for example, configuring at least one of the engagement click and each of the groove sections to be an inclining surface allows the swing arm to be rotated in the second rotational direction against the urging force produced by the spring when the slide plate is caused to slide. The band length can therefore be readily adjusted simply by moving the slide plate without any button operation.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Furthermore, in the state in which the folding member is folded and accommodated in the buckle cover, rotation of the swing arm in the second rotational direction can be restricted, whereby the engagement of the engagement click with the groove section can be maintained. Therefore, the state in which the slide plate is not allowed to slide, that is, the band length cannot be adjusted can be achieved, whereby an unintentional increase or decrease in the band length can be reliably avoided.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Since the buckle is formed of a small number of parts, the buckle can be readily assembled, and the cost thereof can be reduced. Moreover, the band length can be adjusted in multiple steps in accordance with the number of groove sections by the distance between the groove sections in each step, whereby the band length can be readily fit the user's wrist or any other body site.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the buckle according to the aspect of the present disclosure, it is preferable that the swing arm includes a base rotatably supported by the buckle cover, an arm section extending from the base toward the slide plate and provided with an engagement click, and a restriction strip extending from the base toward the side opposite to the arm section, and that rotation of the swing arm in the second rotational direction is restricted when the restriction strip comes into contact with the folding member accommodated in the buckle cover.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In the buckle according to the aspect of the present disclosure, rotation of the swing arm in the second rotational direction is restricted by providing the swing arm with the restriction strip and causing the folding member to come into contact with the restriction strip, whereby the simple structure can reliably restrict the rotation of the swing arm.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">It is preferable that the buckle according to the present disclosure includes a button unit including a lock member urged by the spring and a first button and a second button protruding out of the buckle cover, that the folding member is provided with a hook, that when the lock member is urged by the spring, the lock member urges the first button and the second button in opposite directions and moves to a locked position where the hook is locked, and when the first button and the second button are pressed, the lock member is moved against the urging force produced by the spring to an unlocked position where the hook is unlocked.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the buckle according to the aspect of the present disclosure, in which the folding member is provided with the hook, and the locking member, which is moved to the locked position where the hook is locked and to the unlocked position where the hook is unlocked, is provided, the locked state in which the folding member is accommodated in the buckle cover and the unlocked state can be reliably achieved, and the lock member is moved to lock and unlock the hook, whereby durability of the buckle cover can be improved as compared, for example, with a case where the locked and unlocked states are achieved by deforming the sidewall sections or any other portion of the buckle cover.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Since the single spring serves as both the spring that urges the swing arm in the first rotational direction and the spring that urges the lock member to the locked position, and furthermore, the first button and the second button are urged in opposite directions when the lock member is moved to the locked position, the number of parts can be reduced, and the assembly can be readily performed, so that the cost can be reduced as compared with the case where separate springs urge the swing arm and the lock member.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In the buckle according to the aspect of the present disclosure, it is preferable that the engagement click of the swing arm has a triangular shape in the side view viewed in the axial direction of the axis of rotation of the swing arm, and that the groove sections of the slide plate each have an inverted triangular shape with which the engagement click is engageable.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In the buckle according to the aspect of the present disclosure, the engagement click has a triangular shape, and the groove sections each have an inverted triangular shape with which the engagement click can engage, whereby the contact surface where the engagement click comes into contact with any of the groove sections can incline with respect to the sliding direction of the slide plate. Therefore, even in the state in which the engagement click is urged by the spring, when the slide plate is moved in either the direction in which the slide plate is pushed into or pulled from the buckle cover, the engagement click can readily move along the inclining surface of each of the groove sections, whereby the slide plate can be readily caused to slide to adjust the band length when the rotation of the swing arm is not restricted.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the buckle according to the aspect of the present disclosure, it is preferable that the groove sections of the slide plate each have a first inclining surface with which the engagement click comes into contact when the slide plate is moved in the direction in which the slide plate approaches the axis of rotation of the swing arm and a second inclining surface with which the engagement click comes into contact when the slide plate is moved in the direction in which the slide plate moves away from the axis of rotation of the swing arm, and that the inclination angle of the first inclining surface with respect to the direction of the movement of the slide plate is smaller than the inclination angle of the second inclining surface with respect thereto.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the buckle according to the aspect of the present disclosure, since the inclination angle of the first inclining surface with respect to the direction of the movement of the slide plate is smaller than the inclination angle of the second inclining surface with respect thereto, the slide plate can be moved more readily when the slide plate is moved in the direction in which the slide plate approaches the axis of rotation of the swing arm, that is, when the band length is shortened than when the slide plate is moved in the opposite direction, that is, when the band length is extended.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In the buckle according to the present disclosure, it is preferable that the buckle cover includes a front surface section, a first sidewall section, and a second sidewall section, that guide grooves extending along the longitudinal direction are formed at the inner surfaces of the first sidewall section and the second sidewall section, and that the slide plate includes a plate section inserted into the guide grooves.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The buckle according to the present disclosure, in which the plate section of the slide plate is inserted into the guide grooves so that the slide plate moves stably, allows stable, smooth adjustment of the band length. Furthermore, since the range over which the slide plate moves can be set by the guide grooves, damage to other parts due to collision of the slide plate with the other parts can also be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the buckle according to the present disclosure, it is preferable that the slide plate includes a movement restriction section provided continuously with the groove sections, that the movement restriction section has a restriction surface perpendicular to the sliding direction of the slide plate and protruding beyond the groove sections, and that the engagement click has a perpendicular surface that comes into contact with the restriction surface.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In the buckle according to the present disclosure, the perpendicular surface of the engagement click of the swing arm comes into contact with the restriction surface, whereby the movement of the slide plate can be restricted.
