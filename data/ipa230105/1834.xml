The claimed subject matter may be embodied in other ways, may include different elements or steps, and may be used in conjunction with other existing or future technologies. This description should not be interpreted as implying any particular order or arrangement among or between various steps or elements except when the order of individual steps or arrangement of elements is explicitly described.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The described embodiments of the invention provide for modular folding shelves for passenger seats that are capable of rapid installation or replacement and suitable for holding one or more small items in conjunction with a passenger seat placed forward of a seated passenger. While the modular folding shelves are discussed for use with aircraft seats, they are by no means so limited. Rather, embodiments of the modular folding shelves may be used in passenger seats or other seats of any type or otherwise as desired.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to certain embodiments of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a passenger seat assembly <b>100</b> can include one or more passenger seats <b>102</b> and modular folding shelves <b>110</b> mounted thereto. Structural portions of the passenger seats <b>102</b> and modular folding shelves <b>110</b> may be formed of materials including but not limited to aluminum, stainless steel, aramid fibers, polycarbonate, polypropylene, other metallic materials, composite materials, or other similar materials. A passenger seat <b>102</b> includes a passenger seat back <b>104</b> that can include a wide variety of features, with typical passengers seats including a media device <b>106</b> and a tray table <b>108</b>. Configurations of passenger seats <b>102</b> can include pockets, cup holders, privacy screens, or many other elements. The modular folding shelf <b>110</b> can be mounted to the passenger seat back <b>104</b> at any suitable aft-facing portion thereof, e.g., between a provided media device <b>106</b> and tray table <b>108</b> as shown, or at any other suitable location.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A modular folding shelf <b>110</b> can include an attachment portion <b>112</b> and a platform portion <b>114</b> that are connected by a folding support element <b>116</b>. The attachment portion <b>112</b> is configured to be attached to the seat back <b>104</b>, and the platform portion <b>114</b> is then operable to unfold away from the attachment portion, to be supported by the folding support element <b>116</b> and thereby provide a small shelf or platform capable of supporting lightweight passenger articles. In some embodiments, the attachment portion <b>112</b> and platform portion <b>114</b> are reduced by a cutout <b>115</b> that can reduce the overall footprint of the modular folding shelf <b>110</b> when it is attached to the seat back <b>104</b> (e.g., to allow clearance for other devices attached to the passenger seat <b>102</b>), the cutout <b>115</b> being concealed by the folding support element <b>116</b> when the modular folding shelf <b>110</b> is deployed. The platform portion <b>114</b> unfolds via a hinge <b>118</b> positioned at a lower extent or bottom end of the attachment portion <b>112</b>. The platform portion <b>114</b> may include a flanged end <b>122</b> formed by a flanged or tilted end of the platform portion, which is positioned to help to retain items placed on a deployed modular folding shelf <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the attachment portion <b>112</b> may include an additional retainer <b>120</b> formed of a flanged or hooked end of the attachment portion that can hook over a structural part of the seat back <b>104</b> in order to support the weight of the modular folding shelf <b>110</b> when the modular folding shelf is installed to a seat back. The attachment portion <b>112</b> is connected with the passenger seat back <b>104</b> with sufficient strength that, when the modular folding shelf <b>110</b> is deployed, the platform portion <b>114</b> can support at least the weight of most flat consumer electronics, including but not limited to: cellular phones, portable game consoles, tablet computing devices, and laptop computers that convert to a tablet mode. In some embodiments, the weight capacity of the modular folding shelf is at least 0.8 kg, preferably at least 1 kg, preferably at least 2 kg, and more preferably at least 2.5 kg.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Additional detail concerning the attachment and operation of the modular folding shelf <b>110</b> is presented below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>13</b>B</figref>. For example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side schematic view illustrating a first example of a modular folding shelf <b>200</b>, which is configured to connect with a passenger seat as shown with reference to modular folding shelf <b>110</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The modular folding shelf <b>200</b> includes attachment portion <b>112</b> and platform portion <b>114</b>, with respective curved extensions forming the retainer <b>120</b> and flanged end <b>122</b>. Hinge <b>118</b> can be formed by a narrowing of the material forming the modular folding shelf <b>200</b> as a whole, which may include a thermoformed polymer, textile or polymer composite, leather or treated leather product, or the like. Such hinges can be referred to as a living hinge, or live hinge. In some embodiments, hinge <b>118</b> can be formed by a change in material, e.g., from a rigid or semi-rigid material or assembly in the attachment portion <b>112</b> and platform portion <b>114</b>, to a softer or more flexible material at the hinge <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The platform portion <b>114</b> can unfold from a stowed configuration <b>200</b><i>a </i>to a deployed configuration <b>200</b><i>b </i>about the hinge <b>118</b>. An angle <b>224</b> between the stowed configuration <b>200</b><i>a </i>and deployed configuration <b>200</b><i>b </i>can be less than 90 degrees, between 45 and 90 degrees, or approximately 60 degrees. According to some embodiments, the angle <b>224</b> can be up to 60 degrees to allow the shelf to correctly hold a personal electronic device when the seat back <b>104</b> reclines. The angle <b>224</b> is limited by the support element <b>116</b>, which unfolds in an accordion-like manner at multiple hinges <b>226</b> to support the platform portion <b>114</b> in the deployed configuration <b>200</b><i>b. </i>A resulting inclination of the platform portion <b>114</b> depends on the angle of the passenger seat back <b>104</b>, but may be at least 10 degrees, preferably at least 20 degrees, to ensure that the platform portion remains inclined toward the passenger seat back when deployed and when the passenger seat back is reclined, with some buffer to account for changes in the inclination of the passenger cabin. According to some embodiments, the hinges <b>226</b> of the support element <b>116</b> can be attached to the attachment portion <b>112</b> and platform portion <b>114</b>, and can rotate about pins like conventional hinges; but in some embodiments, the support element <b>116</b> can also be fabricated directly from the same material as a remainder of the modular folding shelf <b>200</b>, and the support element hinges <b>226</b> can be formed as live hinges.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The body of the modular folding shelf <b>200</b> (i.e., the attachment portion <b>112</b> and retainer <b>120</b>, and the platform portion <b>114</b> and flanged end <b>122</b>) can be formed as a single part by any suitable thermoforming technique, e.g., molding, extrusion, or the like. In some embodiments, the attachment portion <b>112</b>, platform portion, and support element <b>116</b> can be formed together as a single part by a thermoforming process. Live hinges in the modular folding shelf <b>110</b>, e.g., hinge <b>118</b> or support hinges <b>226</b>, can be formed by direct manufacture of the live hinges during a forming process, or may be formed by scoring or cutting the body of the modular folding shelf after an initial forming process.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Various attachment means can be used to mount the attachment portion <b>112</b> to a passenger seat back (e.g. seat back <b>104</b>). For example, according to some embodiments, a touch fastener <b>313</b> can be fixed to the attachment portion <b>112</b> in a forward-facing direction and configured to mate with a matching surface or touch fastener on a passenger seat back. The touch fastener <b>313</b> can be a hook-and-loop type fastener, with either the felted or the hook portion fixed to the modular folding shelf <b>200</b>, and the mating element fixed to the seat back to which the modular folding shelf will be installed. Other suitable touch fasteners can be used, adhesives or adhesive tapes, snap-fit mechanisms, magnets, or comparable attachment mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The modular folding shelf <b>200</b> can include one or more retention elements <b>228</b> that are connected at least with the platform portion <b>114</b> and configured to retain the modular folding shelf in the stowed configuration <b>200</b><i>a, </i>in order to keep the modular folding shelf secured when not in use. According to some embodiments, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the retention elements <b>228</b> can be magnets positioned on the platform portion <b>114</b> and attachment portion <b>112</b> and positioned so that the magnets interact with each other to retain the platform portion <b>114</b> in the stowed configuration <b>200</b><i>a. </i>The retention elements <b>228</b> as shown are positioned underneath the support element <b>116</b> so that they are not visible to a passenger using the modular folding shelf <b>200</b>; however, retention elements may be placed above or on the support element instead if desired, or at any suitable location where folding portions of the modular folding shelf approach each other in the stowed configuration <b>200</b><i>a. </i>Various alternative retention elements <b>228</b> may be used, such as snaps, hooks, touch fasteners, removable adhesives, or other releasable retainers.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additional examples of modular folding shelves are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>13</b></figref>, as described below. Unless explicitly contraindicated, the specific elements of each example modular folding shelf may be substituted in each other example in any suitable combination.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side schematic view illustrating a second example of a modular folding shelf <b>300</b> that is attachable with a passenger seat similar to modular folding shelf <b>110</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The modular folding shelf <b>300</b> includes attachment portion <b>112</b> and platform portion <b>114</b>, with respective curved extensions forming the retainer <b>120</b> and flanged end <b>122</b>. Modular folding shelf <b>300</b> can differ from modular folding shelf <b>110</b> in that the hinge <b>318</b> may be formed by connecting separate attachment portion <b>112</b> and platform portion <b>114</b> at a pin about which the platform portion can rotate.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A support element <b>316</b> can be connected with both the attachment portion <b>112</b> and the platform portion <b>114</b> to limit the range of movement of the platform portion when it is deployed from a stowed configuration <b>300</b><i>a </i>to a deployed configuration <b>300</b><i>b. </i>The support element <b>316</b> can be formed of any suitable flexible material that readily folds and unfolds when the platform portion <b>114</b> is stowed or deployed, respectively. According to some embodiments, the support element <b>316</b> can be a textile or flexible leather band that runs a length of the modular folding shelf <b>300</b> and is fixed to the attachment portion <b>112</b> and platform portion <b>114</b>.
