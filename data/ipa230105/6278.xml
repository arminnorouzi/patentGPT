During the operation of the traction battery, the battery modules generate heat which is transported for example to the outside via the housing. Here, the housing is metallic in design in order to make possible a necessary high heat conduction between the battery modules and the housing. The housing is then formed from metal as a die casting. Disadvantageously, this results in a high utilisation of metal.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The object of the invention therefore is to state an improved or at least an alternative embodiment for a traction battery of the generic type with which the described disadvantages are overcome.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the invention, this object is solved through the subject of the independent claim(s). Advantageous embodiments are subject of the dependent claims.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A traction battery for a motor vehicle comprises a housing having a pot-shaped housing pot and a lid closing the housing pot. In addition, the traction battery comprises multiple components to be cooled arranged in the housing. The traction battery also comprises a cooling device with at least one cooling channel that can be flowed through by a cooling medium, preferentially by a cooling liquid. Here, the cooling device is arranged within the housing and connected to the respective components to be cooled in a heat-transferring manner. According to the invention, the traction battery comprises at least one plate-like insert and the cooling channel of the cooling device is delimited towards the outside by the housing pot in regions and by the insert in regions. The housing pot and the lid are formed from plastic and the at least one insert from metal. The respective components of the traction battery to be cooled lie against the insert in a heat-transferring manner.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, only the insert, which is connected to the components to be cooled in a heat-transferring manner, is formed from metal in the traction battery according to the invention. The housing pot and the lid, which are not directly connected to the components to be cooled in a heat-transferring manner, are formed from plastic. In other words, only the regions in the traction battery according to the invention which are in direct heat-transferring contact with the components of the traction battery to be cooled are formed from metal. This results in cost, weight and material advantages.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Advantageously, the component to be cooled can be a battery module consisting of multiple battery cells stacked against one another. Advantageously, the component to be cooled can be a control board for controlling the traction battery and/or a battery module or multiple battery modules of the traction battery.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Advantageously, the insert can be formed in a deep-drawing method or in a die-casting method or in an extrusion method.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Advantageously, the insert can be plate-shaped. Advantageously, the at least one insert can be plate-shaped and have a complex shape. Advantageously, the at least one insert can have a complex shape for the space-saving arranging of the components to be cooled in the housing.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Advantageously it can be provided that the at least one insert is sealed-off towards the housing pot. Because of this, the cooling channel that can be flowed through by the cooling medium, preferentially by the cooling liquid, is also sealed-off from the components to be cooled.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an advantageous embodiment it can be provided that at the edge and circumferentially the at least one insert is overmoulded by a plastic, preferentially by a thermoplastic. Then, the at least one insert is material bonded to the housing pot via the overmoulded plastic, preferentially welded or vibration-welded. Because of this, the cooling channel can be securely sealed-off from the components to be cooled within the housing.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition it can be provided that the at least one insert is connected to the lid at the edge and circumferentially in a material bonded manner via the overmoulded plastic, preferentially welded or vibration-welded. Alternatively or additionally it can be provided that the lid is connected to the housing pot at the edge and circumferentially in a material bonded manner, preferentially welded or vibration-welded. In both cases, the housing can be securely sealed-off towards the outside because of this.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another advantageous embodiment it can be provided that the at least one insert is embedded in the housing pot under the effect of heat at the edge and circumferentially. Because of this, the cooling channel can be securely sealed-off from the components to be cooled within the housing. The lid is then connected to the housing pot at the edge and circumferentially in a material bonded manner, preferentially welded or vibration-welded. Because of this, the housing can be securely sealed-off towards the outside.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an advantageous embodiment it can be provided that the at least one insert comprises a bonding seam facing the housing pot and is bonded to the housing pot at the edge and circumferentially via the bonding seam. Then, the bonding seam forms a seal which securely seals-off the cooling channel from the components to be cooled within the housing. Advantageously it can be provided that the at least one insert comprises a bonding seam facing the lid and is bonded to the lid via the bonding seam at the edge and circumferentially. Because of this, the housing can be securely sealed-off towards the outside.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an advantageous embodiment it can be provided that the housing pot and the lid are joined to one another in a material bonded manner at the edge and circumferentially. Then, the at least one insert can be overmoulded with elastomer at the edge and circumferentially and because of this a sealing lip can be formed on the at least one insert. The sealing lip of the at least one insert can then be compressed between the housing pot and the lid at the edge and circumferentially. Because of this, the cooling channel can be securely sealed-off from the components to be cooled within the housing and the housing towards the outside. Advantageously, the sealing lip can comprise multiple sealing ribs. During the compression, the sealing ribs can be pressed in between the housing pot and the lid. By way of the sealing ribs, the sealing effect of the sealing lip can be additionally reinforced.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further important features and advantages of the invention are obtained from the subclaims, from the drawings and from the associated figure description by way of the drawings.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is to be understood that the features mentioned above and still to be explained in the following cannot only be used in the respective combination stated but also in other combinations or by themselves without leaving the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferred exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown in the drawings and are explained in more detail in the following description, wherein same reference numbers relate to same or similar or functionally same components.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It shows, in each case schematically</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> a sectional view of a traction battery according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>5</b></figref> sectional views of joining locations formed differently in the traction battery according to the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a sectional view of a traction battery <b>1</b> according to the invention.
