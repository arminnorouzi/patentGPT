It will be evident, however, to those skilled in the art, that embodiments of the inventive subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In general, well-known instruction instances, structures, and techniques are not necessarily shown in detail.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As discussed, silicon photonic (SiPh) integrated circuits can implement an optical coupling to output light generated by the circuit, detect light received by the circuit, or otherwise process light within the circuit. In some example embodiments, the optical coupling interface is located at the edge of the silicon photonic integrated circuit chip, or within the plane of light propagation on the silicon photonic integrated circuit chip. In some example embodiments, the optical coupling is placed approximately or precisely normal to the plane of light propagation in the silicon photonic integrated circuit chip. In these approaches, the light in the PIC can be turned upward or downward with an optical component in the PIC, such as a mirror and/or a grating coupler. In implementing the optical turning component, the overall efficiency of the optical coupling interface can depend on the properties (e.g. thickness, refractive index, shape, etc.) of the materials existing between the light-turning component on the SiPh IC and the component with which the SiPh IC is interfacing (e.g. an optical fiber, an off-chip laser, an off-chip detector, etc.). SiPh ICs can be fabricated using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates, where the high-index-contrast between the buried oxide and the silicon substrate can impact the overall efficiency of the optical coupling interface. In particular, for example, light can be reflected by the silicon-dioxide/silicon interface, and the reflection can decrease the coupling efficiency, increase the manufacturing process sensitivities, and limit bandwidths that are usable in a given chip design (due to the decreased coupling efficiency and manufacturing sensitivities). This decreased wavelength performance further limits the number of lanes that can be added to a chip (e.g., such as a course wavelength division chip having a plurality of sequential lanes that are spaced 20-40 nm apart). While edge couplings or turning components that direct light away from the SOI silicon substrate can mitigate these issues, turning light away is not practical as a design limitation in many layouts (e.g., an edge coupler design may turn light away, however edge coupled designs have space limitations and/or may not be the preferred layout of a given optical structure, such as in flip-chip PICs).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some example embodiments, multiple silicon wafers can be processed to form an SOI with one or more anti-reflective coatings to increase efficiency and reduce manufacturing sensitivity of the structures. In an example processing, a surface of one wafer (Wafer A) is thermally oxidized to form a buried oxide. Further, a weakened interface can be created within the top silicon of Wafer A, via a process such as implantation. Wafer A is then flipped and bonded onto another wafer, Wafer B. The bonded structure is separated at the weakened silicon interface, which leaves an SOI wafer comprising the silicon substrate of Wafer B, the buried thermal oxide from Wafer A, and a thin device silicon layer from Wafer A (e.g., that interfaces with a device, such as the organic substrate <b>160</b> or optical fiber <b>121</b>). The SOI wafer is commonly annealed and the device silicon layer is polished.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some example embodiments, an anti-reflection (AR) coating is added between the buried oxide and silicon substrate of the SOI wafer. In some example embodiments, the AR coating is a thin film that is deposited on Wafer B before bonding with Wafer A. Alternatively, and in accordance with some example embodiments, the thin film is deposited on Wafer A after oxidation of Wafer A, which is then bonded with Wafer B. Further, in some example embodiments, the thickness of the deposited film is close to or exactly a quarter-wavelength of the light to be transmitted through the film (e.g., light received by the PIC from an external source, generated by the PIC using an internal light source, or processed by the PIC) such that the interference at the coating interface is exactly out of phase (e.g., interference from reflections at the top and bottom of the interfaces of the coating). Further, to yield a good fringe from the interference due the AR coating (e.g., from perfect amplitude and subtraction of the waves at the AR coating interfaces), the deposited film is of a material that has a refractive index near the geometric mean of the materials on either side of the coating. For example, if the two interfacing materials are a buried oxide layer and a silicon layer, the AR coating can be a film of a silicon nitride material (e.g., Si3N4), which has an index that is close to the geometric mean of the indices of the buried oxide and silicon materials. In this way, the AR coating can compensate in cases where the buried oxide thickness is not ideal (e.g., intentionally polished down, random manufacturing process variation), and further relaxes the wavelength sensitivity and manufacturing sensitivity thereby enabling broadband wavelength performance (e.g., lower loss over a wider wavelength band) and in turn enabling designs with additional lanes.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a side view of an optical-electrical device <b>100</b> including one or more optical devices, according to some example embodiments. In illustrated embodiment, the optical-electrical device <b>100</b> is shown to include a printed circuit board (PCB) substrate <b>105</b>, organic substrate <b>160</b>, an application-specific integrated circuit <b>115</b> (ASIC) and photonic integrated circuit <b>120</b> (PIC).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some example embodiments, the PIC <b>120</b> includes silicon on insulator (SOI) or silicon based (e.g., silicon nitride (SiN)) devices, or may comprise devices formed from both silicon and a non-silicon material. Said non-silicon material (alternatively referred to as &#x201c;heterogeneous material&#x201d;) may comprise one of III-V material, magneto-optic material, or crystal substrate material. III-V semiconductors have elements that are found in group III and group V of the periodic table (e.g., Indium Gallium Arsenide Phosphide (InGaAsP), Gallium Indium Arsenide Nitride (GainAsN)). The carrier dispersion effects of III-V-based materials may be significantly higher than in silicon-based materials, as electron speed in III-V semiconductors is much faster than that in silicon. In addition, III-V materials have a direct bandgap, which enables efficient creation of light from electrical pumping. Thus, III-V semiconductor materials enable photonic operations with an increased efficiency over silicon for both generating light and modulating the refractive index of light. Thus, III-V semiconductor materials enable photonic operation with an increased efficiency at generating light from electricity and converting light back into electricity.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The low optical loss and high quality oxides of silicon are thus combined with the electro-optic efficiency of III-V semiconductors in the heterogeneous optical devices described below; in embodiments of the disclosure, said heterogeneous devices utilize low loss heterogeneous optical waveguide transitions between the devices' heterogeneous and silicon-only waveguides.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Magneto-optic (MO) materials allow heterogeneous PICs to operate based on the MO effect. Such devices may utilize the Faraday Effect, in which the magnetic field associated with an electrical signal modulates an optical beam, offering high bandwidth modulation, and rotates the electric field of the optical mode, enabling optical isolators. Said MO materials may comprise, for example, materials such as iron, cobalt, or yttrium iron garnet (YIG). Further, in some example embodiments, crystal substrate materials provide heterogeneous PICs with a high electro-mechanical coupling, linear electro-optic coefficient, low transmission loss, and stable physical and chemical properties. Said crystal substrate materials may comprise, for example, lithium niobate (LiNbO3) or lithium tantalate (LiTaO3).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the example illustrated, the PIC <b>120</b> exchanges light with an external light source <b>125</b> via an optical fiber <b>121</b>, in a flip-chip configuration where a top-side of the PIC <b>120</b> is connected to the organic substrate and light propagates out (or in) from a bottom-side of the PIC <b>120</b> facing away (e.g., towards a coupler), according to some example embodiments. The optical fiber <b>121</b> can couple with the PIC <b>120</b> using a prism, grating, or lens, according to some example embodiments. The optical components of PIC <b>120</b> (e.g., optical modulators, optical switches) are controlled, at least in part, by control circuitry included in ASIC <b>115</b>. Both ASIC <b>115</b> and PIC <b>120</b> are shown to be disposed on copper pillars <b>114</b>, which are used for communicatively coupling the PICs via organic substrate <b>160</b>. PCB substrate <b>105</b> is coupled to organic substrate <b>160</b> via ball grid array (BGA) interconnect <b>116</b> and may be used to interconnect the organic substrate <b>160</b> (and thus, ASIC <b>115</b> and PIC <b>120</b>) to other components of the optical-electrical device <b>100</b> not shown (e.g., interconnection modules, power supplies, etc.).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example photonic integrated circuit structure <b>200</b> (e.g., photonic integrated circuit <b>120</b>), according to some example embodiments. An etalon is an optical cavity formed from two reflective interfaces (e.g., Fabry-Perot Interferometer) that can depend on the dimensions of the cavity and the reflective indices of the materials. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, light is illustrated as ray arrows (dotted arrows, solid arrows). In the illustrated example, the grating layer <b>215</b> is between a first oxide layer <b>210</b> (e.g., handleside buried oxide layer) and a second oxide layer <b>220</b> (e.g., mirrorside buried oxide layer), and light can propagate out from the through a silicon layer <b>205</b> (e.g., a bottom side of PIC <b>120</b> facing towards an external coupler). Light can be generated, received, or otherwise processed by the photonic integrated circuit structure <b>200</b> vertically (e.g., with respect to the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) in a flip-chip configuration. For example, the light can be generated by an integrated light source (e.g., not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), propagate through and emanate from the grating layer <b>215</b>, towards the mirror <b>225</b> which reflects the light such that it propagates through the second oxide layer <b>220</b>, the grating layer <b>215</b>, the first oxide layer <b>210</b>, and exits from the silicon layer <b>205</b> (e.g., to an external device, such as a fiber optical coupler).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an unintended etalon can occur in the structure <b>200</b> from reflections between different surfaces. For example, an etalon can occur from reflections from an interface made by the silicon layer <b>205</b> and the first oxide layer <b>210</b> and reflections from the mirror <b>225</b>. As an additional example, an etalon can occur from reflections from an interface made by the silicon layer <b>205</b> and the first oxide layer <b>210</b> and reflections from another interface made by the first oxide layer <b>210</b> and the grating layer <b>215</b>. As a further example, an etalon can occur from reflections from an interface made by the grating layer <b>215</b> and the second oxide layer <b>220</b>, and the mirror <b>225</b>. In some example embodiments, the etalons are unintended can result from manufacturing variations. For example, the first oxide layer <b>210</b> can be further etched and then polished (according to a given PIC layout design) and the variations in polishing can create variations in thickness of the first oxide layer <b>210</b>, which result in one or more of the above etalons.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example photonic integrated circuit structure <b>300</b> (e.g., photonic integrated circuit <b>120</b>) formed from wafers (e.g., Wafer A, Wafer B), according to some example embodiments. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, light is illustrated as ray arrows (e.g., dotted arrows, solid arrows). In some example embodiments, the silicon layer <b>305</b> and the AR coating <b>313</b> are formed using Wafer B, and the first oxide layer <b>310</b>, the grating layer <b>315</b>, the second oxide layer <b>320</b>, and the mirror layer <b>325</b> are formed on Wafer A or using Wafer A (e.g., implantation separation to create the second oxide layer <b>320</b>). Light can be generated, received, or otherwise processed by the photonic integrated circuit structure <b>300</b> vertically (e.g., with respect to the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). For example, the light can be generated by an integrated light source (e.g., not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) and directed from the grating through the first oxide layer <b>310</b>, or downwards to reflect on the mirror layer <b>325</b> and up through the mirror layer <b>325</b>, the grating layer <b>315</b>, the first oxide layer <b>310</b>, the AR coating <b>313</b>, and the silicon layer <b>305</b> (e.g., to an external device, such as a fiber optical coupler). In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the photonic integrated circuit structure <b>300</b> includes an AR coating <b>313</b> that can be applied to one of the wafers before bonding to avoid one or more etalons in the photonic integrated circuit structure <b>300</b> (e.g., by removing the full length round trip that creates the etalon), thereby reducing the manufacturing sensitivity of the photonic integrated circuit structure <b>300</b>. For instance, in particular, if the first oxide layer <b>310</b> is over-polished in the manufacturing process, the AR coating <b>313</b> will stop one or more etalons from arising in the photonic integrated circuit structure <b>300</b>. Additionally, the wavelength span of light to be propagated can be increased (e.g., for additional lanes) due to avoided sensitivities for potential etalons arising within the photonic integrated circuit structure <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some example embodiments, the grating layer <b>315</b> comprises a broadband turning mechanism (e.g., total internal reflection (TIR) grating, turning mirror) that turns light in the grating layer <b>315</b> ninety degrees towards the interface between the silicon layer <b>305</b> and the first oxide layer <b>310</b>. In these example embodiments, the addition of the AR coating <b>313</b> between the silicon layer <b>305</b> and the first oxide layer <b>310</b> removes the etalon effect, thus the overall bandwidth of the device is set by the AR coating <b>313</b> removing the one or more etalons (e.g., as the turning mirror in this embodiment is very broadband and has a wide bandwidth that is limited by a possible etalon at interface of the silicon layer <b>305</b> and the first oxide layer <b>310</b>).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a process architecture <b>400</b> for manufacturing SOIs with AR coatings to reduce wavelength and manufacturing sensitivity, according to some example embodiments. In some example embodiments, the Wafer A <b>402</b> is oxidized to generate an oxidized Wafer A <b>405</b>. The oxidized Wafer A <b>405</b> then undergoes interface weaking, e.g., using ion implantation to create a weak interface <b>406</b> for later separation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a thin film of material <b>413</b> is applied to Wafer B <b>450</b> to function as an AR coating as discussed above. For example, a thin film (e.g., 164 nm) of silicon nitride (Si3N4) can be applied via thin film deposition (e.g., chemical vapor deposition, growth deposition, physical vapor deposition) to create the AR coating <b>313</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The thin film is selected as a material of a certain index (e.g., a geometric mean of the two materials on either side of the coating, a mean of the index of silicon and silicon dioxide, etc.). Further, the film is deposited at a certain thickness (e.g., a quarter-wavelength of the light to propagate through the coating), for instance, to ensure that the two reflections of the potential etalon remain perfectly out of phase, and further to ensure the waves have equal magnitude (e.g., to yield a good fringe from interference), the thin film of material is selected to ensure that it has an index of refraction between the two refractive indexes being matched (silicon and BOX), such that the amplitude matches between the two reflected waves and the reflection is completely subtracted and the etalon does not occur. In accordance with some example embodiments, the index of the film is selected to the geometric mean (e.g., or near to the mean) of the two refractive indexes being matched (silicon and BOX), such that the amplitude matches between the two reflected waves and the reflection is completely subtracted and the etalon does not occur. Additionally, in some example embodiments, the thin film is applied to Wafer A instead of Wafer B. For example, the Wafer A can be oxidized, and the thin film can be applied to the surface of Wafer A that is bonded to the Wafer B.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Continuing, the wafer A is then flipped over and bonded to Wafer B to create bonded structure <b>427</b>. Wafer A is then separated at the weak interface <b>406</b> to create a new Wafer A which can be used as a doner wafer for additional SOI creation.

For example, Wafer A or Wafer B (e.g., silicon wafers) is oxidized to produce buried oxide layers on the wafer.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">At operation <b>510</b>, a thin film is applied as an AR coating using film deposition processes (e.g., chemical vapor deposition). In some example embodiments, the index of the material of the film has a geometric mean of the two materials creating a reflective interface of an etalon. For example, the etalon interface can be created from a silicon material (e.g., the silicon layer <b>305</b>) and a silicon oxide material (e.g., the first oxide layer <b>310</b>) and a layer of silicon nitride is applied as a thin film to one of the wafers.

For example, a weak interface can be created in Wafer A (e.g., via implantation) and the Wafer A is split to create a new wafer and a resulting SOI structure, such as the photonic integrated circuit structure <b>300</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a flow diagram of method <b>600</b> for processing light using a high optical bandwidth PIC having etalon compensation to decrease wavelength and manufacturing sensitives, according to some example embodiments. At operation <b>605</b>, the photonic integrated circuit structure <b>300</b> propagates light. For example, light propagates out from the grating layer <b>315</b> toward the mirror layer <b>325</b> and further propagates light from the grating layer <b>315</b> towards the silicon layer <b>305</b> (e.g., a bottom-side of a flip-chip).

In the illustrated embodiment, the optical transceiver <b>700</b> comprises an integrated photonic transmitter structure <b>705</b> and an integrated photonic receiver structure <b>710</b>. In some example embodiments, the integrated photonic transmitter structure <b>705</b> and the integrated photonic receiver structure <b>710</b> are example optical components fabricated as a PIC device, such as PIC <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, discussed above. The integrated photonic transmitter structure <b>705</b> is an example of a WDM transmitter having four lanes, transmitter lanes <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>, in which each lane handles a different wavelength of light. The integrated photonic receiver structure <b>710</b> is an example of a WDM receiver that receives WDM light (e.g., from an optical network or from the integrated photonic transmitter structure <b>705</b> in loopback mode). The integrated photonic receiver structure <b>710</b> can receive and process light by filtering, amplifying, and converting it to electrical signal using components such as multiplexers, semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) and one or more detectors such as photodetectors (e.g., photodiodes).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The optical transceiver <b>700</b> is an example structure that can be formed from two wafers with the AR coating film as discussed above (e.g., Wafer A, Wafer B, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). Due to the AR coating removing manufacturing sensitivities (e.g., unintentional etalons arising from over polishing the buried oxide), different wavelengths and additional lanes can be added to the optical transceiver <b>700</b>. For example, the AR coating film can be added to a wafer used to form the optical transceiver and the AR coating has a geometric mean that is near silicon and buried oxide to remove an etalon from each of the lanes in the integrated photonic transmitter structure <b>705</b>. For example, due to the increased bandwidth of the optical transceiver, additional transmitter lanes having smaller wavelengths can be added to enable greater bandwidth overall.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some example embodiments, different films with different thicknesses can be implemented to compensate for different operating characteristics of the different lanes. For example, the area over transmitter lanes <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> may receive an AR coating having a thickness that is near the one-quarter wavelength of the light in transmitter lanes <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> (e.g., one-quarter wavelength of an average wavelength of the light propagating in lanes <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>) of the different wavelengths of the. Further, an area over transmitter lanes <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> (or additional lanes <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, additional lanes <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> etc.) may receive an AR coating that is slightly thinner to correspond to the smaller wavelength(s) of light propagating in those lanes (e.g., for 8-lane WDM).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In view of the disclosure above, various examples are set forth below.
