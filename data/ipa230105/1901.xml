The brake systems <b>100</b> are shown here as hydraulic brake by wire systems in which electronically controlled fluid pressure is utilized to apply braking forces for at least a portion of the brake systems <b>100</b>. The brake systems <b>100</b> may suitably be used on a ground vehicle, such as an automotive vehicle having four wheels with a wheel brake associated with each wheel. Furthermore, the brake systems <b>100</b> can be provided with other braking functions such as anti-lock braking (ABS) and other slip control features to effectively brake the vehicle. Components of the brake systems <b>100</b> may be housed in one or more blocks or housings. The block or housing may be made from solid material, such as aluminum, that has been drilled, machined, or otherwise formed to house the various components. Fluid conduits may also be formed in the block or housing.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the illustrated embodiment of the brake systems <b>100</b>, there are four wheel brakes <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, and <b>102</b>D.

The wheel brakes <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, and <b>102</b>D can be associated with any combination of front and rear wheels of the vehicle in which the selected brake system <b>100</b> is installed. For example, the brake systems <b>100</b> may be configured as a diagonal split system, as shown, such that a first pressure circuit (indicated by dashed line &#x201c;1&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>) is associated with providing fluid to one or both of the right wheel brakes <b>102</b>B and <b>102</b>D, and these two brakes are electrically actuated in kind, as noted below. A second pressure circuit (indicated by dashed line &#x201c;2&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>) may be associated with providing fluid to one or both of the left wheel brakes <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>C; again, with electrical actuation from the same source, as further discussed below.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, the front wheel brakes <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B are hydraulically operated, and the rear wheel brakes <b>102</b>C and <b>102</b>D may be electrically operated, such as by including the pair of rear wheel motors <b>104</b>C and <b>104</b>D for selectively electrically actuating respective left and right rear wheel parking and/or service brakes on the rear wheels, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>.

Any of the described structures and components could be integrally formed as a single unitary or monolithic piece or made up of separate sub-components, with either of these formations involving any suitable stock or bespoke components and/or any suitable material or combinations of materials. Any of the described structures and components could be disposable or reusable as desired for a particular use environment. Any component could be provided with a user-perceptible marking to indicate a material, configuration, at least one dimension, or the like pertaining to that component, the user-perceptible marking potentially aiding a user in selecting one component from an array of similar components for a particular use environment. A &#x201c;predetermined&#x201d; status may be determined at any time before the structures being manipulated actually reach that status, the &#x201c;predetermination&#x201d; being made as late as immediately before the structure achieves the predetermined status. The term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; is used herein to indicate a quality that is largely, but not necessarily wholly, that which is specified&#x2014;a &#x201c;substantial&#x201d; quality admits of the potential for some relatively minor inclusion of a non-quality item. Though certain components described herein are shown as having specific geometric shapes, all structures of this disclosure may have any suitable shapes, sizes, configurations, relative relationships, cross-sectional areas, or any other physical characteristics as desirable for a particular application. Any structures or features described with reference to one aspect or configuration could be provided, singly or in combination with other structures or features, to any other aspect or configuration, as it would be impractical to describe each of the aspects and configurations discussed herein as having all of the options discussed with respect to all of the other aspects and configurations. A device or method incorporating any of these features should be understood to fall under the scope of this disclosure as determined based upon the claims below and any equivalents thereof.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Other aspects, objects, and advantages can be obtained from a study of the drawings, the disclosure, and the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
