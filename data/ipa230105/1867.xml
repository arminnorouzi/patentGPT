From the viewpoint of improving the traffic safety, in vehicles, for example, it is required to ensure the traffic safety even w % ben an abnormality occurs in the vehicle, for example.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, a vehicle power supply system is known in which, when an abnormality occurs in a main power supply, by supplying electric power from a backup power supply to a specific important load, it is possible to continue supply of electric power to the specific important load, and it is possible to ensure traffic safety even when an abnormality occurs in the main power supply (for example, see JP-A-2017-218013).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The vehicle power supply system of JP-A-2017-218013 includes an engine that is an internal combustion engine. In general, a vehicle including an engine that is an internal combustion engine is provided with a starter motor for cranking the internal combustion engine to generate power for starting the internal combustion engine. Since the starter motor requires a large amount of electric power to operate, in a vehicle including the internal combustion engine and the starter motor, an output voltage of a battery that supplies electric power for driving the starter motor is likely to decrease when the starter motor is in operation, for example, when the vehicle returns from an idling stop.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the vehicle power supply system of JP-A-2017-218013, when a voltage of the main power supply detected by a battery sensor is equal to or less than a predetermined voltage, it is detected that the main power supply is abnormal. Therefore, in the vehicle power supply system of JP-A-2017-218013, when an output voltage of the main power supply decreases to equal to or less than a predetermined voltage due to an operation of the starter motor, for example, when the vehicle returns from an idling stop, it may be erroneously determined that an abnormality occurs in a main power supply system even though no abnormality occurs in the main power supply system including the main power supply.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a vehicle power supply system capable of preventing an erroneous determination that an abnormality occurs in a main power supply system due to the fact that a starter motor is in operation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a vehicle power supply system being mounted on a vehicle including an internal combustion engine, the vehicle power supply system including: a main power supply system including a main low-voltage power supply and a normal load;
