Korean Patent Application Nos. 10-2021-0087787, 10-2021-0087777, and 10-2021-0122632, filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Jul. 5, 2021, Jul. 5, 2021, and Sep. 14, 2021, respectively,

Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A heat emission source of a motor for driving an electric vehicle is a coil, through which an electric current flows, and a core, through which a magnetic flux flows. During an operation of a motor, temperatures of corresponding components increase, and functions thereof become abnormal when the temperature rises are excessive. To prevent this, cooling schemes for cooling the motor are important, and the schemes for cooling the motor may include an oil cooling scheme of directly spraying oil to a heat emission source, a water cooling scheme of indirectly cooling a heat emission source by causing cooling water to flow a water passage part of a housing, and the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Among them, the oil cooling type cooling scheme of spraying oil to a heat emission source is a scheme of discharging oil from a pipe to cool a stator core and a coil. In the oil cooling type cooling scheme, because the number of components is large, it is difficult to directly cool a rotor core as the rotor core is covered by a rotor plate, a stator core/coil, and oil is not discharged from a pipe in all directions but is partially leaked from several holes, a cooling effect of an end coil part (a part including an end of the coil) of the highest temperature is degraded. Accordingly, to improve cooling performance, a structure capable of improving the cooling performance while not being complex is further necessary.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, the conventional rotor plate has a flat disk shape, and the sprayed oil cannot be delivered to the end coil well due to the shape, and a torque due to rotation of the rotor plate cannot be delivered to the oil well. Accordingly, the problem needs to be solved to improve a cooling performance of the motor.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.
