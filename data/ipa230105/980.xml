The method permits visualization of any tumor, whether located externally on a patient's body or located internally in the body, and as small as 2 mm in diameter, producing a biomarker, either a biomarker specific for the tumor or a general biomarker.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, a biomarker indicates a disease process. As subsequently described, a biomarker can be a protein, antigen, enzyme, hormone, carbohydrate, toxin, DNA, an organism such as bacteria, tumor cell, exosome, or indirectly an antibody, present in a liquid biopsy specimen. It can be produced by the plasma cells, against a tumor antigen, etc.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The method uses antibodies conjugated with nanoparticles which include but are not limited to quantum dots, with the conjugated form collectively termed functionalized nanoparticles, that are heated under specified conditions to produce a photoacoustic signal (for use on the body surface or for use in reachable cavities) that is then visualized to locate the tumor to which the nanoparticles are attached. Nanoparticles may be used for qualitative and quantitative assessment of an analyte in the blood or other tissue using photoacoustic technology, U.S. Pat. No. 8,554,296. As previously stated, as used herein, unless specifically stated otherwise, nanoparticles include but are not limited to quantum dots.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Early stage small neoplastic cells produce biomarkers that are either specific to the tumor cells or that represent the body's response to the tumor as an antibody. The biomarkers can be proteomic, genetic, epigenetic or glycomic biomolecules. These biomolecules can be recognized in the patient's tissue samples or in the blood. Their existence can be demonstrated thus far chemically using, e.g., immunoassay or PCR methods. Quantitation of these biomarkers is also important to determine disease progression and prognosis.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Biomarkers for many diseases are found in the blood. As subsequently disclosed, biomarkers detected in a liquid biopsy sample are used to generate antibodies against them using known methods in the art. The anti-tumor antibodies are used to coat nanoparticles in the inventive method, where a lesion can be imaged regardless of the lesion size or location in the body. The method is not limited to tumor detection and/or therapy. As only one example, detecting an antibody against anti-&#x3b2;-amyloid protein plaque present in Alzheimer's disease in a liquid biopsy specimen, the method renders the plaque visible with the nanoparticles and accessible to the inventive treatment. As another example, the method can also be used to detect and/or treat inflammatory processes, etc.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The inventive method is applicable to any processes or diseases that produce a biomarker detectable in a liquid biopsy specimen. It is applicable to a lesion including an abscess, an ulcer, a tumor either benign or malignant, an ischemic area of stroke and/or an area of the brain affected by a stroke whether visible or microscopically.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, many biomarkers may be combined to coat nanoparticles. Over a thousand proteins are differentially expressed in human cancers and thus may serve as biomarkers. Such proteins play a role in cancer-related processes such as angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell differentiation, cell signaling, hematopoiesis, hormonal control, immune reactions, etc. Exemplary biomarkers include in the claim, but are not limited to, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) for both malignant pleural effusion and peritoneal cancer dissemination; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) for stage IV breast cancer; bladder tumor antigen for urothelial cell carcinoma; thyroglobulin for thyroid cancer metastasis; &#x3b1;-fetoprotein for hepatocellular carcinoma; prostate specific antigen (PSA) for prostate cancer; cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) for non-small cell lung cancer; cancer antigen 19.9 (CA 19.9) for pancreatic cancer; cancer antigen 15.3 (CA 15.3) for breast cancer; the combination of leptin, prolactin, osteopontin, and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) for ovarian cancer; the combination of CD98, fascin, secreted chain of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (sPIgR), and 14-3-3 eta proteins for lung cancer; troponin I for myocardial infarction, and B-type natriuretic peptide for congestive heart failure. While the previous nine proteins are the only approved markers for cancer testing to date, they are but a small fraction of the total number of available biomarkers, and their sensitivity and specific vary.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other common biomarkers include the estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR), HER-2/neu, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for breast cancer, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1)-associated with serum HER2-positive breast cancer; Kirsten Ras oncogene (KRAS) and UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A (UGT1A1) for colorectal cancer; HER-2/neu for gastric cancer, c-KIT, CD20 antigen, CD30, and factoriInteracting with PAPOLA and CPSF1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha fusion protein (FIP1L1-PDGRF alpha), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) for gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST); Philadelphia Chromosome (BCR/ABL)/PML/RAR alpha and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (TPMT/UGT1A1/ALK EGFR) for leukemia/lymphoma; KRAS/EGFR for lung cancer, and BRAF and S100 for melanoma.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other examples of biomarkers include tumor suppressors that are lost in cancers, such as Breast Cancer Gene 1 (BRCA1), Breast Cancer Gene 2 (BRCA2); RNA such as mRNA, microRNA; proteins found in body fluids or tissue such as prostate specific antigen and CA-125; gene and protein based biomarkers; and nonspecific biomarkers such as glycosaminoglycans in body fluids; alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline in skeletal involvement; hyaluronic acid excretion and urinary hydroxyproline in bone disease, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In malignancies, the biomarkers may be released into the circulation either prior to or after the tumor has grown sufficiently to become metastatic. Small tumors (less than about 2 mm) seldom have any clinical manifestations, however even such small tumors can release chemical and/or biomarkers into the circulation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The existence of biomarkers in the circulation has been known, but has not met the threshold for locating tumor cells that could not be imaged radiographically or by ultrasound as long as the tumors were asymptomatic. Available imaging methods such as x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, computed tomography (CT) scans, CT ultrasound, etc. may not permit visualization of lesions smaller than about 3 mm in diameter. This has been the case for most malignant tumors, or when a malignant tumor is created from a benign precursor lesion such as nevus, breast unspecific cyst or unspecific scar, prostate tumors along with benign prostate hypertrophy or uterus cancer inside the uterus fibroma, melanoma inside a skin nevus or in a seborrheic keratosis, etc. Moreover, it is often difficult to follow a cancerous tumor which has been irradiated but may still harbor malignant cells, and that can start growing with time and metastasize before it shows a local growth that is detected by conventional imaging or other methods.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The diagnosis of a malignant tumor may be extremely difficult, even when a tumor is visible clinically or radiologically, e.g. a uterus fibroma that may have some malignant transformation. Moreover, a diagnosis also affects the decision whether or not and also how to remove the tumor. As one example, accessing the uterus through a small incision, and removing the tumor piece by piece using an endoscope and a cutting probe, has a fast post-operative recovery. Such a method is in contrast to completely removing the uterus with the tumor intact out of caution that the tumor may harbor neoplastic cells, but using a large incision with significantly higher operative risks and post-operative complication probabilities. Another, more problematic example, is the decision for a woman having genetic disposition to breast cancer without any physical or radiological manifestation. The woman must endure the stress and fear not knowing if or when she may develop breast cancer, and must consider prophylactic removal of both breasts. As another example, a personal decision whether or not to undergo radiation therapy when a nevus is discovered under the retina, and biopsy results that often do not provide definitive information because of the diversity of the cells in the entire area of the tumor.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">When the tumor site is unknown, locating a biomarker in the circulation may be akin to finding a needle in a hay stack. For any particular tumor or cancer, not all biomarkers are even known. Similarly, finding a micro DNA in the circulation may not provide an answer when the tumor is either invisible or has already metastasized. An example of this occurs in patients with uveal melanomas, having a mortality rate of about 50%, even if the tumors undergo radiation, at the time the ophthalmologist discovers the tumor. This points to the fact that a malignant tumor can metastasize very early, at times even when the size of the tumor is about 2 mm in diameter which is equal to about one million cells. In general, these lesions do not have any symptoms.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The inventive method makes it possible to evaluate a patient with genetic predisposition of a malignant neoplasm before its clinical manifestation can be seen radiographically.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a cancer treatment and imaging system, according to an embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a cancer treatment and imaging system, according to another embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a cancer treatment system, according to yet another embodiment of the invention, wherein a thyroid tumor is being treated;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a cancer treatment and imaging system, according to still another embodiment of the invention, wherein a thyroid tumor is being treated and imaged; and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a cancer treatment and imaging system, according to yet another embodiment of the invention, wherein a thyroid tumor is being treated and imaged.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, the presence of one or more biomarkers is evaluated in any body fluid or organ. Exemplary bodily fluids include, but are not limited to, urine, blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), eye cavity fluid, tear film, sputum, fluid obtained from the trachea, bronchi, abdominal cavity, vagina, uterus etc. The biomarkers are analyzed in vitro by methods known in the art, e.g., immunoassays including enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), Western blots, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), etc. The biomarkers are then conjugated with functionalized antibody coated nanoparticles and/or quantum dots, as known in the art.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, one obtains a liquid biopsy sample. Such a sample may be obtained from, e.g., blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CFS), aqueous or vitreous or abdominal cavity fluid, lymph node fluid, bladder fluid, milk duct fluid, sputum, gastric fluid, bile duct fluid, sinus fluid, etc. The patient may or may not have any clinical symptom. The patient may or may not have history of a family disposition for tumors in and/or cancer of the breast, brain, lung, prostate, ovary, pancreas, etc., or a genetic abnormality leading to progression in diseases such as, e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, post traumatic brain syndrome, brain tumor, other neurological disease, age related macular degeneration, an infectious disease, an immune response, etc. The method evaluates the components of the sample for cell free nucleic acid-based biomarkers including but not limited to micoRNA and microDNA; protein-based biomarkers, extracellular vesicle (EV)-based biomarkers that are contained within exosomes, extracellular vesicles, or microvesicles, and circulating tumor cell (CTC)-based biomarkers. The method uses methodologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) or recombinant affinity reagents fabricated into nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes, nanowires, quantum dots, or gold nanoshells, to enhance their detection with the use of, e.g., surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), as known in the art.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For example, if a known tumor exists and there is a known biomarker for the tumor, one may have or prepare an antibody against the tumor to be used in both imaging and therapy. Large tumors with symptoms can be imaged, but before the inventive method, there was a problem when a biomarker was present in a liquid biopsy specimen but the tumor was invisible, e.g., an early stage of a tumor, and there was no symptomatic or radiographic evidence of the tumor.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Detecting a tumor biomarker, typically a protein or a glycoprotein, in a liquid biopsy specimen is facilitated by the inventive methods. Once detected, an antibody against that tumor biomarker can be prepared. The antitumor biomarker antibody is used to locate the tumor. Antibody production is a well-known method in the art, and it will be appreciated that the antibody against either or both of the tumor biomarker and the tumor cell may be recombinant, monoclonal, polyclonal, or an aptamer. The prepared antitumor cell antibodies are conjugated with nanoparticles and administered to a patient, where they target the tumor cells and can be detected and/or treated. Detection is by photoacoustic imaging or by some other type of imaging technology. Treatment is at least by one of thermal energy. The photoacoustic detection and thermal treatment is described herein.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, any specific tumor related biomarker may be used. One example uses trastuzumab or herceptin, a recombinant monoclonal antibody, against the oncogene HER-2, previously mentioned, which is a member of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER/EGFR/ERBB) family. Other examples of known monoclonal antibodies or biologics include, but are not limited to, rituximab, cetuximab, racotunomab, obinotuzumab, pertuzumab, belaniatumomab, bevacizumab, nivolumab, ofatumumab, botezomib, daratumumab, ipilumumab, pembrolizumab, and daratumumab.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, in the absence of a specific biomarker, antibodies against biomarkers that are shared by a number of the tumors may be used. Such biomarkers include glycosaminoglycan, which is specific for a group of cancers such as bladder, gastrointestinal, glioblastoma, etc. Antibodies against such biomarkers are then conjugated with nanoparticles, termed functionalized nanoparticles. The term &#x201c;functionalized&#x201d; indicates nanoparticles that have been coated to render them soluble, biocompatible, and/or targeted by conjugating them with a biomolecule such as an antibody.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the nanoparticle may be one or more of the following compounds or contain one or more of the following components: quantum dots, nanowires, nanotubes, nanoshells, nanocages, perovskites, nanoparticles that are magnetic such as iron or iron oxide, paramagnetic, or nanoparticles that are non-magnetic such as gold, gold-silica, gold-iron, silica coated gold nanospheres and nanorods, ferritic, quartz, graphene, carbon, zinc oxide, piezoelectric, etc. Any of these nanoparticles, alone or in combination, may be conjugated or otherwise associated with the biomarkers' antibodies, using methods known in the art.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another embodiment, self-assembling bio/nano hybrid material consisting of two constituents at the nanometer or molecular level composed of inorganic and organic compounds, having amphiphilic characteristics, i.e., hydrophilic and lipophilic components or micelles, which may be radioactive (e.g., Cu<sup>64</sup>) or radioactive (e.g., tin) are prepared with biocompatible coatings and administered in the body for both therapy and imaging.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, the functionalized nanoparticles travel in the body and attach to receptors of desired cells, e.g., tumors, Alzheimer's plaque, drusen of the retina, etc. These nanoparticles are imaged by applying external thermal energy and/or by applying a reversible or alternating magnetic field. The thermal energy causes the nanoparticles to expand, producing an ultrasound wave in the tissue. The ultrasound wave can be detected by an ultrasonic receiver which is imaged in two to three dimensional formats as a tomogram. In another embodiment, the plaques in Alzheimer's disease, and the drusen in age related macular degeneration, are rendered visible using silica coated nanoparticles &#x3c;2 nm in diameter administered with turmeric, glycosaminoglycan, amyloid antibody, or percolan, etc. and are quantified. In another embodiment, the nanoparticles are conjugated with antibodies, medications, sterols, antibiotics, antifungals, antibacterials, antiproliferative agents, etc. that can be released from silica coated gold nanoparticles when coated with thermosensitive polymers, e.g., chitosan coated nanoparticles heated to 40&#xb0; C.-42&#xb0; C., to treat various diseases including bacteria, fungi, parasites, plaque, drusen, etc. In another embodiment, the plaques and drusen can be quantified by imaging using light, MRI, photoacoustic technology imaging, etc.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another embodiment, the functionalized anti-biomarker-conjugated nanoparticle, ranges in size from 1 nm to 900 nm. In another embodiment, the functionalized biomarker ranges in size from 1 nm to 8 nm, chosen to enhance their elimination through the kidney for facilitated clearance.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, the nanoparticles are rendered magnetic by coating with a thin film of iron oxide prior to their conjugation with biomarkers' antibodies.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the nanoparticles are rendered more biocompatible by coating with a compound, including but not limited to the following: (poly)ethylene glycol, cell penetrating peptide (CPP), activating CPP (ACPP), biotin, streptavidin, etc., as known in the art, prior to their injection in the body.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Thermal energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation, ultrasound, or an alternating magnetic field is applied, under the control of a photoacoustic imaging system, to the organ suspected of potentially harboring an as yet invisible neoplasm. The thermal energy applied increases the temperature of the exposed nanoparticle, and creates a photoacoustic or thermoacoustic image or tomogram of the accumulated heated nanoparticles. This image or tomogram represents a suspected neoplasm in that organ, and is compared to an image taken without the thermal application radiographically.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, one administers functionalized antibody-coated nanoparticles that, once attached to tumor cells, become visible with a photoacoustic imaging unit that corroborates with an image obtained or not seen with other technology such as ultrasound, MRI, PET, CT scan, etc. In one embodiment, the images obtained with other instruments are either overlapped using a processor or are taken simultaneously during photoacoustic or thermoacoustic imaging. In one embodiment, after administration of the antibody-coated nanoparticle, an MRI image is overlapped with the photoacoustic image and compared by a processor to verify the changes in the imaged area.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment, the nanoparticles are incorporated in liposomes.

After controllably increasing the temperature of the functionalized nanoparticle to between 40&#xb0; C.-43&#xb0; C. by increased energy delivery through a thermal delivery source, under the control of the photoacoustic (or thermoacoustic) imaging system and a processor, the temperature-sensitive coating polymers, such as chitosan, melts and release medications specific to the pathology. For example, a medication to dissolve amyloid plaques would be administered to a patient with Alzheimer's disease; a medication to remove retinal drusen would be administered to a patient with age-related retinal disease, etc.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the functionalized nanoparticle, e.g., a nanoshell, nanocage, etc., is combined with biodendrimers that are conjugated with biomarkers and monoclonal antibodies and/or genes, e.g., siRNA, mRNA, etc., for simultaneous visualization and therapy.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, the functionalized nanoparticle, e.g., a nanoshell, nanocage, etc., is combined with biodendrimers that are conjugated with biomarkers and monoclonal antibodies and/or genes, e.g., siRNA, mRNA, and CRISPR Cas9 and Kr&#xfc;ppel associated box (KRAB) domain to silence the tumor gene etc., for simultaneous visualization and therapy.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In another embodiment, after thermal imaging one increases the temperature of the functionalized nanoparticles. This is achieved by increased energy delivered by a thermal delivery source under the control of the photoacoustic or thermoacoustic imaging system connected to a processor. The energy delivery unit increases the temperature of the functionalized nanoparticles to 42&#xb0; C.-43&#xb0; C. to melt the temperature-sensitive coating polymers, such as chitosan, and release anticancer medications, or inhibitory genes, siRNA, miRNA, and CRISPR Cas9 and KRAB domain to neutralize a tumor gene or checkpoint inhibitors, or introduce missing genes, or add any other genes for gene editing from the thermosensitive coating of the nanoparticles along with a CRISPR complex to modify the genetic composition of the tumor cells, etc. In another embodiment, the temperature of the functionalized nanoparticles is increased, by the thermal delivery unit via a processor under the control of the photoacoustic or thermoacoustic imaging unit, to image the temperature and control it to 45&#xb0; C.-47&#xb0; C., to 47&#xb0; C., or to 50&#xb0; C. to kill the suspected tumor to which the antibody-coated nanoparticles are attached.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, one synthetizes hybrid, very small (1 nm-8 nm) gold silica nanoparticles that have a dual function, the nanoparticles antibody coated for imaging, and having photovoltaic and magnetic properties, to release one or more gene(s) or medication(s) at certain temperatures, creating a photoacoustic response for imaging in the body by light stimulation in the eye for simultaneous imaging and therapy.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, using antibody coated quantum dots and light of a specific wavelength that is absorbed by the quantum dot and emits light of a different wavelength, one can render the moving tumor cells and extracellular vesicle visible attached to the quantum dots in the retinal or choroidal vessels, or vessels and tumors of the skin, or tumors located beneath the skin and their feeding vessels, by light absorbed by the quantum dots circulating in the vessels, as is done in fluorescence angiography with appropriate filters and camera.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In another embodiment, a gold quantum dot in a mesoporous silica shell or cage is coated with an antibody or a biomarker to any cell, e.g., neuronal or tumor cells, retinal drusen, Alzheimer plaques, etc. for delivering medication or gene to an organ, e.g., to the retina or brain.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In another embodiment, the extent of plaque or drusen, as an indicator of disease progression in the brain or eye, respectively, can be evaluated by conjugating nanoparticles with antibodies to glycosaminoglycan, heparin sulfate, glycosaminoglycan, and/or heparin sulfate proteoglycan, and injecting the composition into the body or locally to adhere to plaques or drusen for diagnosis, quantitation, and/or therapy with antibodies and medication.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In another embodiment, the nanoparticles are used for simultaneous imaging and thermotherapy of very small tumors. The nanoparticles are heated to a temperature ranging from 41&#xb0; C.-43&#xb0; C., releasing anti-cancer medication, along with inhibitory siRNA, or modify a gene using the CRISPR cas9 system or another CRISPR system, additionally releasing checkpoint inhibitors such as CTLA-4 or PD-1 along with tumoricidal vectors, etc.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, the nanoparticles are rendered radioactive by coating with the nanoparticles with alpha or beta radiators that are antibody specific or nonspecific biomarkers of the tumor. The nanoparticles can also be coated with heat sensitive polymers, including but not limited to chitosan, PEG, poly amino esters, etc.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, checkpoint inhibitors defined as immune system components that act as co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory molecules, poisons such as bee or snake venom, or other toxic agents that damage tumor cell membranes, or interleukin-2 (IL-2), or toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), or genes that inhibit tumor growth, siRNA, siDNA, mi RNA, mDNA along with the CRISPR-cas9 complex with and without KRAB domain or variations of these may be used to silence the tumor gene.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, the nanoparticles are coated with a specific or a nonspecific biomarker such as glycosaminoglycan and injected into the circulation, into a body fluid such as the lymphatic system or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or inside a body cavity. Examples of injection sites include, but are not limited to, eye, sinuses, abdominal cavity, bladder, uterus, etc. The nanoparticles may also be injected into the breast ducts, e.g., through the nipple, inside the brain, into the prostate or other organ, or may even be applied topically. The injected nanoparticles circulate and seek cells bearing a receptor to their antibody, or cells with specific receptors or biomolecules, and readily attach within minutes or hours.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, specific or non-specific biomarkers' antibodies are conjugated with nanoparticles and injected either into circulation or locally into a body cavity. The nanoparticles travel and seek cells bearing specific receptors or biomolecules, and attach within a few hours. The patient's body or organ is then scanned, with the thermal energy producing radiation or an alternating or reversible magnetic field to heat the nanoparticles. Using photoacoustic or thermoacoustic technology, the sound wave generated by the thermal expansion of the nanoparticle induced by absorption of the thermal energy is recorded. The sound wave signals may originate from any part of the body, or from a specific organ.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment, an alternating magnetic field produces heat in magnetic nanoparticles as a result of rapid circular or semicircular motion of the nanoparticles. The patient's body is scanned within the reversible magnetic field, and the photoacoustic or thermoacoustic sound is recorded as a temperature profile of the site of the nanoparticle/cell membrane imaged and location of the lesion is verified.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In another embodiment, other sources of thermal energy are used. Such sources include, but are not limited to, electromagnetic radiation, visible light, invisible light, infrared radiation, microwaves, or radiofrequency waves, etc. The nanoparticles are heated from body temperature of 37&#xb0; C. to 40&#xb0; C. or 43&#xb0; C., or if needed to 45&#xb0; C. At the desired temperature, e.g., 41&#xb0; C.-43&#xb0; C., the heat sensitive coating of the nanoparticle melts, releasing its cargo of, e.g., medication, gene, etc., thus facilitating or enhancing passage of these compounds through the membrane of the neoplastic cells.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In another embodiment, use of a photoacoustic or thermoacoustic technology unit controls the thermal delivery unit and the thermal energy delivered to the nanoparticles to maintain or reach a predetermined temperature for a desired time.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, the temperature rise of the nanoparticles expands them, producing a photoacoustic or thermoacoustic sound wave. This photoacoustic or thermoacoustic sound wave is recorded by one or multiple ultrasonic receivers located on the patient's skin. The signal can be obtained from any part of the body, or from a specific organ, since the signal travels through the body as a wave. The signal or sound pulse is converted to an electric pulse in the receiver, then is amplified and imaged on a monitor. A processor produces a two- or three-dimension image of the lesion, localizing the location of the sound and indicating the size of a lesion and its temperature by the amplitude of the sound pulse.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one embodiment, photoacoustic or thermoacoustic imaging is used for a very early stage diagnosis of cancerous lesion that are less than 2 mm in diameter, which are radiographically invisible without knowing their exact location in the body (e.g., for the tissue surface in the eye and visible cavities).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one embodiment using photoacoustic technology and a specific or non-specific tumor biomarker, a very small lesion (&#x3c;2 mm in diameter) is imaged in the body when the tumor has not caused any clinical symptom. The inventive method thus is used to differentiate a malignant lesion from a benign lesion, even if the cancerous lesion is inside a begin lesion. It is noteworthy that biopsy of these very small tumors, even when the lesion is visible, e.g., on skin or under the retina, may not yield malignant cells if the biopsy is performed on a part of the lesion that contains benign cells. With tumors in the brain, it is most often the case that the tumors will not be noted, absent a neurological symptom.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, the inventive method is used with specific biomarkers of a tumor such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, glioma, pancreatic malignancies, along with nonspecific biomarkers. The location and size of a malignant tumor in any organ is imaged in a patient with a genetic propensity to develop a tumor. The thermal energy may also be applied, if desired, to treat the lesion simultaneously with providing the photoacoustic or thermoacoustic effect. Subsequent evaluation of the level of these biomarkers in the blood indicate if the lesion was damaged or eliminated by the method, including use of medicaments and/or other treatment agents delivered by the method as cargo in the nanoparticles.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment, a combination of biomarkers can be used in an early stage. For example, specific or nonspecific bio-markers such as glycosaminoglycans can be used in imaging a malignant lesion using antibody-coated nanoparticles to photoacoustically or thermoacoustically image the presence of a very small early stage tumor anywhere in the body.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In another embodiment, the inventive method is employed to determine residual tumor cells that may have been left at the site of a tumor resection or elsewhere in the body, and to treat or eliminate the residual tumor cells.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another embodiment, the functionalized nanoparticles are conjugated with one of the recombinant, monoclonal, or polyclonal antibodies or aptamers known in the art and administered along with either one or more toxin(s) or antibodies, along with a medication that is provided at a much lower dose systemically to kill the already compromised tumor cells.

All &#x201c;photoacoustic&#x201d; terminology has previously been used for describing tissue heating or the difference in the temperature between two tissues, vessels vs. skin, and has been done with light alone, not in combination with nanoparticles. In one embodiment, the method is performed for therapy by providing the patient with at least one antibody-coated functionalized nanoparticle having a detectable property, with the antibody targeting the functionalized nanoparticle to a specific patient site, then heating the nanoparticles to generate a photoacoustic signal, i.e., thermal therapy, and imaging to visualize any localized nanoparticle at the site. The ultrasonic receiver of the photoacoustic unit is an array of ultrasonic receivers mounted on a hand held probe simultaneously recording multiple photoacoustic signals from the lesion during thermal energy application which in one embodiment is pulsating.

In this embodiment, the mechanism of drug release with focused ultrasound can broadly be divided into thermal and mechanical processes (or a combination of both). The thermal release requires an ultrasound-induced temperature increase at the target region from the absorption of acoustic energy. The thermal release using ultrasound generally requires moderate intensities of several W/cm<sup>2</sup>, high duty cycles up to 100%, moderate pressures of hundreds of kPa to MPa range, and long treatment times, of the order of several seconds to 30 minutes. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has a focal intensity of a few kW/cm2, and the temperature rise is 60-100&#xb0; C. In this embodiment, HIFU therapy is used to damage diseased tissue through ablation or cavitation. Compared to continuous HIFU, pulsed HIFU (pHIFU) with low duty cycles (&#x3c;10%) can significantly reduce the temperature rise and may be used to promote the mechanical effects, such as acoustic cavitation. Low-intensity focused ultrasound has a focal intensity of a few tens of W/cm2 and results in the temperature rise of 41-45&#xb0; C. To limit unspecific heat damage to normal tissues, low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) can be used in combination with drug carriers (such as thermosensitive liposomes). In this approach, the payloads are delivered at a few degrees above physiological temperatures.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0144">In one embodiment, drug delivery systems comprising thermosensitive liposomes are used, which release the encapsulated drug when heated to hyperthermia temperatures at 41-43&#xb0; C. At these temperatures, nanoparticle extravasation increases, likely due to increased pore sizes between endothelial cells and increased intravascular blood flow. The mechanism for mechanical release in the absence of a temperature increase is not well known. Mechanical release can be caused from high mechanical stresses on the drug carrier shell using short ultrasound pulses causing membrane rupture and generation of membrane pores. In this embodiment, doxorubicin is released in response to LIFU (thermal) and pHIFU (mechanical) exposure.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0145">In one embodiment, methylene blue at doses of &#x3c;0.5 microgram/ml and beta-propiolactone (BPL) at &#x3c;0.5 mg/ml with or without anti-neoplastic medication, or methylene blue derivatives at a very low concentration can be used for vaccine production, or peptide nucleic acid (PNA) can be added, without the use of heat or light, but it is potentially a carcinogenic medication, therefore the vaccine/in-culture medium is washed and filtered to remove free methylene blue and its derivatives and/or beta-propiolactone, and use the remaining proteins, glycoproteins, saccharides, etc. to make a therapeutic vaccine, with additionally one or more antineoplastic medications or antibacterials are added to kill the tumor cells and bacteria and/or peptoids or synthetic peptoids are added, plus cell inflammatory pathway inhibitors (e.g., Rock inhibitors, Fasudil, Wnt inhibitors, GSK inhibitors, and/or integrin inhibitors) may be combined with the vaccine to reduce the inflammatory response, and/or VLPs, toll-like receptors, or oval albumin or aluminum-based compounds called adjuvants or recombinant spider silk proteins or saponin-based adjuvants (SBAs), etc. are added to the vaccine to stimulate an immune response against the tumor in the body.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0146">In one embodiment, thermosensitive liposomes with encapsulated doxorubicin are prepared with a liposomal lipid, DPPC, and a non-ionic surfactant consisting of PEGylated acyl chains, Brij&#xae; S2, at a composition of 96:4 mol %.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0147">In one embodiment, tumor cells of a patient are exposed to focused ultrasound in two different exposure regimes: (a) low intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) for thermal exposure, and (b) pulsed high intensity focused ultrasound (pHIFU) for mechanical damage.
