No. 16/142,839 filed Sep. 26, 2018, which claims priority to Danish Patent Application No. PA 2017 70751 filed Oct. 3, 2017. Each of the aforementioned applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of power converters, more specifically for circuits for control of power converters e.g. in wind turbines.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electric control signals for control of power switching circuits, gatedrive circuits, e.g. in a wind turbine, is normally transferred via galvanic separation means. The signals can e.g. be transferred via a traditional 1:1 electric transformer to provide galvanic separation. Such transformer will normally be located inside the converter cabinet, and thus inside the power stack where it is a part of the gatedriver, driving an IGBT module.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a wind turbine with an electric power of several MW, the environment inside the converter cabinet is influence by a strong magnetic radiation due to large currents running through the busbars, generating a surrounding magnetic field. There will also be stray magnetic fields around reactors in the converter, and finally EMI is generated by the commutation of the power modules. Very high currents processed in a MW converter in the busbars and components at switching frequencies of up to typically 10 kHz will generate strong fields which are picked up by the gatedriver transformer. This will lead to a wrong signal level transfer over the galvanic barrier of the gatedriver, thus distorting the control signals, which again may cause errors in the control function of the power electronic switches of the converter. In worst case scenarios this may lead to a cross conduction of the IGBT, if there is no other systems in place to secure this cannot happen, on the high voltage side of the gatedriver.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, according to the above description, it is an object of the present invention to provide a device and method for providing a magnetically immune galvanic separation for use in high power gatedrivers, e.g. for use in the control of an electric power converter of a wind turbine.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a first aspect, the invention provides a gatedriver circuit arranged to generate an electric control signal output for controlling switching of a power electronic switch, the gatedriver circuit comprising<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">a transformer arranged to receive an electric control signal at its electric input and to transform the electric control signal to the electric control signal output at its electric output, wherein the transformer provides a galvanic separation between its electric input and output, and wherein the transformer comprises</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">separate first and second cores of magnetically conductive material, wherein each of the first and second cores are shaped to form respective closed loops,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">a first electrical conductor forming the electric input, wherein the first electrical conductor has at least one winding arranged around a part of the first core and at least one winding arranged around a part of the second core,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0010">a second electrical conductor forming the electric output, wherein the second electrical conductor has at least one winding arranged around a part of the first core and at least one winding arranged around a part of the second core,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0011">wherein the first core is positioned in relation to the second core so as to allow mutual magnetic interaction between the first and second cores, and wherein the windings of the first and second electrical conductors around the first core have the same winding direction, and wherein the windings of the first and second electrical conductors around the second core have opposite winding direction of the windings of the first and second electrical conductors around the first core, so as to counteract electric influence induced by a common magnetic field through the closed loops of the first and second cores.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0012">Such gatedriver circuit is advantageous, since it allows galvanic separation which is highly immune towards strong magnetic fields which may disturb signal transfer using a traditional transformer. By the use of two separate cores and the opposite winding directions, the influence of magnetic fields on the control signal can be eliminated or at least significantly reduced, thereby allow the gatedriver circuit to function also in environments with strong magnetic fields.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0013">Thus, such gatedriver circuit can be used in high power applications, such as for control of power electronic switches in an electric converter for powers of 1 MW or more, e.g. for large wind turbines, without functional problems due to magnetic interference with gatedriver control signals. Still, this galvanic separation can be obtained by the use of simple components.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0014">Even further, the gatedrive circuit according to the first aspect has the advantage that a traditional transformer can be replacement with the transformer of the invention without any further modification of the transmitter and receiver circuits.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">It has been found that a suppression of magnetic influence of 10-20 dB, or even more than 20 dB can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">In the following, preferred embodiments and features of the gatedriver circuit will be described.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">Preferably, the first conductor has the same number of windings around the first and second cores, and the second conductor preferably also has the same number of windings around the first and second cores. This will provide the most effective cancelling of the magnetic influence.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">The first and second cores may have identical geometrical shapes, or they may have different shapes, e.g. they may have similar geometrical shapes but with different size. In a preferred embodiment, both of the first and second cores have toroid shapes, e.g. the two toroids may be identical, and they may be stacked, i.e. with the first core positioned on top of the second core. The toroids may have an outer diameter of such as 1-20 cm, such 2-10 cm.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">In some embodiments, the first and second cores have different sizes, but have, e.g. the same geometrical shape, thereby enabling that the first core to be positioned inside the closed loop of the second core.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">The first and second cores may be made of a ferrite material. However, other materials known to be used for transformer core material may be used.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">The first electrical conductor may have 2-50 windings arranged around a part of the first core and 2-50 windings arranged around a part of the second core. Likewise, the second electrical conductor has 2-50 windings arranged around a part of the first core and 2-50 windings arranged around a part of the second core. The transformer may be designed to provide a voltage transformation ratio of 0.5 to 2.0 from its electric input to its electric output. Especially, the number of windings of the first and second electrical conductors are equal or substantially equal, so as to provide a voltage ratio of 0.8-1.2, such as 10-20 windings of each of the first and second electrical conductors so as to provide a voltage ratio of 1.0.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">It is to be understood that the first and second electrical conductors are preferably electrically insulated wires, such as copper wires or wires of other electrically conductive materials.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">Preferably, the gatedriver circuit comprises a transmitter circuit connected to the first electrical conductor and a receiver circuit connected to the second electrical conductor. The transmitter circuit may especially be arranged to generate an electric control signal with a frequency within the interval 10 kHz to 5 MHz. Especially, the electric control signal may be a series of impulse signals.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">In a second aspect, the invention provides an electric power converter comprising a plurality of power electronic switches controlled and an electric gatedriver circuit according to the first aspect for controlling the plurality of power electronic switches. Especially, the gatedriver circuit is arranged to generate the electric control signal output to control the plurality of power electronic switches at a switching frequency of below 10 kHz.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">The power converter may especially comprise an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) module, wherein the gatedriver circuit is arranged to control switching of the IGBT module. Alternatively, or additionally, the power electronic switches may include one or more of: mosfet, GTO, IGCT, and/or comprises power electronic switches based on silicon carbide (SiC) technologies.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">Especially, the power converter may be dimensioned to convert electric power of at least 1 MW, such as 2-10 MW or more.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">In a third aspect, the invention provides a wind turbine comprising a gatedriver circuit according to the first aspect, or an electric power converter according to the second aspect.

However, it is to be understood that the invention may be other power electric applications, especially where operation of power electronic switches are controlled by control signals in an environment involving strong magnetic fields.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a wind turbine with three rotor blades for driving an electric generator located inside the nacelle on top of a tower. Typically, the electric power converter in a wind turbine can be placed up-tower or down tower. The full scale converter typically comprises a power stack for AC/DC conversion and a power stack for DC/AC conversion. Furthermore the converter system comprises reactors, filter capacitors, breakers, busbars and other converter related systems. The gatedriver circuit with the galvanic separation transformer according to the invention will normally be located inside the converter cabinet, inside the power stack where it is a part of the gatedriver, driving power electronic switches in the form of an IGBT module. Strong magnetic fields are present inside the converter, due to large currents, e.g. thousands of amperes, running through the busbars, generating surrounding magnetic field. There will also be stray magnetic fields around reactors in the converter. Further, EMI is generated by the commutation of the power.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of a traditional toroid transformer for providing galvanic separation in the transfer of control signals, typically impulse signals in the frequency range 10 kHz to 5 MHz, for controlling of switching of power electronic switches of the electric power converter which operate at a switching frequency of up to 10 kHz, e.g. 1 kHz to 10 kHz. Here, a primary winding around a part of the toroid core serves to receive an electric input signals E_I and generate a corresponding electric output signal E_O at a secondary winding. However, a magnetic field B will induce a voltage in the secondary winding which will influence the electric output signals E_O, and thus makes the signal transfer susceptible to external magnetic air flux field. This can lead to errors in the control signals, and generate a false turn on of the power electronic switches in the connected power module if not handled properly.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an embodiment of the transformer for the gatedriver circuit according to the invention. In this embodiment, two separate identical toroid cores of magnetically conductive material are wound by a first electrical conductor forming an electric input E_I, and a second electrical conductor forms an electric output E_O. The first electrical conductor has windings arranged around a part of the first core and windings arranged around a part of the second core. The second electrical conductor has windings arranged around a part of the first core and at least one winding arranged around a part of the second core.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0048">The winding directions are indicated on the conductors with arrows, and the first and second electrical conductors around the first core have the same winding direction, and wherein the windings of the first and second electrical conductors around the second core have opposite winding direction of the windings of the first and second electrical conductors around the first core.

Preferably, the first conductor has equal number of windings around the first and second toroid, and the second conductor has equal number of windings around the first and second toroid, so as to provide the most effective cancelling of the magnetic influence. E.g. the number of windings of the first and second conductors are equal, so as to provide a 1:1 voltage transformation.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an embodiment of the two toroid principle from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in a top view (upper part) and a side view (lower part).
