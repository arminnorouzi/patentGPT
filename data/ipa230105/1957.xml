As an example, the time history of an environmental representation may be understood/interpreted as a series of frames, within which an object can be tracked (e.g., in a time domain, based on the update interval and/or time period between frames). Additionally or alternatively, the term frame can refer to a coordinate system (a.k.a. coordinate frame; such as an ego vehicle frame) at a particular time and/or the data received from a set of sensors at a particular time (e.g., frame of data from imaging or time-of-flight sensor, etc.). However, the term frame can be otherwise suitably referenced and/or may have any other suitable meaning.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In variants, a labeling subsystem <b>122</b> and/or a relabeling subsystem <b>124</b> can function in the role of a &#x201c;tracker&#x201d;, &#x201c;object tracker&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;object tracking system&#x201d; insofar as they individually and/or collectively track objects through a time-history of the environment (e.g., historical environmental representations). Accordingly, the labeling subsystem and/or relabeling subsystem can be individually and/or collectively be referenced herein as a &#x201c;tracker,&#x201d; &#x201c;object tracker,&#x201d; &#x201c;object tracking system,&#x201d; and/or other like terms; or may be otherwise suitably referenced. As an example, the labelling subsystem can function as a primitive tracker (and/or primitive object tracker) which generates a primitive environmental representation, including primitive object tracks, which may be subsequently refined by the relabeling subsystem. As a second example, the relabeling subsystem can function to track and/or refine object trajectories to generate an updated (refined) environmental representation based on historical environmental representations. As a third example, the labeling subsystem <b>122</b> and the relabeling subsystem <b>124</b> can collectively function as a tracker and/or tracking system, receiving sensor data inputs (e.g., individual sensor data, which may include object associations) and tracking/labeling objects through a time-history of the environment (e.g., historical environmental representations) to generate an updated/refined environmental representation. As a fourth example, the labeling subsystem <b>122</b> and the relabeling subsystem <b>124</b> can collectively operate within a single tracking cycle and/or update interval. However, the terms &#x201c;tracker,&#x201d; &#x201c;object tracker,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;object tracking system,&#x201d; can be otherwise suitably referenced.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">1.1 Examples</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one variant, a method can include: determining a set of measurement inputs using a sensor suite of a vehicle; using an object tracking system, generating an environmental representation based on the measurement inputs, the environmental representation comprising a set of labelled objects in an environment of the vehicle; determining one or more hypotheses for at least a subset of the set of labelled objects; determining a score for each hypothesis based on a plurality of historical environmental representations associated with the subset of labelled objects; based on the score, updating the environmental representation, including: relabeling the subset of objects based on the hypothesis; and providing the updated environmental representation to a processor onboard the vehicle. In an example, the method can further include autonomously controlling the vehicle using the processor and based on the updated environmental representation.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an illustrative example, a method can include maintaining an environmental representation for a vehicle by repeatedly: at the start of a vehicle tracking cycle, generating an current environmental representation by labelling objects (e.g., using an object tracker) in the ego-vehicle frame using current sensor measurements, and, during a remainder of the tracking cycle, refining the environmental representation by merging and/or splitting objects to improve a score and/or goal and/or objective (e.g., based on smooth object trajectories, based on other metrics, etc.) over a recent time history. At the end of each tracking cycle, the refined environmental representation can be used to autonomously control the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In additional or alternative variations, the method can include a subset of these processes, additional processes, and/or any combination of processes.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">2. Benefits</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The system and method for dynamically updating an environmental representation of an autonomous agent can confer several benefits over current systems and methods.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">First, variations of the technology can provide a recoverable history of objects and/or object states in an environment of an autonomous agent. Such variants can apply smoothing techniques which evaluate the environment and/or objects therein over an extended time history (e.g., multiple sensing frames and/or intervals) to improve an overall estimate when compared to filtering approaches (e.g., where an instantaneous timestep may be evaluated against the immediately preceding timestep; where the t&#x2212;1 timestep captures all historical information used to evaluate at timestep t; etc.). Such &#x2018;smoothing&#x2019; variants may avoid cascading effects, since objects in an environment of the agent can be relabeled in future timesteps and/or prior incorrect labels assigned to the objects can be retroactively corrected (e.g., without cascading effects; an example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), thereby enabling an accurate time history of the agent's environment to be used in decision-making. However, variants may otherwise facilitate recovery of an object state history.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Second, variations of the technology can be adaptable to the time and/or resource requirements of an autonomous agent or autonomous vehicle (AV) application, such as by being customizable with respect to the amount of time and/or computing resources spent on dynamically updating the environmental representation. In specific examples, for instance, a number of iterations of updates and/or a level of computing performed in each update (e.g., number of computing subsystems employed in proposing a new set of labels) can be confined by any number of constraints. Moreover, variants can provide natural degradation of environmental awareness as computational complexity approaches the resource constraints, which can facilitate scalability of the system/method into increasingly complex environments and AV settings (e.g., without missing update intervals due to convergence failures, losing state history, etc.).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Third, variations of the technology can provide cumulative knowledge gain (e.g., over a series of updated environmental representations) to improve efficiency and/or amortize computation over multiple iterations (e.g., within a single frame or update interval; across multiple update intervals; etc.). In specific examples, a cost function being optimized for has its results carried over from iteration to iteration.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Fourth, variations of the technology can provide robust sensor fusion, since the preserved object state history can allow sensor fusion across multiple time intervals/update cycles. As an example, separate object tracks can be preserved in a state history (e.g., even when not fused/recognized as a common object detection in the original frame) and subsequently merged/fused (or segmented/split). In variants, the environmental representation can be generated using low level sensors, low level sensor data (e.g., low level time-of-flight returns rather than feature detections, etc.), and/or low-level compute, while still enabling the agent to have a comprehensive and high confidence understanding of its environment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Fifth, variations of the technology can provide technical solutions necessarily rooted in computer technology to overcome issues specifically arising with computer technology, such as environmental awareness for autonomous vehicle planning/control, recovery of a state history of an object environment, object detection/classification, and/or other computer technology challenges.

The hypothesis can be evaluated by scoring the environmental representation (e.g., using a series of evaluation metrics, using a model of a relabeling module, etc.). The scores can be compared against the score of a current environmental representation and/or prior environmental representations to determine a difference. In one example, a hypothesis whose score exceeds that of the current environmental representation (e.g., and/or which has the greatest global score; highest scoring hypothesis) can be taken as the new environmental representation (e.g., the objects labels of the environmental representation can be updated based on the hypothesis; objects can be relabeled based on the hypothesis).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Additionally or alternatively, any or all of the hypotheses can include labels for only a subset of objects in the environmental representation (e.g., wherein other objects have labels from S<b>220</b>, wherein other objects have no labels, etc.).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Further additionally or alternatively, the scores from multiple hypotheses can be compared against each other (e.g., wherein the highest score is used, wherein the highest score is compared with the score from S<b>220</b>, etc.).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In a second variation, additional to the first, hypotheses can be prioritized for subsequent evaluations (e.g., at a subsequent tracking cycle) based on their scores and/or their difference in score relative to a score in S<b>220</b> and/or relative to each other (i.e., lowest scoring hypothesis can be de-prioritized, hypotheses having small score differences relative to prior environmental representations can be repeatedly evaluated until the labels can be disambiguated, etc.).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In a third variation of the method, a relabeling subsystem can generate one or more hypotheses for each object and evaluate to determine an object label for each object.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In one variant, a method can include: determining a set of measurement inputs using a sensor suite of a vehicle; using an object tracking system, generating an environmental representation based on the measurement inputs, the environmental representation comprising a set of labelled objects in an environment of the vehicle; determining a hypothesis for a subset of the labelled objects; determining a score for the hypothesis based on a plurality of historical environmental representations associated with the subset of labelled objects; based on the score, updating the environmental representation, including: relabeling the subset of objects based on the hypothesis; and providing the updated environmental representation to a processor onboard the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In one variant, a system can include, for a vehicle: a sensor suite onboard the vehicle and configured to generate a set of measurements, wherein the set of measurements corresponds to a measurement time; a memory comprising a set of historical environmental representations; an object tracking system configured to generate an environmental representation based on the measurements, the environmental representation comprising a set of labelled objects; a processing system configured to, within a time interval immediately following the measurement time, repeatedly: determine a first score for the environmental representation based on the set of historical environmental representations; determine a hypothesis for a subset of the labelled objects; determine a second score for the hypothesis based on the set of historical environmental representations; and in response to the second score exceeding the first score, update the environmental representation, comprising: relabeling the subset of objects according to the hypothesis; and a controller configured to operate the vehicle based on the updated environmental representation.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Embodiments of the system and/or method can include every combination and permutation of the various system components and the various method processes, wherein one or more instances of the method and/or processes described herein can be performed asynchronously (e.g., sequentially), contemporaneously (e.g., concurrently, in parallel, etc.), or in any other suitable order by and/or using one or more instances of the systems, elements, and/or entities described herein.
