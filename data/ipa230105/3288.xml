The entire contents of the above-listed application is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present document primarily relates to an electric drive axle, such as for a vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Known electric drive axles with gear reductions often exhibit deficiencies with regard to axle packaging and torque transfer capacity. Space inefficient axle assemblies may therefore not be integrated into space constrained vehicles, thereby limiting the applicability of the axles.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 9,707,834B2 relates to a transmission with a common carrier planetary gear set for a vehicle that has drive axle half shafts defining an axis of rotation, an electric motor/generator with a motor shaft parallel with the axis of rotation, either concentric with the axis of rotation or spaced therefrom, and a differential with a differential carrier connected with the drive axle half shafts. The planetary gear set has a first sun gear member integrally manufactured or selectively connectable with the motor shaft, first and second planet gears, a carrier member rotatably supporting the first and the second planet gears so that the first planet gear meshes with the first sun gear member, and a ring gear member meshing with the planet gears. The ring gear is connectable to a non-rotating housing. The carrier member is operatively connected with the differential carrier.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 8,169,110B2 relates to an oil-cooled motor/generator for an automotive powertrain located outside of the transmission, such as a BAS motor/generator. The motor/generator may have a stator, a rotor circumscribed by the stator, and a motor shaft on which the rotor is mounted for rotation. A housing assembly may surround the stator and the rotor, with a bearing positioned between the housing assembly and the motor shaft. A flow control member may at least partially circumscribe the rotor axially adjacent the stator. A bearing retainer may be positioned axially adjacent the bearing. A rotor end ring may be axially adjacent the rotor. The housing assembly may have an inlet configured to receive cooling oil by spraying or injector. The housing assembly, the flow control member, the bearing retainer and the rotor end ring may be configured to distribute the cooling oil from the inlet to cool the stator, the rotor and lubricate the bearing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there is demand for a compact electric drive axle with high torque transfer capacity.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An electric drive axle which realizes these advantages is described herein.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The presently proposed electric drive axle comprises an electric motor, a first planetary gear set, a second planetary gear set, and a differential assembly. The electric motor is drivingly connected or drivingly connectable to the differential assembly via the first planetary gear set and via the second planetary gear set. As the electric motor is drivingly connected or drivingly connectable to the differential assembly via the first planetary gear set and via the second planetary gear set, the electric drive axle may transfer a high torque and feature a high degree of compactness.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The electric motor usually comprises a rotor rotatable with respect to a rotation axis. The first planetary gear set, the second planetary gear set and the differential assembly may be coaxial with the rotation axis. The electric motor usually further comprises a stator. The stator of the electric motor may enclose or at least partially enclose the rotor of the electric motor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The electric drive axle may comprise a housing. The stator of the electric motor may be stationary relative to the housing. At least one, several or all of the electric motor, the first planetary gear set, the second planetary gear set and the differential assembly may be disposed within the housing. The housing may include a fluid sump holding or configured to hold a lubricant. One or more of the electric motor, the first planetary gear set, the second planetary gear set and the differential assembly may be disposed within the fluid sump. A lubricant held within the fluid sump may then cool the electric motor. Additionally or alternatively, a lubricant held within the fluid sump may lubricate at least one, several or all of the electric motor, the first planetary gear set, the second planetary gear set and the differential assembly.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first planetary gear set and the second planetary gear set may share a common ring gear. The common ring gear may be stationary relative to the housing or to the stator of the electric motor. For example, the common ring gear may be fixed to the housing or may be integral with the housing.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first planetary gear set may be drivingly connected or drivingly connectable to the differential assembly via the second planetary gear set. The first planetary gear set typically comprises a first sun gear, a first planetary carrier and one or more first planet gears rotatably disposed on the first planetary carrier. The second planetary gear set typically comprises a second sun gear, a second planetary carrier and one or more second planet gears rotatably disposed on the second planetary carrier. The first planetary carrier may be rigidly or torsionally connected to the second sun gear.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The rotor of the electric motor may be rigidly connected to or integral with the first sun gear. For example, the rotor of the electric motor and the first sun gear may be connected to one another in a torque-proof manner via a splined connection. One of the first sun gear and the first planetary carrier may be rigidly connected to one of the second sun gear and the second planetary carrier. For example, the first planetary carrier may be rigidly connected to or integral with the second sun gear. The differential assembly typically comprises a differential carrier. The second planetary carrier may then be rigidly connected to or integral with the differential carrier.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The electric drive axle may include a bearing, for example a first bearing, rotatably supporting the first planetary carrier on a rotor of the electric motor. For instance, at least a portion of the first planetary carrier may radially enclose at least a portion of the rotor of the electric motor. The first bearing may then include an outer ring mounted on a radially inner side of the first planetary carrier, wherein the radially inner side of the first planetary carrier faces the rotation axis, an inner ring mounted on a radially outer side of the rotor of the electric motor, wherein the radially outer side of the rotor of the electric motor faces away from the rotation axis, and a plurality of rolling members such as a plurality of spheres radially disposed between and/or received within the inner and the outer ring of the first bearing. A snap ring or circlip mounted on the radially inner side of the first planetary carrier may locate or fix the outer ring of the first bearing along the axial direction. For example, the snap ring or circlip mounted on the radially inner side of the first planetary carrier may restrict axial movement of the outer ring of the first bearing away from the stator of the electric motor or toward the differential assembly. Similarly, a collar mounted on the radially outer side of the rotor of the electric motor may locate or fix the inner ring of the first bearing along the axial direction. For example, the collar mounted on the radially outer side of the rotor of the electric motor may restrict axial movement of the inner ring of the first bearing towards the stator of the electric motor or away from the differential assembly.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The electric drive axle may include a bearing, for example a second bearing, rotatably supporting the first planetary carrier on the housing. For instance, at least a portion of the housing may radially enclose at least a portion of the first planetary carrier. The second bearing may then include an outer ring mounted on a radially inner side of the housing, wherein the radially inner side of the housing faces the rotation axis, an inner ring mounted on a radially outer side of the first planetary carrier, wherein the radially outer side of the first planetary carrier faces away from the rotation axis, and a plurality of rolling members such as a plurality of spheres radially disposed between and/or received within the inner and the outer ring of the second bearing. A collar mounted on or integral with the radially inner side of the housing may locate or fix the outer ring of the second bearing along the axial direction. For example, the collar mounted on or integral with the radially inner side of the housing may restrict axial movement of the outer ring of the second bearing toward the stator of the electric motor or away from the differential assembly. Similarly, a collar mounted on or integral with the radially outer side of the first planetary carrier may locate or fix the inner ring of the second bearing along the axial direction. For example, the collar mounted on or integral with the radially outer side of the first planetary carrier may restrict axial movement of the inner ring of the second bearing away from the stator of the electric motor or toward the differential assembly.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The electric drive axle may include a bearing, for example a third bearing, rotatably supporting the second planetary carrier on the first planetary carrier. For instance, at least a portion of the second planetary carrier may radially enclose at least a portion of the first planetary carrier. The third bearing may then include an outer ring mounted on a radially inner side of the second planetary carrier, wherein the radially inner side of the second planetary carrier faces the rotation axis, an inner ring mounted on a radially outer side of the first planetary carrier, wherein the radially outer side of the first planetary carrier faces away from the rotation axis, and a plurality of rolling members such as a plurality of spheres radially disposed between and/or received within the inner and the outer ring of the third bearing. A collar or shoulder mounted on or integral with the radially outer side of the first planetary carrier may locate or fix the inner ring of the third bearing along the axial direction. For example, the collar or shoulder mounted on or integral with the radially outer side of the first planetary carrier may restrict axial movement of the inner ring of the third bearing toward the stator of the electric motor or away from the differential assembly. Similarly, a collar or shoulder mounted on or integral with the radially inner side of the second planetary carrier may locate or fix the outer ring of the third bearing along the axial direction.

For instance, at least a portion of the housing may radially enclose at least a portion of the differential carrier or of the second planetary carrier. The fourth bearing may then include an outer ring mounted on a radially inner side of the housing, wherein the radially inner side of the housing faces the rotation axis, an inner ring mounted on a radially outer side of the second planetary carrier, wherein the radially outer side of the second planetary carrier faces away from the rotation axis, and a plurality of rolling members such as a plurality of spheres radially disposed between and/or received within the inner and the outer ring of the fourth bearing. A collar or shoulder mounted on or integral with the radially inner side of the housing may locate or fix the outer ring of the fourth bearing along the axial direction. For example, the collar or shoulder mounted on or integral with the radially inner side of the housing may restrict axial movement of the outer ring of the fourth bearing away from the stator of the electric motor and/or away from the differential assembly.

Usually, the electric drive axle further comprises a second drive half shaft coaxial with the first drive half shaft. One of the first drive half shaft and the second drive half shaft may reach through the electric motor, for example through the rotor of the electric motor. Further, one of the first and the second drive half shaft may reach through one or both of the first planetary gear set and the second planetary gear set, for example through the first sun gear and through the second sun gear.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An embodiment of the presently proposed electric drive axle is described in the following detailed description with respect to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows a sectional view of an embodiment of an electric drive axle of the presently proposed type.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> schematically shows a sectional view of a layout of the electric drive axle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an enlarged view of a detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref></p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically illustrates a sectional view of an embodiment of an electric drive axle <b>100</b> of the presently proposed type. For example, the electric drive axle <b>100</b> may be included in an automotive vehicle such as a passenger car, a commercial vehicle such as a truck or bus, or in an off-highway vehicle such as a forklift truck, a tractor, a harvester, a dumper, a wheel loader, or the like. The electric drive axle includes an electric motor <b>1</b>, a first planetary gear set <b>2</b>, a second planetary gear set <b>3</b>, a differential assembly <b>4</b>, a first drive half shaft <b>5</b><i>a</i>, a first vehicle wheel <b>6</b><i>a</i>, a second drive half shaft <b>5</b><i>b</i>, a second vehicle wheel <b>6</b><i>b</i>, and a housing <b>7</b>.

In the embodiment depicted here, the electric motor <b>1</b>, the planetary gear sets <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and the differential assembly <b>4</b> are disposed within the housing <b>7</b>. The drive half shafts <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b </i>are at least partially disposed within the housing <b>7</b>. The housing <b>7</b> includes a fluid sump <b>10</b> for holding a lubricant such as oil. When the fluid sump <b>10</b> is filled or at least partially filled with lubricant, the lubricant may cool the electric motor <b>1</b>. Further, when the fluid sump <b>10</b> is filled or at least partially filled with a lubricant, the lubricant may lubricate one or more of the electric motor, the first planetary gear set <b>2</b>, the second planetary gear set <b>3</b> and the differential assembly <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The electric motor <b>1</b> is drivingly connected to or drivingly engaged with the axle half shafts <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b </i>via the planetary gear sets <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and the differential assembly <b>4</b>. Specifically, the electric motor <b>1</b> is drivingly connected to or drivingly engaged with the second planetary gear set <b>3</b> via the first planetary gear set <b>2</b>. And the first planetary gear set <b>2</b> is drivingly connected to or drivingly engaged with the differential assembly <b>4</b> via the second planetary gear set <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The differential assembly <b>4</b> may be an open differential. For example, the differential assembly <b>4</b> may comprise a differential carrier <b>4</b><i>c </i>and spider gears <b>4</b><i>d </i>rotationally mounted on the differential carrier <b>4</b><i>c</i>.
