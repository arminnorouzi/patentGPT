In an initial state, the driving member <b>32</b> is located, for example, in the middle of the length direction of the carriage <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, it can be seen from the above structures that two belts are wound on the rollers <b>23</b> located at the two ends of the carriage <b>22</b>: the driving belt <b>24</b> and the conveyor belt <b>21</b>. The driving belt <b>24</b> receives a drive force from the driving assembly <b>3</b>, and then transfers the drive force to the conveyor belt <b>21</b> through an intermediate transfer component. A specific transmission process of the motive force is as follows. A driving source <b>31</b> of the driving assembly <b>3</b> drives the driving member <b>32</b> to move linearly, which driving member <b>32</b> is fixed together with the driving belt <b>24</b>. The driving belt <b>24</b> is in driving connection with the rollers <b>23</b>. The movement of the driving belt <b>24</b> causes the rollers <b>23</b> to rotate, and the rotation of the rollers <b>23</b> causes the conveyor belt <b>21</b> to rotate. The item is placed on the conveyor belt <b>21</b>, and the movement of the conveyor belt <b>21</b> causes the item to move from a middle portion of the conveyor belt <b>21</b> to the edge of the conveyor belt <b>21</b>, and then the item falls under the action of inertial force and gravity.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the diameter of a middle portion <b>231</b> of each roller <b>23</b> is smaller than the diameters of two ends <b>232</b> of the roller <b>23</b>, the middle portion <b>231</b> of the roller <b>23</b> is in driving connection with the driving belt <b>24</b>, and the two ends <b>232</b> of the roller <b>23</b> are in driving connection with the conveyor belt <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As the diameter of the middle portion <b>231</b> of the roller <b>23</b> is smaller, the middle portion <b>231</b> of the roller <b>23</b> is in driving connection with the driving belt <b>24</b>. As the diameters of the two ends <b>232</b> of the roller <b>23</b> are larger, the two ends <b>232</b> of the roller <b>23</b> are in driving connection with the conveyor belt <b>21</b>. The conveyor belt <b>21</b> is located on the outer sides and close to edges, and the driving belt <b>24</b> is located on the inner side and close to the middle. This arrangement can achieve that when the driving belt <b>24</b> travels a distance S, the conveyor belt <b>21</b> travels a distance that is n times S. The value of n is greater than <b>1</b>. In some embodiments, their corresponding ratio is such that, for example, when the driving belt <b>24</b> travels a distance S, the conveyor belt <b>21</b> travels a distance that is less than <b>2</b>S and greater than S, such that the item at an edge of the conveyor belt <b>21</b> can also be moved to an edge of another side and unloaded therefrom.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>14</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the middle portion <b>231</b> of the roller <b>23</b> is provided with first anti-slip teeth <b>233</b> cooperating with the driving belt <b>24</b>.

The carriage <b>22</b> is provided with a guide slot <b>221</b>, which extends in the same direction as the second direction B, and the slider <b>25</b> is mounted in the guide slot <b>221</b>. Providing the slider <b>25</b> can make the linear movement of the driving member <b>32</b> smoother, such that the rotation of the driving belt <b>24</b> driven by the driving member <b>32</b> is also smoother and more reliable, and the rotation of the rollers <b>23</b> is also smoother, so the movement of the conveyor belt <b>21</b> driven by the rollers <b>23</b> is also smoother and less prone to wobble.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, in some embodiments, to make the conveying motion of the conveyor belt <b>2</b> smoother, the article sorting and conveying apparatus is further provided with a guiding assembly <b>4</b>.

An axle of the guide wheel <b>26</b> is pivoted to two adjacent links described above.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, two guiding assemblies <b>4</b> are provided, and one or more guide wheels <b>26</b> are provided on each side of the bottom of the carriage <b>22</b> of the article carrying assembly <b>2</b>. The guide groove <b>41</b> extends in the same direction as the first direction, and the guide wheel <b>26</b> moves along the guide groove <b>41</b> of the guiding assembly <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Other implementations of the roller <b>23</b> are described below.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In other embodiments, the roller <b>23</b> located at each end of the carriage <b>22</b> is not an integral whole, but includes a plurality of independent rollers <b>23</b>. Specifically, the roller <b>23</b> located at each end of the carriage <b>22</b> includes a first roller and a second roller. The first roller is rotatably mounted to the carriage <b>22</b> and in driving connection with the driving belt <b>24</b>. The second roller is rotatably mounted to the carriage <b>22</b> and driven coaxially with the first roller; the diameter of the first roller is smaller than that of the second roller; and the second roller is in driving connection with the conveyor belt <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In other embodiments, the first roller is in driving cooperation with the driving belt <b>24</b>, and the second roller is in driving cooperation with the conveyor belt <b>21</b>. The first roller and the second roller located at the same end of the carriage <b>22</b> are mounted to the same rotating shaft, i.e., rotation center lines of the first roller and the second roller are coaxial. A transmission path of the motive force is as follows. The driving source <b>31</b> drives the driving member <b>32</b> to move linearly, and the driving belt <b>24</b> fixedly connected with the driving member <b>32</b> is brought into motion, thereby causing the first roller to rotate. The first roller causes the second roller coaxial therewith to rotate through the rotating shaft. The rotation of the second roller brings the conveyor belt <b>21</b> into motion. It is to be noted that due to the relatively short path of movement required for the sorting motion, the conveyor belt <b>21</b> does not move circularly in a 360-degree range, but rather just moves to the extent that the item located on the conveyor belt <b>21</b> is moved from any position on the conveyor belt <b>21</b> to an edge of the conveyor belt <b>21</b> where a sorting port M for required sorting is located. Different rollers <b>23</b> cooperate with the driving belt <b>24</b> and the conveyor belt <b>21</b> respectively, which facilitates processing and manufacturing.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">How to implement the sorting motion is introduced below.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The sorting motion is implemented in such a manner that the driving assembly <b>3</b> drives the conveyor belt <b>21</b> to move. The sorting motion is independent from the conveying motion. In other words, the conveying motion of the conveyor belt <b>21</b> is implemented in such a manner that the conveying assembly <b>1</b> brings the entire article carrying assembly <b>2</b> into motion, and the sorting motion is movement of the conveyor belt <b>21</b> relative to the conveying assembly <b>1</b>. The sorting motion of the article carrying assembly <b>21</b> exists regardless of whether the conveying assembly <b>1</b> moves.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The driving assembly <b>3</b> includes the driving source <b>31</b> and the driving member <b>32</b>. The driving source <b>31</b> does not move with the conveying motion nor with the sorting motion. The driving source <b>31</b> is fixed at a position corresponding to the sorting port M. The driving source <b>31</b> is in non-contact driving connection with the driving member <b>32</b>. The driving member <b>32</b> is mounted to the article carrying assembly <b>2</b>; and the driving assembly <b>3</b> is configured to drive the conveyor belt <b>21</b> to move in a second direction, which is the direction of the sorting motion. The first direction and the second direction intersect each other, such as being perpendicular to each other.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The driving source <b>31</b> and the driving member <b>32</b> are not in contact and are separated by a certain distance, i.e., there is a gap between the driving source <b>31</b> and the driving member <b>32</b>. Only the driving member <b>32</b> need to be arranged on the article carrying assembly <b>2</b>, and no control components such as power supply and signal transmission components need to be arranged on the article carrying assembly <b>2</b>. This greatly reduces the structural complexity of the article carrying assembly <b>2</b> and also improves the reliability of the article carrying assembly <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In practical applications, the position of the sorting port M is basically determined, and the driving source <b>31</b> is installed at the position corresponding to the sorting port M, and the driving source <b>31</b> is common. In some embodiments described above, the article sorting and conveying apparatus further includes the guiding assembly <b>4</b> for guiding the article carrying assembly <b>2</b>, and the driving source <b>31</b> is fixed to the guiding assembly <b>4</b>. For example, the entire article sorting and conveying apparatus includes four sorting ports M1, M2, M3 and M4. One driving source <b>31</b> is provided at each of the four sorting ports M1, M2, M3 and M4. All article carrying assemblies <b>2</b> are only provided with the driving members <b>32</b>. When the item needs to be sorted out of the sorting port M1, the driving source <b>31</b> at the sorting port M1 is started. When the article carrying assembly <b>2</b> is transported to the sorting port M1, the driving source <b>31</b> drives the conveyor belt <b>21</b> of the article carrying assembly <b>2</b> to move to drop the item off the conveyor belt <b>21</b> into the corresponding sorting port.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the above technical solution, as the driving source <b>31</b> of each sorting port is common, there is no need to provide both the driving source <b>31</b> and the drive part <b>32</b> on the article carrying assembly <b>2</b>, which greatly reduces the number of driving sources <b>31</b> needed on the one hand, and achieves that the entire article sorting and conveying apparatus is more compact and needs fewer components to achieve the same performance on the other hand, thus optimizing the structure of the article sorting and conveying apparatus.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some embodiments, the driving assembly <b>3</b> includes a linear motor. The driving source <b>31</b> includes a primary part, and the driving member <b>32</b> includes a secondary part. The primary part and the guiding assembly <b>4</b> are mounted together, and both are fixed and motionless. The secondary part moves with the conveying motion of the article carrying assembly <b>2</b>. When the secondary part moves to a position where it can be driven by the primary part, the primary part drives the secondary part to move linearly, and then the movement of the secondary part is converted into movement of the conveyor belt <b>21</b> by the components of the article carrying assembly <b>2</b> described above.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Specifically, the article carrying assembly <b>2</b> is provided with a slidable secondary part at the bottom, and the belt of the article carrying assembly <b>2</b> is fixedly connected to the secondary part. When the secondary part is excited by the linear motor, it moves either left or right depending on the direction of excitation, thereby causing the conveyor belt <b>21</b> to rotate and throw the item on the article carrying assembly <b>2</b> into the port. As the article carrying assemblies <b>2</b> passes through the sorting port in sequence, one driving source <b>31</b> provided at the sorting port drives all driving members <b>32</b> that pass through the sorting port, which reduces the number of driving sources <b>31</b> needed and allows the article sorting and conveying apparatus to have a more reasonable and compact structure and more optimized performance.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Some embodiments of the present disclosure further provide an article sorting and conveying system, including a sorting port and the article sorting and conveying apparatus provided in any technical solution of the present disclosure, the sorting port corresponding to the driving source <b>31</b> of the driving assembly <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some embodiments, a plurality of sorting ports are provided, each of the sorting ports being provided with at least one driving source <b>31</b> correspondingly.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The article sorting and conveying system provided in the above technical solution has the structure and features of the article sorting and conveying apparatus described above, which will not be repeated here.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In description of the present disclosure, it needs to be appreciated that orientation or position relations denoted by the terms &#x201c;center&#x201d;, &#x201c;longitudinal&#x201d;, &#x201c;transverse&#x201d;, &#x201c;front&#x201d;, &#x201c;rear&#x201d;, &#x201c;left&#x201d;, &#x201c;right&#x201d;, &#x201c;vertical&#x201d;, &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d;, &#x201c;top&#x201d;, &#x201c;bottom&#x201d;, &#x201c;inner&#x201d;, &#x201c;outer&#x201d; and the like are orientation or position relations illustrated based on the drawings, are merely for the convenience of describing the present disclosure and simplifying description, instead of indicating or implying the denoted devices or elements must have specific orientations or be constructed and operated in specific orientations, and thus the terms cannot be construed as limiting the protection scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Finally, it should be noted that the above embodiments are only used for describing rather than limiting the technical solutions of the present disclosure.
