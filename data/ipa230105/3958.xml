The telecommunication cables can include electrical cable, fiber optic cable, and/or hybrid cable that includes both electrical and optical conductors. The cabinets typically allow terminations of the various cables to be connected, disconnected, and/or reconnected to other terminations of the various cables. In this way, the routing of signals across a telecommunications network can be configured and reconfigured as desired. For example, a trunk cable from a main office of a telecommunications provider or a data center may be branched to various branch cables at the cabinet. Each of the branch cables may then be routed to an end-user or to another cabinet.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The telecommunications cable can be stored on, delivered on, and deployed by spools. The cable is typically wound on the spool at a factory that produced the cable. Upon delivery to an installation site, the cable can be unwound from the spool and deployed.

The first cable spool <b>352</b><sub>1</sub>&#x2032; may be mounted to a second cable spool <b>352</b><sub>2</sub>&#x2032;. Additional cable spools <b>352</b>&#x2032; can be added in like manner, as needed. As with the similar cable assembly <b>350</b>, described above, the cable assembly <b>350</b>&#x2032; is adapted to provide a length of fiber optic cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; that is greater than the length that can fit around the cable spool assembly <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>&#x2032; of the tray assembly <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>&#x2032;, <b>14</b>&#x2033;. In the depicted embodiment, the cable spool <b>352</b>&#x2032; can hold a length of the fiber optic cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; that is generally equal to the lengths or range of lengths held by the cable spool <b>352</b>, described above.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">The cable spool <b>352</b>&#x2032; can be manufactured of materials similar to the materials used in the cable spool <b>352</b>, described above. The cable spool <b>352</b>&#x2032; includes a drum <b>354</b>&#x2032;, a first flange <b>356</b>&#x2032;, and a second flange <b>358</b>&#x2032;.

The notch <b>366</b>&#x2032; allows the fiber optic cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; to pass from the drum <b>354</b><sub>1</sub>&#x2032; to the drum <b>354</b><sub>2</sub>&#x2032;. As the fiber optic cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; passes from the drum <b>354</b><sub>1</sub>&#x2032; to the drum <b>354</b><sub>2</sub>&#x2032;, a transition in cable radius is made. In particular, adjacent the transition, the cable radius on the drum <b>354</b><sub>1</sub>&#x2032; is at or near a large radius or a maximum radius, and the cable radius on the drum <b>354</b><sub>2</sub>&#x2032; is at or near a small radius or a minimum radius. Guiding features <b>371</b> of the notch <b>366</b>&#x2032; keep the transition snag-free.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">To deploy the fiber optic cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; from the cable assembly <b>350</b>&#x2032;, the cable assembly <b>350</b>&#x2032; can be positioned relative to the telecommunications mount similar to the positioning of the cable assembly <b>350</b>, described above. The fiber optic cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; is first paid out from the second cable spool <b>352</b><sub>2</sub>&#x2032; (or the last cable spool <b>352</b>&#x2032;). The fiber optic cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; is pulled from the cable spool <b>352</b><sub>2</sub>&#x2032;, which causes rotation of the cable assembly <b>350</b>&#x2032;, including the tray assembly <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>&#x2032;, <b>14</b>&#x2033;, carried by the cable spool <b>352</b><sub>1</sub>&#x2032;. When the second cable spool <b>352</b><sub>2</sub>&#x2032; is empty of cable <b>353</b>&#x2032;, the cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; corresponding to the transition is paid out, over/through the guiding features <b>371</b>, followed by the cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; wrapped about the first cable spool <b>352</b><sub>1</sub>&#x2032;. The details of paying out the cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; from the first cable spool <b>352</b><sub>1</sub>&#x2032; and the cable spool assembly <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>&#x2032; are similar to the paying out of cable <b>353</b> from the cable spool <b>352</b> and the cable spool assembly <b>62</b>, described above. To facilitate unwinding and winding of the cable <b>353</b>&#x2032;, the spindle/rotation structure <b>370</b> may be employed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref>). The spindle structure <b>370</b> includes a base <b>372</b> and a rotation mount <b>374</b>. As depicted, the rotation mount <b>374</b> is a shaft. The cable assembly <b>350</b>&#x2032; preferably includes a bushing or bearing <b>376</b> adapted to rotatably mount over the shaft <b>374</b>. As depicted, the bearing <b>376</b> is positioned on the second flange <b>358</b>&#x2032;. As depicted, the spindle structure <b>370</b> is positioned opposite the tray assembly <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>&#x2032;, <b>14</b>&#x2033; about the cable assembly <b>350</b>&#x2032;. In other embodiments, the spindle structure <b>370</b> is positioned adjacent the tray assembly <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>&#x2032;, <b>14</b>&#x2033;. The rotation mount <b>374</b> can mount to the bushing <b>222</b> of the tray assembly <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>&#x2032;, <b>14</b>&#x2033; (e.g., within an inside diameter of the bushing <b>222</b>, as shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>). To reduce rotational friction, anti-friction features <b>378</b> can be included on the second flange <b>358</b>&#x2032;. The anti-friction features <b>378</b> may be made from Teflon&#xae; or other suitable material with a sufficiently low coefficient of friction. As depicted, the anti-friction features <b>378</b> may ride/glide on the base <b>372</b>. The anti-friction features <b>378</b> may provide stability to the cable assembly <b>350</b>&#x2032;. The anti-friction features <b>378</b> may act as thrust bushings. Other thrust bushings (e.g. flange type) can also or alternatively be used.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">The spindle/rotation structure <b>370</b> may be set on a floor, a cabinet, or other suitable structure when unwinding or winding the cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; from the cable spool <b>352</b>&#x2032;. The spindle/rotation structure <b>370</b> may be reused.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">The cable spools <b>352</b>&#x2032; are removed from the tray assembly <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>&#x2032;, <b>14</b>&#x2033; after the cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; has been removed from them. The cable spools <b>352</b>&#x2032; and the tray assembly <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>&#x2032;, <b>14</b>&#x2033; are respectively disposed of and installed similar to the cable spool <b>352</b> and the tray assembly <b>14</b>, discussed above.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">The cable assembly <b>350</b>&#x2032; provides advantages in stocking, shipping, storing, and deploying the fiber optic cable <b>353</b>&#x2032;. In particular, the cable assembly <b>350</b>&#x2032; can be factory pre-built and stocked in several discrete configurations of varying length. The pre-building can include applying terminations <b>353</b>c (e.g., connectors) to the fiber optic cable <b>353</b>&#x2032;. Each of the pre-built cable assemblies <b>350</b>&#x2032; can be deployed to a range of installations with a range of length requirements for the fiber optic cable <b>353</b>&#x2032;. In general, the minimum cable length installation that the cable assembly <b>350</b>&#x2032; could service would include a deployed cable length about equal to the length of the cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; initially wound on the cable spool(s) <b>352</b>&#x2032;. In general, the maximum cable length installation that the cable assembly <b>350</b>&#x2032; could service would include a deployed cable length about equal to the length of the cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; initially wound on the cable spool(s) <b>352</b>&#x2032; plus the length of the cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; initially wound on the cable spool assembly <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>&#x2032;. Installation lengths between the minimum and the maximum cable length installation could be serviced without applying the fiber optic terminations <b>353</b>c in the field. As a range of cable installation lengths can be serviced by a single cable assembly <b>350</b>&#x2032; part number, the cable assembly <b>350</b>&#x2032; can be factory pre-built. A few discrete cable assemblies <b>350</b>&#x2032; of different deployed cable length ranges can therefor service a wide variety of installations.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">The cable assembly <b>350</b>&#x2032; allows post-installation flexibility. In particular, if a telecommunications component needs to be moved or the deployed cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; of the cable assembly <b>350</b>&#x2032; needs to be connected at a substantially different location, within the range of the cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; initially wound on the cable spool assembly <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>&#x2032;, the fiber optic cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; can be taken in or paid out from the cable spool assembly <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">A discrete length of the cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; is stored and deployed from the cable spool(s) <b>352</b>&#x2032;. This discrete length can be roughly matched to a given installation. Preferably, the discrete length of the cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; from the cable spool(s) <b>352</b>&#x2032; is somewhat shorter than the total length of deployed cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; required at the given installation. A discrete length of the cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; is stored on the cable spool assembly <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>&#x2032;. However, a variable length of this cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; can be deployed to exactly match (i.e., fine tune) the total length of the deployed cable <b>353</b>&#x2032; to the requirements of the given installation.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">The cable assembly <b>350</b>&#x2032; is depicted at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>35</b>-<b>37</b></figref> including the cable spool <b>352</b>&#x2032;.
