To this end, an opening must be present in the wall of a lower tower segment. In tower segments made out of steel, doorframes or reinforced doorplates are welded on or in. This is necessary because each opening in a tower segment leads to a mechanical weakening of the tower segment. However, welding on or in doorframes or reinforced doorplates is complicated and cost-intensive.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Provided is a wind turbine as well as a method for manufacturing a tower of a wind turbine, in which openings can be provided in the tower wall, which reduces a weakening of a tower segment and is cost-effective.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a consequence, a wind turbine with a tower is provided, which has at least one first and second tower segment.

In order to improve the stability of the steel tower segment, a reinforcing element with a cured casting compound is provided around the first opening. This makes it possible to improve the way doorframes or doorplates are secured to the steel wall, so as to achieve an improved strength of the tower segment.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect of the present invention, the reinforcing element has tooth elements, which are fastened to the wall inside. In addition, the reinforcing element has the cured casting compound on the wall inside around the first opening. The tooth elements protrude into the cured casting compound.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect of the present invention, the reinforcing element has reinforcing bars for reinforcement purposes.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention also relates to a method for manufacturing a wind turbine tower. A tower segment with a steel wall and a first opening is formed. Tooth elements are fastened to the steel wall around the first opening. A shell is provided around the opening. The tooth elements protrude into the volume that is surrounded by the formwork. Casting compound is filled into the formwork and cured.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additional embodiments of the invention are the subject of the subclaims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Advantages and exemplary embodiments of the invention will be described in more detail below with reference to the drawing.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an illustration of a wind turbine according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention,</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a cutout of a sectional view of a tower segment of the wind turbine on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a schematic top view of a doorway in a wall of a tower segment of the wind turbine on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an illustration of a wind turbine according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.
