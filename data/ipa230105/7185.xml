A mobile phone is used as an example. An implementation process of&#x201c;moving a lens&#x201d; may be shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>. In an object shooting process, the mobile phone moves in a horizontal direction. This is &#x201c;moving a lens&#x201d;. It is assumed that the mobile phone moves from a point A to a point B. In a movement process, a preview image displayed on a display of the mobile phone changes because coverage of a camera changes. Certainly, &#x201c;moving a lens&#x201d; may also include &#x201c;moving a lens&#x201d; in a vertical direction. An upward movement may mean &#x201c;ascending a lens&#x201d;, and a downward movement may mean &#x201c;descending a lens&#x201d;. An implementation process of &#x201c;shaking a lens&#x201d; may be shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>. In an object shooting process, the mobile phone rotates around a central axis. The central axis is, for example, a perpendicular bisector of a short side of the mobile phone on a plane on which the display of the mobile phone is located. If the mobile phone rotates leftward around the central axis, &#x201c;shaking a lens&#x201d; leftward is implemented as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>. If the mobile phone rotates rightward around the central axis, &#x201c;shaking a lens&#x201d; rightward is implemented as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In other words, if a user needs to implement the foregoing camera movement shooting technique such as &#x201c;moving a lens&#x201d; or &#x201c;shaking a lens&#x201d; by using a portable electronic device (for example, a mobile phone), the user needs to move or rotate the mobile phone. This is inconvenient.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This application provides a video shooting method and an electronic device, to improve convenience of implementing a camera movement shooting manner such as &#x201c;moving a lens&#x201d; or &#x201c;shaking a lens&#x201d; by using a mobile phone.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, a video shooting method is further provided. The method is applied to an electronic device, and includes: enabling a camera function; determining a first video recording template in response to a first operation of a user, where the first video recording template includes a first example sample, a second example sample, and preset audio, the first example sample corresponds to a first camera movement mode, the second example sample corresponds to a second camera movement mode, and the first camera movement mode is different from the second camera movement mode; displaying a video recording interface, where the video recording interface includes a first camera movement mode identifier and a second camera movement mode identifier; keeping a position of the electronic device unchanged and starting video recording in response to a second operation of the user, and automatically generating a synthetic video, where the synthetic video includes a first video clip, a second video clip, and the preset audio, the first video clip is a video clip generated by the electronic device in the first camera movement mode, and the second video clip is a video clip generated by the electronic device in the second camera movement mode.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, in this manner, various video clips obtained in various camera movement modes may be synthesized into a video and preset audio may be configured for the synthetic video, so that a video of relatively good quality can be obtained through a convenient operation. The synthetic video may be directly uploaded to a social network, sent to a contact, and the like, and an excessively complex video processing process is not required, so that an operation is simple, and user experience is relatively good.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a possible design, the keeping a position of the electronic device unchanged and starting video recording in response to a second operation of the user includes: when the first camera movement mode identifier is selected, generating the first video clip in the first camera movement mode in response to a shooting indication by the user, where duration of the first video clip is first preset duration; and when the second camera movement mode identifier is selected, generating the second video clip in the second camera movement mode in response to a shooting indication by the user, where duration of the second video clip is second preset duration.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In other words, for each camera movement mode, the user may control start and/or stop of recording. For example, the first video recording template includes a plurality of camera movement modes. Video recording duration corresponding to each camera movement mode may be preset fixed duration, to be specific, shooting stops when the preset duration is reached. Alternatively, video recording duration corresponding to each camera movement mode may be non-preset duration. For example, the user controls, by using a shooting control on a viewfinder interface, a mobile phone to start and stop recording in the first camera movement mode.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a possible design, when the first video clip is generated in the first camera movement mode, a countdown of generating the first video clip in the first camera movement mode is further displayed on the video recording interface; and when the second video clip is generated in the second camera movement mode, a countdown of generating the second video clip in the second camera movement mode is further displayed on the video recording interface.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In other words, the electronic device may display a recording time countdown, to help the user learn of a recording progress (for example, remaining recording duration), so that interaction experience is relatively good.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a possible design, the method further includes: displaying the video recording interface, where the video recording interface includes the first camera movement mode identifier and the second camera movement mode identifier; deleting the first camera movement mode identifier or the second camera movement mode identifier m response to a third operation of the user; keeping the position of the electronic device unchanged and starting recording in response to a fourth operation of the user; and automatically generating a synthetic video, where the synthetic video includes a video clip generated by the electronic device in a camera movement mode that is not deleted, and the synthetic video further includes the preset audio.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In other words, the user may delete a camera movement mode identifier. For example, if the user deletes a camera movement mode identifier corresponding to a camera movement mode that the user does not like, the corresponding camera movement mode is deleted, and video clips generated in camera movement modes corresponding to remaining camera movement mode identifiers are synthesized into a video.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a possible design, the method further includes: displaying the video recording interface, where the video recording interface includes the first camera movement mode identifier and the second camera movement mode identifier; adding a third camera movement mode identifier to the video recording interface in response to a third operation of the user, where the third camera movement mode identifier is used to indicate a third camera movement mode; keeping the position of the electronic device unchanged and starting recording in response to a fourth operation of the user; and automatically generating a synthetic video, where the synthetic video includes the first video clip, the second video clip, a third video clip, and the preset audio, and the third video clip is a video clip generated by the electronic device in the third camera movement mode.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In other words, assuming that the user likes a camera movement mode, the user may add a camera movement mode identifier corresponding to the camera movement mode, so that the corresponding camera movement mode is added, and a video clip generated in an original camera movement mode and a video clip generated in the added camera movement mode are synthesized into a video.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a possible design, the method further includes: displaying the video recording interface, where the video recording interface includes the first camera movement mode identifier and the second camera movement mode identifier; adjusting an order of displaying the first camera movement mode identifier and the second camera movement mode identifier to a first order in response to a third operation of the user; keeping the position of the electronic device unchanged and starting recording in response to a fourth operation of the user; and automatically generating a synthetic video, where an order of playing the first video clip and the second video clip in the synthetic video is the first order.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In other words, the user may adjust an order of displaying camera movement mode identifiers, so that an order of synthesizing video clips is adjusted, and an order of playing two video clips in a synthetic video is also adjusted.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a possible design, the first example sample and/or the second example sample are/is displayed on the video recording interface.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">On the recording interface, the first example sample is used to help the user view a shooting effect of the first camera movement mode, and the second example sample is used to view a shooting effect of the second camera movement mode, so that interaction experience is relatively good.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a possible design, before the automatically generating a synthetic video, the method further includes: displaying a presentation interface, where the presentation interface includes the first video clip and the second video clip; and the automatically generating a synthetic video includes: performing video synthesizing in response to a video synthesizing instruction entered by the user.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In other words, before performing video synthesizing, the user may further separately view the first video clip and the second video clip. Assuming that the user is satisfied with the two video clips, video synthesizing is performed under a trigger operation of the user.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a possible design, the method further includes: deleting the first video clip or the second video clip in response to the fourth operation; or adding a local third video clip to the synthetic video; or adjusting the order of playing the first video clip or the second video clip in the synthetic video.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In other words, the user may delete a video clip, for example, delete a shot clip that the user is not satisfied with; or may locally add a video clip that the user likes; or may adjust an order of playing two video clips in a synthetic video. In conclusion, the user can flexibly set a synthetic video, so that interaction experience is relatively good.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a possible design, the first video recording template is a default template or a user-defined template.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In other words, the user not only may use a default template of the electronic device, but also may customize a template, for example, set a template that the user likes, so that interaction experience is relatively good.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a possible design, the method further includes: automatically storing the first video clip, the second video clip, and the synthetic video. In other words, the electronic device may automatically store all video clips and a video into which the video clips are synthesized. In this way, the user may locally view each individual video clip, or may view the synthetic video, so that user experience is relatively good. For example, the user may upload an individual video clip to the social network, or may upload the synthetic video to the social network.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a possible design, the method further includes: in response to a specific operation, changing audio in the synthetic video, or adding a text and/or a picture to the synthetic video. In other words, the user may change audio in a synthetic video, or may add a text, a picture, or the like to a synthetic video, so that interaction experience is relatively good.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to a second aspect, an electronic device is further provided.

Details are not described again.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">According to an eighth aspect, a method for displaying a preview image in a video recording scenario is provided. The method is applied to an electronic device, for example, a mobile phone or a tablet computer. The electronic device detects a first operation used to open a camera application; starts the camera application in response to the first operation; detects a second operation used to indicate a first video recording mode; displays a viewfinder interface on a display of the electronic device in response to the second operation, where the viewfinder interface includes a first preview image, and the first preview image is a first image block in a first region on a first image captured by a first wide-angle camera on the electronic device; keeps a position of the electronic device unchanged, and detects a third operation that indicates an image movement direction; and displays a second preview image on the viewfinder interface in response to the third operation, where the second preview image is a second image block in a second region on a second image captured by the first wide-angle camera, or the second preview image is an image block obtained after angle of view conversion is performed on the second image block; and an orientation of the second region relative to the first region is related to the image movement direction.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">For example, in a process in which a user performs video recording by using a mobile phone, a preview image includes a scene A facing the user, and does not include a scene B on the right front of the user. The user keeps a position of the mobile phone unchanged, and enters an image rightward movement instruction (for example, by using a touchscreen). In this case, the preview image is updated to a new preview image including the scene B on the right front of the user (for example, excluding the scene A). Therefore, when the position of the electronic device remains unchanged, a shooting manner such as &#x201c;moving a lens&#x201d; or &#x201c;shaking a lens&#x201d; may also be implemented, so that user experience is relatively good.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">It should be understood that, that an orientation of the second region relative to the first region is related to the image movement direction includes: the orientation of the second region relative to the first region is the same as or opposite to the image movement direction. This is not limited in this embodiment of this application. For example, the user may voluntarily set the orientation of the second region relative to the first region to be the same as or opposite to the image movement direction.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In a possible design, that an orientation of the second region relative to the first region is related to the image movement direction includes: a distance between the second region and a first edge of the second image is a second distance, a distance between the first region and a first edge of the first image is a first distance, and a distance change amount of the second distance relative to the first distance is related to the image movement direction.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">For example, it is assumed that a distance between the first region and a left edge of the first image is H, and a distance between the second region and a left edge of the second image is H+A. When A is a positive number, it indicates that the orientation of the second region relative to the first region is rightward; or when A is a negative number, it indicates that the orientation of the second region relative to the first region is leftward.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In an example, the electronic device determines a third region on a third image, where a second orientation change amount of the third region relative to the second region is equal to a first orientation change amount of the second region relative to the first region; and displays a third preview image on the viewfinder interface, where the third preview image is a third image block in the third region on the third image, or the third preview image is an image block obtained after angle of view conversion is performed on the third image block. The second orientation change amount is a distance change amount of a third distance relative to the second distance, and the first orientation change amount is the distance change amount of the second distance relative to the first distance. The third distance is a distance between the third region and a first edge of the third image, the second distance is the distance between the second region and the first edge of the second image, and the first distance is the distance between the first region and the first edge of the first image.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In other words, change amounts of positions of preview images on images captured by the first wide-angle camera are the same. Therefore, visually, a preview image on the viewfinder interface moves at a constant speed, so that user experience is relatively good.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In another example, a second orientation change amount of the third region relative to the second region may alternatively be greater than a first orientation change amount of the second region relative to the first region. Therefore, visually, a preview image on the viewfinder interface moves at an accelerated speed, so that a sense of rhythm and visual impact are implemented.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Certainly, a second orientation change amount of the third region relative to the second region may alternatively be less than a first orientation change amount of the second region relative to the first region. Therefore, visually, a preview image on the viewfinder interface moves at a decelerated speed, so that video recording flexibility and interestingness are higher.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In a possible design, before entering the first video recording mode, the electronic device displays a fourth preview image on the viewfinder interface, where the fourth preview image is an image captured by a second wide-angle camera, a field of view of the second wide-angle camera is less than a field of view of the first wide-angle camera, and the first preview image is some or all of image blocks within an overlapping range between the field of view of the first wide-angle camera and the field of view of the second wide-angle camera. In other words, when switching from another mode to the first video recording mode, the electronic device starts the first wide-angle camera with a larger field of view, and displays, on the viewfinder interface, the first image block in the first region on the first image captured by the first wide-angle camera. Larger coverage of an image captured by a camera with a larger field of view indicates that more details are included and a movable range of a position of a first region on an image is larger. Therefore, a shooting manner such as &#x201c;moving a lens&#x201d; or &#x201c;shaking a lens&#x201d; may be implemented within a larger movable range, so that user experience is relatively good.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">It should be understood that a magnification of an image captured by the second wide-angle camera is less than or equal to a magnification of an image captured by the first wide-angle camera.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The third operation includes: a flick operation on the first preview image; or</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">an operation on a control used to indicate an image rotation direction on the viewfinder interface; or</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">an operation of pressing and dragging a specific control on the viewfinder interface.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">It should be understood that the foregoing third operation is merely an example instead of a limitation. Another operation used to input an image movement direction is also feasible. This is not limited in this embodiment of this application.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">It can be understood that, when an image movement stop instruction is detected, a fifth preview image is displayed on the viewfinder interface, where the fifth preview image is a fifth image block in a fifth region on a fifth image captured by the first wide-angle camera, or the fifth preview image is an image block obtained after angle of view conversion is performed on the fifth image block; and an orientation of the fifth region relative to the second region does not change. In other words, when an image movement stop instruction is detected, an orientation of a preview image on an image does not change, and a position of the preview image on the viewfinder interface visually does not change.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">It can be understood that, when detecting an image movement stop instruction, the electronic device generates and stores a video, where the video includes the second preview image. In other words, when detecting an image movement stop instruction, the electronic device automatically generates a video, and stores the video. This facilitates an operation and improves user experience.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The detecting an image movement stop instruction includes:</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">when the third operation is a flick operation on the first preview image, generating the image movement stop instruction when detecting an uplift after the flick operation; or</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">when the third operation is an operation of tapping a control used to indicate an image movement direction on the viewfinder interface, generating the image movement stop instruction when detecting that a tap operation is performed again at any position on the viewfinder interface; or</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">when the third operation is an operation of touching and holding a control used to indicate an image movement direction on the viewfinder interface, generating the image movement stop instruction when detecting an uplift after the touch and hold operation; or</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">when the third operation is an operation of pressing and dragging a specific control on the viewfinder interface, generating the image movement stop instruction when detecting an uplift after the drag operation.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">It should be noted that the image movement stop instruction is merely an example instead of a limitation. Another image movement stop instruction is also feasible. This is not limited in this embodiment of this application.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">For example, the second image is one of M frames of images obtained through frame extraction from N frames of images captured by the first wide-angle camera, where N is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and M is an integer less than N. Frame extraction play can achieve a fast play effect. Therefore, a preview image can be quickly played. Alternatively, the second image is one of M frames of images obtained through multi-frame image insertion into N frames of images captured by the first wide-angle camera, where N is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and M is an integer greater than N. Frame insertion play can achieve a slow play effect. Therefore, a preview image can be slowly played.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The image block obtained after angle of view conversion is performed on the second image block satisfies the following formulas:</p><p id="p-0100" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>x&#x2032;=x</i>*cos(&#x3b8;)&#x2212;sin(&#x3b8;)*<i>y</i>; and<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0101" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>y&#x2032;=x</i>*sin(&#x3b8;)+cos(&#x3b8;)*<i>y. </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0102" num="0099">Herein, (x&#x2032;, y&#x2032;) is a pixel on the image block obtained after the angle of view conversion; (x, y) is a pixel on the second image block; and &#x3b8; is a rotation angle, and the rotation angle is preset. After the electronic device performs angle of view conversion on an image block by using the foregoing formulas, a preview image is more suitable for a preview image presented when the mobile phone is shaken actually. Therefore, when the position of the electronic device remains unchanged, the user may implement a shooting manner such as &#x201c;moving a lens&#x201d; or &#x201c;shaking a lens&#x201d; by using the electronic device, so that user experience is relatively good.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0100">According to a ninth aspect, a method for displaying a preview image in a video recording scenario is further provided.

For example, when the electronic device is a mobile phone, the mobile phone starts a camera application, opens a camera, and displays a viewfinder interface, where a preview image is displayed on the viewfinder interface. The mobile phone is still used as an example. When the mobile phone enables a video call function (for example, a video communication function in WeChat), the mobile phone opens a camera, and displays a viewfinder interface, where a preview image is displayed on the viewfinder interface.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0193">A field of view in the embodiments of this application is an important performance parameter of a camera. In addition, &#x201c;field of view&#x201d; may also be referred to as terms such as &#x201c;angle of view&#x201d;, &#x201c;vision scope&#x201d;, and &#x201c;vision field scope&#x201d;. This specification imposes no limitation on the name. The field of view is used to indicate a maximum shooting angle range of the camera. If an object is in the angle range, the object is captured by the camera and therefore is further presented in a preview image. If an object is outside the angle range, the object is not captured by the camera and therefore is not presented in a preview image.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0194">Generally, a larger field of view of the camera indicates a larger shooting range and a shorter focal length; and a smaller field of view of the camera indicates a smaller shooting range and a longer focal length. Therefore, cameras may be classified into a common camera, a wide-angle camera, an ultra-wide-angle camera, and the like due to different fields of view. For example, a focal length of the common camera may range from 40 millimeters to 45 millimeters, and an angle of view may range from 40 degrees to 60 degrees; a focal length of the wide-angle camera may range from 24 millimeters to 38 millimeters, and an angle of view may range from 60 degrees to 84 degrees; and a focal length of the ultra-wide-angle camera may range from 13 millimeters to 20 millimeters, and an angle of view may range from 94 degrees to 118 degrees.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0195">A video shooting method provided in the embodiments of this application may be applied to an electronic device. The electronic device includes a camera. Preferably, the camera is a wide-angle camera or an ultra-wide-angle camera. Certainly, the camera may alternatively be a common camera. A quantity of cameras is not limited in this application. There may be one or more cameras. If there are a plurality of cameras, the plurality of cameras may preferably include at least one wide-angle camera or at least one ultra-wide-angle camera.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0196">The electronic device may be, for example, a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a wearable device (for example, a watch, a wristband, a helmet, a headset, or a necklace), a vehicle-mounted device, an augmented reality (augmented reality, AR) device/a virtual reality (virtual reality, VR) device, a notebook computer, an ultra-mobile personal computer (ultra-mobile personal computer, UMPC), a netbook, or a personal digital assistant (personal digital assistant.

For example, for the m<sup>th </sup>frame of image, a small block in a corresponding large block is marked as an m<sup>th </sup>region, and an image block in the m<sup>th </sup>region may be obtained through clipping and displayed on a display as a preview image. In other words, a preview image displayed on the mobile phone is an image block obtained through clipping from an image captured by the camera.

However, the movie shooting requires professional equipment and photographers. Therefore, in this application, it is considered that movie-similar shooting is implemented through a mobile phone by using various camera movement modes when the mobile phone remains stationary. For example, a micro movie mode (or may be referred to as a movie mode) may be provided in the mobile phone. In the micro movie mode, a user may use the mobile phone to perform movie-similar shooting. Specifically, the micro movie mode includes a plurality of story templates, and each story template includes a plurality of different camera movement modes. The mobile phone may perform video shooting by using different camera movement modes included in a story template, thereby improving video shooting quality and facilitating an operation, even non-professional photographers can use various camera movement modes to complete shooting, thereby improving video shooting interest to a specific extent.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0297">The following specifically describes the technical solutions in the embodiments of this application with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0298"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> shows a graphical user interface (graphical user interface, GUI) of a mobile phone. The GUI is a home screen (home screen) of the mobile phone. The home screen includes icons of a plurality of applications, for example, an icon of a camera application. When detecting an operation that a user taps the icon of the camera application, the mobile phone starts the camera application, and displays another GUI shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, where the GUI may be referred to as a viewfinder interface (or a shooting interface). A preview image may be displayed on the viewfinder interface in real time.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0299">After detecting an operation that the user indicates a micro movie mode, the mobile phone enters (or starts) the micro movie mode. In the micro movie mode, the mobile phone may perform video recording by using various story templates.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0300">The user may indicate the micro movie mode in a plurality of manners.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0301">For example, the viewfinder interface includes a button used to indicate the micro movie mode. When detecting an operation that the user taps the button, the mobile phone enters the micro movie mode.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0302">For example, the button may be a button <b>501</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>-(a).

Optionally, when a video recording mode is entered, the button is displayed on the viewfinder interface, and the button may not be displayed in a photo mode. Alternatively, the button may be displayed at a position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>-(c). A display position of the button may be set by the mobile phone by default, or may be set by the user.

For example, the preset gesture operation may be a gesture operation of drawing a circle on the viewfinder interface, or an operation of touching and holding a preview image on the viewfinder interface. This is not limited in this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0305">Alternatively, after the mobile phone displays the viewfinder interface, if the mobile phone detects a user voice that indicates to enter the micro movie mode, the mobile phone enters the micro movie mode.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0306">After entering the micro movie mode, the mobile phone may display a plurality of story templates. Each story template may include a plurality of camera movement modes.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0307">Optionally, to help the user intuitively understand the story templates, the mobile phone may further provide a video sample corresponding to each story template. A video sample may be understood as a finished product that has been recorded by using a story template. For example, the story templates include a travel template. A video sample corresponding to the travel template includes three video clips, and each video clip is shot in one camera movement mode. In this way, the user can roughly know a shooting effect of the travel template by watching the video sample corresponding to the travel template.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0308">For example, for an interface displayed after the mobile phone enters the micro movie mode, refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>.

The home page includes a plurality of story templates, for example, a travel template, a quiet template, and a dynamic template shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0309">The home page may further include a preview box <b>601</b> for displaying a video sample corresponding to a story template. For example, when detecting an operation that the user selects the travel template (for example, an operation of tapping the travel template), the mobile phone displays a video sample corresponding to the travel template in the preview box <b>601</b>.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0310">Because the video sample corresponding to the travel template is obtained by synthesizing the three sample clips, the video sample may be directly played or each sample clip may be played in the preview box <b>601</b>. For example, after a first sample clip is played in the preview box <b>601</b>, a next sample clip is automatically played, or a next sample clip is automatically played after a period of time. To help the user determine a specific sample clip that is being played in the preview box <b>601</b>, the mobile phone may output a specific prompt. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, when the first sample clip is being played in the preview box <b>601</b>, a first small circle in a mark <b>602</b> is in a first color (for example, black), and the other two small circles are in a second color (for example, white); or when the second sample clip is being played in the preview box <b>601</b>, a second small circle in a mark <b>602</b> is in a first color (for example, black), and the other two small circles are in a second color (for example, white).</p><p id="p-0324" num="0311">Alternatively, when detecting an operation that the user selects the first sample clip, the mobile phone plays the first sample clip in the preview box <b>601</b>. When detecting an operation of selecting the second sample clip, the mobile phone plays the second sample clip in the preview box <b>601</b>. For example, still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, the first sample clip is displayed in the preview box <b>601</b> by default. When the mobile phone detects a left-flick operation of the user in the preview box <b>601</b>, the preview box <b>601</b> includes a next sample clip. When the mobile phone detects a left-flick operation of the user in the preview box <b>601</b> again, the preview box <b>601</b> includes a next sample clip. In addition, the mark <b>602</b> may also prompt the user with a sample clip that is being played in the preview box <b>601</b>.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0312">Optionally, the video sample may include music, and the music may be set by default, for example, may be set in the travel template as an auxiliary.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0313">Optionally, a quantity of sample clips, total recording duration of the travel template, recording duration of each video clip, and the like may be further displayed in the preview box <b>601</b> in addition to the mark <b>602</b>.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0314">Because the user may want to know a camera movement mode used for each story template, the mobile phone may display a prompt to the user on a touchscreen or may prompt the user in a sound manner, to notify the user of a camera movement mode used for a story template.

Details are not described again.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0332">Alternatively, the button <b>705</b> may be a video synthesis button for synthesizing recorded clips into a video.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0333">For example, the mark <b>702</b> to the mark <b>704</b> are used as recording buttons. Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, when detecting an operation of tapping the mark <b>702</b>, the mobile phone starts recording in the first camera movement mode, stops the recording when recording duration (for example, 3 s) is reached, and stores a recorded clip (which is referred to as a clip <b>1</b> for ease of distinguishing). When detecting an operation of tapping the mark <b>703</b>, the mobile phone obtains a clip <b>2</b> through recording in the second camera movement mode. When detecting an operation of tapping the mark <b>704</b>, the mobile phone obtains a clip <b>3</b> through recording in the third camera movement mode. When detecting an operation of tapping the button <b>705</b>, the mobile phone synthesizes the clip <b>1</b> to the clip <b>3</b> into one video.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0334">Likewise, in a process in which the mobile phone performs recording in the first camera movement mode, the time in the mark <b>702</b> may gradually decrease. When the time decreases to 0, the recording in the first camera movement mode stops. A principle of recording in the second camera movement mode and the third camera movement mode is the same as a principle of recording in the first camera movement mode. Details are not described again.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0335">Optionally, recording duration (for example, 3 s) corresponding to each camera movement mode may not be preset. For example, when detecting an operation of tapping the mark <b>702</b>, the mobile phone starts recording in the first camera movement mode; and when detecting an operation of tapping the mark <b>702</b> again, the mobile phone stops the recording in the first camera movement mode. The second camera movement mode and the third camera movement mode have a same principle as the first camera movement mode. In other words, the mark <b>702</b> is used to control start and stop of recording in the first camera movement mode. To be specific, for each camera movement mode, the recording duration may be determined by the user.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0336">An example in which the recording duration corresponding to each camera movement mode is preset and is 3 s is used above. It can be understood that the recording duration corresponding to each camera movement mode may be adjusted. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>-(a), when detecting an operation (for example, a touch and hold operation) on the mark <b>702</b>, the mobile phone may display a selection box, where the selection box includes a button &#x201c;Time setting&#x201d;. When an operation on the button &#x201c;Time setting&#x201d; is detected, an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>-(b) is displayed. A button &#x201c;+&#x201d; and a button &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; are displayed on the interface. The button &#x201c;+&#x201d; is used to increase a time, for example, increase the time to <b>4</b><i>s</i>. The button &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; is used to decrease a time, for example, decrease the time to 2 s.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0337">It should be noted that an example in which the travel template includes three camera movement modes is used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> It can be understood that the travel template may further include more or fewer camera movement modes. For example, the user may add or delete a camera movement mode.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0338">An example of deleting a camera movement mode is used. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>-(a), when detecting an operation (for example, a touch and hold operation) on the mark <b>702</b>, the mobile phone displays the selection box, where the selection box includes a button &#x201c;Delete&#x201d;. When the mobile phone detects an operation on the button &#x201c;Delete&#x201d;, the mark <b>702</b> is deleted, and correspondingly the first camera movement mode corresponding to the mark <b>702</b> is deleted.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0339">An example of adding a camera movement mode is used. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>-(a), the recording interface of the travel mode further includes a button &#x201c;+&#x201d;. When detecting an operation (for example, a tap operation) on the button &#x201c;+&#x201d;, the mobile phone displays an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>-(b), where the interface includes a camera movement mode list. After the user selects a camera movement mode, if the mobile phone detects an operation of tapping a button &#x201c;Add&#x201d;, an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>-(c) is displayed, and a mark <b>707</b> is added to the interface to indicate the user to select an added camera movement mode.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0340">Optionally, an order of different camera movement modes may be adjusted. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>, when the mobile phone detects an operation of touching and holding and dragging the mark <b>704</b>, the mark <b>704</b> is in a movable state. When it is detected that the mark <b>704</b> is dragged to a position between the mark <b>702</b> and the mark <b>703</b>, an order of the three camera movement modes is adjusted as follows, the first camera movement mode, the third camera movement mode, and the second camera movement mode. In this case, an order of the three clips in the synthetic video is as follows: the clip <b>1</b>, the clip <b>3</b>, and the clip <b>2</b>. The clip <b>1</b> is obtained through shooting in the first camera movement mode, the clip <b>2</b> is obtained through shooting in the second camera movement mode, and the clip <b>3</b> is obtained through shooting in the third camera movement mode.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0341">After the mobile phone enters the recording interface of the travel template (for example, the interface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>), the user may not remember a specific camera movement mode included in the travel template. Therefore, to help the user view a camera movement mode included in the travel template, the user may be prompted with the camera movement mode of the travel mode on the recording interface of the travel mode. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref>-(a), when detecting an operation of tapping the button <b>603</b>, the mobile phone enters an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref>-(b). The interface includes a widget. The video sample corresponding to the travel template may be played in the widget, or each sample clip may be played in the widget. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref>-(b), when the mobile phone detects an operation on the mark <b>702</b>, the first sample clip is played in the widget (for example, the sample clip <b>1</b> is cyclically played or is played only once). When the mobile phone detects an operation on the mark <b>703</b>, the second sample clip is played in the widget (for example, the sample clip <b>1</b> is cyclically played or is played only once). In this way, in a recording process, the user can view a camera movement mode used by each sample clip.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0342">Optionally, after completing video shooting by using the travel template, the mobile phone may enter an effect presentation interface. This helps the user view a shooting effect.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0343">Manner 2 is used as an example. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>-(a), after recording in the last camera movement mode reaches the recording duration (for example, 3 s), the mobile phone may automatically enter an effect presentation interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>-(b). A preview box <b>901</b> is displayed on the interface for displaying a video obtained by synthesizing the three video clips. If the mobile phone detects an operation on a button &#x201c;OK&#x201d;, the mobile phone stores the synthetic video. For example, an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>-(a) is returned, and an image in the synthetic video is displayed in a gallery mark in a bottom-left corner of the interface. If the user is not satisfied with the synthetic video, the user may perform rerecording. For example, when the mobile phone detects an operation on a button &#x201c;Back&#x201d;, the mobile phone returns to the interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>-(a) to perform rerecording. Optionally, the preview box <b>901</b> may occupy a part of the display or the entire display. If the entire display is occupied, the button &#x201c;OK&#x201d; and the button &#x201c;Back&#x201d; may be displayed above the preview box <b>901</b>.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0344">It should be noted that an example in which the synthetic video is displayed in the preview box <b>901</b> is used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>-(b). It can be understood that each video clip may alternatively be displayed. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>-(a) shows an example of another effect presentation interface. The interface includes a mark of each video clip. For example, when the mobile phone detects an operation (for example, a tap operation) on the mark of the clip <b>1</b>, the clip <b>1</b> is played in the preview box <b>901</b>. When the mobile phone detects an operation on the mark of the clip <b>2</b>, the clip <b>2</b> is played in the preview box. Therefore, the user can view each recorded video clip. When the mobile phone detects an operation of tapping a button &#x201c;OK&#x201d;, the mobile phone synthesizes the three clips into a video, stores the synthetic video, and returns to the interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>-(a).</p><p id="p-0358" num="0345">Optionally, an order of the three video clips may be adjusted. For example, still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>-(a), the mobile phone detects an operation (for example, an operation of touching and holding and dragging) on the mark of the clip <b>2</b>, and changes a display position of the mark, for example, drags the mark of the clip <b>3</b> to a position between the mark of the clip <b>1</b> and the mark of the clip <b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>-(b). Therefore, an order of the clip <b>3</b> and the clip <b>2</b> is adjusted. In this case, if the mobile phone detects an operation on the button &#x201c;OK&#x201d;, an order of displaying the video clips in a synthetic video is as follows: the clip <b>1</b>, the clip <b>3</b>, and the clip <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0346">Optionally, some cases are considered. For example, the user is not satisfied with a video clip in the three video clips. In this case, the video clip may be deleted, and the remaining video clips are synthesized into a video. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>-(a), when detecting an operation (for example, a touch and hold operation) on the mark of the clip <b>2</b>, the mobile phone displays a button &#x201c;Delete&#x201d;. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>-(b), when the mobile phone detects an operation on the button &#x201c;Delete&#x201d;, the clip <b>3</b> is deleted. In this case, if the mobile phone detects an operation on a button &#x201c;OK&#x201d;, the mobile phone synthesizes the clip <b>1</b> and the clip <b>2</b> into a video.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0347">Alternatively, if the user is not satisfied with a video clip, the user may rerecord the clip. For example, still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>-(a), when detecting an operation (for example, a touch and hold operation) on the mark of the clip <b>3</b>, the mobile phone displays a button &#x201c;Rerecord&#x201d;. When detecting an operation of tapping the button &#x201c;Rerecord&#x201d;, the mobile phone displays an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>-(c). The interface is used to rerecord the clip <b>3</b>. Therefore, only the mark <b>704</b> of the third camera movement mode may be displayed on the interface, and the mark of the first camera movement mode and the mark of the second camera movement mode are not displayed. For example, still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>-(c), when detecting an operation of tapping the button <b>705</b>, the mobile phone starts recording in the third camera movement mode. When the recording duration (for example, 3 s) is reached, the mobile phone automatically returns to the interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>. The clip <b>3</b> is a rerecorded clip.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0348">Optionally, before synthesizing the clip <b>1</b> to the clip <b>3</b> into the video, the mobile phone may further add a locally recorded video clip. In this case, the clip <b>1</b> to the clip <b>3</b> and the added local video are synthesized during video synthesizing. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref>-(a), a button &#x201c;+&#x201d; is displayed on the effect presentation interface. When detecting an operation of tapping the button &#x201c;+&#x201d;, the mobile phone displays an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref>-(b). The interface is an interface of &#x201c;Gallery&#x201d; of the mobile phone. Assuming that the user selects a video <b>913</b>, when the mobile phone detects an operation of tapping a button &#x201c;Add&#x201d;, the mobile phone displays an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref>-(c), where a clip <b>4</b>, that is, the video <b>913</b>, is added to the interface. In this case, if the mobile phone detects an operation of tapping the button &#x201c;OK&#x201d;, the mobile phone synthesizes the four clips into a video.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0349">Optionally, the mobile phone may further perform processing such as clipping and text or music adding on a recorded video clip.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0350">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>-(a), four icons are displayed in the preview box <b>901</b>: a clipping icon, a text icon, a music icon, and a mute icon. It can be understood that the four icons act on the clip <b>1</b> when the clip <b>1</b> is played in the preview box, and the four icons act on the clip <b>2</b> when the clip <b>2</b> is played in the preview box.</p><p id="p-0364" num="0351">For example, the clip <b>1</b> is displayed in the preview box. When detecting an operation on the clipping icon, the mobile phone may display an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>-(b). A clipping box <b>910</b> is displayed in the preview box <b>901</b>, and all frames of images of the clip <b>1</b> may be displayed in the clipping box <b>910</b>. For example, when the user wants to clip the last several frames, the user may move a clipping strip <b>911</b> to a position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>-(b). In this case, the last several frames are clipped. When it is detected that a button &#x201c;OK&#x201d; is tapped, an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>-(a) may be returned. In this case, a clipped clip <b>1</b> is displayed in the preview box <b>901</b>.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0352">When detecting an operation on the text icon, the mobile phone displays an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>-(c). A text input box is displayed in the preview box <b>901</b> on the interface, and the user may enter a text in the text input box. When it is detected that the button &#x201c;OK&#x201d; is tapped, the interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>-(a) is returned. In this case, a clip <b>1</b> obtained after text adding is displayed in the preview box <b>901</b>. It should be noted that text adding is used as an example for description herein. It can be understood that an emoticon, an animation, and the like may also be added.</p><p id="p-0366" num="0353">When detecting an operation on the music icon, the mobile phone may display an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>-(d). A song clip list is displayed on the interface, and the list includes marks of a plurality of song clips such as a mark of a song clip A and a mark of a song clip B. When the mobile phone detects that the user selects the mark of the song clip A, the mobile phone may use the song clip A as background music of the clip <b>1</b>. For example, when detecting that the button &#x201c;OK&#x201d; is tapped, the mobile phone returns to the interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>-(a). In this case, a clip <b>1</b> obtained after the song clip A is added is displayed in the preview box <b>901</b>. Optionally, in addition to a camera movement mode, a story template may further include default music. For example, for the travel template, default music of the travel template is music used in the sample video corresponding to the travel template. Therefore, assuming that the user does not select music, the mobile phone uses the default music of the travel template as the background music of the video. Because of a music rhythm, an image play rhythm in a video may be consistent with a music play rhythm. For example, if music includes a drum point, a frame of image is played when one drum point is played, and a next frame of image is played when a next drum point is played.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0354">Optionally, the mobile phone may further eliminate an original sound in a video clip in the three recorded video clips. The original sound may be understood as a sound in a recorded video. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>-(a), when detecting an operation on the mute icon, the mobile phone eliminates an original sound of the clip <b>1</b>. Optionally, an original sound of a video clip may be entirely or partially eliminated. The clip <b>1</b> is used as an example. When the mobile phone detects an operation on the mute icon, the mobile phone may display an audio clipping box that is similar to, for example, the clipping box <b>910</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>-(b), and the user may select a to-be-muted part in the clip <b>1</b> by using the audio clipping box, so that an original sound of an unmuted part in the clip <b>1</b> is retained.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0355">It should be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>-(a) to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>-(d) only list four processing manners of performing clipping, text adding, music adding, and original sound elimination on a video clip. It can be understood that another processing manner may be further included. For example, various picture styles may be further provided to process an image in a clip, for example, a black-and-white style, an animation style, an ink and wash style, a strong exposure style, and a weak exposure style, which are not enumerated one by one in this application.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0356">Optionally, the mobile phone may further select a synthesis special effect, and the synthesis special effect is used to synthesize three video clips in a specific synthesizing manner. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>F</figref>-(a), when detecting an operation on a button &#x201c;Animation&#x201d;, the mobile phone displays an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>F</figref>-(b). The interface includes a plurality of synthesis special effects. For example, assuming that the user selects &#x201c;Combine&#x201d;, when the mobile phone detects an operation that the user taps a button &#x201c;OK&#x201d;, a manner of synthesizing the clip <b>1</b> and the clip <b>2</b> is: fusing the last frame of the clip <b>1</b> and the first frame of the clip <b>2</b>; and a corresponding synthesis effect is as follows: After playing the last second frame of the clip <b>1</b>, the mobile phone plays the last frame of the clip <b>1</b>, where the last frame is an image obtained by fusing the last frame of the clip <b>1</b> and the first frame of the clip <b>2</b>; and then continues to play the second frame of the clip <b>2</b>. To help the user view a synthesis effect, the mobile phone displays an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>F</figref>-(c), to display the synthesis effect. When detecting that a button &#x201c;Save&#x201d; is tapped, the mobile phone saves the synthesis effect &#x201c;Combine&#x201d;, and then returns to an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>F</figref>-(a). When detecting an operation of tapping a button &#x201c;OK&#x201d; on the interface, the mobile phone synthesizes the clip <b>1</b> and the clip <b>3</b> by using the saved synthesis special effect.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0357"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>F</figref>-(b) is used as another example. Assuming that the user selects &#x201c;Gradually zoom in&#x201d;, a corresponding synthesis effect is as follows: After playing the clip <b>1</b>, the mobile phone plays the first frame of image in the clip <b>2</b> in a gradually zoom-in manner, and then plays the second frame of image in the clip <b>2</b>. It should be noted that &#x201c;Combine&#x201d;, &#x201c;Gradually zoom in&#x201d;, and the like are used as examples for description herein. There may be other synthesis special effects, which are not enumerated one by one in this application.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0358">Optionally, when storing a video, the mobile phone may store both an original video and a synthetic video. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>-(a) is used as an example. When detecting the button &#x201c;OK&#x201d;, the mobile phone may store the video obtained by synthesizing the clip <b>1</b> to the clip <b>3</b>, or may store an original video, where the original video may be understood as a video recorded without a camera movement mode. For ease of understanding, the rightward movement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>-(a) is used as an example. An original video is a video constituted by the m<sup>th </sup>frame of image to the (m+3)<sup>th </sup>frame of image instead of a video constituted by image blocks in the m<sup>th </sup>region to the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows an interface of a gallery application in the mobile phone. The interface stores two videos: a video shot in a camera movement mode and a video shot without a camera movement mode. For ease of distinguishing by the user, a mark <b>1001</b> may be displayed on the video shot in a camera movement mode. Optionally, when detecting the button &#x201c;OK&#x201d;, the mobile phone may alternatively store each of the clip <b>1</b> to the clip <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0359">In the foregoing embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> is used as an example. A plurality of story templates are provided on the home page of the micro movie mode. The plurality of story templates are set by default (for example, are set when the mobile phone is delivered from a factory). It can be understood that the user may alternatively customize a story template. For ease of distinguishing, templates that are set by default are collectively referred to as a &#x201c;default template&#x201d;, and templates that are customized by the user are collectively referred to as a &#x201c;user-defined template&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0360">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>-(a), a button &#x201c;+&#x201d; may be further displayed on the home page. When detecting an operation on the button, the mobile phone may display an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>-(b). The interface is the interface of &#x201c;Gallery&#x201d; in the mobile phone. The user may select a video clip stored in &#x201c;Gallery&#x201d;. Assuming that the user selects a clip <b>1101</b>, when the mobile phone detects that the user taps a button &#x201c;Add&#x201d;, the mobile phone displays an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>-(c). A new template is added to the interface. The user may set a name of the new template. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, when detecting an operation (for example, a touch and hold operation) on the new template, the mobile phone displays a button &#x201c;Name&#x201d;; and when detecting an operation of tapping the button &#x201c;Name&#x201d;, the mobile phone names the new template.</p><p id="p-0374" num="0361">After adding a user-defined template, the mobile phone may parse a camera movement mode corresponding to the template. When the user selects a customized module, the user shoots a video in a camera movement mode corresponding to the customized module, to be specific, the user may use the template to shoot a video with an effect similar to that of the template. For example, if the user captures a clip from a movie as a user-defined template, an effect of a video shot by the user by using the template may be similar to that of the movie. Therefore, for non-professional photographers, shooting works with relatively high quality may also be obtained, and user experience is relatively good.</p><p id="p-0375" num="0362">It can be understood that a template that the user does not like or that is not frequently used may be deleted. Both a default template and a user-defined template can be deleted; or only a user-defined template can be deleted, and a default template cannot be deleted. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, when detecting an operation (for example, a touch and hold operation) on the new template, the mobile phone displays a button &#x201c;Delete&#x201d;; and when detecting an operation of tapping the button &#x201c;Delete&#x201d;, the mobile phone deletes the new template.</p><p id="p-0376" num="0363">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>-(b), an example in which a user-defined template is a local video of the mobile phone is used. It can be understood that a user-defined module may alternatively be set in another manner. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>-(a) is used as an example. When detecting an operation on the button &#x201c;+&#x201d;, the mobile phone displays an interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>. The interface includes a camera movement mode list. The user may select a plurality of camera movement modes from the camera movement mode list and combine the camera movement modes into a user-defined story template.

The user may indicate the mobile phone to use a specific camera movement mode. The mobile phone performs different processing processes in different camera movement modes. For example, when the user expects to use the &#x201c;shake&#x201d; shooting manner, the user may enter an instruction to indicate the mobile phone to enter the shake mode. If the user expects to use the &#x201c;move&#x201d; shooting manner, the user may enter another instruction to indicate the mobile phone to enter the move mode. That the mobile phone enters the shake mode may be understood as that the mobile phone performs processing based on a processing procedure corresponding to the move mode.

Alternatively, after starting the camera application, the mobile phone enters a camera movement mode by default, for example, a camera movement mode used when the camera application is used last time. Assuming that the mobile phone enters the move mode by default after starting the camera application, the mobile phone may start an ultra-wide-angle camera.

To help the user determine a current mode, when the mobile phone enters the move mode, the mobile phone may display prompt information <b>1312</b> on the viewfinder interface. The prompt information <b>1312</b> is used to indicate that the mobile phone is currently in the move mode. Certainly, when the mobile phone switches from the common video recording mode to the move mode, the mobile phone may also output another prompt, for example, a vibration feedback. The prompt information <b>1312</b> may be displayed in a manner in which a preview image is not blocked as much as possible, for example, a translucent manner or a transparent manner. A direction control <b>1311</b> is also displayed on the viewfinder interface.

For example, the direction control <b>1311</b> is displayed at a position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> by default, or the user may adjust the display position of the direction control <b>1311</b>.</p><p id="p-0412" num="0399">In some embodiments, the mobile phone uses a first wide-angle camera (for example, a common wide-angle camera) in the common video recording mode. When switching from the common video recording mode to the move mode, the mobile phone starts a second wide-angle camera (for example, an ultra-wide-angle camera). An angle of view of the first wide-angle camera is less than an angle of view of the second wide-angle camera. A first preview image is displayed on the viewfinder interface in the move mode. The first preview image is a first image block in a first region on an image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera. It can be understood that the mobile phone starts the ultra-wide-angle camera after entering the move mode. In this case, the first preview image may be a first image block in a first region on a first frame of image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera.</p><p id="p-0413" num="0400">The first image block may be an image block that corresponds to the first preview image and that is on the image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera. For example, the first image block is all or a part of an image in an overlapping angle of view range between the image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera and an image captured by a common wide-angle camera. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the first region on the image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera. The first region may be all or a part of an overlapping angle of view range between the ultra-wide-angle camera and the common wide-angle camera. It can be learned from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> through comparison that the preview image is the first image block in the first region in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> after the mobile phone enters the move mode in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. The mobile phone may close or open the common wide-angle camera after switching from the common video recording mode to the move mode.</p><p id="p-0414" num="0401">In some embodiments, the preview image does not change when the mobile phone switches from the common video recording mode to the move mode. That the preview image does not change may be understood as that the preview image is not de-magnified or magnified after the mobile phone switches to the move mode. For example, a magnification of a preview image in the move mode and a magnification of a preview image in the common video recording mode are the same, for example, both are 1&#xd7;. Therefore, after the mobile phone switches from the common video recording mode to the move mode, the user does not perceive that the preview image is suddenly magnified or de-magnified.</p><p id="p-0415" num="0402">In some other embodiments, the preview image may change m the common video recording mode and the move mode. That the preview image changes may be understood as that the preview image is de-magnified or magnified after the mobile phone switches to the move mode. For example, a magnification of a preview image in the common video recording mode is IX, and a magnification of a preview image in the move mode is 5&#xd7;. To be specific, the preview image is magnified when the mobile phone switches from the common video recording mode to the move mode. It can be understood that a position movement range in the first region on the image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera is widened in a case in which an image magnification is increased after the mobile phone switches to the move mode. This can achieve a shooting effect of moving a lens within a relatively wide range.</p><p id="p-0416" num="0403">The following embodiment describes a process in which the mobile phone implements image translation in the move mode.</p><p id="p-0417" num="0404">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the ultra-wide-angle camera captures N frames of images, for example, a first frame of image, a second frame of image, and an (m&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>frame of image. It can be understood that the mobile phone starts the ultra-wide-angle camera after entering the move mode. In this case, the first preview image displayed after the mobile phone enters the move mode may be a first image block in a first region on a first frame of image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera. Assuming that the mobile phone has not detected an image movement instruction, the mobile phone determines a second region on the second frame of image. A position of the second region does not move relative to that of the first region, and the preview image is updated from the image block in the first region to an image block in the second region. By analogy, a position of an (m&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>region on the (m&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>frame of image does not move relative to that of the first region, where m may be an integer greater than or equal to 3. The preview image is updated to an image block in the (m&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>region. In other words, the mobile phone does not detect the image movement instruction in a period from the first frame of image to the (m&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>frame of image. Therefore, a position of the preview image on the image does not change.</p><p id="p-0418" num="0405">Assuming that the mobile phone detects an image rightward movement instruction before the preview image is updated to an image block in an m<sup>th </sup>region on an m<sup>th </sup>frame of image (for example, in a process in which the preview image is displayed as the image block in the (m&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>region), the mobile phone determines the m<sup>th </sup>region on the m<sup>th </sup>frame of image, where a position of the m<sup>th </sup>region moves rightward by a distance A relative to that of the (m&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>region. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, a distance between the (m&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>region and a left image edge is H, and a distance between the m<sup>th </sup>region and a left image edge is H+A.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the distance between the m<sup>th </sup>region and the left image edge is H+A, and a distance between the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region and a left image edge is H+A+B. In this case, the preview image on the viewfinder interface is updated from the image block in the m<sup>th </sup>region to an image block in the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region, to be specific, the preview image moves rightward by a distance B on the image.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0407">The mobile phone determines an (m+2)<sup>th </sup>region on an (m+2)<sup>th </sup>frame of image, where a position of the (m+2)<sup>th </sup>region moves rightward by a distance C relative to that of the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the distance between the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region and the left image edge is H+A+B, and a distance between the (m+2)<sup>th </sup>region and a left image edge is H+A+B+C. In this case, the preview image on the viewfinder interface is updated from the image block in the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region to an image block in the (m+2)<sup>th </sup>region, to be specific, the position of the preview image on the image moves rightward by a distance C. Therefore, the preview image gradually moves rightward on the image.</p><p id="p-0421" num="0408">Assuming that the mobile phone detects a movement stop instruction, the mobile phone determines an (m+3)<sup>th </sup>region on an (m+3)<sup>th </sup>frame of image, where a position of the (m+3)<sup>th </sup>region does not change relative to that of the (m+2)<sup>th </sup>region. The preview image is updated from the image block in the (m+2)<sup>th </sup>region to an image block in the (m+3)<sup>th </sup>region, to be specific, the position of the preview image on the image does not change. In this case, the rightward movement stops. Then, the preview image is updated from the image block in the (m+3)<sup>th </sup>region to an image block in an (m+4)<sup>th </sup>region, to be specific, the position of the preview image on the image remains unchanged until the image movement instruction is detected again and the movement continues.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0409">There are a plurality of value relationships among A, B, and C.

In this case, the constant rightward movement is performed. In other words, after the mobile phone detects the image rightward movement instruction, the position of each updated preview image on the image relative to the previous frame of preview image moves rightward by the same distance L, until the movement stop instruction is detected. This achieves a shooting effect of the constant rightward movement.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0411">Example 2: A&#x3c;B&#x3c;C&#x3c;D. It is assumed that A=L, B=2L, and C=3L. To be specific, after the mobile phone detects the image rightward movement instruction, a target region on a next frame of image moves rightward at an accelerated speed relative to a target region on a previous frame of image. For example, the m<sup>th </sup>region moves rightward by a distance L relative to the (m&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>region; the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region moves rightward by a distance 2L relative to the m<sup>th </sup>region, to be specific, the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region moves rightward at an accelerated speed; and the (m+2)<sup>th </sup>region moves rightward by a distance 3L relative to the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region, to be specific, the (m+2)<sup>th </sup>region moves rightward at an accelerated speed relative to the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region. Therefore, after the mobile phone detects the image rightward movement instruction, each updated preview image moves rightward at an accelerated speed relative to a previous frame of preview image. This achieves a shooting effect of an accelerated image rightward movement.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0412">Example 3: A&#x3e;B&#x3e;C&#x3e;D. It is assumed that A=2L, B=L, and C=0. To be specific, after the mobile phone detects the image rightward movement instruction, a target region on a next frame of image moves rightward at a decelerated speed relative to a target region on a previous frame of image. For example, the m<sup>th </sup>region moves rightward by a distance 2L relative to the (m&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>region: the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region moves rightward by a distance L relative to the m<sup>th </sup>region, to be specific, the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region moves rightward at a decelerated speed relative to the m<sup>th </sup>region; and the (m+2)<sup>th </sup>region moves rightward by a distance 0 relative to the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region, to be specific, the (m+2)<sup>th </sup>region moves rightward at a decelerated speed relative to the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region. In this case, the movement stops. Therefore, after the mobile phone detects the image rightward movement instruction, each updated preview image moves rightward at a decelerated speed relative to a previous frame of preview image, even the speed decreases to 0. This achieves a shooting effect of a decelerated image rightward movement.</p><p id="p-0426" num="0413">The foregoing provides three examples of the value relationship among A, B, and C.

It can also be understood that the mobile phone does not perform frame extraction or frame insertion processing on the N frames of images captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera, but sequentially updates the preview images to the image blocks in the target regions on the N frames of images. This helps improve continuity and smoothness of preview images. Assuming that the mobile phone determines the target region in the manner in which A=B=C=L in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> after detecting the instruction used to indicate the image movement direction, the position of the preview image on the image moves rightward at a constant speed.

The mobile phone extracts M frames of images from the N frames of images captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera, where M is an integer less than N; and updates a preview image by using an image block in a target region on each of the M frames of images. This can achieve a fast update (or play) effect. For example, it is assumed that an image capture frame rate of the ultra-wide-angle camera is 240 fps, to be specific, 240 frames of images are captured per second. It is further assumed that an image play (or referred to as update) frame rate of the mobile phone is 30 fps, to be specific, updating is performed by 30 frames per second. In this case, the 240 frames of images need to be updated in 8 seconds.

In some embodiments, jitter occurs in a process in which the user holds the mobile phone. To alleviate instability of the preview image caused by jitter of the user, an implementation is as follows: The mobile phone performs image stabilization on an image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera, and determines a target region such as a first region, a second region, or a third region on an image obtained after the image stabilization. The image stabilization may be image stabilization clipping. Generally, when the user jitters, an image in an edge region on a preview image changes relatively quickly and consequently is unstable, and an image in a middle region on the preview image changes relatively slightly and therefore is relatively stable. Therefore, the mobile phone may clip an edge of each frame of image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera. A specific clipping area is not limited in this embodiment of this application. For example, the mobile phone determines a first region on a remaining image obtained after a first frame of image is clipped, determines a second region on a remaining image obtained after a second frame of image is clipped, determines a third region on a remaining image obtained after a third frame of image is clipped, and so on.

Likewise, the mobile phone may determine a second region on a second frame of image, and perform image stabilization clipping on a second image block in the second region; and so on.

If the foregoing angle of view conversion process is used, a rotation angle &#x3b8; may be determined in a plurality of manners. For example, the rotation angle &#x3b8; is preset, for example, is a preset fixed value. Alternatively, if the user enters the image movement direction by performing a flick operation on the screen, the rotation angle is related to the flick operation. For example, the mobile phone stores a correspondence between a flick distance W of the flick operation and the rotation angle &#x3b8;. When the mobile phone detects a flick operation of the user on the screen, the mobile phone determines a flick distance W of the flick operation, and determines a corresponding rotation angle &#x3b8; based on the distance W and the correspondence. For example, a farther flick distance W of the flick operation indicates a larger rotation angle. Alternatively, the rotation angle &#x3b8; may be related to a display value of the identifier <b>1320</b>.

When a first region is translated to an edge of the image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera, the mobile phone outputs prompt information, to prompt the user to move the position of the mobile phone. The move mode is used as an example. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, when the mobile phone detects that the user continuously presses the down arrow, a position of a preview image on an image gradually moves downward. When the position of the preview image on the image moves to the edge of the image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera, the mobile phone may output prompt information <b>1330</b>, to prompt the user to manually move the mobile phone downward, or the mobile phone may output prompt information used to prompt the user that the mobile phone cannot continue to move.</p><p id="p-0472" num="0459">It should be understood that video recording starts when the mobile phone detects an operation on the recording control <b>1307</b>. After starting the recording, the user may also indicate to enter the move mode or the shake mode, and then enter an image movement direction. The mobile phone translates, in the direction, a position of a target region on the image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera, and continuously updates a preview image based on an image block in the target region.

The other video is a video recorded in the move mode or the shake mode, to be specific, each frame of image in the video is an image block on an image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, two videos are stored in a video folder in an album of the mobile phone, where one video is a complete video, and the other video is a video recorded in the move mode or the shake mode.

In this mode, an image rotation shooting effect may also be achieved when the user does not need to manually rotate the mobile phone (for example, the mobile phone remains stationary).</p><p id="p-0475" num="0462">For example, when the mobile phone is in the move mode or the shake mode, if the mobile phone detects a preset operation on a preview image (for example, a double-tap operation or a touch and hold operation on the preview image), the mobile phone enters the image rotate mode. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a viewfinder interface in the image rotate mode. The viewfinder interface includes indication information <b>1360</b> used to indicate that the mobile phone is currently in the image rotate mode.

The viewfinder interface further includes a preview box <b>1361</b>, and an image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera (for example, a complete image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera) is displayed on the preview box <b>1361</b>. A target box <b>1362</b> is displayed in the preview box <b>1361</b>, and an image block in the target box <b>1362</b> is a current preview image. The viewfinder interface further includes an icon <b>1363</b> used to indicate a rotation progress and an icon <b>1364</b> used to set a rotation speed.</p><p id="p-0476" num="0463">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, assuming that the mobile phone detects an image clockwise rotation instruction before a preview image is updated to an m<sup>th </sup>frame of image, the mobile phone determines a target region on the m<sup>th </sup>frame of image, that is, an m<sup>th </sup>region, and rotates an image block in the m<sup>th </sup>region clockwise by an angle G; the mobile phone determines an (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region on an (m+1)<sup>th </sup>frame of image, where a position of the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region remains unchanged relative to that of the m<sup>th </sup>region; and rotates an image block in the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region clockwise by an angle 2G; and so on. Therefore, after the mobile phone detects the image clockwise rotation instruction, preview images are sequentially updated to an image block in the m<sup>th </sup>region that is obtained after the clockwise rotation by an angle G, an image block in the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region that is obtained after the clockwise rotation by an angle 2G, an image block in an (m+2)<sup>th </sup>region that is obtained after clockwise rotation by an angle 3G, and the like. Therefore, a preview image gradually rotates clockwise, and all updated preview images rotate by a same angle, to be specific, rotate at a constant speed.</p><p id="p-0477" num="0464">Assuming that a rotation stop instruction is detected before a preview image is updated to an (m+3)<sup>th </sup>frame of image, the mobile phone determines an (m+3)<sup>th </sup>region on the (m+3)<sup>th </sup>frame of image, where a position of the (m+3)<sup>th </sup>region remains unchanged relative to that of the (m+2)<sup>th </sup>region; and rotates an image block in the (m+3)<sup>th </sup>region clockwise by an angle 3G, where the rotation angle of the image block in the (m+3)<sup>th </sup>region remains unchanged relative to that of the image block in the (m+2)<sup>th </sup>region.

However, rotation angles of two adjacent frames may alternatively be different. For example, the rotation angle of the image block in the m<sup>th </sup>region is G, and the rotation angle of the image block in the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region is 3G. In this case, a preview image rotates at an accelerated speed. Alternatively, the rotation angle of the image block in the m<sup>th </sup>region is G, and the rotation angle of the image block in the (m+1)<sup>th </sup>region is 0.5G. In this case, a preview image rotates at a decelerated speed.</p><p id="p-0479" num="0466">It should be noted that the foregoing frame extraction updating manner or frame insertion updating manner is also applicable to this embodiment. For example, the accelerated rotation may be implemented through frame extraction, and the decelerated rotation may be implemented through frame insertion. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, it is assumed that the user expects to increase a rotation angle when the mobile phone detects an operation above &#x201c;+&#x201d; on the icon <b>1364</b>. In this case, the mobile phone may implement the accelerated rotation through frame extraction. This is similar to the manner of extracting one frame every other frame in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> This achieves an effect that each updated preview image rotates by an angle 2G. It is assumed that the user expects to decrease a rotation angle when the mobile phone detects an operation on &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; below the icon <b>1364</b>. In this case, the mobile phone may implement the decelerated rotation through frame insertion. This is similar to the manner of inserting one frame every other frame in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>. This achieves an effect that each updated preview image rotates by an angle 0.5G.</p><p id="p-0480" num="0467">The foregoing mentions that there may be a plurality of manners in which the mobile phone detects an instruction used to indicate an image rotation direction. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, when the mobile phone detects an operation on the icon <b>1363</b>, clockwise or counterclockwise rotation starts by default, which may be voluntarily set by the user. For another example, a left arrow and a right arrow are displayed at the icon <b>1363</b>. When the mobile phone detects that the user taps the left arrow, the counterclockwise rotation starts. When the mobile phone detects that the user taps the right arrow, the clockwise rotation starts.</p><p id="p-0481" num="0468">For example, rotation starts after the mobile phone detects an operation of tapping the icon <b>1363</b>, and the rotation automatically stops when preset rotation duration (for example, 5 s) is reached.

When the mobile phone detects that the user taps the icon <b>1373</b> used to indicate to pull a lens, an area of a target region on an image starts to increase.

Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>, an area of the target box <b>1372</b> on the viewfinder interface may be synchronously increased, to notify the user of an approximate proportion of a current preview image to a complete image.</p><p id="p-0501" num="0488">It should be noted that an example of pulling a lens is used above, and a similar manner may be used for pushing a lens. For example, when the mobile phone detects a lens push instruction, the mobile phone may determine a target region in a manner similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>. A difference lies in that an area of a target region on a next frame of image is smaller than an area of a target region on a previous frame of image, so that preview image magnification is implemented.

The electronic device displays the viewfinder interface in the common video recording mode, and the electronic device displays the selection box <b>1309</b> after detecting an operation of tapping the control <b>408</b> used to indicate a camera movement mode.

The first wide-angle camera is, for example, an ultra-wide-angle camera, and the second wide-angle camera is, for example, a common wide-angle camera. In other words, after the electronic device switches from the common video recording mode to the move mode, the electronic device switches from the common wide-angle camera to the ultra-wide-angle camera, and the first preview image is the first image block in the first region on the first image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera.

The third operation may be an operation that the user taps an arrow (for example, the right arrow) on the direction control <b>1311</b>, and a direction indicated by the arrow is the image movement direction. Alternatively, the third operation may be an operation that the user presses an arrow in press duration that reaches preset duration, and a direction indicated by the arrow is the image movement direction. Alternatively, the third operation is an operation that the user presses and drags (or flicks) the video recording control <b>1307</b> in a direction, and the drag direction is the image movement direction.

The first preview image is the first image block in the first region on the first frame of image. It is assumed that the third operation used to indicate the image rightward movement is detected in a period from the (m&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>frame of image to the m<sup>th </sup>frame of image.

The user may voluntarily set the image movement direction entered by the user to be the same as or opposite to the movement direction in which the position of the preview image on the image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera moves.</p><p id="p-0518" num="0505">In the foregoing descriptions, that an orientation of the second region relative to the first region is related to the image movement direction may be understood as follows: a distance between the second region and a first edge of the second image is a second distance, a distance between the first region and a first edge of the first image is a first distance, and a distance change amount of the second distance relative to the first distance is related to the image movement direction. The first edge may be an upper edge, a lower edge, a left edge, a right edge, or the like of the image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera. For example, if the image movement direction is leftward or rightward, the first edge may be the left edge or the right edge. If the image movement direction is upward or downward, the first edge may be the upper edge or the lower edge. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is used as an example. It is assumed that the first edge is the left image edge, the second distance between the second region (that is, the m<sup>th </sup>region) and the left edge of the second image (that is, the m<sup>th </sup>frame of image) is H+A, and the first distance between the first region and the left edge of the first image is H. In this case, the distance change amount of the second distance relative to the first distance is A. The distance change amount A has a plurality of cases, and is related to the image movement direction. For example, when the image movement direction is rightward and A is greater than 0, the second region moves rightward relative to the first region. When the image movement direction is leftward and A is less than 0, the second region moves leftward relative to the first region.</p><p id="p-0519" num="0506">A third preview image after the second preview image may be a third image block in a third region on a third image captured by the ultra-wide-angle camera. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is still used as an example.

The third distance is a distance between the third region and a first edge (for example, a left image edge) of the third image, to be specific, is H+A+B; and the second distance is a distance between the second region and the first edge (for example, the left image edge) of the second image, to be specific, is H+A In this case, the second orientation change amount is B.</p><p id="p-0521" num="0508">A first orientation change amount of the second region (that is, the m<sup>th </sup>region on the m<sup>th </sup>frame of image) relative to the first region (that is, the first region on the first frame of image) is the distance change amount of the second distance relative to the first distance. The second distance is the distance between the second region and the first edge (for example, the left image edge) of the second image, to be specific, is H+A; and the first distance is the distance between the first region and the first edge of the first image, to be specific, is H.
