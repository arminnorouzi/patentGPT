Each of the plurality of pixels may detect light in a specific spectral region (or range). For example, the plurality of pixels may include a red pixel for converting light in a red spectrum region into an electrical signal, a green pixel for converting light in a green spectrum region into an electrical signal, and a blue pixel for converting light in a blue spectrum region into an electrical signal. A color filter for transmitting light in a specific spectral region may be disposed on each of the plurality of pixels.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Each of the plurality of pixels may be implemented to operate both a signal dump operation and a readout operation using a single source-follower transistor.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The row driver <b>120</b> may be implemented to drive the pixel array <b>110</b> in a row unit. The row driver <b>120</b> may decode a row control signal (e.g., an address signal) generated by the timing controller <b>170</b>, and may select at least one of the row lines included in the pixel array <b>110</b> in response to the decoded row control signal.

Pixel signals output by the plurality of pixels may have a deviation caused by unique characteristics (e.g., fixed pattern noise (FPN), or the like) of each pixel, or a deviation caused by a difference in characteristics of a logic for outputting a pixel signal from the pixel. The correlated double sampling technique may be used to calculate a reset component (or a reset signal) and an image component (or an image signal) for each of the pixel signals and to extract the difference as a valid signal component to compensate for the deviation between the pixel signals.
