end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a self-invertible inverse latex comprising a novel sequestering agent, to the process for preparing such a self-invertible inverse latex, to the use of said self-invertible inverse latexes as thickeners and/or emulsifiers and/or stabilizers used for preparing cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions for topical use, and also to said compositions thus prepared.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Polymers are widely used today in cosmetic formulations for topical use and represent the second most widely used family of products in formulations of this type. Cosmetic compositions contain polar phases, for instance phases consisting of water, and in most cases require the use of rheology-modifying polymers to increase the viscosity of these polar phases, and also to confer well-defined rheological behavior.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Among the polymers which modify the rheology of polar phases, mention may be made of natural polymers or synthetic polymers, and notably polymers of linear or branched, crosslinked or noncrosslinked, anionic or cationic, or amphiphilic, polyelectrolyte type. These polymers, once introduced into polar phases, have the property of spreading out under the effect of electrostatic repulsions due to the presence of the (negative and/or positive) charges on the linear or branched, noncrosslinked or crosslinked polymer backbone. Rheology-modifying agents provide both an increase in the viscosity of the polar phase, and also a degree of consistency and/or a stabilizing effect conferred on the cosmetic, dermocosmetic or demopharmaceutical formulation to be thickened.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to meet consumer needs and to improve cosmetic formulations for topical use, scientists have developed new innovative and varied polymer systems. Thus, the polymers used in cosmetics for topical use or dermocosmetics can act as film-forming agents, rheology modifiers, enable the stabilization of the fatty phases in the emulsions (of water-in-oil or oil-in-water type) or the stabilization of particles (pigments or fillers), or else confer specific sensory properties after application to the skin (for instance a soft feel, ease of handling and application, freshness effect, and the like), also having a direct impact on the appearance of the formula (translucent or opaque).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Rheology-modifying polymers for aqueous phases, mainly polyelectrolytes, result from the radical polymerization of (meth)acrylate type monomers, i.e. esters derived from acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, or else derivatives of acrylamide.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Today, these polymers, which can be provided in the form of an inverse latex, a concentrated inverse latex or a powder, make it possible to meet the needs of customers in terms of thickening performance, in a polar solvent, for instance water. The aqueous gels obtained once these polymers are dispersed in water have a smooth appearance, free from grains or lumps, with specific sensory properties to the touch, and also ease of handling and of application.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">The liquid form, known under the name &#x201c;self-invertible inverse latex&#x201d;, or its concentrated liquid form, is a composition which is provided in the form of a water-in-oil emulsion and comprises:</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">an aqueous phase, itself comprising at least one polymer of polyelectrolyte type, of anionic, or cationic, or ampholytic type, which is linear and/or branched and/or crosslinked,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0010">a fatty phase comprising at least one oil,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0011">at least one emulsifying surfactant (S1) of water-in-oil type,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0012">at least one emulsifying surfactant (S2) of oil-in-water type,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0013">said polymer being obtained by performing an inverse emulsion radical polymerization process.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0014">Radical polymerization is known for its sensitivity to the presence of impurities, even in small amounts. Compounds which may lead to a decrease in the rate of polymerization at low concentration are known as inhibitors or retarders. However, the distinction between these two effects is not always simple, and the same compound can have both harmful contributions depending on its concentration in the medium or on the nature of the monomers and of the reaction medium. Reproducible performance of the polymers which thicken an aqueous phase must be guaranteed in order to ensure a consistent quality of the cosmetic formulations for topical use containing these polymers. For this, industrial manufacturers must ensure that the polymerization reactions repeatably follow the same kinetics, more particularly regarding the inhibition time, the temperature increase profile, and the total duration of the polymerization reaction over time. Given these constraints, particular attention is given to the factors which can influence the start of the radical polymerization reaction, for example the presence of oxygen, which can retard the polymerization reaction by reacting with the radicals generated. These new peroxide radicals have a lower reactivity, since the initiation capacity is reduced. This is reflected by a weaker initiation step and a lower propagation rate, thus ultimately leading to polymers having different thickening properties. A step of deoxygenation of the medium, notably by purging with nitrogen before starting the polymerization reaction, thus proves necessary. Another factor directly impacting the polymerization is the presence of metallic species (Fe2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, and the like) which, in turn, generate an inhibitory effect. In this case, the inhibition can take place during the initiation phase by the reaction of the initiator radicals with metallic impurities, so that the active radical center then becomes incapable of fixing another monomer unit and becomes inactive during the polymerization.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0015">The abovementioned metal ions can potentially originate from the starting materials or else from the items of equipment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0016">The monomers used for the preparation of self-invertible inverse latexes may have traces of metal cations. In the same way, it is not impossible to envisage the presence of metallic contaminants in the items of industrial equipment receiving the polymerization reactions. In most cases, the items of equipment are made of stainless steel and several types of stainless steel are encountered which differ in their composition. Stainless steel is an iron-based alloy, to which nickel, chromium or molybdenum are added in certain cases. It is chromium which gives stainless steel its antioxidant properties since, in the presence of oxygen, it is capable, by itself, of regenerating its surface chromium oxide layer, referred to as the passive layer. However, it is not impossible that, on prolonged contact with sources of pollution, acids, moisture, sea spray or iron-laden dust, or in the case of deep scratches, the protective layer will then become depassivated (therefore activated) and the stainless steel will become oxidized more quickly than it will be capable of protecting itself. In these cases, the appearance of rust may be found, which rust is thus a source of iron-based metal contaminants.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0017">In view of the risks associated with the presence of all these sources of metal contaminants, the use of a sequestering agent is inescapable.

presence of metal cations on the progression of the polymerization process: in the presence of copper cations (in this case at least 160 molar ppm of Cu2+ ions) and in the absence of any sequestering agent, the polymerization reaction does not take place. The introduction of the sodium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (sold under the brand name Versenex&#x2122; 80) in test (IL2) allows the polymerization reaction to take place and leads to a polymer being obtained that has thickening properties in water and in saline solution.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0151">In comparison, the use of ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid in trisodium salt form (sold under the brand name Natriquest&#x2122; E30) in test (IL1), under stoichiometric conditions identical to test (IL2), makes it possible to obtain polymerization kinetics similar to those observed for test (IL2) and a self-invertible inverse latex that has equivalent viscosifying performance. As test (IL5) shows, the amount of ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid in trisodium salt form must be high enough: introduced at a lower dose (60 molar ppm), it does not make it possible to complex all of the cations, which results in the absence of initiation of the polymerization. Furthermore, test (IL6), free of added copper cations, shows that the process takes place in an identical manner: ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid in trisodium salt form as is has no impact on the polymerization reaction.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0152">Test (IL3) demonstrates the lower efficacy of N,N-diacetic glutamic acid tetrasodium salt (sold under the brand name DissolvineTMGLDA 47-S), despite its higher chelating capacity (85 milligrams of Cu/gram of sequestrant [1]) than that of ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid in trisodium salt form (18.4 milligrams of Cu/gram of sequestrant [2]). Specifically, added before the polymerization under identical stoichiometric conditions, N,N-diacetic glutamic acid tetrasodium salt enables initiation of the polymerization reaction but the kinetics are slower than in test (IL2) and than in test (IL1): the reaction time is almost twice as long. Similarly, the exothermicity observed is lower, which suggests that the conversion of the monomers is not complete. The process has therefore not taken place properly.<ul id="ul0027" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0027-0001" num="0153">[1]: &#x201c;Product Data Sheet&#x201d; from the company Nouryon, Dissolvine GL-47-S of Jul. 3, 2019</li>    <li id="ul0027-0002" num="0154">[2]: Technical sheet for Natriquest, from the company Ineos, &#x201c;Issue March 2008&#x201d;.</li>    <li id="ul0027-0003" num="0155">[3]: &#x201c;technical data sheet;
