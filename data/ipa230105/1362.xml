ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">With respect to separation of a liquid mixture, there are various techniques for removing a substance (e.g., a salt) dissolved in a solvent (e.g., water), and membrane separation methods are coming to be increasingly utilized nowadays as processes for energy saving and resources saving. Examples of membranes for use in the membrane separation methods include microfiltration membranes, ultrafiltration membranes, nanofiltration membranes, and reverse osmosis membranes, and these membranes are used for, for example, obtaining drinking water from water containing salts or harmful substances, production of industrial ultrapure water, wastewater treatment, recovery of valuables, etc.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most of the currently commercially available reverse osmosis membranes and nanofiltration membranes are composite semipermeable membranes formed by coating a support membrane with a separation functional layer having the ability to separate salts, etc. There are two kinds, i.e., one including a support membrane and, disposed thereover, a gel layer and an active layer formed by crosslinking a polymer and one including a support membrane and an active layer formed thereon by condensation-polymerizing monomers. In producing a composite semipermeable membrane, it is possible to independently select a separation functional layer, which performs a separation function, and a support membrane, which imparts strength to the separation functional layer. Composite semipermeable membranes hence can achieve separation performance and strength.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various such composite semipermeable membranes have been disclosed. For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a composite semipermeable membrane obtained by coating a support membrane with a separation functional layer constituted of a crosslinked aromatic polyamide obtained by a polycondensation reaction of a polyfunctional amine with a polyfunctional acid halide.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">Patent Document 1: JP-A-562-121603</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0006">Patent Document 2: JP-A-H2-78428</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problems</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0007">However, the conventional composite semipermeable membrane including the separation functional layer constituted of a crosslinked aromatic polyamide, although achieving separation performance and permeation performance, has a problem in that this composite semipermeable membrane has limitations in its separation performance. There also is a problem in that the crosslinked aromatic polyamide constituting the separation functional layer is decomposed by contact with some kind of oxidants due to an operation error, etc., and this irreversibly impairs the separation performance.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a composite semipermeable membrane which achieves excellent separation performance, in particular satisfactory salt-separating performance, and permeation performance and which further has excellent oxidation resistance.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to the Problems</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0009">In order to solve the problems, the present invention provides a composite semipermeable membrane including:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0010">a support membrane including a base and a porous support layer; and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0011">a separation functional layer disposed on the porous support layer and including a crosslinked aromatic polyamide,</p><p id="p-0012" num="0012">in which the separation functional layer contains sulfo groups in an amount of 7.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>to 5.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>g/m<sup>2 </sup>and includes a structure represented by the following formula 1.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="29.13mm" wi="69.93mm" file="US20230001363A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Provided that R<sub>1 </sub>is a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon having a carbon number of 1-10 and optionally having a substituent, R<sub>2 </sub>to R<sub>5 </sub>are each a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon having a carbon number of 1-10, Ar<sub>1 </sub>to Ar<sub>3 </sub>are each an aromatic ring having a carbon number of 6-14 and optionally having a substituent, and at least one of R<sub>1</sub>, Ar<sub>1</sub>, and Ar<sub>3 </sub>includes a sulfo group.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effect of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention can provide a composite semipermeable membrane which is excellent in terms of salt-separating performance and permeation performance and also in oxidation resistance.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is cross-sectional view schematically showing the structure of a composite semipermeable membrane: (a) is a cross-sectional view of the composite semipermeable membrane, (b) is an enlarged view of the separation functional layer, and (c) is an enlarged view of a pleat structure of the separation functional layer.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Embodiments of the present invention are explained in detail below but the present invention is not limited by the embodiments in any way.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">1. Composite Semipermeable Membrane</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">An example of the structure of the composite semipermeable membrane is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a composite semipermeable membrane <b>1</b> includes a base <b>2</b>, a porous support layer <b>3</b>, and a separation functional layer.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">(1-1) Support Membrane</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The multilayer structure including the base <b>2</b> and the porous support layer <b>3</b> is called a support membrane. The support membrane is a membrane which is for imparting strength to the separation functional layer and which itself has substantially no solute-separating performance.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Examples of the base <b>2</b> include fabric including a polyester-based polymer, a polyamide-based polymer, a polyolefin-based polymer, or a mixture or copolymer thereof. Preferred of these is fabric of a polyester-based polymer having high mechanical and thermal stability. With respect to configurations of the fabric, it is preferred to use long-fiber nonwoven fabric, short-fiber nonwoven fabric, or woven or knitted fabric.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The porous support layer <b>3</b> has a large number of fine pores communicating with one another. The porous support layer is not particularly limited in the pore diameter or pore diameter distribution. For example, preferred is a porous support layer that has a symmetrical structure, in which the pores have an even diameter, or an unsymmetrical structure, in which the pore diameter gradually increases from one surface to the other surface, and that has a pore diameter of 0.1-100 nm in the surface on the smaller-pore-diameter side.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As a material for the porous support layer <b>3</b>, use can be made of homopolymers or copolymers, such as a polysulfone (hereinafter &#x201c;PSf&#x201d;), a polyethersulfone, a polyamide, a polyester, a cellulosic polymer, a vinyl polymer, poly(phenylene sulfide), a poly(phenylene sulfide sulfone), poly(phenylene sulfone), and poly(phenylene oxide); any of these can be used alone or a blend of two or more thereof can be used. Examples of the cellulosic polymer include cellulose acetate and cellulose nitrate, and examples of the vinyl polymer include polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinyl chloride), and polyacrylonitrile. Preferred of these are homopolymers or copolymers such as PSf, polyamides, polyesters, cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, poly(vinyl chloride), polyacrylonitrile, poly(phenylene sulfide), and poly(phenylene sulfide sulfone)s. More preferred are cellulose acetate, PSf, poly(phenylene sulfide sulfone)s, or poly(phenylene sulfone). Especially preferred is PSf because this kind of polymers are highly stable chemically, mechanically, and thermally and are easy to mold.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The PSf has a weight-average molecular weight (hereinafter &#x201c;M<sub>w</sub>&#x201d;) of preferably 10,000-200,000, more preferably 15,000-100,000. In cases when the M<sub>w </sub>of the PSf is 10,000 or higher, a porous support layer having desirable mechanical strength and heat resistance can be obtained. Meanwhile, in cases when the M<sub>w </sub>of the PSf is 200,000 or less, a raw material solution for the porous support layer has a viscosity within an appropriate range and can have satisfactory formability.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The thicknesses of the base and porous support layer affect the strength of the composite semipermeable membrane and the packing density of the composite semipermeable membrane in an element. From the standpoint of obtaining satisfactory mechanical strength and packing density, the total thickness of the base and porous support layer is preferably 30-300 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 100-220 &#x3bc;m. The thickness of the porous support layer is preferably 20-100 &#x3bc;m. The thicknesses of the base and porous support layer can be each determined by examining a section thereof to measure the thickness thereof at 20 points at intervals of 20 &#x3bc;m along a direction (plane direction of the membrane) perpendicular to the thickness direction and calculating an average value of the measured thickness values.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">(1-2) Separation Functional Layer</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The separation functional layer <b>4</b> is a layer which has the function of separating solutes and includes a crosslinked aromatic polyamide. The separation functional layer <b>4</b> preferably includes the crosslinked aromatic polyamide as a main component.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The expression &#x201c;including a crosslinked aromatic polyamide as a main component&#x201d; means that the proportion of the crosslinked aromatic polyamide in the separation functional layer is 50 mass % or higher. The proportion of the crosslinked aromatic polyamide in the separation functional layer is preferably 80 mass % or higher, more preferably 90 mass % or higher.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The separation functional layer has a structure represented by formula 1 given above. In formula 1, at least one of R<sub>1</sub>, Ar<sub>1</sub>, Ar<sub>2</sub>, and Ara has a sulfo group. In formula 1, it is preferable that R<sub>1 </sub>is a hydrocarbon having carbon number of 1 or 2 and having at least one sulfo group, and it is more preferable that Ar<sub>2 </sub>is an aromatic ring having carbon number of 6-14 and having at least one sulfo group. That at least one of R<sub>1</sub>, Ar<sub>1</sub>, Ar<sub>2</sub>, and Ar<sub>3 </sub>in formula 1 has a sulfo group means that a sulfo-group-containing structure has been bonded to a terminal amino group or aromatic ring of the crosslinked aromatic polyamide.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present inventors diligently made investigations and, as a result, have discovered that amino groups, especially terminal amino groups, of crosslinked aromatic polyamides are starting points for oxidative deterioration and that the oxidative deterioration can be inhibited by lowering the electron density of the amino groups, amide groups and aromatic rings. Since at least one of R<sub>1</sub>, Ar<sub>1</sub>, Ar<sub>2</sub>, and Ar<sub>3 </sub>in formula 1 has a sulfo group, which is an electron-attracting substituent, the amino groups, amide groups and the aromatic rings have a reduced electron density. Hence, a composite semipermeable membrane having reduced reactivity with oxidants including hypochlorous acid and having excellent oxidation resistance is obtained.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A sulfo group is a hydrophilic substituent and is present in an ionized state when in contact with neutral water. Since at least one of R<sub>1</sub>, Ar<sub>1</sub>, Ar<sub>2</sub>, and Ar<sub>3 </sub>in formula 1 has a sulfo group, which is hydrophilic and is negatively charged, a composite semipermeable membrane that combines excellent permeation performance due to the hydrophilicity, and excellent salt-separating performance due to Coulomb repulsion against the anion as a constituent component of a salt to be removed, is obtained.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The separation functional layer contains sulfo groups in an amount of 7.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>to 5.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>g/m<sup>2</sup>.

In cases when the temperature of the raw material solution for porous support layer is within that range, the PSf does not precipitate and the raw material solution for porous support layer sufficiently infiltrates into interstices among fibers of the base before solidifying. As a result, the porous support layer tenaciously bonds to the base by the anchor effect and a support membrane having excellent strength can be obtained. The preferred range of the temperature of the raw material solution for porous support layer can be suitably regulated in accordance with the material and good solvent used, the concentration, etc.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">The time period from the application of the raw material solution for porous support layer to immersion in the coagulating bath is preferably 0.1-5.0 seconds.

It is hence preferred to suitably replace the coagulating bath so that the coagulating bath retains a composition within a certain range. The lower the concentration of the good solvent for PSf in the coagulating bath, the higher the rate of coagulation of the raw material solution for porous support layer. Consequently, lower good-solvent concentrations enable the porous support layer to be even in structure and have excellent strength. In addition, since lower good-solvent concentrations result in higher rates of coagulation of the raw material solution for porous support layer, it is possible to improve the efficiency of producing the support membrane, by heightening the rate of membrane formation.

By using this separator, feed water can be separated into a permeate, e.g., drinking water, and a concentrate, which has not passed through the membrane, thereby obtaining the desired water.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0088">Examples of the feed water to be treated with the composite semipermeable membrane according to the present invention include liquid mixtures having a TDS (total dissolved solids) of 500 mg/L to 100 g/L, such as seawater, brackish water, and wastewater. In general, the term &#x201c;TDS&#x201d; means the content of total dissolved solids, which is represented by &#x201c;weight&#xf7;volume&#x201d; or &#x201c;weight ratio&#x201d;. According to a definition, a TDS value can be calculated from the weight of residues obtained by filtering the feed water with a 0.45-&#x3bc;m filter and vaporizing the filtrate solution at a temperature of 39.5-40.5&#xb0; C. However, a simpler method is to convert a practical salinity (S).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0089">Higher operation pressures for the fluid separator result in an improvement in solute removal ratio but also result in an increase in the amount of energy required for the operation. Because of this and in view of the durability of the composite semipermeable membrane, the operation pressure at the time when the water to be treated is caused to pass through the composite semipermeable membrane is preferably 0.5-10 MPa. The temperature of the feed water is preferably 5-45&#xb0; C. since the solute removal ratio decreases as the temperature rises and the membrane permeation flux decreases as the temperature declines. In cases when the pH of the feed water is high, there is a possibility that use of feed water having a high solute concentration, e.g., seawater, might result in generation of a scale of magnesium, etc. In addition, high-pH operations may deteriorate the membrane. It is hence preferred to operate the fluid separator at a pH in a neutral range.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0093" num="0090">The present invention will be described below with reference to specific Examples, but the present invention is not limited by the following Examples in any way.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0091">Property values of the composite semipermeable membrane of the present invention were determined by the following methods.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0092">(1) Sulfo Group Content, C/D</p><p id="p-0096" num="0093">(i) In Vicinity of Surface of Separation Functional Layer</p><p id="p-0097" num="0094">The composite semipermeable membrane was cut into a 3 cm&#xd7;3 cm square, rinsed with 90&#xb0; C. distilled water for 10 minutes, and dried.
