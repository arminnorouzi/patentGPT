Thus, people often use their garage for storage and leave the vehicles on the driveway.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Unfortunately, leaving the vehicles on the driveway exposes the vehicles to weather, theft, and/or other potential damage from an external source. While there are third party storage solutions, these are a recurring expense that shift the location of people's items away from the home.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there is a need for a motorized garage extension that is easy to use and protects vehicles located on the driveway.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present general inventive concept provides a motorized garage extension.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additional features and utilities of the present general inventive concept will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the general inventive concept.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The foregoing and/or other features and utilities of the present general inventive concept may be achieved by providing a motorized garage extension connected to a garage and a driveway, the motorized garage extension including a plurality of walls connected to the garage to move from retracted against the garage in a first position to at least partially extended away from the garage in a second position, and move from extended away from the garage in the second position to retracted against the garage in the first position, a plurality of wall receiving tracks disposed on at least a portion of the driveway, each of the plurality of wall receiving tracks to move of at least one of the plurality of walls in response to movement of the plurality of wall receiving tracks, and a roof unit connected to at least a portion of the plurality of walls to cover at least one of the plurality of walls, the plurality of wall receiving tracks, and the driveway in an extended position, and expose at least one of the plurality of walls, the plurality of wall receiving tracks, and the driveway in a retracted position.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Each of the plurality of walls may include at least one panel, and a support frame connected to at least a portion of the garage to support the at least one panel.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Each of the plurality of wall receiving tracks may include an extraction unit disposed within the plurality of wall receiving tracks to move the at least one panel within each of the plurality of wall receiving tracks.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The roof nut may include a container body, and a covering member disposed within at least a portion of the container body to cover at least one of the plurality of walls, the plurality of wall receiving tracks, and the driveway in the extended position, and expose at least one of the plurality of walls, the plurality of wall receiving tracks, and the driveway in the retracted position.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The roof unit may further include a roof motor disposed within at least a portion of the container body and connected to the covering member to move the covering member in response to rotation of the roof motor.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The covering member and the plurality of walls may move simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The motorized garage extension may further include a track motor connected to at least a portion of the plurality of wall receiving tracks to move the plurality of walls in response to rotation of the track motor.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The motorized garage extension may further include an operation unit including a plurality of buttons to control movement of the plurality of walls and the roof unit.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each of the plurality of buttons may have braille text disposed thereon.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">These and/or other features and utilities of the present generally inventive concept will become apparent and more readily appreciated from the following description of the embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings of which:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a top perspective view of a motorized garage extension as disposed on a garage, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present general inventive concept;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a zoomed in view of the motorized garage extension as disposed on the garage in a retracted position, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present general inventive concept;
