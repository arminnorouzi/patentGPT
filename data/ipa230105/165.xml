However, the internal structure of the aerosol generating device <b>1</b> is not limited to the structures illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>3</b></figref>. In other words, according to the design of the aerosol generating device <b>1</b>, the battery <b>11</b>, the controller <b>12</b>, the heater <b>13</b>, and the vaporizer <b>14</b> may be differently arranged.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the cigarette <b>2</b> is inserted into the aerosol generating device <b>1</b>, the aerosol generating device <b>1</b> may operate the heater <b>13</b> and/or the vaporizer <b>14</b> to generate an aerosol from the cigarette <b>2</b> and/or the vaporizer <b>14</b>. The aerosol generated by the heater <b>13</b> and/or the vaporizer <b>14</b> is delivered to a user by passing through the cigarette <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to necessity, even when the cigarette <b>2</b> is not inserted into the aerosol generating device <b>1</b>, the aerosol generating device <b>1</b> may heat the heater <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The battery <b>11</b> may supply power to be used for the aerosol generating device <b>1</b> to operate. For example, the battery <b>11</b> may supply power to heat the heater <b>13</b> or the vaporizer <b>14</b>, and may supply power for operating the controller <b>12</b>. Also, the battery <b>11</b> may supply power for operations of a display, a sensor, a motor, etc. mounted in the aerosol generating device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The controller <b>12</b> may generally control operations of the aerosol generating device <b>1</b>. In detail, the controller <b>12</b> may control not only operations of the battery <b>11</b>, the heater <b>13</b>, and the vaporizer <b>14</b>, but also operations of other components included in the aerosol generating device <b>1</b>. Also, the controller <b>12</b> may check a state of each of the components of the aerosol generating device <b>1</b> to determine whether or not the aerosol generating device <b>1</b> is able to operate.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The controller <b>12</b> may include at least one processor. A processor can be implemented as an array of a plurality of logic gates or can be implemented as a combination of a general-purpose microprocessor and a memory in which a program executable in the microprocessor is stored. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the processor can be implemented in other forms of hardware.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The heater <b>13</b> may be heated by the power supplied from the battery <b>11</b>. For example, when the cigarette <b>2</b> is inserted into the aerosol generating device <b>1</b>, the heater <b>13</b> may be located outside the cigarette <b>2</b>. Thus, the heated heater <b>13</b> may increase a temperature of an aerosol generating material in the cigarette <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The heater <b>13</b> may include an electro-resistive heater. For example, the heater <b>13</b> may include an electrically conductive track, and the heater <b>13</b> may be heated when currents flow through the electrically conductive track. However, the heater <b>13</b> is not limited to the example described above and may include all heaters which may be heated to a desired temperature. Here, the desired temperature may be pre-set in the aerosol generating device <b>1</b> or may be set as a temperature desired by a user.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As another example, the heater <b>13</b> may include an induction heater. In detail, the heater <b>13</b> may include an electrically conductive coil for heating a cigarette in an induction heating method, and the cigarette may include a susceptor which may be heated by the induction heater.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, the heater <b>13</b> may include a tube-type heating element, a plate-type heating element, a needle-type heating element, or a rod-type heating element, and may heat the inside or the outside of the cigarette <b>2</b>, according to the shape of the heating element.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Also, the aerosol generating device <b>1</b> may include a plurality of heaters <b>13</b>. Here, the plurality of heaters <b>13</b> may be inserted into the cigarette <b>2</b> or may be arranged outside the cigarette <b>2</b>. Also, some of the plurality of heaters <b>13</b> may be inserted into the cigarette <b>2</b> and the others may be arranged outside the cigarette <b>2</b>. In addition, the shape of the heater <b>13</b> is not limited to the shapes illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>3</b></figref> and may include various shapes.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The vaporizer <b>14</b> may generate an aerosol by heating a liquid composition and the generated aerosol may pass through the cigarette <b>2</b> to be delivered to a user. In other words, the aerosol generated via the vaporizer <b>14</b> may move along an air flow passage of the aerosol generating device <b>1</b> and the air flow passage may be configured such that the aerosol generated via the vaporizer <b>14</b> passes through the cigarette <b>2</b> to be delivered to the user.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, the vaporizer <b>14</b> may include a liquid storage, a liquid delivery element, and a heating element, but it is not limited thereto. For example, the liquid storage, the liquid delivery element, and the heating element may be included in the aerosol generating device <b>1</b> as independent modules.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The liquid storage may store a liquid composition. For example, the liquid composition may be a liquid including a tobacco-containing material having a volatile tobacco flavor component, or a liquid including a non-tobacco material. The liquid storage may be detachable from the vaporizer <b>14</b> or may be formed integrally with the vaporizer <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">For example, the liquid composition may include water, a solvent, ethanol, plant extract, spices, flavorings, or a vitamin mixture. The spices may include menthol, peppermint, spearmint oil, and various fruit-flavored ingredients, but are not limited thereto. The flavorings may include ingredients capable of providing various flavors or tastes to a user. Vitamin mixtures may be a mixture of at least one of vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, and vitamin E, but are not limited thereto. Also, the liquid composition may include an aerosol forming substance, such as glycerin and propylene glycol.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The liquid delivery element may deliver the liquid composition of the liquid storage to the heating element. For example, the liquid delivery element may be a wick such as cotton fiber, ceramic fiber, glass fiber, or porous ceramic, but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The heating element is an element for heating the liquid composition delivered by the liquid delivery element. For example, the heating element may be a metal heating wire, a metal hot plate, a ceramic heater, or the like, but is not limited thereto. In addition, the heating element may include a conductive filament such as nichrome wire and may be wound around the liquid delivery element. The heating element may be heated by a current supply and may transfer heat to the liquid composition in contact with the heating element, thereby heating the liquid composition. As a result, an aerosol may be generated.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, the vaporizer <b>14</b> may be referred to as a cartomizer or an atomizer, but it is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The aerosol generating device <b>1</b> may further include general-purpose components in addition to the battery <b>11</b>, the controller <b>12</b>, the heater <b>13</b>, and the vaporizer <b>14</b>. For example, the aerosol generating device <b>1</b> may include a display capable of outputting visual information and/or a motor for outputting haptic information. Also, the aerosol generating device <b>1</b> may include at least one sensor (e.g., a puff detecting sensor, a temperature detecting sensor, a cigarette insertion detecting sensor, etc.). Also, the aerosol generating device <b>1</b> may be formed as a structure where, even when the cigarette <b>2</b> is inserted into the aerosol generating device <b>1</b>, external air may be introduced or internal air may be discharged.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Although not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>3</b></figref>, the aerosol generating device <b>1</b> and an additional cradle may form together a system.

For example, the cigarette <b>2</b> may be divided into a first portion including an aerosol generating material and a second portion including a filter, etc. Alternatively, the second portion of the cigarette <b>2</b> may also include an aerosol generating material. For example, an aerosol generating material made in the form of granules or capsules may be inserted into the second portion.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The entire first portion may be inserted into the aerosol generating device <b>1</b>, and the second portion may be exposed to the outside. Alternatively, only a portion of the first portion may be inserted into the aerosol generating device <b>1</b>, or the entire first portion and a portion of the second portion may be inserted into the aerosol generating device <b>1</b>. The user may puff aerosol while holding the second portion by the mouth of the user. In this case, the aerosol is generated by the external air passing through the first portion, and the generated aerosol passes through the second portion and is delivered to the user's mouth.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, the external air may flow into at least one air passage formed in the aerosol generating device <b>1</b>. For example, the opening and closing and/or a size of the air passage formed in the aerosol generating device <b>1</b> may be adjusted by the user. Accordingly, the amount of smoke and a smoking impression may be adjusted by the user. As another example, the external air may flow into the cigarette <b>2</b> through at least one hole formed in a surface of the cigarette <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Hereinafter, an example of the cigarette <b>2</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example of a cigarette.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the cigarette <b>2</b> may include a tobacco rod <b>21</b> and a filter rod <b>22</b>.

However, the filter rod <b>22</b> is not limited thereto. In other words, the filter rod <b>22</b> may include a plurality of segments. For example, the filter rod <b>22</b> may include a first segment configured to cool an aerosol and a second segment configured to filter a certain component included in the aerosol. Also, according to necessity, the filter rod <b>22</b> may further include at least one segment configured to perform other functions.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The cigarette <b>2</b> may be packaged by at least one wrapper <b>24</b>. The wrapper <b>24</b> may have at least one hole through which external air may be introduced or internal air may be discharged. For example, the cigarette <b>2</b> may be packaged by one wrapper. As another example, the cigarette <b>2</b> may be double-packaged by at least two wrappers <b>24</b>. For example, the tobacco rod <b>21</b> may be packaged by a first wrapper <b>241</b>, and the filter rod <b>22</b> may be packaged by wrappers <b>242</b>, <b>243</b>, and <b>244</b>.

For example, the tobacco rod <b>21</b> may be formed as a sheet or a strand. Also, the tobacco rod <b>21</b> may be made out of pipe tobacco, which is formed of tiny bits cut from a tobacco sheet. Also, the tobacco rod <b>21</b> may be surrounded by a heat conductive material. For example, the heat-conducting material may be, but is not limited to, a metal foil such as aluminum foil. For example, the heat conductive material surrounding the tobacco rod <b>21</b> may uniformly distribute heat transmitted to the tobacco rod <b>21</b>, and thus, the heat conductivity applied to the tobacco rod may be increased and taste of the tobacco may be improved. Also, the heat conductive material surrounding the tobacco rod <b>21</b> may function as a susceptor heated by the induction heater. Here, although not illustrated in the drawings, the tobacco rod <b>21</b> may further include an additional susceptor, in addition to the heat conductive material surrounding the tobacco rod <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The filter rod <b>22</b> may include a cellulose acetate filter.

For example, when the average puff time of the user is 2 seconds, and the center frequency may be set to 0.125 Hz according to an experiment.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0139">The controller <b>660</b> may set a lower cutoff frequency and a higher cutoff frequency of the BPF based on a preset puff recognition time. For example, when the average puff time of the user is 2 seconds, the puff recognition time may be set to 1 second to 3 seconds. In addition, when the puff recognition time is 1 second to 3 seconds, the lower cutoff frequency may be set to 1/12 (0.083) Hz, and the higher cutoff frequency may be set to 0.25 Hz according to an experiment. Accordingly, the bandwidth BW of the BPF <b>910</b> may be set to &#x2159; (0.167) Hz.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0140">In step S<b>1230</b>, the controller <b>660</b> may detect a user's puff based on the filtered power signal.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0141">The controller <b>660</b> may detect the user's puff based on a fixed threshold. The controller <b>660</b> may determine that the user's puff has occurred when the filtered power signal is greater than or equal to a preset threshold.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0142">The controller <b>660</b> may count the user's puff. In addition, the controller <b>660</b> may control internal components of the aerosol generating device <b>600</b> based on the counted number of the user's puffs. For example, the controller <b>660</b> may display the number of remaining puffs via the user interface <b>650</b>. However, this is only an example, and the operation of the controller <b>660</b> based on the user's puff is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating the method of detecting the puff.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0144">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, in step S<b>1310</b>, the controller <b>660</b> may compare the filtered power signal with the preset threshold.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0145">In step S<b>1320</b>, the controller <b>660</b> may determine that the user's puff has occurred when the filtered power signal is greater than or equal to a threshold. As aforementioned, since the filtered power signal according to the embodiments has a large difference between a maximum value and a minimum value of a duty within one period of a puff, the controller <b>660</b> may accurately detect the user's puff.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0146">At least one of the components, elements, modules or units (collectively &#x201c;components&#x201d; in this paragraph) represented by a block in the drawings such as the controller <b>660</b>, may be embodied as various numbers of hardware, software and/or firmware structures that execute respective functions described above, according to an exemplary embodiment.
