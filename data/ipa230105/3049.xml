However, the present applicant is not limited to this, the first elastic member <b>7</b> and the second elastic member <b>11</b> can be elastic pieces.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In this embodiment, the working principle of this disclosure is briefly described as follows: when to lock, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the operator holds the handle and inserts the lock core <b>3</b> into the through hole <b>22</b> till that the pin cap <b>25</b> of the pin <b>23</b> enters the locking hole <b>4</b>. When the LED display screen lock needs to be unlocked, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, for the pin is locked in the locking hole <b>4</b>, and the unlocking surface <b>52</b> of the handle <b>1</b> is abutted against the protect pad <b>6</b> of the pin rod <b>24</b>, the handle <b>1</b> can be rotated slowly, thereby a thickness of the unlocking portion, where the protect pad <b>6</b> is abutted against, gradually increases, to drive the pin <b>23</b> to exit from the locking hole <b>4</b> until a top of the pin cap <b>25</b> is abutted against the groove <b>10</b>. Thus, the unlocking of the LED display screen lock is completed and then the handle <b>1</b> and the lock core <b>3</b> can be taken off from the lock seat <b>2</b>. Optionally, the handle <b>1</b> is configured to rotate in a range from 50&#xb0; to 180&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Based on the above, according to the LED display screen lock of the present application, the operator can hold the handle and inserts the lock core into the through hole until that the pin cap of the pin enters the locking hole to realize the locking. The operator rotates the handle to make the unlocking surface push the protect pad outwards, so that the pin cap exits the locking hole and the pin exits the locking hole to complete unlocking. In the embodiment of the present application, the protect pad <b>6</b> can decrease the abrasion between the unlocking surface <b>52</b> and the pin cap <b>25</b>, and prolong the working life of the LED display screen lock. The second elastic member can separate the handle and the lock seat once the pin exists the locking hole, which prevents the LED display screen lock from being locked by accident.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The above are only embodiments of the present application, and do not limit the scope of the present application. Under the inventive concept of the present application, any equivalent structural transformations made according to the description and drawings of the present application, or any direct/indirect application in other related technical fields are included in the claimed scope of the present application.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
