level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a switch for connecting field apparatuses and device for galvanically isolating at least one apparatus which is connectable to a 2-wire Ethernet bus system, in particular of a field apparatus within an industrial automation system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Industrial automation systems usually comprise a multiplicity of automation apparatuses networked together via an industrial communication network and are used in the context of manufacturing automation or process automation for the control or regulation of installations, machines or apparatuses. On account of time-critical boundary conditions in industrial automation systems, predominantly real-time communication protocols, such as PROFINET, PROFIBUS, Real-Time Ethernet or Time Sensitive Networking (TSN), are used for communication between automation apparatuses. In particular, control services or applications can be distributed among currently available servers or virtual machines of an industrial automation system in an automated manner and depending on capacity utilization.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Interruptions of communication connections between computer units of an industrial automation system or automation apparatuses can result in an undesired or unnecessary repetition of a communication of a service request. Moreover, uncommunicated or incompletely communicated messages can, for example, prevent an industrial automation system from transitioning to or staying in a safe operating state.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In Ethernet-based communication networks, problems can arise if network resources for a communication of data streams or data frames with real-time requirements are used in a competing manner for a communication of data frames having a large payload data content without specific quality of service requirements. This can ultimately have the effect that data streams or data frames with real-time requirements are not communicated in accordance with a requested or required quality of service.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO 2007/129031A1 discloses a data signal isolation device comprising a first media converter. The first media converter is provided for converting electrical output data signals into optical output data signals. Moreover, an optical data signal transmission device is provided, which is designed for transmitting the optical output data signals. Furthermore, the data signal isolation device comprises a second media converter, designed to convert the optical output data signals back into electrical output data signals. In addition, an intrinsically safe power supply is provided. Furthermore, the optical data signal transmission device has an electrical isolation gap. Furthermore, the second media converter is fed by an intrinsically safe power supply.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">EP2784977A1 describes a coupler unit for power and data transmission in potentially explosive environments via Ethernet lines. The coupler unit has a supply-side terminal for at least four-core Ethernet lines for combined power and data transmission. A separating filter unit for the frequency-selective output coupling of a supply current and a data signal transmitted via a supply-side Ethernet line is connected to the supply-side terminal. A terminal for Ethernet lines for combined power and data transmission via two cores is provided on the load side. A mixer unit for the frequency-selective coupling of a regulated supply current and a data signal to be transmitted via a load-side Ethernet line to a common core pair is connected to the load-side terminal. The coupler unit enables an adaptation of non-intrinsically safe Power over Ethernet to intrinsically safe Power over Ethernet that is provided via two-core lines.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Ethernet Advanced Physical Layer (Ethernet APL) constitutes an OSI Layer 1 extension that specifically takes account of requirements in the process industry. Ethernet APL places special emphasis in particular on high-speed communication over large distances and also on 2-core cables and protective measures for safe operation within potentially explosive areas. As a barrier for realizing intrinsic safety, an electronic circuit is provided in each case at outputs and inputs of switches and field apparatuses. Such circuits prevent ignitable electrical energy from entering connections. In particular, apparatuses that are operated in potentially explosive areas must be protected by a protection class in accordance with the series of International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards 60079. This ensures that an explosive environment cannot be ignited by hot surfaces or spark generation even in the case of multiple faults. This is achieved through safe limiting of voltages and/or currents in circuits configured to be intrinsically safe.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A further central requirement for circuits configured to be intrinsically safe consists in a safe galvanic isolation of the circuits. In the case of pure power supply applications, such requirements can be satisfied, for example, via a transformer for a switched-mode power supply. If the intention is for data to be transmitted at a high data rate, in particular starting from 100 Mbit/s in addition to power transmission, galvanic isolation via a transformer constitutes an inadequate solution.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of the foregoing, it is therefore and object of the present to provide a device for galvanically isolating at least one apparatus that is connectable to a 2-wire Ethernet bus system, where the device enables both the power supply of the apparatus and high data transmission rates and can be operated in potentially explosive environments, and also to provide a suitable solution for implementing the invention.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This and other objects and advantages are achieved in accordance with the invention by a switch and device for galvanically isolating at least one apparatus that is connectable to the 2-wire Ethernet bus system that has an uplink and a downlink physical layer (PHY) interface device, where each uplink and a downlink PHY interface device comprises a transmitting unit and a receiving unit. The receiving units each have two output terminals for providing a received ternary-coded signal as differential signal. The PHY interface devices can be in particular in each case an integrated circuit or a functional group of a circuit that is used to implement coding and decoding of data between a digital system and a physical propagation medium. Preferably, the device in accordance with the invention is configured for use in an intrinsically safe circuit and, in accordance with IEC60079-11, has a safe link to line elements to be protected.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, the device in accordance with the invention comprises an uplink and a downlink signal split device, each of which is connected to the output terminals of an assigned receiving unit and is configured to split a ternary-coded signal provided as differential signal into two binary-coded signals. Furthermore, an uplink and a downlink optocoupler device are provided, each of which is connected to an assigned signal split device and is configured to transfer two received binary-coded signals to a transmitting unit of an assigned PHY interface device. Preferably, the uplink signal split device is connected to the output terminals of the receiving unit of the uplink PHY interface device, while the downlink signal split device is connected to the output terminals of the receiving unit of the downlink PHY interface device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Overall, the present invention enables safe galvanic isolation of an intrinsically safe circuit and also limiting of power, current, voltage to a no longer ignitable level via an optical isolation method that does not cause over-voltages on the secondary side. The optical isolation method allows the present invention to be used at high data rates, in particular, because no capacitive loads are present. Preferably, the apparatus that is connectable to the 2-wire Ethernet bus system is configured in accordance with Ethernet Advanced Physical Layer. Furthermore, the device in accordance with the invention is advantageously configured for connection to multiplexed supply lines of the 2-wire Ethernet bus system that are provided for simultaneous power and data transmission.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The uplink and downlink signal split devices can, for example, each be formed by comparators, switching transistors or logic gates. Preferably, the uplink and downlink signal split devices are each formed by two comparators for a respective differential signal component and are configured to compare the respective differential signal component with a reference signal level.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the ternary-coded signal is an MLT-3 signal comprising a negative signal level, a zero signal level and a positive signal level. The two binary-coded signals each comprise a zero signal level and a one signal level. Advantageously, the signal split devices are accordingly each configured to convert (i) the negative signal level of the MLT-3 signal to the zero signal level of a first binary-coded signal and to the one signal level of a second binary-coded signal, (ii) the zero signal level of the MLT-3 signal to the same signal level of the first and second binary-coded signals, and (iii) the positive signal level of the MLT-3 signal to the one signal level of the first binary-coded signal and to the zero signal level of the second binary-coded signal.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As an alternative thereto, the signal split devices can each be configured to convert (i) the negative signal level of the MLT-3 signal to the one signal level of a first binary-coded signal and to the zero signal level of a second binary-coded signal, (ii) the zero signal level of the MLT-3 signal to the same signal level of the first and second binary-coded signals, and (iii) the positive signal level of the MLT-3 signal to the zero signal level of the first binary-coded signal and to the one signal level of the second binary-coded signal.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In both above-described embodiments, the signal split devices are advantageously each configured to convert (i) the zero signal level of the MLT-3 signal to the zero signal level of the first binary-coded signal and to the zero signal level of the second binary-coded signal or (ii) the zero signal level of the MLT-3 signal to the one signal level of the first binary-coded signal and to the one signal level of the second binary-coded signal.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the uplink optocoupler device is connected to the uplink signal split device, while the downlink optocoupler device is connected to the downlink signal split device. Here, the optocoupler devices each comprise 2 digital optocouplers for transferring in each case one of the two binary-coded signals. The use of digital optocouplers enables a cost-effective implementation of the disclosed embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In particular, the optocoupler devices can each comprise two digital optocouplers, each having an input-side anode terminal, an input-side cathode terminal, a supply voltage terminal, an output signal terminal and an output-side ground terminal. Here, the cathode terminals, the supply voltage terminals and the output signal terminals are each interconnected with limiting resistors for the purpose of voltage, current and/or power limiting. In this way, the digital optocouplers can be effectively protected against overloads in fault situations.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The switch in accordance with the invention for connecting field apparatuses to a 2-wire Ethernet bus system comprises in particular a device for galvanic isolation in accordance with the disclosed embodiments. Specifically, the switch comprises, besides a primary switch and a secondary switch, a device for galvanic isolation comprising an uplink and a downlink PHY interface device, an uplink and a downlink signal split device and also an uplink and a downlink optocoupler device.
