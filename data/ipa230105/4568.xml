These stages generally include invention, filing a patent application on the invention, prosecuting the patenting application to allowance or abandonment, determining whether to file any continuing applications, and paying maintenance fees on the allowed patent.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">At each stage, one or more parties determine the best course of action to take with respect to the invention. For example, when determining whether or not to file a patent, the inventor may know what products are out in the technology area of the invention, a business manager may know how the invention fits in with a company's goals, and a patent attorney may have researched existing patents or application in the technology area of the patent. These parties will ultimately make the decision whether it is worth the initial investment of filing an application on the invention and then determine the next course of action at each future stage.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some instances, an inventor, business manager or portfolio manager may wish to monitor the patent activities of one or more competitors. The provision of up-to-date information relating to cited references or technology trends in the art to which a user's or competitor's patent portfolio relates may be particularly helpful in devising patenting strategy or making informed business decisions.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In various embodiments, a patent management system includes tools to help the parties involved in the patenting process make decisions at each stage in the life of a patent. These tools may also be used for general research by parties not immediately involved with the patenting of the invention. Additionally, these tools may be used as standalone tools, in combination with other tools, and in combination with other patent management systems. The tools may be used to provide patent analytics information. The tools may also be used to facilitate prosecution of a patent matter, by assisting in extracting and automatically analyzing data from external patent databases, for example. In an example embodiment, tools and systems are provided for a patent management system known as &#x201c;PAIR Plus&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Examples of tools include, but are not limited to prosecution analytics, reference management, prior art analytics, docketing management, claim mapping, claim analytics, portfolio analytics, external database (e.g., PAIR) analytics, annuity management, and strategic monitoring. The systems, methods and tools of the present invention set forth in this specification are described in relation to a patent management system and patent matters, but it will be understood that the present invention could equally be applied to other forms of intellectual property (trademarks, copyright, registered designs, and the like). Moreover, the term &#x201c;patent&#x201d; is not intended to be limited to an issued patent, but may include a pending patent application or un-filed application or invention disclosure. The term &#x201c;user&#x201d; is intended to cover any person interacting with the patent management system. A user may be an inventor, portfolio manager, business manager or patent attorney, for example.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view of computer network system <b>100</b> according to various embodiments.

The user-interface may be implemented using a variety of programming languages or programming methods, such as HTML (HyperText Markup Language), VBScript (Visual Basic&#xae; Scripting Edition), JavaScript&#x2122;, XML&#xae; (Extensible Markup Language), XSLT&#x2122; (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations), AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), Java&#x2122;, JFC (Java&#x2122; Foundation Classes), and Swing (an Application Programming Interface for Java&#x2122;).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">User terminal <b>104</b> may be a personal computer or mobile device. In an embodiment, user terminal <b>104</b> includes a client program to interface with patent management system <b>102</b>. The client program may include commercial software, custom software, open source software, freeware, shareware, or other types of software packages. In an embodiment, the client program includes a thin client designed to provide query and data manipulation tools for a user of user terminal <b>104</b>. The client program may interact with a server program hosted by, for example, application server <b>110</b>. Additionally, the client program may interface with database management server <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Operations database <b>116</b> may be composed of one or more logical or physical databases. For example, operations database <b>116</b> may be viewed as a system of databases that when viewed as a compilation, represent an &#x201c;operations database.&#x201d; Sub-databases in such a configuration may include a matter database a portfolio database, a user database, a mapping database and an analytics database. Operations database <b>116</b> may be implemented as a relational database, a centralized database, a distributed database, an object oriented database, or a flat database in various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In various embodiments, the tools of the patent management system share a common framework. The framework may have a base organization unit of a matter. In various embodiments, a matter is an issued patent or patent application that includes one or more patent claims. In an embodiment, a matter is generally identified by its patent number or publication number. Identification may mean either identification as it relates to a user of the patent management system or within the patent management system. Thus, a user may see a matter listed as its patent number while internally a database of the patent management system may identify it by a random number. One or more matters may be associated with prior art or cited references stored in a reference or prior art database.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">One or more matters may be grouped together to form a portfolio. A matter may also be associated with one or more other matters in a family. A family member may be a priority matter, a continuing (e.g., continuation, divisional) matter, or foreign counter-part member. Family members may be determined according to a legal status database such as INPADOC.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Data stored in a first database may be associated with data in a second database through the use of common data fields. For example, consider entries in the matter database formatted as [Matter ID, Patent Number] and entries in the portfolio database formatted as [Portfolio ID, Matter ID]. In this manner, a portfolio entry in the portfolio database is associated with a matter in the matter database through the Matter ID data field. In various embodiments, a matter may be associated with more than one portfolio by creating multiple entries in the portfolio database, one for each portfolio that the matter is associated with. In other embodiments, one or more patent reference documents may be associated with a patent by creating multiple entries in the patent database, for example. The structure of the database and format and data field titles are for illustration purposes and other structures, names, or formats may be used. Additionally, further associations between data stored in the databases may be created as discussed further herein.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">During operation of patent management system <b>102</b>, data from multiple data sources (internal and external) is imported into or accessed by the operations database <b>116</b>. Internal sources may include data from the various tools of the patent management system. External sources <b>120</b> may include websites or databases associated with foreign and domestic patent offices, assignment databases, WIPO, and INPADOC. In various embodiments, the data is scraped and parsed from the websites if it is unavailable through a database. The data may be gathered using API calls to the sources when available. The data may be imported and stored in the operations database on a scheduled basis, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or some other regular or periodic interval. Alternatively, the data may be imported on-demand. The imported data may relate to any information pertaining to patents or patent applications, such as serial numbers, title, cited art, inventor or assignee details and the like.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">After data importation, the data may be standardized into a common format. For example, database records from internal or external sources may not be in a compatible format with the operations database. Data conditioning may include data rearrangement, normalization, filtering (e.g., removing duplicates), sorting, binning, or other operations to transform the data into a common format (e.g., using similar date formats and name formats).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of patent management system <b>102</b>, according to an example embodiment.

In various embodiments, the data stored in databases <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>210</b> may be in the same or multiple physical locations. For example, portfolio database <b>206</b> may be stored in one or more computers associated with a portfolio management service. In various embodiments, patent management system <b>102</b> mirrors databases stored in other locations. In an embodiment, when a request is made to access data stored in the databases, patent management system <b>102</b> determines where the data is located and directs the request to the appropriate location. Similarly, modules <b>212</b>-<b>222</b> may be executed across multiple computer systems.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an example embodiment user database <b>202</b> stores data representing users of patent management system <b>102</b>. The data may include data fields of user credentials including a user ID and password and access rights with respect to patent management system <b>102</b>. The user ID may be common across the tools of the patent management system. In this manner, access rights of the user with respect to the tools of the patent management system may follow across the various tools of the patent management system. In an example embodiment, different access rights are granted to a user ID between the various tools.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In various embodiments, each user ID has access rights to one or more matters. Similarly, a user ID may have portfolio level access rights. Access rights may be defined according to at least two parameters: read access and write access. Thus, when a user logs into patent management system <b>102</b>, the user is presented with access only to the matters/portfolios that have been associated with the user ID. More (e.g., additional contact information) or fewer data fields associated with a user may be included in a user entry stored in user database <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an embodiment, matter database <b>204</b> stores data representing matters. Each matter may be associated with one or more portfolios. In some embodiments, a matter is associated with no portfolios. In various embodiments, a matter is a foreign or domestic patent or application. Matters may also be inventions that have not yet been filed (e.g., as may be the case within a docketing system). In an embodiment, a matter entry includes data fields representing a matter ID, patent number, publication number, serial number, docketing number, title (e.g., the name of the patent or application), type of the matter (e.g., application, issued patent, PCT application), status of the matter (e.g., issued, abandoned, allowed), a link to the patent office where the matter was filed, a link to a PDF download of the matter, abstract of the matter, inventors of the matter, current owner of the matter, cited references on the face of the matter, filed date, issue date, docket number, and annuity information (e.g., due date, country, and amount due). In some embodiments, other patent reference documents or prior art in any form may be stored and associated with one or more matters. More or fewer data fields associated with a patent may be included in a matter entry stored in matter database <b>204</b>. In an example embodiment, matter database <b>204</b> may store a patent matter database, wherein this database includes data about the patent matters. The data may include, for at least one patent matter, a claim set or statement of invention and a priority date for the claim set or statement of invention. Matter database <b>204</b> may also store a database of prior art documents (also known as &#x201c;references&#x201d;), wherein the prior art database includes data about the prior art documents. The data may include, for at least one prior art document, a priority date or publication date of the document. One or more of the prior art documents may be associated with a first patent matter in the patent matter database. Matter database <b>204</b> may also store data obtained from internal or external sources relating to cited references owned by or cited against (in &#x201c;forward&#x201d; or &#x201c;reverse&#x201d; manner) a target entity (for example, a client of a firm) as well as cited references owned by or cited against (in &#x201c;forward&#x201d; or &#x201c;reverse&#x201d; manner) another entity (for example, a competitor of the client or other target entity). Public bibliographic details of such cited references may be obtainable from websites or databases associated with foreign and domestic patent offices (PAIR), assignment databases, WIPO, and INPADOC. In various embodiments, the data is scraped and parsed from the websites if it is unavailable through a database. The data may be gathered using API calls to the sources when available. The data may be imported and stored in the operations database on a scheduled basis, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or some other regular or periodic interval. Alternatively, the data may be imported on-demand. The imported data may relate to any information pertaining to patents or patent applications, such as serial numbers, title, cited art, inventor or assignee details and the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In various embodiments, a matter is associated with one or more other matters as a family with a family ID. Family members may be priority documents, continuation patents/applications, divisional patents/applications, and foreign patent/application counterparts. In an embodiment, family information is determined according to an external source such as INPADOC. Patent reference documents and/or other prior art may be manually or automatically stored, cross-cited and associated with related family matters, for example.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Portfolio database <b>206</b>, in an example embodiment, stores data representing portfolios of one or more matters. Data stored in portfolio database <b>206</b> may have been previously generated by a tool of patent management system <b>102</b>. In various embodiments, a portfolio may be generated by a user using patent management system <b>102</b>. For example, a user interface may be presented to the user requesting a name for the portfolio and identifiers of matters to be included in the portfolio. In an embodiment, a portfolio entry in portfolio database <b>206</b> includes the data fields of portfolio ID and portfolio name. Additionally, a data field for matter ID may also be included in an entry in the portfolio database. Thus, each portfolio may be associated with one or more matters through the use of the matter ID data field. More or fewer data fields associated with a portfolio may be included in a portfolio entry of portfolio database <b>206</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In various embodiments, mapping database <b>208</b> may include mappings of patent concepts to one or more matters. In an example embodiment, the underlying patents and patent claims included in each patent portfolio may be categorized by patent concepts (sometimes referred herein as concepts) such as scope concepts (SC) and technology categories (TC).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an example embodiment, technology categories are categories that claims relate to, but are not necessarily limited to. For example, a claim to a pulse generator may be put in the technology category &#x201c;pacemaker&#x201d;, but not be limited to a pacemaker per se&#x2014;perhaps the claim merely says that the pulse generator generates a pulse of certain type that is useful for pacing, but pacing does not appear in the claim. Hence, the claim relates to the technology category &#x201c;pacemaker,&#x201d; but it is not limited to being a pacemaker.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an example embodiment, scope concepts are concepts that a claim is limited to. This is contrast to technology categories, where the claim may be mapped to a TC but it not necessarily limited to it. A scope concept may be defined in a way to give the concept a context that a user can understand without necessarily having to look at the corresponding claim language. For example, if the scope concept is &#x201c;method or apparatus for cardiac rhythm management&#x201d;, and it is mapped to claim A, then claim A by definition is limited to this application, such that if a target device does not perform cardiac rhythm management, then it would not infringe claim A.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an example embodiment, there are two types of scope concepts: 1) high level scope concepts that are like technical categories in the sense they are broad and general and apply to many claims in a portfolio; and 2) scope concepts that are specific to a limited number of claims&#x2014;for example all claims in a patent may be limited to a very specific distinguishing feature, and this feature could be the basis for a scope concept.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some example embodiments, high level scope concepts may be defined prior to mapping, and then assigned as applicable. For example, several scope concepts like: atrial pacing, ventricular pacing, defibrillation method or device, etc, may be defined. Then a mapping team may go through all claims in a portfolio and map these scope concepts to claims that are limited to these concepts. After the mapping is complete, an analysis may be done showing how many claims in the portfolio are limited to each of these scope concepts, and the claims may be presented for each SC. This may be useful is disqualify claims that are not of interest to a particular target (e.g., if an analysis is being done to find a claim that covers an alleged infringer).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some example embodiments, specific scope concepts are mapped patent by patent or by patent family. These may enable a person to create one or two scope concepts that can be mapped across all claims in given patent, a family of patents, or across a portion of a patent portfolio. In order to effectively formulate a scope concept that may be globally useful across a patent portfolio, it may be useful to be able to examine multiple patent claims at the same time even if they are not all in the same patent or patent family. A keyword mapping may indicate that there is an exact match between the keyword and a subset of the claim language.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In various embodiments, analytics database <b>210</b> stores data representing calculated analytics on data stored within patent management system <b>102</b> or external data sources. In various embodiments, analytics are organized according to an individual matter, a portfolio, or family, or date of an event (such as an assignment recordal, for example). Events may be organized by a date range (for example, all assignments occurring between Corporation A and Corporation B in the last 6 months, or all filings made by inventor X in last 12 months). The calculated analytics may be based on information gathered from multiple sources such as databases of patent management system <b>102</b> and PAIR.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In various embodiments, information for an individual matter may include status (e.g., disclosure received, drafting, filed, completed-waiting examination, in prosecution, allowed, issued), cited prior art, list and type of rejections (e.g., 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 101, 102, 103) number of claims allowed, office action count, interviews held, IDS statements filed, attorney fees to date, and PTO fees to date. Further metrics for an individual matter stored in analytics database <b>210</b> may include, time waiting for examiner, total time in examination, time waiting for PTO while in examination, and time on appeal. Additional prosecution details may include an upcoming docket date (e.g., due dates for office action, IDS due dates, etc.). A claim prosecution history chart may also be stored in analytics database <b>210</b> for each matter. The prosecution history may include a history of claim amendments and arguments made in prosecution.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In various embodiments, portfolio and family analytics information may be stored in analytics database <b>210</b> based on aggregating the metrics for an individual matter. In an embodiment, the analytics of a family may differ from those in a portfolio as not all family member matters may be part of a portfolio. Additionally, the analytics may be stored for multiple time periods such that comparisons may be made between current metrics and metrics from a year ago (or other time period).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Aggregated metrics may include a total patents and applications, pending and waiting for examination, in prosecution with no claims allowed, in prosecution with some claims allowed, appealed, notice of allowance received, and issued. These metrics may be compiled for both US and international matters in the portfolio. Additional information may include the international portfolio distribution by country. An age distribution of the portfolio may also be compiled. For example the portfolio may be broken down by less than one year old, 1 to 3 years old, 3 to 5 years old, 5 to 10 years old, 10 to 20 years old, and 20 or more years old. Recent filing and issue activity as well as upcoming Ford filing deadlines may be stored in analytics database <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In various embodiments, prosecution metrics across a portfolio or family are determined and stored in analytics database <b>210</b>. This data may include matters waiting for examination, matters in examination, matters appealed, and cases allowed but not yet issued. Analytics with respect office actions may also be compiled and stored. For example success of allowance after a first office action response, a second response, and so forth may be stored in analytics database <b>210</b>. Additional prosecution analytics may include allowance rate (e.g., 10%) after a telephone interview, allowance after an in-person interview, percentage of interviews with response, number and type of rejection, average time in prosecution (e.g., in months), average time to file a response, and average time to next office action. Further, the list of recently allowed cases, recently appealed cases, stalled cases, and recently abandoned cases may also be stored for each portfolio and family in analytics database <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In various embodiments, the results of keyword analysis on one or more matters and/or prior art references may be stored in analytics database <b>210</b>. The keyword analysis may be based on the occurrences of the keywords in the matter or references to derive a score or keyword overlap.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In various embodiments, data stored in the database for a group of matters in a portfolio or family is analyzed to determine the top (e.g., ten) most cited patents, the top most cited inventors, top most cited prior art owners (e.g., according to assignment documents or the face of the patent), newly (e.g., within the last 60 days) cited prior art owners, and top most cited prior art inventors. This information may be stored in analytics database <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an embodiment, display module <b>212</b> is configured to display user interfaces and information retrieved from one or more databases <b>202</b>-<b>210</b>. If a user is accessing patent management system <b>102</b> remotely (e.g., through a web browser) display module <b>212</b> may be configured to transmit data representing a user-interface through a network to a user terminal. In various embodiments, display module <b>212</b> is configured to generate one or more charts of data stored in databases <b>202</b>-<b>210</b>. For example, display module <b>212</b> may generate a pie chart of the top <b>10</b> inventors within a portfolio.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In various embodiments, input module <b>214</b> receives data from multiple sources where it may be further processed by one or more other modules and stored in one or more of databases <b>202</b>-<b>210</b>. In various embodiments, input module <b>214</b> or the patent management system <b>102</b> may comprise a search engine (not shown) for conducting searches at a patent registry or on the Internet. For example, input module <b>214</b> may be configured to utilize one or more APIs to data from one or more patent data stores (e.g., public PAIR, private PAIR, INPADOC, foreign patent offices, patent docketing systems, portfolio management systems, etc). The data may include published patent documents, patent applications, office actions or other patent office correspondence, prior art references, claim mappings, dockets dates, annuity payment data and patent or patent application assignment information. Specific assignment data may include details pertaining to the assignor or assignee (e.g. name, address, nationality, place of incorporation), date of assignment, details of the matter being assigned, or any other data pertaining to assignments or change in ownership that may be recorded at any national or regional patent registry such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) or European Patent Office (EPO), for example.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In various embodiments, input module <b>214</b> is configured to receive input from one or more user interface elements. For example patent management system <b>102</b> may present multiple user interfaces to a user. These user interfaces may enable users to input data directly into databases <b>202</b>-<b>210</b>, instruct the patent management system to retrieve data from patent data stores, and instruct the patent management system to perform various operations (e.g., analysis) on the data in databases <b>202</b>-<b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Additionally, input module <b>214</b> may be configured to determine the selection of one or more user interface elements by a user and initiate the action associated with the selected user interface element. For example, a user interface element may include a drop-down menu to select a portfolio. Input module <b>214</b> may be configured to receive the selection of the portfolio by the user. Then, input module <b>214</b> may pass the selection to one or more other modules for further processing. For example, display module <b>212</b> may update the drop-down menu to indicate the selection of the portfolio. In other example embodiments, a user may select an assignee name, or technology field, or date range of potential interest (or a combination of these or other aspects of interest), for which the user wishes to be informed of recent or ongoing assignment or change in ownership status. The user may request to be informed regularly (daily, weekly or monthly, for example) of ongoing assignments or changes in ownership by making a selection of the appropriate interface elements.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In various embodiments, input module <b>214</b> processes the data that has been inputted and formats it according to the data fields of databases <b>202</b>-<b>210</b> as discussed above. In various embodiments processing is completed using a parsing module (not shown). For example, consider a patent publication that a user has directed to be inputted into one or more of the databases. The parsing module may use a combination of automatic image recognition and text analysis to determine the filing date, issue date, title, abstract, and claims of the patent. In some embodiments, the parsing module may flag certain pieces of data that had been determined to be potentially inaccurate (e.g., a number could not be read). A user of patent management system <b>102</b> may then examine the flagged data and manually enter the information which is then stored in the appropriate database.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The resulting data that has been parsed by the parsing module may then be entered as an entry in one or more of databases <b>202</b>-<b>210</b>. This may be accomplished by, for example, formulating an insert SQL query with the parsed information. In various embodiments the parsing module may parse multiple pieces of information before generating a database entry. For example, input module <b>214</b> may receive a docket number for an issued patent. The docket number may be combined with the information parsed from the issued patent to form an entry in matter database <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In various embodiments, mapping module <b>216</b> is configured to facilitate mappings of scope concept, technology categories, prior art and keywords to patent claims of a matter. In an embodiment, mapping signifies association. For example, in conjunction with display module <b>212</b> and input module <b>214</b>, mapping module <b>216</b> may present a user interface of patent claims stored in matter database <b>204</b> and scope concepts stored in mapping database <b>208</b>. Input module <b>214</b> may receive a selection of one or more patent claims and one or more scope concepts and pass them to mapping module <b>216</b>. Mapping module <b>216</b> may then formulate an SQL query to associate the one or more patents claims with the one or more scope concepts. When executed, the SQL query, may update the mapping database <b>208</b> with the associations. In various embodiments, mapping module <b>216</b> also allows the creation of new scope concepts, technology categories, and keywords that may be mapped to one or more patent claims. Furthermore, mapping module may present user interfaces that allow a user to rank and rate matters stored in matter database <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Mapping module <b>216</b> may also allow the generation of claim charts of a plurality of cells. A claim chart may include one or more scope concepts, technology categories, and keywords on one axis and claims of matters in a portfolio on the other axis. The claim chart may include a variety of levels of granularity of scope concepts. Some claims may be mapped to all of the scope concepts while others may not be mapped to any scope concepts. At the cell intersection between a scope concept (or technology category or keyword) and a claim an indication of the mapping may be presented by changing the format of the cell. For example, the cell may be colored blue when a scope concept is mapped and red when not mapped.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In various embodiments, analytics module <b>218</b> is configured to examine and run calculations on the data stored in the databases <b>202</b>-<b>210</b> to generate the analytics previously discussed. For example, analytics module <b>218</b> may formulate an SQL query that retrieves the number of times that a prior art reference has been cited within a portfolio. This query may be run for each prior art cited within the portfolio to determine a list of the most cited (e.g., the top ten) prior art references with a portfolio. In an embodiment, the queries are formulated and run as requested by a user. In an embodiment, once the analytics information has been determined, it is stored within analytics database <b>210</b>. In various embodiments, queries are formulated and run on a periodic basis (e.g., nightly) and entries in analytics database <b>210</b> may be updated to reflect any changes. In other embodiments, the analytics module <b>218</b> may in response to user input formulate a query to examine how many times a given patent matter has been assigned or been subject to a change in ownership from one party to another. Other queries analyzing patent assignment data may be run as requested by a user.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In various embodiments, the analytics module <b>218</b> is configured to analyze and map cited reference data stored in the matter database <b>204</b>. The data may be scraped in by the input module <b>214</b>. For example, cited references owned by or cited against target or other entities as mentioned above may be mapped against each other to determine a &#x201c;prior art&#x201d; overlap. The overlap may be presented graphically, for example in a graphic user interface presented in user terminal <b>104</b>. In various embodiments, the overlap may relate to so-called &#x201c;forward&#x201d; citations, or &#x201c;reverse&#x201d; citations, or both. In various embodiments, the overlap may be presented for a target company and one or more competitors. Changes in the overlap over time may also be stored and mapped to give an indication to a user of technology trends, changes in trends and the ongoing development of potentially relevant prior art. In various embodiments, a prior art overlap between a target and competitor may be stored, mapped and shown for a single patent, a portfolio of patents, or a family of patents. The target and other entities of interest, such as competitor companies or inventors, may be selected by the user.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">An analytical result or mapping may be displayed as a list of prior art cited against both the target and competitor, with an indication of which art overlaps or is common to both listings. In various embodiments, the analytical result or mapping may in addition or alternatively present a list of companies that own the prior art cited against the target and other entities. The target company may appear as an owner. The display module <b>212</b> may be configured to display the results of the mappings and overlap of cited references as a bar chart, or listings, or other graphic, in a user interface of the type shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In various embodiments, the analytics module <b>218</b> is configured to receive input identifying a pool of keywords for a first patent matter in matter database <b>204</b> and associated prior art documents in matter database <b>204</b>. The term keyword is intended to include individual keywords as well as a number of keywords grouped together making up a key phrase, for example. The module <b>218</b> may be further configured to perform a keyword analysis on the first patent matter and associated prior art documents based on occurrences of the keywords in the first patent matter and associated prior art documents. The analytics module <b>218</b> may be further configured to identify, based on the analysis, keywords occurring uniquely in the first patent matter. In view of their uniquely occurring nature, these keywords may be regarded as claim elements potentially differentiating the claim set or statement of invention over the disclosures contained in the one or more prior art documents.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In various embodiments, the analytics module <b>218</b> is configured to generate for a user the patent activity profiles of one or more entities.

Modules may constitute either software modules (e.g., code embodied (1) on a non-transitory machine-readable medium or (2) in a transmission signal) or hardware-implemented modules. A hardware-implemented module is tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more processors may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware-implemented module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In various embodiments, a hardware-implemented module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a hardware-implemented module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware-implemented module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware-implemented module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Accordingly, the term &#x201c;hardware-implemented module&#x201d; should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired) or temporarily or transitorily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner and/or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware-implemented modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware-implemented modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware-implemented modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware-implemented modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor, for example, to constitute a particular hardware-implemented module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware-implemented module at a different instance of time.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Hardware-implemented modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware-implemented modules. Accordingly, the described hardware-implemented modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware-implemented modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connect the hardware-implemented modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware-implemented modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware-implemented modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware-implemented modules have access. For example, one hardware-implemented module may perform an operation, and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware-implemented module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware-implemented modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Similarly, the methods described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor-implemented modules.
