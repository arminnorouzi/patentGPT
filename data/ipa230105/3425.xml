For example, in order to achieve high efficiency, it has been proposed to form various films on sliding surfaces of slide members included in the hermetic refrigerant compressor, and to use lubricating oil having a reduced viscosity.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The hermetic refrigerant compressor includes a sealed container in which the lubricating oil is stored. The sealed container also accommodates an electric element and a compression element. The compression element includes, as the slide members, for example, a crankshaft, a piston, and a connecting rod serving as a coupler. A main shaft of the crankshaft and a main bearing, the piston and a bore, a piston pin and the connecting rod, and an eccentric shaft of the crankshaft and the connecting rod, etc., form slide parts with each other.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As one example of the hermetic refrigerant compressor that uses lubricating oil having a reduced viscosity, Patent Literature 1 discloses a reciprocating compressor. In Patent Literature 1, the lubricating oil used in the reciprocating compressor has a kinematic viscosity in the range of 3 mm<sup>2</sup>/S to 10 mm<sup>2</sup>/S at 40&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">If the lubricating oil has a low viscosity, an oil film is not easily formed by the lubricating oil. In this respect, in the reciprocating compressor (hermetic refrigerant compressor) disclosed by Patent Literature 1, the surfaces of the slide members forming the slide parts (i.e., sliding surfaces) are subjected to special treatment to facilitate the formation of the oil film, so that even in a case where lubricating oil having a low viscosity is used and the oil film formed thereby is thin, wear or seizing of the piston and the connecting rod is prevented.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Not only the use of low-viscosity lubricating oil, but also the adoption of a configuration in which a main bearing is provided with a thrust bearing is also known as one way of achieving high efficiency. For example, Patent Literature 2 discloses a hermetic compressor in which a thrust bearing is provided on a thrust surface of a main bearing. This thrust ball bearing includes; a plurality of rolling elements (e.g., balls) retained by a retainer; and an upper race and a lower race provided over and under the rolling elements, respectively. The rolling elements roll on the upper and lower races while being in point contact with these races. Accordingly, the thrust bearing functions as a rolling bearing. The rolling bearing thus configured allows the main shaft to rotate with less friction while supporting a load in a perpendicular direction. This makes it possible to effectively heighten the efficiency of the hermetic refrigerant compressor.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">By heightening the efficiency of a hermetic refrigerant compressor, the energy saving of a refrigerator-freezer using the hermetic refrigerant compressor can be realized. Other than heightening the efficiency of the hermetic refrigerant compressor, there is also another known way of achieving energy saving of the refrigerator-freezer, which is to lower the operation speed of the hermetic refrigerant compressor. There has been a proposed hermetic refrigerant compressor configuration that can be made suited for low-speed operation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, Patent Literature 3 discloses a compressor (hermetic refrigerant compressor) configured such that the thickness of a flange that radially protrudes between a main shaft and an eccentric shaft of a crankshaft is set to 4 mm or less so as to avoid decrease in the amount of lubricating oil fed between a cylinder and a piston during low-speed operation. Accordingly, the position of the entire cylinder can be lowered without reducing the cross-sectional area of the cylinder. As a result, the lubricating oil more easily reaches the upper surface of the piston, and thereby the amount of lubricating oil fed between the cylinder and the piston can be increased.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">PTL 1: Japanese Patent No. 5222244</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">PTL 2: Japanese Patent No. 6469575</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">PTL 3: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Publication No. 2018-035727</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The efficiency of hermetic refrigerant compressors has been heightened more and more in recent years. By providing the main bearing with the thrust bearing as in Patent Literature 2, the efficiency of the hermetic refrigerant compressor can be further heightened. In this case, however, due to the presence of the thrust bearing, the overall height of the hermetic refrigerant compressor increases. If such a hermetic refrigerant compressor is installed in a refrigerator-freezer, the size of a machinery room in the refrigerator-freezer needs to be increased, which results in reduction in the internal volume of the refrigerator-freezer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As a prior art example for avoiding such increase in the overall height of the hermetic refrigerant compressor, Patent Literature 2 discloses an example in which the wall thickness of a support portion of a cylinder block is reduced. Regarding this prior art example, Patent Literature 2 points out a technical problem in that when the wall thickness of the support portion of the cylinder block is reduced, the stiffness of the cylinder block is reduced, and consequently, the main bearing tends to be deformed easily. In light of this, Patent Literature 2 adopts a configuration that makes it possible to avoid increase in the overall height without reducing the wall thickness of the support portion.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Meanwhile, in Patent Literature 3, as described above, the thickness of the flange that is positioned between the main shaft and the eccentric shaft of the crankshaft is made thin, specifically, 4 mm or less, so as to avoid increase in the overall height. However, if the thickness of the flange is made excessively thin, it causes inclination of the eccentric shaft relative to the main shaft. Each of Patent Literature 2 and Patent Literature 3 describes that if the entire crankshaft is inclined in the main bearing, the heightening of the efficiency of the compressor is hindered. However, none of the patent literatures takes inclination of the eccentric shaft relative to the main shaft into consideration.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">By using low-viscosity lubricating oil as in Patent Literature 1, a frictional coefficient between slide members forming a slide part is reduced, and thereby high efficiency can be achieved. In this case, however, there is a risk of causing reduction in the wear resistance of the slide part. In Patent Literature 1, as described above, the sliding surfaces are subjected to special treatment to avoid reduction in the wear resistance. However, performing the special treatment causes increase in the manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention has been made to solve the above-described problems. An object of the present invention is to provide a hermetic refrigerant compressor including a thrust bearing, the hermetic refrigerant compressor making it possible to achieve high efficiency without requiring special treatment on sliding surfaces and to avoid increase in the overall height without making the flange excessively thin.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to solve the above-described problems, a hermetic refrigerant compressor according to the present invention includes a sealed container in which lubricating oil is stored, the sealed container accommodating an electric element and a compression element, the compression element being driven by the electric element and configured to compress a refrigerant. The compression element includes: a crankshaft including a main shaft and an eccentric shaft; a cylinder block including a compression chamber; a piston that is inserted in the compression chamber in a reciprocable manner; a coupler that couples the piston and the eccentric shaft; a main bearing that pivotally supports the main shaft; and a thrust bearing provided on a thrust surface of the main bearing. One end of a sliding surface of the main bearing, the one end being closer to the compression chamber than an opposite end of the sliding surface, is a first end. The opposite end of the sliding surface is a second end. A distance between a center axis of the compression chamber and the second end of the sliding surface of the main bearing is a distance L. A distance between the center axis of the compression chamber and the first end of the sliding surface of the main bearing is a distance La. When the distance L is in a range of 38 mm to 51 mm, the distance La is less than or equal to 16 mm.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the above configuration, in the hermetic refrigerant compressor including the thrust bearing, when the distance L, which affects the overall height of the hermetic refrigerant compressor, is specified within a predetermined range, the upper limit of the distance La between the center axis of the compression chamber and the first end of the sliding surface of the main bearing is specified to 16 mm. This makes it possible to avoid increase in the overall height of the hermetic refrigerant compressor without making a flange excessively thin, the flange contributing to the stability of the eccentric shaft, and also makes it possible to reduce the load on the main shaft without subjecting sliding surfaces to special treatment. Consequently, the efficiency of the hermetic refrigerant compressor can be further heightened without increasing the overall height of the hermetic refrigerant compressor. In addition, since the flange is not made excessively thin, not only high efficiency but also favorable reliability of the hermetic refrigerant compressor can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A refrigerator-freezer according to the present invention includes a refrigerant circuit including: the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above; a radiator; a decompressor; and a heat absorber. In the refrigerant circuit, the hermetic refrigerant compressor, the radiator, the decompressor, and the heat absorber are connected by piping in an annular manner.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The above configuration makes it possible to avoid increase in the overall height of the hermetic refrigerant compressor including the thrust bearing without making the flange thin, and also makes it possible to reduce the load on the main shaft without requiring special treatment on the sliding surfaces. Consequently, high efficiency and favorable reliability of the hermetic refrigerant compressor are achieved. By including the hermetic refrigerant compressor, which is highly efficient and has favorable reliability, in the refrigerator-freezer, the power consumption of the refrigerator-freezer can be reduced, and also, the refrigerator-freezer can be made highly reliable.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The above and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will more fully be apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments with accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention is configured as described above, and has an advantage of being able to provide a hermetic refrigerant compressor including a thrust bearing, the hermetic refrigerant compressor making it possible to achieve high efficiency without requiring special treatment on sliding surfaces and to avoid increase in the overall height without making the flange excessively thin.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic sectional view showing one example of the configuration of a hermetic refrigerant compressor according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a fragmentary sectional view of the hermetic refrigerant compressor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the view schematically showing one example of a distance L, a distance La, and a load applied to a main shaft slide part (a main shaft load) in the hermetic refrigerant compressor.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a fragmentary sectional view of the hermetic refrigerant compressor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the view schematically showing one configuration example of an essential part of a thrust bearing in the hermetic refrigerant compressor.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing one example of the configuration of a refrigerator-freezer including the hermetic refrigerant compressor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a graph showing one example of a relationship among the distance La, the main shaft load F, and the inclination angle of an eccentric shaft in the hermetic refrigerant compressor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is a graph showing one example of the molecular weight distribution of lubricating oil used in the hermetic refrigerant compressor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> is a graph showing one example of a relationship between the content of a high molecular weight component in the lubricating oil shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> and the coefficient of performance of the hermetic refrigerant compressor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a graph showing one example of a relationship between a rotation speed and compressor efficiency of the hermetic refrigerant compressor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A hermetic refrigerant compressor according to the present disclosure includes a sealed container in which lubricating oil is stored, the sealed container accommodating an electric element and a compression element, the compression element being driven by the electric element and configured to compress a refrigerant. The compression element includes: a crankshaft including a main shaft and an eccentric shaft; a cylinder block including a compression chamber; a piston that is inserted in the compression chamber in a reciprocable manner; a coupler that couples the piston and the eccentric shaft; a main bearing that pivotally supports the main shaft; and a thrust bearing provided on a thrust surface of the main bearing. One end of a sliding surface of the main bearing, the one end being closer to the compression chamber than an opposite end of the sliding surface, is a first end. The opposite end of the sliding surface is a second end. A distance between a center axis of the compression chamber and the second end of the sliding surface of the main bearing is a distance L. A distance between the center axis of the compression chamber and the first end of the sliding surface of the main bearing is a distance La. When the distance L is in a range of 38 mm to 51 mm, the distance La is less than or equal to 16 mm.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the above configuration, in the hermetic refrigerant compressor including the thrust bearing, when the distance L, which affects the overall height of the hermetic refrigerant compressor, is specified within a predetermined range, the upper limit of the distance La between the center axis of the compression chamber and the first end of the sliding surface of the main bearing is specified to 16 mm. This makes it possible to avoid increase in the overall height of the hermetic refrigerant compressor without making a flange excessively thin, the flange contributing to the stability of the eccentric shaft, and also makes it possible to reduce the load on the main shaft without subjecting sliding surfaces to special treatment. Consequently, the efficiency of the hermetic refrigerant compressor can be further heightened without increasing the overall height of the hermetic refrigerant compressor. In addition, since the flange is not made excessively thin, not only high efficiency but also favorable reliability of the hermetic refrigerant compressor can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above, the thrust bearing may include: a lower race positioned on the thrust surface; an upper race positioned facing the lower race; and a plurality of rolling elements that are arranged between the upper and lower races and that are rollably in contact with the upper and lower races. The rolling elements may be balls.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to the above configuration, even if the thrust bearing is a general ball bearing, increase in the overall height can be avoided, and also, without subjecting the sliding surfaces to special treatment, the load on the main shaft can be reduced and thereby high efficiency can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above, the lubricating oil may have a kinematic viscosity in a range of 1 mm<sup>2</sup>/S to 7 mm<sup>2</sup>/S at 40&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to the above configuration, the lubricating oil has a reduced viscosity. When the distance L is specified within the predetermined range, the distance La is specified to less than or equal to 16 mm. This setting makes it possible to reduce the load on the main shaft without making the flange thin and without subjecting the sliding surfaces to special treatment. Therefore, even though the lubricating oil that is used is low-viscosity oil, reduction of the wear resistance of a slide part formed by the main shaft and the main bearing (i.e., a main shaft slide part) can be effectively suppressed or avoided. Consequently, the efficiency of the hermetic refrigerant compressor can be further heightened without requiring special treatment on the sliding surfaces and without increasing the overall height of the hermetic refrigerant compressor.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above, the lubricating oil may have a mass average molecular weight in a range of 150 to 400, and may contain 0.5% by mass or more of a high molecular weight component. The high molecular weight component may have a mass molecular weight of greater than or equal to 500.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to the above configuration, the average molecular weight of the low-viscosity lubricating oil is within a predetermined range, and the lubricating oil contains the high molecular weight component whose molecular weight is relatively great. Accordingly, even though the lubricating oil is low-viscosity oil, a favorable oil film can be formed by the lubricating oil. This makes it possible to effectively suppress or avoid reduction in the wear resistance of the main shaft slide part. Consequently, the efficiency of the hermetic refrigerant compressor can be further heightened without requiring special treatment on the sliding surfaces and without increasing the overall height of the hermetic refrigerant compressor.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above, the lubricating oil may contain an oiliness agent.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to the above configuration, the low-viscosity lubricating oil contains the oiliness agent in addition to the high molecular weight component. By additionally containing the oiliness agent in the lubricating oil, the formation of the oil film by the lubricating oil can be further facilitated. Consequently, the friction at the main shaft slide part can be reduced more favorably.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above, the oiliness agent may be an ester-based compound.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to the above configuration, since the oiliness agent contained in the lubricating oil is an ester-based compound, the oiliness agent has an ester linkage. Accordingly, owing to the polarity derived from the ester linkage, the oil film formation performance of the oiliness agent can be improved. Consequently, the friction at the main shaft slide part can be reduced more favorably.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above, a distillation fraction of the lubricating oil at a distillation temperature of 300&#xb0; C. may be 0.1% or greater, and a distillation end point may be 440&#xb0; C. or higher.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to the above configuration, a component having a high distillation temperature is present in the low-viscosity lubricating oil containing the high molecular weight component. Accordingly, even though the temperature of the slide part increases due to reduction of the sliding area, the evaporation of the lubricating oil can be avoided or suppressed effectively. As a result, the oil film can be more stably formed by the lubricating oil. Consequently, the friction at the main shaft slide part can be reduced more favorably.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above, the lubricating oil may contain a sliding modifier such that a content of the sliding modifier in the lubricating oil in terms of an atomic weight of sulfur is greater than or equal to 100 ppm.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to the above configuration, a suitable amount of the sulfur-based sliding modifier is added to the low-viscosity lubricating oil containing the high molecular weight component.

Even in a state where the sliding area is reduced, the frictional coefficient of the shaft part can be reduced favorably. Consequently, the main shaft slide part has a low frictional coefficient and favorable wear resistance regardless of the operating speed.

In a case where the overall height is thus increased, the size of an engine room (machinery room) in a refrigerator-freezer in which the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> is installed needs to be increased, which results in reduction in the internal volume of the refrigerator-freezer. In consideration of this, in order to reduce the main shaft load F, it is conceivable to reduce the distance La without changing the distance L.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0092">However, a simple way that can be adopted to reduce the distance La is, for example, as described in Patent Literature 2 as prior art, to reduce the wall thickness of the support portion of the cylinder block <b>130</b>, or as described in Patent Literature 3, to reduce the thickness of the flange <b>128</b> to 4 mm or less.

As a result, deformation of the main bearing <b>134</b> tends to occur. In a case where the wall thickness of the flange <b>128</b> is reduced, the inclination of the eccentric shaft <b>122</b> increases. In particular, the conventional art does not take into consideration at all such increase in the inclination of the eccentric shaft <b>122</b> due to the reduction of the wall thickness of the flange <b>128</b>.

This makes it possible not only to achieve high efficiency of the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> while maintaining favorable quality (in particular, favorable reliability) of the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b>, but also to eliminate the necessity to increase the size of the engine room (machinery room) of the refrigerator-freezer.

In the present embodiment, the internal diameter (bore diameter) of the compression chamber <b>133</b> (bore) may be in the range of 22 mm to 28 mm. Setting the distance La such that the distance La is less than or equal to 16 mm when the distance L is in the range of 38 mm to 51 mm makes it possible not only to eliminate the necessity to make the flange <b>128</b> excessively thin, but also to keep the internal diameter of the compression chamber <b>133</b> within the aforementioned range.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0100">Based on the above equations (1) and (2), other than reducing the distance La, it is conceivable to reduce the frictional coefficient &#x3bc; between the main shaft <b>124</b> and the main bearing <b>134</b> in order to reduce the sliding loss W. A simple conceivable way to reduce the frictional coefficient &#x3bc; is, as described in Patent Literature 1, to use low-viscosity lubricating oil <b>180</b>. However, in a case where the lubricating oil <b>180</b> has a low viscosity, it is difficult to form, with the lubricating oil <b>180</b>, a sufficient oil film for lubrication. If a sufficient oil film for lubrication is not formed, there is a risk of wear or seizing of the main shaft <b>124</b> and the main bearing <b>134</b>. For this reason, in Patent Literature 1, the sliding surfaces are subjected to special treatment.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0101">In light of the above, the inventors of the present invention have conducted diligent studies, and as a result of the studies, they have found on their own that, as indicated by results of Examples 2 to 4 described below, by not only setting the distance La to less than or equal to 16 mm (i.e., reducing the main shaft load F), but also using the low-viscosity lubricating oil <b>180</b> containing a high molecular weight component, both efficiency and reliability of the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> can be further improved (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0105" num="0102">Specifically, in the case of adopting a technique of simply using low-viscosity lubricating oil <b>180</b>, wear or seizing of the main shaft <b>124</b> and the main bearing <b>134</b> cannot be effectively prevented or suppressed, and for this reason, it has been thought that using low-viscosity oil as the lubricating oil <b>180</b> is not suitable for securing the quality of the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0103">However, the inventors of the present invention have found on their own that since the main shaft load F can be reduced by setting the distance La of the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> to less than or equal to 16 mm as described above, the frictional coefficient &#x3bc; between the main shaft <b>124</b> and the main bearing <b>134</b> can be relatively reduced, accordingly, and for this reason, relatively low-viscosity oil can be used as the lubricating oil <b>180</b>. Further, it has also been found that by using low-viscosity oil containing a high molecular weight component as the lubricating oil <b>180</b>, a more favorable oil film can be formed, which makes it possible to further enhance the functional advantage of achieving both high efficiency and favorable reliability.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0104">In particular, while the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> is performing low-speed operation, the sliding environment for the main shaft slide part is severe, and if the lubricating oil <b>180</b> is low-viscosity oil, a favorable oil film is not easily formed by the lubricating oil <b>180</b>. In this respect, according to the present disclosure, the main shaft load F is reduced by setting the distance La to less than or equal to 16 mm. Therefore, even though the lubricating oil <b>180</b> is low-viscosity oil, a favorable oil film is easily formed by the lubricating oil <b>180</b> during low-speed operation.

Alternatively, an oil substance serving as the high molecular weight component may be added to the suitable lubricating oil, such that the suitable lubricating oil contains 0.5% by mass or more of the high molecular weight component. In the former case, for example, mineral oil may be used as the suitable lubricating oil. Unrefined or roughly refined raw material mineral oil may be refined to prepare (produce) the suitable lubricating oil.

In the present disclosure, these weights can be measured and expressed in terms of standard polystyrene by GPC (Gel Permeation Chromatography) technique that is used in Example 2 described below. That is, the mass average molecular weight (weight average molecular weight) of the suitable lubricating oil may be measured by GPC technique as a weight (mass) average molecular weight in terms of polystyrene. To determine whether or not the mass molecular weight of the high molecular weight component is greater than or equal to 500, a molecular weight distribution graph indicating a relationship between differential molar mass distribution and mass molecular weight may be measured by GPC technique.

As compared to a case where the suitable lubricating oil does not contain the high molecular weight component (0% by mass), the coefficient of performance is improved even in a case where the content of the high molecular weight component in the suitable lubricating oil is greater than 7.0% by mass. However, in a case where the content of the high molecular weight component in the suitable lubricating oil is greater than 7.0% by mass, it is possible that the coefficient of performance improving effect obtained in this case is unfavorably disproportionate to the content of the high molecular weight component.

In light of this, in the present embodiment, a preferable upper limit content of the high molecular weight component is less than or equal to 6.0% by mass. Still further, according to the Examples described below, in a case where the content of the high molecular weight component is about 2.0 to 2.5% by mass, the coefficient of performance exhibits its maximal value.

It should be noted that, depending on various conditions of the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> or various conditions of a shaft part to be lubricated, it is possible that the maximal value of the coefficient of performance is shifted to the high molecular weight component content decreasing side or to the high molecular weight component content increasing side.

Specifically, if the ratio of the high molecular weight component to the suitable lubricating oil is within any of the aforementioned preferable ranges, it can be assumed that, when looking at the suitable lubricating oil as a whole, the high molecular weight component barely affects increase in the mass average molecular weight (i.e., the mass average molecular weight of the suitable lubricating oil does not exceed 400). Thus, the upper limit content of the high molecular weight component in the suitable lubricating oil can be set within such a range as not to affect the functions of the suitable lubricating oil and not to cause excessive increase in the mass average molecular weight.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0125">In the present embodiment, the reason why the coefficient of performance of the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> is improved by containing the high molecular weight component in the suitable lubricating oil is, as the results in the below-described Examples 2 and 4 indicate (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), that even though the suitable lubricating oil has a low viscosity (the kinematic viscosity at 40&#xb0; C. is in the range of 1 mm<sup>2</sup>/S to 7 mm<sup>2</sup>/S), the suitable lubricating oil contributes to the formation of a favorable oil film at the slide part owing to the high molecular weight component. Specifically, while the main shaft <b>124</b> supported by the main bearing <b>134</b> is sliding, the high molecular weight component can be present on the outer peripheral surface (sliding surface) of the main shaft <b>124</b> and the inner peripheral surface (sliding surface) of the main bearing <b>134</b>, the outer and inner peripheral surfaces forming the main shaft slide part, regardless of the entire flow of the suitable lubricating oil at the main shaft slide part, and thereby the oil film is favorably formed by the suitable lubricating oil.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0126">In the present embodiment, only one oil substance may be used as the suitable lubricating oil, or a suitable combination of two or more oil substances may be used as the suitable lubricating oil. The definition of a combination of two or more oil substances herein includes not only a combination of, for example, two or more different oil substances, each of which is mineral oil, but also a combination of, for example, at least one oil substance that is mineral oil and at least one oil substance that is alkyl benzene oil (or at least one oil substance that is polyalkylene glycol oil).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0127">In a case where the suitable lubricating oil is prepared by adding the high molecular weight component as an additive component to the principal component, for example, one oil substance may be used as the principal component, and another oil substance different from the principal component may be used as the high molecular weight component. Alternatively, two or more oil substances may be used as the principal component, and one oil substance may be used as the high molecular weight component. Further alternatively, one oil substance may be used as the principal component, and two or more oil substances may be used as the high molecular weight component. Still further alternatively, two or more different oil substance mixtures, in each of which the high molecular weight component is added to the principal component, may be mixed together to prepare the suitable lubricating oil.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0128">The oil substances used in the present embodiment are not particularly limited. At least one oil substance from among mineral oil, alkyl benzene oil, and ester oil may be used as the principal component and/or the high molecular weight component. The suitable lubricating oil thus prepared makes it possible to favorably achieve, even in a state where the sliding area is reduced, the effect of reducing the frictional coefficient of the shaft part.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0129">The physical properties of the suitable lubricating oil (oil substance or lubricating oil composition) used in the present embodiment are not particularly limited except the aforementioned kinematic viscosity at 40&#xb0; C. Preferable physical properties of the suitable lubricating oil are, for example, such distillation properties that the distillation fraction of the suitable lubricating oil at a distillation temperature of 300&#xb0; C. is 0.1% or greater and the distillation end point is 440&#xb0; C. or higher. A method of measuring the distillation properties is not particularly limited. In the present embodiment, a measurement method in compliance with JIS K2254: 1998 &#x201c;Petroleum products-Determination of distillation characteristics&#x201d; or in compliance with JIS K2601: 1998 &#x201c;Testing methods for crude petroleum&#x201d; is used.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0130">At the slide part formed by the shaft part and bearing part, heat is generated due to friction between sliding surfaces upon sliding motion, and it is known that at an early stage of the friction, an instantaneous temperature rise called &#x201c;flash temperature&#x201d; occurs. The outer peripheral surface of the shaft part and the inner peripheral surface of the bearing part are configured as smooth sliding surfaces so as to achieve favorable slidability. However, even though the sliding surfaces are macroscopically smooth surfaces, there are microscopically fine protrusions on the sliding surfaces. During sliding motion, the fine protrusions of one sliding surface repeatedly adhere to and break away from the other sliding surface. When the fine protrusions of the one sliding surface break away from the other sliding surface, thermal energy is released, and when the released thermal energy concentrates, an instantaneous temperature rise occurs. A high temperature resulting from the instantaneous temperature rise is hereinafter called &#x201c;flash temperature&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0131">For example, Reference Literature 1: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Publication No. 2006-097096 discloses a carburized or carbonitrided bearing steel component. According to Reference Literature 1, generally speaking, seizing occurs when the flash temperature exceeds about 140&#xb0; C. It is also known that the flash temperature at the slide part reaches several hundred degrees Celsius. In the present embodiment, in the case of using the suitable lubricating oil, which is low-viscosity oil containing the high molecular weight component, a condition that the flash temperature at the slide part is 300&#xb0; C. or higher is important.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0132">Therefore, preferably, the distillation properties of the suitable lubricating oil (oil substance or lubricating oil composition) used in the present embodiment are such that the distillation fraction (volume fraction) of the suitable lubricating oil at a distillation temperature of 300&#xb0; C. is 0.1% or greater and the distillation end point is 440&#xb0; C. or higher. In a case where the suitable lubricating oil has these preferable distillation properties, even when the flash temperature of 300&#xb0; C. or higher occurs at the slide part, problems such as the evaporation of the oil film formed by the suitable lubricating oil can be suppressed or prevented effectively. Consequently, even though the suitable lubricating oil is low-viscosity oil containing the high molecular weight component and the temperature of the slide part increases due to the reduction of the sliding area, the oil film can be more stably formed by the suitable lubricating oil.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0133">The suitable lubricating oil used in the present embodiment may be a low-viscosity oil substance containing the high molecular weight component. Various additives may be added to the oil substance. In other words, the suitable lubricating oil used in the present embodiment may be a lubricating oil composition that contains not only the oil substance but also another component. As previously described, only one oil substance may be used as the suitable lubricating oil, or a combination of two or more oil substances may be used as the suitable lubricating oil. Also in the case of using a combination of two or more oil substances as the suitable lubricating oil, the suitable lubricating oil may be defined as a &#x201c;lubricating oil composition&#x201d;. Alternatively, in the case of using a combination of two or more oil substances as the suitable lubricating oil, the suitable lubricating oil may be defined as &#x201c;mixed oil&#x201d;, whereas in the case of containing not only the oil substance but also another component in the suitable lubricating oil, the suitable lubricating oil may be defined as a &#x201c;lubricating oil composition&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0134">In a case where the suitable lubricating oil used in the present embodiment is a lubricating oil composition that contains not only the oil substance but also another component, this other component is not particularly limited to a specific component. A typical example of the other component is an additive known in the field of general lubricating oil. In particular, in the present embodiment, the suitable lubricating oil preferably contains an oiliness agent. By adding the oiliness agent to the suitable lubricating oil, the formation of the oil film on the sliding surfaces of the slide part by the suitable lubricating oil is facilitated. Consequently, the friction at the slide part can be reduced more favorably.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0135">The oiliness agent is not particularly limited to a specific kind of oiliness agent. Typical examples of the oiliness agent include higher fatty acids, higher alcohols, esters (ester-based compounds), ethers, amines, amides, and metal soaps. Only one of these oiliness agents may be used, or two or more of these oiliness agents may be suitably used in combination. The addition amount(s) of the oiliness agent(s) is/are not particularly limited, and the oiliness agent(s) may be added in the range of, for example, 0.01 to 1% by weight.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0136">In the present embodiment, a more preferable example of the oiliness agent is an ester-based compound. The ester-based compound may be a compound having an ester structure in which an alcohol and a carboxylic acid are reacted with each other. The alcohol may be a monohydric alcohol, or may be a polyhydric alcohol, which is at least bivalent. Similarly, the carboxylic acid may be a monocarboxylic acid, a dicarboxylic acid, or a tricarboxylic acid (or may be a carboxylic acid containing four or more carboxyl groups). Generally speaking, a commercially available ester-based oiliness agent can be suitably used.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0137">As previously described, the suitable lubricating oil used in the present embodiment is low-viscosity oil containing the high molecular weight component. In a case where the suitable lubricating oil is a lubricating oil composition containing the oiliness agent, the oil film formation performance can be further improved. As previously described, since the suitable lubricating oil used in the present embodiment contains the high molecular weight component, the high molecular weight component is present on the sliding surfaces of the main shaft <b>124</b> and the main bearing <b>134</b>, the sliding surfaces forming a slide part, and consequently, the oil film can be favorably formed by the suitable lubricating oil. Further, by containing the oiliness agent in the suitable lubricating oil, the oiliness agent adheres to the sliding surfaces of the main shaft <b>124</b> and the main bearing <b>134</b>, and thereby the formation of the oil film by the suitable lubricating oil (lubricating oil composition) is further facilitated.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0138">In particular, in a case where the oiliness agent is an ester-based compound, the oiliness agent has an ester linkage. Accordingly, owing to the polarity derived from the ester linkage, the adhesion of the oil film formed by the suitable lubricating oil (lubricating oil composition) to the slide part can be further facilitated (i.e., the adhesiveness of the oil film can be further improved), which makes it possible to further improve the oil film formation performance of the suitable lubricating oil. Therefore, the frictional coefficient can be further reduced, and the friction at the slide part can be reduced more favorably.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0139">The suitable lubricating oil used in the present embodiment may contain, as additives, not only the above-described oiliness agent but also a sulfur-based sliding modifier. The sulfur-based sliding modifier may be a sulfur-based sliding modifier that allows the material of the shaft part such as the main shaft <b>124</b> (i.e., shaft part material) and sulfur to react with each other. Accordingly, the sliding modifier may be sulfur, or may be a sulfur compound that contains sulfur and that is reactive with the shaft part material.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0140">In the present embodiment, since the material of the shaft part is a ferrous material, examples of sulfur compounds usable as the sliding modifier include sulfurized olefins, sulfide-based compounds (e.g., dibenzyl disulfide (DBDS)), xanthates, thiadiazoles, thiocarbonates, sulfurized oil or fat, sulfurized esters, dithiocarbamates, and sulfurized terpenes.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0141">The content of the sulfur-based sliding modifier in the suitable lubricating oil is not particularly limited. Preferably, the sliding modifier may be added to the suitable lubricating oil, such that the content of the sliding modifier in the suitable lubricating oil in terms of the atomic weight of sulfur is greater than or equal to 100 ppm. It should be noted that the upper limit addition amount of the sliding modifier is not particularly limited, so long as the upper limit addition amount is such an amount (e.g., 1000 ppm or less) as not to affect the physical properties of the suitable lubricating oil (lubricating oil composition).</p><p id="p-0145" num="0142">As previously described, the suitable lubricating oil used in the present embodiment is low-viscosity oil containing the high molecular weight component. In a case where the suitable lubricating oil is a lubricating oil composition containing the sliding modifier in addition to the oiliness agent, the wear resistance of the sliding surfaces can be improved by the sliding modifier. Accordingly, even in a state where the sliding area is reduced, the friction at the slide part can be reduced more favorably.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0143">The suitable lubricating oil used in the present embodiment may contain, as additives, not only the above-described oiliness agent and sliding modifier but also a known extreme-pressure additive. A specific extreme-pressure additive to be added to the suitable lubricating oil is not particularly limited, and a known extreme-pressure additive can be suitably used. Examples of known extreme-pressure additives that can be suitably used include phosphorus-based compounds, such as phosphate esters, and halogenated compounds, such as chlorine-based hydrocarbons or fluorine-based hydrocarbons. Only one of these extreme-pressure additives may be added to the lubricating oil composition (suitable lubricating oil), or a suitable combination of two or more of these extreme-pressure additives may be added to the lubricating oil composition (suitable lubricating oil).</p><p id="p-0147" num="0144">Among these extreme-pressure additives, a phosphorus-based compound can be used preferably. Typical examples of the phosphorus-based compound include tricresyl phosphate (TCP), tributyl phosphate (TBP), and triphenyl phosphate (TPP). Among these, TCP is particularly preferable. In addition to the sulfur-based sliding modifier, a phosphorus-based extreme-pressure additive may be added to the suitable lubricating oil, and thereby, for example, wear of the main shaft slide part can be reduced favorably.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0145">The amount of the extreme-pressure additive to be added to the lubricating oil composition is not particularly limited. For example, in a case where the principal component of the suitable lubricating oil is a low-polarity substance such as mineral oil or alkyl benzene oil, a suitable addition amount of the extreme-pressure additive is in the range of 0.5 to 8.0% by weight, and more preferably in the range of 1 to 3% by weight.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0146">As previously described, the suitable lubricating oil used in the present embodiment is low-viscosity oil containing the high molecular weight component. In a case where the suitable lubricating oil is a lubricating oil composition containing the extreme-pressure additive in addition to the oiliness agent, the wear resistance of the sliding surfaces can be improved by the extreme-pressure additive. In particular, by containing both the sliding modifier and the extreme-pressure additive in the suitable lubricating oil, wear of the sliding surfaces can be reduced more favorably by their synergistic effect. Accordingly, even in a state where the sliding area is reduced, the friction at the slide part can be reduced more favorably.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0147">Further, in the present embodiment, known various additives may be added to the suitable lubricating oil in addition to the oiliness agent, the sliding modifier, and the extreme-pressure additive. Those known in the field of general lubricating oil can be suitably used as the various additives to be added to the suitable lubricating oil. Typical examples of such additives include antioxidants, acid-acceptors, metal deactivators, defoaming agents, anti-corrosive agents, and dispersants.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0148">In other words, the suitable lubricating oil used in the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment may be a low-viscosity oil substance containing a high molecular weight component (the low-viscosity oil substance may be formed by only one oil substance, or may be mixed oil containing two or more oil substances). Preferably, the suitable lubricating oil may be a lubricating oil composition (formed by an oil substance and an oiliness agent) that is prepared by adding the oiliness agent to the oil substance. As another preferable example, the lubricating oil composition may contain, as the additive(s), a sliding modifier and/or an extreme-pressure additive.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0149">As described above, in the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> according to the present disclosure, the compression element <b>106</b> extends in the vertical direction, and includes the crankshaft <b>120</b> including the main shaft <b>124</b> and the eccentric shaft <b>122</b>.
