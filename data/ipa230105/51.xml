Each suffers one or more weaknesses including specifically but not exclusively the need for significant training, time and labor intensive, limited to use with only one of wet or dry conditions, effective only with select pet species, expense, etc. A substantial need exists for a pet grooming and conditioning appliance capable of facilitating care and cleaning of a pet's fur, coat, hair and skin that does not suffer these weaknesses.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is an animal grooming and conditioning of fur, coat, hair, and skin system that support a person in the general care and cleaning of various types of animals. The grooming and conditioning system is driven in a rotating manner by a power source such as a drill or other such device that rotates the drum. Attached to the drum are columns of flexible material that when placed against an animal's fur or coat aids in the removal of excess fur, hair, dirt &#x26; debris, and dead skin &#x26; dander. The flexible columns are not unlike teeth in a comb or brush in that they extend upward from a matting material that holds them in an upright fashion. Unlike a comb or brush, these flexible columns are wider in diameter, or variable height or width or number attached to the matting material. The flexible columns can also have variable levels of flexibility to alter the degree to which an animal's fur is conditioned.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The pet grooming and skin care appliance is adapted for use in combination with a hand held power tool. The appliance includes a drum secured to a rigid arbor. The drum defines an axis of rotation and has an array of flexible and resilient fingers that extend radially outward from the axis of rotation. The arbor extends coaxially away from a proximal end of the drum. The arbor is configured and arranged for operable engagement to a power tool for rotation of the arbor and the drum about the axis of rotation by a powered drive shaft on the power tool.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The pet grooming and skin care appliance can be manufactured by (i) obtaining an attachment configured and arranged for rotational engagement with a chuck on a power drill, the attachment comprising an arbor with a cylinder mounted to a distal axial end of the arbor, wherein the cylinder has a cylindrical sidewall and defines an axis of rotation, (ii) obtaining a flexible and resilient integrally molded element comprising a sheet having first and second ends, first and second side edges, and first and second major surfaces with an array of fingers projecting from the second major surface of the sheet, and (iii) securing the element to the sidewall of the cylinder with the first major surface facing the cylinder and the fingers projecting radially outward from the axis of rotation defined by the cylinder.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The pet grooming and skin care appliance can be used by (i) securing the arbor to a power tool for powered rotation of the appliance about the axis of rotation by the power tool, (ii) activating the power tool so as to effect rotation of the appliance about the axis of rotation by the power tool whereby the fingers on the appliance spin, and (iii) grooming a pet by stroking the coat of the pet with the spinning fingers.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The pet grooming and skin care appliance can include the following nonexclusive features.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Feature 1: Variable Flexible Column Sizes. The appliance can include flexible columns, not unlike teeth in a comb or large brush. These columns extend vertically from a matting material so they protrude upward. The columns are made out of flexible material such as rubber, soft, or flexible material that bend sideways when pressure is applied.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Feature 2: Variable Drum and Matting Material Sizes. The appliance can include flexible columns that are embedded in a matting material to form one solid piece. This matting material with flexible columns can be a variety of widths and lengths. Small animal grooming and conditioning systems will be an inch or so wide and a few inches long. Large animal grooming and conditioning systems can be six or more inches wide and over ten inches long.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Feature 3: Variable Attachment Options. The appliance can include attachment options to mount the rotating drum to a power source. The attachments can include cylinder or slightly squared metal attachment bars that connect to the front of a drill for example. Other attachment options may connect to the housing of the drill or other power source in a matter to provide better stability and control of fur, debris, or materials removed from the animals being conditioned.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Feature 4: Variable Animal Usage. The appliance can be used on a variety of animals such as cats, small, medium, and large dogs, horses, cows, and other such animals or livestock that has fur or hair that is commonly conditioned by washing, combing, or other such maintenance.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Feature 5: Power-Driven Drum Rotation. The appliance can be used with a power source such as a handheld, cordless, or power drill. This is the common power source but the driver to rotate the drum could be any number of small engines that are able to rotate the attachment bar.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Feature 6: One or Two Hand Systems. The appliance can be used with one or two-hand applications. The one hand application is most commonly used for smaller animals where the matting material and flexible columns is small enough to fit on a smaller power source such as a drill. With the larger animal grooming and conditioning systems for use on horses, cattle, or larger animals, the two-handed system provides more stability and support. The two-handed system can provide a handle extending from each side of the system with a power source rotating the drum in the center section between the handles.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Feature 7: Vacuum or Other Suction Adapters. The appliance can be used with a variety of adapters to aid in vacuuming up fur, hair, and other debris. This adapter has a special housing around the matting materials and flexible columns to create a fully enclosed system. The suction adapter then connects to a vacuum or other piece of equipment that provides flow of air away from the conditioning system.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Feature 8: Water or Other Cleaning Product Adapters. The appliance can be used with a variety of adapters to aid in the wetting, washing, and application of cleaners or other related products. The invention can be fitted with a hose not unlike a garden hose or other such pipe as to allow water to flow into the chamber containing the rotating drum. This flow of moisture when combined with a cleaning material will wash, condition, and remove fur, hair, or other debris in one easy application.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a proximal end perspective view of one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a distal end perspective view of the invention depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a distal end perspective view of the core component of the invention depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a bottom perspective view of the molded element component of the invention depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> prior to bending of the element into a cylinder and interlocking the abutting ends.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a top perspective view of the molded element component of the invention depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> prior to bending of the element into a cylinder and interlocking the abutting ends.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a side elevation view of the invention depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> rotationally attached to a power drill.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a front perspective view of the invention depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> including an embodiment of an enclosure, attached to a power drill.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a bottom plan view of the invention depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As utilized herein, including the claims, the term &#x201c;chuck&#x201d; refers to any type of clamp used to secure an appliance to a power drill for powered rotation of the appliance, including specifically but not exclusively keyed chucks, keyless chucks and quick connect chucks.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As utilized herein, including the claims, the term &#x201c;pet&#x201d; refers to any domesticated animal kept for pleasure or show rather than utility and includes specifically but not exclusively companion animals such as dogs, cats and horses and show animals for display or performance such as horses, rabbits, goats, dairy cows, koalas, etc.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Nomenclature Table</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="161pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Ref.
