It is estimated that since 2013, in the Puglia region in southern Italy, the bacterium <i>Xylella fastidiosa </i>has infected about 6.5% of monitored olive plants, causing huge environmental and economic impact for farmers, as well as a dramatic drop in oil production of the region.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003"><i>X. fastidiosa </i>has been recognized as a quarantine pathogen capable of causing serious phytosanitary pandemics in the territories in which it is established and has therefore been included in the A1 list of the European and Mediterranean plant protection organization EPPO, directive 2000/29/EC.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This bacterium, particularly dangerous in the agricultural sector, belongs to the Xanthomonadaceae family and is characterized by high genetic and phenotypic variability. In fact, four subspecies of <i>Xylella </i>are known, which are able to infect about 150 different types of plants.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the attack mechanism is similar for all varieties of the bacterium, in fact the <i>Xylella</i>, not being a sporogenic bacterium, is transmitted through insect vectors, in particular those of the family of Cicadellidae, which feed on sucking from the lymphatic vessels of plants. These insects, feeding on an infected plant, then transmit the bacterium to a healthy plant. Once transmitted to the healthy host plant, the bacterium multiplies in the xylem vessels, whose function is to lead the raw sap rich in nutrients from the roots to the stem and leaves. Bacterial multiplication continues until these vessels are blocked through the creation of a sort of gel that prevents the regular flow of raw sap. After this colonization, in the plant a series of biological alterations develop which can determine even the death of the plant itself.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Among the diseases caused by <i>X. fastidiosa </i>the &#x201c;Pierce's disease&#x201d; stand out, which can be destructive on the grapevine, the variegated chlorosis of citrus fruits and the complex of the rapid dessiccation of the olive plant. Equally serious diseases may affect also almond, apple, pear, oleander and various species of forest essences and ornamental plants.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The typical and most frequent symptoms of these diseases include the burning of the leaves, the reduced growth and the desiccation of the branches and shoots.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although this bacterium has been known for over a century, there is still no effective therapy for treating sick plants.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To date, there is a sort of containment of the infection in the environment through essentially two practices.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Not being able to act on the bacterium itself, the first practice is based on trying to hit the vector, i.e. the insects that spread the bacterium, through insecticidal treatments and cutting often the grass, to eliminate larvae and insects that are still young.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, the drawbacks associated with the use of insecticides which at high doses, can cause significant damage also in humans, are well known, such as for example dizziness, headache, nausea, muscle spasms, convulsions, respiratory difficulties, rashes, endocrine disruption, reproductive problems, learning disabilities, etc.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, although the use of insecticidal products leads to a reduction in the spread of the bacterium, it is still necessary to use the second practice in combination in order to contain the propagation of the microorganism.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">This second practice consists in the reduction of the bacterium reservoir by felling the infected plants.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The tree felling, however, involves huge losses both from the environmental point of view for the eradication of plants, especially the olive plants, which for the most part are secular plants, and from the point of view of the oil supply, because the number of olives to be squeezed decreases.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Not least, especially from the farmers point of view, the tree felling causes huge losses at the economic level both for the lack of production and sale of oil and for the time required between the cultivation of a new olive plant and the time when it reaches the production regime.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention aims to overcome the limitations and drawbacks of the treatments for the eradication of <i>X. fastidiosa</i>, indicated above.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The purpose of the invention is to provide a treatment of <i>Xylella fastidiosa </i>infections in plants, particularly in olive plants, that overcomes the drawbacks of the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The above purpose was achieved by an organometallic coordination complex.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The invention therefore concerns the use of an organometallic coordination

preferred and advantageous embodiment of the invention, the transition metal is selected from Cu, Zn and Ni, more preferably Cu.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0021">Advantageously, the ligand L is 5-hydroxy-naphthalene-1,4-dione.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0022">In a more preferred embodiment, the organometallic complex of the invention has therefore general formula (I)</p><p id="p-0027"

img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0028" num="0023">Therefore, the aforementioned purposes are achieved by the use of a coordination complex of general formula (I) as a phytosanitary agent.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0024">By definition, an organometallic coordination complex is a compound commonly formed by an ion of a positively charged transition metal that is coordinated to neutral organic molecules or negatively charged ions, called ligands.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0025">The inventors have also found that the ligand L of formula (VII) or a phytopharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof was able to act alone as a phytosanitary agent against <i>X. fastidiosa. </i></p><p id="p-0031" num="0026">Therefore, in another aspect the invention relates to the use of a

invention applied on an infected plant is absorbable by the plant and can reach the xylem vessels of the same where it fulfils its phytopharmaceutical function.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0028">Without being bound by any theory, the inventors believe that the ligand L of formula (VII) alone and complexed with a transition metal is able to be absorbed and allow phytopharmaceutical action on plants against bacteria, in particular <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>, in an unexpected and surprising way.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0029">This ability to be absorbed by the plant, in fact, makes the aforementioned compound (VII), alone or complexed, particularly suitable especially for the use in the treatment of plants infected with <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>, preferably in olive plants infected by this bacterium.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0030">The invention also concerns a phytosanitary composition for treating plant bacterial infections.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0031">Therefore, in a further aspect the invention concerns a phytopharmaceutical composition comprising the organometallic coordination complex or its phytopharmaceutically acceptable salt as defined above and the compound of formula (VII) or its phytopharmaceutically acceptable salt.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0032">This composition is therefore useful for treating <i>Xylella fastidiosa </i>in plants, preferably olive plants.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"
