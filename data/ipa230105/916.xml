relates to an acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitor for use in the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a subject.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Hepatitis B virus infects an estimated 260 million people worldwide, causing around 780,000 deaths a year. A complication of chronic HBV (CHB) infection is the development of HBV-associated (also termed HBV-related) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is the second leading cause of cancer related death with a rising incidence and an ongoing high mortality, with less than 20% of patients responding to current immunotherapies. There is thus a pressing need for novel therapies or novel therapy combinations for the treatment of HBV infection.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Existing treatments very rarely achieve sustained off-treatment viral suppression because they cannot eliminate the cccDNA transcriptional template (episomal form of HBV) or recover the profound immune exhaustion associated with HBV infection. Because of the inadequacy of currently available treatment for HBV, many diagnosed patients are monitored without treatment for years, creating an ongoing pool of highly infectious, stigmatised individuals.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A primary goal of the current drug development in the field is to induce a state of &#x201c;functional cure&#x201d; of HBV where residual viral replicative intermediates within infected hepatocytes are kept under tight long-term immune control, as seen in adults resolving the infection spontaneously. Functional cure would ideally be characterised by sustained off-treatment viral suppression, HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) loss&#x2014;with or without anti-HBs antibody seroconversion&#x2014;and more effective reduction in the risk of HCC.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The current best available treatments of CHB are nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NAs or NUCs), such as Tenofovir or Entecavir, that suppress viraemia effectively with a high barrier to resistance, and are well-tolerated. Other less effective NAs such as Lamivudine, Telbivudine and Adefovir (with much higher risks of resistance development) are still used in some countries, for cost considerations. However even the latest generation of NAs (Tenofovir, Tenofovir alafenamine or Entecavir) rarely induce sustained off-treatment responses as they cannot target the episomal form of HBV (cccDNA) to reduce HBsAg, do not have immunomodulatory capacity and can only partially reduce, but not prevent, the risk of subsequent HCC. Treatment with NAs is currently typically therefore lifelong, with resultant issues of compliance, cost, stigma of ongoing transmission risk, potential emergence of resistance and/or toxicity.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An alternative or additional therapy is pegylated interferon-alpha, given as a finite (typically 1 year) course, which can lead to a durable off-treatment response with HBsAg loss in approximately 10% of patients. Its capacity to induce cure in a proportion of patients has been attributed to its combined direct antiviral and immunomodulatory potential. However, it is rarely used due to poor tolerability and limited, genotype-dependent, response rates.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is thus a need for alternative strategies for therapies or combination therapies to treat HBV and HBV-associated HCC. In particular, there is a need for therapies which enable sustained off-treatment viral suppression.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present inventors have surprisingly found that acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibition is efficacious in the treatment of HBV infection. Unexpectedly, ACAT inhibition has the potential to target both the hepatitis B virus itself and the host immune response against it. Therefore, ACAT inhibition has the potential to target HBV in multiple ways and thus the potential to enable sustained off-treatment viral suppression.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides an ACAT inhibitor for use in the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a subject.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention further provides a method of treating HBV infection in a subject which comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of an ACAT inhibitor to the subject.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention also relates to the use of an ACAT inhibitor in the preparation of a medicament for treating HBV infection in a subject.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a further aspect, the present invention provides an ACAT inhibitor for use in the treatment or prevention of HBV infection in a subject, wherein the infection is caused by HBV genotype C.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention further provides a method of treating HBV infection in a subject which comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of an ACAT inhibitor to the subject, wherein the infection is caused by HBV genotype C.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The invention also relates to the use of an ACAT inhibitor in the preparation of a medicament for treating HBV infection in a subject, wherein the infection is caused by HBV genotype C.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The ACAT inhibitor may be administered to the subject in combination with at least one further pharmaceutically active agent.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect, the present invention provides a therapeutic vaccine composition comprising an ACAT inhibitor for use in the treatment or prevention of HBV infection in a subject.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention further provides a method of treating a HBV infection in a subject which comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic vaccine composition comprising an ACAT inhibitor to the subject.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The invention also relates to the use of an ACAT inhibitor in the preparation of a therapeutic vaccine composition for treating HBV infection in a subject.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a further aspect, the present invention provides a therapeutic HBV vaccine composition comprising an ACAT inhibitor.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a further aspect, the present invention provides a TCR-gene-engineered cell or CAR cell having reduced ACAT activity and/or reduced ACAT expression for use in the treatment of HBV infection in a subject.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention further provides a method of treating HBV infection in a subject which comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of TCR-gene-engineered cell or CAR cell having reduced ACAT activity and/or reduced ACAT expression to the subject.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The subject to be treated in the present invention may have a chronic HBV infection (CHB) and/or be at risk of developing HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), have HBV-associated HCC or have previously had HBV-associated HCC.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>: A) Schematic representation of the cell treatment.

In addition, ACAT activity can for example be measured by the rate of [3H]cholesteryl oleate synthesis (e.g. Guo, JBC 2005; Chang, Biochemistry 1986) and measurement of the cholesterol/cholesteryl ester ratio (colorimetric or fluorometric methods).

Post-transcriptional gene silencing mediated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a conserved cellular defence mechanism for controlling the expression of foreign genes. It is thought that the random integration of elements such as transposons or viruses causes the expression of dsRNA which activates sequence-specific degradation of homologous single-stranded mRNA or viral genomic RNA. The silencing effect is known as RNA interference (RNAi) (Ralph et al. (2005) Nat. Medicine 11: 429-433). The mechanism of RNAi involves the processing of long dsRNAs into duplexes of about 21-25 nucleotide (nt) RNAs. These products are called small interfering or silencing RNAs (siRNAs) which are the sequence-specific mediators of mRNA degradation. In differentiated mammalian cells, dsRNA &#x3e;30 bp has been found to activate the interferon response leading to shut-down of protein synthesis and non-specific mRNA degradation (Stark et al. (1998) Ann. Rev. Biochem. 67: 227-64). However, this response can be bypassed by using 21 nt siRNA duplexes (Elbashir et al. (2001) EMBO J. 20: 6877-88; Hutvagner et al. (2001) Science 293: 834-8) allowing gene function to be analysed in cultured mammalian cells.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0071">shRNAs consist of short inverted RNA repeats separated by a small loop sequence. These are rapidly processed by the cellular machinery into 19-22 nt siRNAs, thereby suppressing the target gene expression.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0072">Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are small (22-25 nucleotides in length) noncoding RNAs that can effectively reduce the translation of target mRNAs by binding to their 3&#x2032; untranslated region</p><p id="p-0071" num="0073">(UTR). Micro-RNAs are a very large group of small RNAs produced naturally in organisms, at least some of which regulate the expression of target genes. Founding members of the micro-RNA family are let-7 and lin-4. The let-7 gene encodes a small, highly conserved RNA species that regulates the expression of endogenous protein-coding genes during worm development. The active RNA species is transcribed initially as an &#x2dc;70 nt precursor, which is post-transcriptionally processed into a mature &#x2dc;21 nt form. Both let-7 and lin-4 are transcribed as hairpin RNA precursors which are processed to their mature forms by Dicer enzyme.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0074">The antisense concept is to selectively bind short, possibly modified, DNA or RNA molecules to messenger RNA in cells and prevent the synthesis of the encoded protein.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0075">Methods for the design of siRNAs, shRNAs, miRNAs and antisense DNAs/RNAs to modulate the expression of a target protein, and methods for the delivery of these agents to a cell of interest are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0076">The ACAT inhibitor may be an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0077">Suitably antibodies include, but are not limited to, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, engineered antibodies including chimeric, CDR-grafted and humanised antibodies, and artificially selected antibodies produced using phage display or alternative techniques.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0078">Suitably the antibody is a monoclonal antibody.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0079">Suitable antibody fragments capable of binding to a selected target, include Fv, ScFv, F(ab&#x2032;) and F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>.

For example, the ACAT inhibitor may directly reduce (i) HBV target cell entry, (ii) HBV genome replication, (iii) HBV viral capsid formation, (iv) HBV sAg assembly and/or (v) HBV virion and/or subviral particle release. Direct antiviral activity may be assessed using methods known in the art. For example, a cell line (e.g. HepG2-NTCP cells or primary human hepatocytes) may be infected with HBV and treated with the ACAT inhibitor (see e.g. present Example 6). Direct antiviral activity may be determined by a reduction of extracellular HBV DNA compared to a control experiment which has not been treated with the ACAT inhibitor. If the ACAT inhibitor can either reduce cccDNA and/or block HBsAg assembly/release, it may additionally reduce production/release of HBsAg.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0083">Suitably, a direct antiviral activity may refer to an ability of the ACAT inhibitor to directly reduce HBV sAg assembly and/or directly reduce HBV virion and/or subviral particle release.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0084">Enhanced humoral immunity to HBV may refer to an ability of the ACAT inhibitor to augment or increase the activity or function of components of a humoral immune response to HBV. Humoral immunity generally refers to an immune response that is mediated by macromolecules found in extracellular fluids such as secreted antibodies and complement proteins. In the context of the present invention, humoral immunity refers to an antibody-mediated immune response. Components of the immune system involved in promoting an antibody-mediated immune response against HBV include, but are not limited to, B-cells and CD4+ T cells, such as CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>FH </sub>cells.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0085">Accordingly, the ACAT inhibitor for use in the present invention may enhance the activity of B cells and/or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Suitably, enhancing B cell activity enhances humoral immunity to HBV. This activity may be particularly advantageous, for example, when the ACAT inhibitor is administered as part of&#x2014;or in combination with&#x2014;a therapeutic vaccine as described herein.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0086">The activity of B cells may be determined using methods which are known in the art. For example, B cell activity may be assessed by determining calcium mobilisation in B cells following B-cell receptor engagement (see e.g. present Example 4). Enhancement of B cell activity may be determined by an increase in calcium mobilisation in B cells compared to a control experiment which has not been treated with the ACAT inhibitor. An alternative readout for B cell signalling is phosphoflow for downstream signalling molecules. The activity of B cells is more commonly measured by determining antibody (e.g. IgG or IgM) production following differentiation into plasma cells using ELISPOT or ELISA assays; enhancement of plasma cell antibody production may thus be measured upon addition of an ACAT inhibitor. Alternatively, enhancement of B cell activity may be determined by an increase in production of effector cytokines with anti-HBV activity (e.g. percentage of IFN&#x3b3; or IL-6 positive cells) as determined by flow cytometry or amount of effector cytokine mRNA or protein as determined by qPCR, ELISA or ELISPOT, respectively) compared to a control experiment which has not been treated with the ACAT inhibitor. B cell activity may also be assessed by determining expansion or activation or reduction in exhaustion of global or memory or HBs-Ag-specific B cells following treatment with an ACAT inhibitor using methods which are known in the art.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0087">For example, calcium mobilisation in B-cells treated with an ACAT inhibitor may be increased by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75% or at least 100% compared to control cells which have not been treated with the ACAT inhibitor.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0088">The activity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells may be determined using methods which are known in the art. For example, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activity may be assessed by determining effector cytokine production (i.e. IFN&#x3b3;, IL-21 or IL-4) following treatment with the ACAT inhibitor (see e.g. present Example 1). Enhancement of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activity may be determined by an increase in effector cytokine (e.g. percentage of effector cytokine positive cells as determined by flow cytometry or amount of effector cytokine mRNA or protein as determined by qPCR, ELISA or ELISPOT, respectively) compared to a control experiment which has not been treated with the ACAT inhibitor.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0089">For example, levels of effector cytokine in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell treated with an ACAT inhibitor may be increased by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75% or at least 100% compared to control cells which have not been treated with the ACAT inhibitor.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0090">Suitably, the CD4+ T cell may be a CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>FH </sub>cell. A CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>FH </sub>cell may be a CD3+CD4+CXCR5+PD-1+ cell. The activity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>FH </sub>cells may be assessed by determining, for example, the expression/production of CD4OL, 4-1BB, ICOS, OX40, IL-21 and/or IL-4. Expression of CD40-L and OX40 in particular can be used to delineate antigen-activated cells.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0091">The ACAT inhibitor for use according to the present invention may: a) exhibit direct antiviral activity against HBV; b) enhance humoral immunity to HBV; and c) enhance T cell immunity to HBV.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0092">Suitably, enhanced T cell immunity to HBV may refer to CD8+ T cell activity. The activity of CD8+ T cells may be determined using methods which are known in the art. For example, CD8+ T cell activity may be assessed by determining effector cytokine production (e.g. IFN&#x3b3;/TNF/IL-2) or cytotoxicity (measured by flow cytometric evaluation of CD107a expression as a marker of degranulation and/or expression of cytotoxic mediators perforin, granzyme, and/or by quantification of specific target cell lysis by e.g. ToxiLight Cytotoxicity Assay), upon stimulation with viral or HCC peptides or mitogens, following treatment with the ACAT inhibitor (see e.g. present Example 1 and Example 5). Enhancement of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activity may be determined by an increase in effector function (e.g. percentage of effector cytokine or degranulating or cytotoxic mediator positive cells as determined by flow cytometry or amount of effector cytokine mRNA or protein as determined by qPCR or ELISPOT, respectively) compared to a control experiment which has not been treated with the ACAT inhibitor.

In the context of the present invention, the cell is suitably redirected to an HLA and HBV-peptide complex of interest. TCR-gene-engineered cells and anti-HBV T cells are described in art, for example see Gehring et al. (J Hepatol. 2011 Jul;55(1):103-10); Qasim et al. (J Hepatol. 2015 Feb;62(2):486-91) and Tan et al.

The subject is suitably the same subject with HBV infection who is to be treated according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0118">Soluble T cell receptors (sTCR) typically comprise the variable domain and at least part of the TCR constant domain but lack the transmembrane domain and intracellular, cytoplasmic domain. Suitably, the sTCR does not comprise a transmembrane domain. Suitably, the sTCR is not anchored on the surface of cell. In the context of the present invention, the sTCR is directed to a HBV target antigen of interest.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0119">A classical CAR is a chimeric type I trans-membrane protein which connects an extracellular antigen-recognizing domain (binder) to an intracellular signalling domain (endodomain). The binder is typically a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from a monoclonal antibody (mAb), but it can be based on other formats which comprise an antibody-like antigen binding site. A spacer domain is usually necessary to isolate the binder from the membrane and to allow it a suitable orientation. A common spacer domain used is the Fc of IgG1. More compact spacers can suffice e.g. the stalk from CD8a and even just the IgG1 hinge alone, depending on the antigen. A trans-membrane domain anchors the protein in the cell membrane and connects the spacer to the endodomain.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0120">When the CAR binds the target-antigen, this results in the transmission of an activating signal to the T-cell it is expressed on. Thus the CAR directs the specificity and cytotoxicity of the T cell towards cells expressing the targeted antigen.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0121">CARs typically therefore comprise: (i) an antigen-binding domain; (ii) a spacer; (iii) a transmembrane domain; and (iii) an intracellular domain which comprises or associates with a signalling domain.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0122">The antigen binding domain is the portion of the CAR which recognizes antigen. Numerous antigen-binding domains are known in the art, including those based on the antigen binding site of an antibody, antibody mimetics, and T-cell receptors. For example, the antigen-binding domain may comprise: a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from a monoclonal antibody; a natural ligand of the target antigen; a peptide with sufficient affinity for the target; a single domain antibody; an artificial single binder such as a Darpin (designed ankyrin repeat protein); or a single-chain derived from a T-cell receptor.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0123">The antigen binding domain may comprise a domain which is not based on the antigen binding site of an antibody. For example, the antigen binding domain may comprise a domain based on a protein/peptide which is a soluble ligand for a tumour cell surface receptor (e.g. a soluble peptide such as a cytokine or a chemokine); or an extracellular domain of a membrane anchored ligand or a receptor for which the binding pair counterpart is expressed on the tumour cell. The antigen binding domain may be based on a natural ligand of the antigen.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0124">The antigen binding domain may comprise an affinity peptide from a combinatorial library or a de novo designed affinity protein/peptide.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0125">CARs comprise a spacer sequence to connect the antigen-binding domain with the transmembrane domain and spatially separate the antigen-binding domain from the endodomain. A flexible spacer allows the antigen-binding domain to orient in different directions to facilitate binding.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0126">The transmembrane domain is the portion of the CAR which spans the membrane. The transmembrane domain may be any protein structure which is thermodynamically stable in a membrane. This is typically an alpha helix comprising of several hydrophobic residues. The transmembrane domain of any transmembrane protein can be used to supply the transmembrane portion of the CAR. The presence and span of a transmembrane domain of a protein can be determined by those skilled in the art using the TMHMM algorithm (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/). Alternatively, an artificially designed TM domain may be used.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0127">The transmembrane domain may be derived from CD28, which gives good receptor stability.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0128">The endodomain is the signal-transmission portion of the CAR. It may be part of or associate with the intracellular domain of the CAR. After antigen recognition, receptors cluster, native CD45 and CD148 are excluded from the synapse and a signal is transmitted to the cell. The most commonly used endodomain component is that of CD3-zeta which contains 3 ITAMs. This transmits an activation signal to the T cell after antigen is bound. CD3-zeta may not provide a fully competent activation signal and additional co-stimulatory signaling may be needed. For example, chimeric CD28 and OX40 can be used with CD3-Zeta to transmit a proliferative/survival signal, or all three can be used together.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0129">The endodomain may comprise:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0130">(i) an ITAM-containing endodomain, such as the endodomain from CD3 zeta; and/or</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0131">(ii) a co-stimulatory domain, such as the endodomain from CD28; and/or</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0132">(iii) a domain which transmits a survival signal, for example a TNF receptor family endodomain such as OX-40 or 4-1BB.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0128" num="0133">Illustrative HBV-specific CARs are described in Festag et al.

Approximately 25% of carriers die from chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0156">The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an enveloped, partially double-stranded DNA virus. The compact 3.2 kb HBV genome consists of four overlapping open reading frames (ORF), which encode for the core, polymerase (Pol), envelope and X-proteins. The Pol ORF is the longest and the envelope ORF is located within it, while the X and core ORFs overlap with the Pol ORF. The lifecycle of HBV has two main events: 1) generation of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) from relaxed circular (RC DNA), and 2) reverse transcription of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) to produce RC DNA. Prior to the infection of host cells, the HBV genome exists within the virion as RC DNA. HBV virions are able to gain entry into host cells by non-specifically binding to the negatively charged proteoglycans present on the surface of human hepatocytes and via the specific binding of HBV surface antigens (HBsAg) to the hepatocyte sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) receptor. All HBV viral mRNAs are capped and polyadenylated, and then exported to the cytoplasm for translation. In the cytoplasm, the assembly of new virons is initiated and nascent pgRNA is packaged with viral Pol so that reverse transcription of pgRNA, via a single stranded DNA intermediate, into RC DNA can commence.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0157">The secretion of antiviral cytokines in response to HBV infection by the hepatocytes and/or the intra-hepatic immune cells plays a central role in the viral clearance of the infected liver.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0158">However, chronically infected patients only display a weak immune response due to various escape strategies adopted by the virus to counteract the host cell recognition systems and the subsequent antiviral responses. Many observations showed that several HBV viral proteins could counteract the initial host cellular response by interfering with the viral recognition signalling system and subsequently the interferon (IFN) antiviral activity. Among these, the excessive secretion of HBV empty sub-viral particles (SVPs, HBsAg) are thought to participate to the maintenance of the immunological tolerant state observed in chronically infected patients (CHB). The persistent exposure to MHC/peptide complexes processed from HBsAg and other viral antigens can lead to HBV-specific T-cell deletion or to progressive functional impairment. Moreover, HBsAg may suppress the function of immune cells such as monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells by direct interaction. In addition HBsAg may drive exhaustion of the antigen-specific B cell response by binding to their cognate B cell receptor (comprising anti-HBs antibody).</p><p id="p-0151" num="0159">HBsAg quantification is the principle biomarker for prognosis and treatment response in functional cure of chronic hepatitis B.

However, HBeAg is postulated to play a key role in viral persistence. HBeAg is thought to promote HBV chronicity by functioning as an immunoregulatory protein. In particular, the HBeAg is a secreted accessory protein, which appears to attenuate the host immune response to the intracellular nucleocapsid protein. The HBeAg acts as an immune tolerogen contributing to</p><p id="p-0154" num="0162">HBV persistence, and possibly functions in utero considering that soluble HBeAg traverses the placenta. Furthermore, HBeAg downregulates: i) cellular genes controlling intracellular signaling; and ii) the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) to dampen the innate immune response to viral infection. In the absence of HBeAg, HBV replication is associated with an upregulation of the TLR2 pathway.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0163">Laboratory diagnosis of hepatitis B infection focuses on the detection of the hepatitis B surface antigen, HBsAg.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0164">Acute HBV infection may be characterized by the presence of HBsAg and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to the core antigen, HBcAg.
