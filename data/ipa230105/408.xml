The form of imaging device <b>201</b> is not limited to an example described in the embodiment, and may be a fixed camera provided on a wall or in the ceiling of a building, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, or a camera provided in a PC, a smartphone, a tablet device, etc. operated by subject <b>11</b>, so long as it is a camera that captures images of subject <b>11</b> and outputs the images.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The subject here is in the posture of sitting on chair <b>12</b>. In fatigue estimation system <b>200</b> according to the present disclosure, the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> is estimated based on fatigue, among fatigue in subject <b>11</b>, which is accumulated by subject <b>11</b> taking a static posture that is a fixed posture. In other words, fatigue, which is accumulated due to a load imposed on at least one of a muscle or a joint and a deteriorating blood flow (hereinafter also referred to as a decrease in a blood flow rate) which result from the fixed state of the posture, is estimated. Accordingly, subject <b>11</b> is in the static posture of sitting, lying, or standing for at least a certain period of time. The certain period of time is a minimum period such as several seconds or several tens of seconds in which fatigue can be estimated in fatigue estimation system <b>200</b>. Such period of time is determined depending on the processing capacities of imaging device <b>201</b> and estimation device <b>100</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> to be described later) included in fatigue estimation system <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Subject <b>11</b> who takes such a static posture is, for example, a desk worker in an office, a driver who maneuvers a moving body, a person who exercises for muscle training utilizing a load imposed by a static posture, a patient in a facility such as a hospital, a passenger or a crew in an airplane, etc.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Images captured and output by imaging device <b>201</b> is processed by estimation device <b>100</b>, and the posture of subject <b>11</b> is estimated as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. The estimated posture of subject <b>11</b> is output as, for example, a rigid link model. Specifically, skeletons indicated by straight lines are connected by joints indicated by black dots, and the posture of subject <b>11</b> can be reproduced based on positional relationships between the skeletons and the joints, each of which is a positional relationship between two skeletons connected by a single joint, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. The estimation of the posture is performed through image recognition, and the estimated posture is output as a rigid link model based on the positional relationships between the joints and the skeletons.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">By applying the estimated rigid link model to a musculo-skeletal model as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, an amount of load imposed on at least one of a muscle or a joint of each of body parts for keeping the positional relationships that are in accordance with the estimated posture is calculated as an estimated value for each of the body parts including muscles pulling skeletons and joints connecting the skeletons in such a manner that the positional relationships of the skeletons are changeable. The estimated value of the amount of load imposed on at least one of the muscle or the joint of the body part is accumulated more as duration in which the static posture continues gets longer. Accordingly, the level of fatigue caused by subject <b>11</b> keeping the static posture is calculated through computation using the estimated value of the amount of the load and the duration of the static posture. Note that &#x201c;at least one of a muscle or a joint&#x201d; is also expressed as &#x201c;a muscle and/or a joint&#x201d; in the following description.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the present embodiment, it is possible to estimate a fatigue level based on the estimated value of the blood flow rate of subject <b>11</b> in addition to the estimated value of an amount of load imposed on a muscle and/or a joint of subject <b>11</b>. The following description focuses on an example of estimating the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> using the estimated values of an amount of load imposed on a muscle and an amount of load imposed on a joint, but it is also possible to estimate, with higher accuracy, the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> by combining therewith the estimated value of the blood flow rate of subject <b>11</b>. Furthermore, it is also possible to estimate the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b>, using the estimated value of any one of an amount of load imposed on a muscle, an amount of load imposed on a joint, and the blood flow rate of subject <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In other words, in fatigue estimation system <b>200</b>, after the posture of subject <b>11</b> is estimated, at least one of an amount of load imposed on a muscle, an amount of load imposed on a joint, or the blood flow rate of subject <b>11</b> is estimated based on the duration of the estimated posture. Fatigue estimation system <b>200</b> estimates the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> based on the estimated value of at least one of an amount of load imposed on a muscle, an amount of load imposed on a joint, or the blood flow rate of subject <b>11</b>. Hereinafter, for the sake of simplification, the estimated value of an amount of load may be simply expressed as an amount of load or an estimated value. When the estimated value includes the estimated value of a blood flow rate, &#x201c;an amount of load&#x201d; may be read as &#x201c;a blood flow rate&#x201d;, and &#x201c;an increase in an amount of load&#x201d; may be replaced with &#x201c;a decrease in a blood flow rate&#x201d; while &#x201c;a decrease in an amount of load&#x201d; may be replaced with &#x201c;an increase in a blood flow rate&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A blood flow rate is information for quantifying a blood flow that deteriorates due to subject <b>11</b> keeping a posture, as described above. The blood flow of subject <b>11</b> deteriorates more as the blood flow rate of subject <b>11</b> decreases, and a blood flow rate can be used as an index of fatigue caused by the deterioration of the blood flow. A blood flow rate may be obtained as an absolute numerical value at a measurement time point or as a relative change value between numerical values at two different time points.

When subject <b>11</b> is detected as being static (being in a static posture) in the obtained images (step S<b>104</b>), the posture of subject <b>11</b> is estimated by estimation device <b>100</b>.

A value indicating such a peak may be based on the sex of subject <b>11</b>. The amount of load may be decreased when the sex of subject <b>11</b> is male, and may be increased when the sex is female.

Accordingly, the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> increases per unit time as the calculated amount of load increases. Note that in such an accumulation of the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b>, the fatigue level is reset (set to fatigue level 0) at a timing when a static posture starts which is a starting point on the time axis.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">When it is determined that the static state changes (Yes in step S<b>110</b>), posture estimator <b>105</b> calculates the amount of the change in the posture from the original static posture to the current posture to which the static posture has changed.

When the posture thus changes, the load imposed on at least one of the muscle or the joint changes. When it comes to the blood flow rate of subject <b>11</b>, the blood flow that has been deteriorating is temporarily improved and the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> turns toward recovery. The fatigue level decreased by recovery pertains to the amount of the change in the posture.

In other words, at the timing when the posture of subject <b>11</b> thus changes, fatigue estimator <b>108</b> estimates the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> by subtracting a recovery amount every time a unit time elapses (step S<b>113</b>).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Fatigue estimator <b>108</b> continues the processes in step S<b>111</b>, step S<b>112</b>, and step S<b>113</b> until the posture of subject <b>11</b> is static.

When the static state of subject <b>11</b> is not detected (No in step S<b>114</b>), fatigue estimator <b>108</b> returns to step S<b>111</b>, calculates a recovery amount, proceeds to step S<b>112</b>, measures a period of change, proceeds to step S<b>113</b>, and performs subtraction of the recovery amount, to continue this process so that the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> recovers as long as the posture continues to change.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In other words, by repeating the processes in step S<b>111</b>, step S<b>112</b>, and step S<b>113</b>, fatigue estimator <b>108</b> estimates the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> using a decreasing function that indicates the fatigue level with respect to the period of change and has a slope corresponding to the calculated recovery amount.

By using a decreasing function indicating a negative slope corresponding to an amount of the change in the posture, the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> is recovered (decreased) for an amount indicated as a change width in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> in a time period, which is indicated as a period of change in the figure, during which the posture continues to change.

Specifically, by visualizing the fatigue levels of subject <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, it is possible for subject <b>11</b> to visually grasp how tired subject <b>11</b> is. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a figure modeling subject <b>11</b> and the levels of fatigue at the shoulders, back, and lower back of subject <b>11</b> are displayed in an integrated manner by display device <b>205</b>. In order to make it easier for subject <b>11</b> to see the fatigue levels at first sight, the fatigue level of the shoulders is indicated as &#x201c;the degree of stiff shoulders&#x201d;, the fatigue level of the back is indicated as &#x201c;the degree of backache&#x201d;, and the fatigue level of the lower back is indicated as &#x201c;the degree of lower backache&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The fatigue levels of three locations in subject <b>11</b> are all displayed in the display example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, and the fatigue levels of the three locations are estimated from images captured in one sequence of imaging. In other words, estimation device <b>100</b> estimates, from one posture of subject <b>11</b>, a fatigue level regarding a muscle and/or a joint at each of the body parts including a first part (e.g., shoulders), a second part (e.g., a back), and a third part (e.g., a lower back) of subject <b>11</b>. Accordingly, even though the posture of subject <b>11</b> is the same, the level of fatigue accumulated in the muscle and/or the joint is different among the body parts, and yet fatigue estimation system <b>200</b> is capable of estimating such different fatigue levels simultaneously and separately.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the present embodiment, since an amount of load is calculated for each of muscles and/or joints of subject <b>11</b>, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, it is possible to estimate the fatigue level of each of the muscles and/or joints as long as a processing resource is not limited.

A fatigue level may be estimated from an amount of load imposed on a single muscle and/or a single joint, but may be estimated from multiple amounts of loads imposed on muscles and/or joints. For example, the degree of stiff shoulders (i.e., the fatigue level of shoulders) may be estimated from the average value of amounts of loads on trapezius, levator scapulae, rhomboid, and deltoid. In the estimation of a fatigue level, a fatigue level that is close to reality may be estimated by weighting an amount of load imposed on a muscle and/or a joint which particularly significantly affects the fatigue level of a body part, instead of simply calculating the average value of all of amounts of loads imposed on muscles and/or joints related to the body part.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The fatigue levels thus estimated may be each indicated as a relative position on a reference indicator where the smallest value is 0 and the largest value is 100, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. A reference value is set at a predetermined position on the reference indicator. Such a reference value is set at a relative position (or before or after the relative position, for instance) of the level of fatigue whose subjective symptoms such as a pain might appear in subject <b>11</b> in general and which is quantified in advance in an immunological examination, for instance. Accordingly, different values may be set for reference values in accordance with the fatigue levels of the body parts.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Furthermore, display device <b>205</b> may display a warning message to subject <b>11</b> as an estimation result when triggered by the estimated fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> reaching its reference value.

Moreover, in association with such a warning message, display device <b>205</b> may display a specific way to deal with the situation, such as an advice &#x201c;It is recommended that you take a break.&#x201d; as indicated together with the warning message in the figure.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Alternatively, when triggered by the estimated fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> reaching its reference value, display device <b>205</b> may display a recommended posture that achieves a less amount of load on a body part of which the fatigue level has reached its reference value, compared to the currently estimated posture of subject <b>11</b>. The reference value here is an example of a second threshold, and may be same as or different from the first threshold. Detailed advices such as &#x201c;Lean toward the backrest of the chair.&#x201d; and &#x201c;Sit back in the seat.&#x201d; may be indicated together with a figure that takes the displayed recommended posture.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Besides the above configuration for urging subject <b>11</b> to deal with an accumulated fatigue level, by displaying the estimation result of the fatigue level to subject <b>11</b>, a configuration in which fatigue estimation system <b>200</b> actively recovers the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> is also conceivable. Specifically, the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> is recovered by recovery device <b>206</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> operating. Since the detailed configuration of recovery device <b>206</b> is as described above, description is omitted. Recovery device <b>206</b> operates when triggered by the estimated fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> reaching its reference value, changes a load imposed on at least one of a muscle or a joint of subject <b>11</b>, and decreases the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> by promoting the blood circulation of subject <b>11</b>. The reference value here is an example of a third threshold and may be same as or different from either one of the first threshold and the second threshold.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Advantageous Effects, etc.</heading><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As described above, fatigue estimation system <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment includes: an information output device (e.g., imaging device <b>201</b>) that outputs information regarding the locations of the body parts of subject <b>11</b>; and estimation device <b>100</b> that estimates the posture of subject <b>11</b> based on the information (e.g., images) output by the information output device, and estimates the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> based on the estimated posture and the duration of the estimated posture.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">For example, the information output device may be imaging device <b>201</b> that captures images of subject <b>11</b> and outputs the images as the information regarding the locations of the body parts of subject <b>11</b>.

In the estimation of the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b>, the posture of subject <b>11</b> estimated from the output images is used. Specifically, the accumulation of fatigue caused by, for instance, an amount of load imposed on a muscle, an amount of load imposed on a joint, and a deteriorating blood flow of subject <b>11</b> which result from keeping of a same static posture are quantified as fatigue levels based on duration in which subject <b>11</b> is static in the static posture. Thus, with fatigue estimation system <b>200</b>, it is possible to estimate the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> in the static posture with higher accuracy and a less amount of load imposed on subject <b>11</b> since the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> is calculated, based on images, in consideration of the duration in which the static posture continues.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">For example, estimation device <b>100</b> may (i) calculate, using a musculo-skeletal model, an amount of load imposed on at least one of a muscle or a joint of subject <b>11</b> required for keeping the estimated posture, and (ii) estimate the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> using an increasing function indicating the fatigue level with respect to the duration of the estimated posture. In the increasing function used for the estimation of the fatigue level, the fatigue level may increase per unit time as the calculated amount of load increases.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Accordingly, an amount of load regarding at least one of each muscle or each joint is calculated using a musculo-skeletal model. With an increasing function indicating, as a slope, the amount of load thus calculated, it is possible to readily estimate the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b>. It is therefore possible to estimate the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> with ease and higher accuracy.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">For example, estimation device <b>100</b> may (i) calculate an amount of load of at least one of a muscle or a joint of each of two or more body parts of subject <b>11</b> including a first part and a second part among the body parts of subject <b>11</b>, and (ii) estimate, for one posture of subject <b>11</b>, at least a first fatigue level of the first part based on the amount of load calculated for the first part and a second fatigue level of the second part based on the amount of load calculated for the second part.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Accordingly, it is possible to calculate the fatigue level of each of two or more of the body parts of subject <b>11</b> in one sequence of imaging. Thus, there is no need to perform measurement for estimating the fatigue level for each of the body parts, and it is possible to promptly and almost simultaneously estimate the fatigue level for each of the body parts. Moreover, since a body part that is prone to get tired among all of the body parts of subject <b>11</b> can be easily identified based on the fatigue levels that have been estimated almost simultaneously, fatigue estimation system <b>200</b> is effective in providing a way to recover the fatigue level. It is therefore possible to promptly and effectively estimate the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">For example, when the posture changes, estimation device <b>100</b> may estimate the fatigue level using a decreasing function indicating the fatigue level with respect to time. In the decreasing function used for the estimation of the fatigue level, the fatigue level may decrease per unit time as the amount of the change in the posture increases.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Accordingly, with a change in the posture of subject <b>11</b>, the recovery of the fatigue level, which owes to changing an amount of load imposed on at least one of a muscle or a joint of subject <b>11</b> and improving the blood circulation of subject <b>11</b>, is reflected in the fatigue level to be estimated.

It is thus possible for subject <b>11</b> to inhibit the risk of experiencing a bad condition such as ill health, an injury, and an accident due to fatigue, by dealing with an accumulated fatigue level according to the displayed warning message. Thus, a bad condition caused by the fatigue of subject <b>11</b> is inhibited using a fatigue level estimated with higher accuracy.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">For example, fatigue estimation system <b>200</b> may further include display device <b>205</b> that displays, to subject <b>11</b>, a recommended posture that achieves a less amount of load compared to an amount of load imposed by the estimated posture, where the display of the recommended posture is triggered by the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b>, which is estimated by estimation device <b>100</b>, reaching a second threshold.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Accordingly, subject <b>11</b>, for instance, can deal with a fatigue level that has reached the second threshold, owing to a recommended posture displayed by display device <b>205</b>. Since the recovery of the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> is expected by changing the current posture to the recommended posture, subject <b>11</b> can inhibit the accumulation of fatigue without being particularly aware of it.

In the estimation of the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b>, the posture of subject <b>11</b> estimated from the output information is used. Specifically, the accumulation of fatigue due to a same static posture being kept is quantified as a fatigue level based on duration in which subject <b>11</b> keeps the static posture. Thus, in the fatigue estimation system, since the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> is calculated in consideration of the duration of a static posture and based on the results of the detection and measurement performed by sensor module <b>207</b>, it is possible to estimate the fatigue level of subject <b>11</b> in a static posture with higher accuracy and a less amount of load imposed on subject <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Although the above embodiment has described that an increasing function and a decreasing function are linear functions, the functions are not limited to linear functions. The increasing function may be a curved function as long as it is a function in which a fatigue level increases with the elapse of time. The decreasing function may be a curved function as long as it is a function in which a fatigue level decreases with the elapse of time.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The above embodiment has described that the estimation device estimates the fatigue level of a subject, using the estimated values of an amount of load imposed on a muscle, an amount of load imposed on a joint, and the blood flow rate of the subject which are estimated from the posture of the subject. However, it is also possible to achieve the estimation of the fatigue level with higher accuracy by correcting the estimated values using values measured by a measurement device. Specifically, the estimation device obtains measured values which are based on the result of measuring the subject by the measurement device and correspond to the estimated values.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The detection device is, for example, an electromyograph, a muscle hardness tester, a manometer, or a near-infrared spectrometer, and is capable of obtaining, through measurement, measured values regarding an amount of load imposed on a muscle, an amount of load imposed on a joint, and a blood flow rate. For example, an electromyograph is capable of estimating, based on an electric potential measured through potential measurement, the movement of a muscle corresponding to the electric potential. In other words, a value resulting from the estimation of the muscle movement can be obtained as a measured value. Since the resulting value can be converted into an amount of load imposed on the muscle, it is possible to correct, using the measured value, the estimated value of the amount of load imposed on the muscle. The correction here is, for example, calculating an average value of the estimated value and the measured value, selecting one of the estimated value and the measured value, or substituting the estimated value into a correlation function between the estimated value and the measured value.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">With a muscle hardness tester, it is possible to estimate the hardness of a muscle by a stress measured when pressure is given to the muscle. Since a value resulting from the estimation of the hardness of the muscle can be converted into an amount of load imposed on the muscle, the resulting value can be used for the correction of the estimated value of the amount of load imposed on the muscle, as is the case above.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">With a manometer, it is possible to obtain, as a measured value, a result of examining what kind of pressure is imposed on a body part of a subject. A parameter of such pressure can be input to a musculo-skeletal model. By inputting an additional parameter such as pressure, the accuracy of the estimation using the musculo-skeletal model is enhanced and it is possible to correct, with higher accuracy, an estimated value estimated using the musculo-skeletal model.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">With a near-infrared spectrometer, it is possible to obtain a measured value resulting from spectrographic measurement of the blood flow rate of a subject. As described in the above embodiment, when estimated values do not include a blood flow rate, the estimated values may be corrected by combining a blood flow rate measured by the near-infrared spectrometer. Even when estimated values include a blood flow rate, a measured blood flow rate may be used when the reliability of the estimated value of the blood flow rate is low.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">By thus making corrections to obtain highly accurate estimated values using measured values corresponding to estimated values obtained from different aspects, it is possible to more accurately estimate the fatigue level of a subject.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">A fatigue factor identification system that identifies the factors of fatigue of a subject may be configured with the use of the fatigue estimation system described in the above embodiment. With a conventional device or system that estimates a fatigue level as, for instance, &#x201c;stiff shoulders&#x201d; or &#x201c;lower backache&#x201d;, it has been difficult to identify how muscles and joints were used, which is a factor of such &#x201c;stiff shoulders&#x201d; or &#x201c;lower backache&#x201d; (i.e., a posture that is the factor). In view of this, it is possible to address the above problem by using the fatigue factor identification system according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In other words, in the fatigue factor identification system according to the present disclosure, a body part at which fatigue is prone to be accumulated (a body part of which an estimated amount that increases various fatigue is large) in a static posture taken by a subject is identified as a fatigue factor portion. The fatigue factor identification system may merely identify a fatigue factor portion in a single static posture taken by the subject or identify a fatigue factor posture of which an estimated amount in a fatigue factor portion is the largest among static postures taken by the subject. A recommended posture with which an identified fatigue factor posture is to be replaced may be presented to the subject or an operation of recovering the fatigue level of the subject with the use of the recovery device may be performed for a fatigue factor portion in a fatigue factor posture.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The fatigue factor identification system includes the fatigue estimation system described in the above embodiment and a storage device for storing information on an estimated fatigue level. Such a storage device is implemented using, for example, semiconductor memory. For instance, various storage units included in the fatigue estimation system may be used or a storage device communicably connected to the estimation device may be newly provided.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">The present disclosure may be implemented as a fatigue estimation system or a fatigue estimation method to be executed by an estimation device. Moreover, the present disclosure may be implemented as a program for causing a computer to execute such a fatigue estimation method, or as a non-transitory computer-readable recording medium having such a program recorded thereon.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Various modifications to the embodiments which may be conceived by those skilled in the art, as well as embodiments resulting from arbitrary combinations of elements and functions from different embodiments are included within the scope of the present disclosure so long as they do not depart from the essence of the present disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">REFERENCE SIGNS LIST</heading><p id="p-0146" num="0145"><b>11</b> subject</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146"><b>100</b> estimation device</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147"><b>101</b> first obtainer (obtainer)</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148"><b>105</b> posture estimator</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149"><b>108</b> fatigue estimator</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150"><b>200</b> fatigue estimation system</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151"><b>201</b> imaging device</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152"><b>203</b> pressure sensor</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153"><b>204</b> receiving device</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154"><b>205</b> display device</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155"><b>206</b> recovery device</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156"><b>207</b><i>a </i>location sensor</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
