application is directed to a high-silica-containing supplemental cementitious materials, and a method of producing same.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In this specification where a document, act or item of knowledge is referred to or discussed, this reference or discussion is not an admission that the document, act or item of knowledge or any combination thereof was at the priority date, publicly available, known to the public, part of common general knowledge, or otherwise constitutes prior art under the applicable statutory provisions; or is known to be relevant to an attempt to solve any problem with which this specification is concerned.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The production of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) is a very energy-intensive process and a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The cement sector is the third largest industrial energy consumer and the second largest CO<sub>2 </sub>emitter of total industrial CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions. World cement production reached 4.1 Gt in 2019 and is estimated to contribute about 8% of total anthropogenic CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an attempt to combat climate change, the members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), through the Paris Agreement adopted in December 2015, agreed to reduce CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions by 20% to 25% in 2030. This represents an annual reduction of 1 giga ton CO<sub>2</sub>. Under this agreement, the UNFCC agreed to keep the global temperature rise within 2&#xb0; C. by the end of this century. To achieve this goal, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) developed a roadmap called &#x201c;Low-Carbon Transition in Cement Industry&#x201d; (WBCSD-CSI). This roadmap identified four carbon emissions reduction levers for the global cement industry. The first lever is improving energy efficiency by retrofitting existing facilities to improve energy performance. The second is switching to alternative fuels that are less carbon intensive. For example, biomass and waste materials can be used in cement kilns to offset the consumption of carbon-intensive fossil fuels. Third is reduction of clinker factor or the clinker to cement ratio. Lastly, the WBCSD-CSI suggests using emerging and innovative technologies such as integrating carbon capture into the cement manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there is a need for improved cement production that reduces CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions; and, therefore, reduces the global effect of climate change. The present disclosure attempts to address these problems, as identified by the EPA and the UNFCCC, by developing a method of integrating carbon capture into the cement manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For instance, Solidia Technologies Inc. has developed a low CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions clinker that reduces CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions by 30%. However, a need exists to integrate such materials into conventional hydraulic concrete materials in order to reduce the clinker factor in hydraulic cements such as ordinary Portland cement (OPC), and to further boost the positive environmental potential through the use of such low CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions materials as supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) in concrete. While certain aspects of conventional technologies have been discussed to facilitate disclosure of the invention, Applicant in no way disclaims these technical aspects, and it is contemplated that the claimed invention may encompass or include one or more of the conventional technical aspects discussed herein.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It has been discovered that the above-noted deficiencies can be addressed, and certain advantages attained, by the present invention. For example, the methods, and compositions of the present invention provide a novel approach to pre-carbonate a carbonatable clinker, preferably but not exclusively a low CO<sub>2 </sub>emission clinker, before adding it to a hydraulic cement as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM), thereby both reducing the clinker factor of conventional hydraulic cements, and incorporating carbon capture into the production of the cement or concrete material, thus providing a doubly positive environmental benefit.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It should be understood that the various individual aspects and features of the present invention described herein can be combined with any one or more individual aspect or feature, in any number, to form embodiments of the present invention that are specifically contemplated and encompassed by the present invention.

For example, the Me may be silicon, titanium, aluminum, phosphorus, vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum, gallium, manganese, zirconium, germanium, copper, niobium, cobalt, lead, iron, indium, arsenic, sulfur and/or tantalum. In a preferred embodiment, the Me includes silicon. The second raw material may be any one or more minerals and/or byproducts having a second concentration of Me.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the first and second concentrations of the first and second raw materials are high enough that the first and second raw materials may be mixed in predetermined ratios to form a desired synthetic formulation having the general formula M<sub>a</sub>Me<sub>b</sub>O<sub>c</sub>, M<sub>a</sub>Me<sub>b</sub>(OH)<sub>d</sub>, M<sub>a</sub>Me<sub>b</sub>O<sub>c</sub>(OH)<sub>d </sub>or M<sub>a</sub>Me<sub>b</sub>O<sub>c</sub>(OH)<sub>d </sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>e</sub>, wherein the resulting synthetic formulation can undergo a carbonation reaction. In one or more exemplary embodiments, synthetic formulations having a ratio of a:b between approximately 2.5:1 to approximately 0.167:1 undergo a carbonation reaction. The synthetic formulations can also have an O concentration of c, where c is 3 or greater. In other embodiments, the synthetic formulations may have an OH concentration of d, where d is 1 or greater. In further embodiments, the synthetic formulations may also have a H<sub>2</sub>O concentration of e, where e is 0 or greater.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The synthetic formulation reacts with carbon dioxide in a carbonation process, whereby M reacts to form a carbonate phase and the Me reacts to form an oxide phase by hydrothermal disproportionation.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an example, the M in the first raw material includes a substantial concentration of calcium and the Me in the second raw material contains a substantial concentration of silicon. Thus, for example, the first raw material may be or include limestone, which has a first concentration of calcium. The second raw material may be or include shale, which has a second concentration of silicon. The first and second raw materials are then mixed and reacted at a predetermined ratio to form reaction product that includes at least one synthetic formulation having the general formula (Ca<sub>w</sub>M<sub>x</sub>)<sub>a</sub>(Si<sub>y</sub>Me<sub>z</sub>)<sub>b</sub>O<sub>c</sub>, (Ca<sub>w</sub>M<sub>x</sub>)<sub>a</sub>(Si<sub>y</sub>,Me<sub>z</sub>)<sub>b </sub>(OH)<sub>d</sub>, or (Ca<sub>w</sub>M<sub>x</sub>)<sub>a </sub>(Si<sub>y</sub>,Me<sub>z</sub>)<sub>b </sub>O<sub>c</sub>(OH)<sub>d</sub>.(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>e</sub>, wherein M may include one or more additional metals other than calcium that can react to form a carbonate and Me may include one or more elements other than silicon that can form an oxide during the carbonation reaction. The limestone and shale in this example may be mixed in a ratio a:b such that the resulting synthetic formulation can undergo a carbonation reaction as explained above. The resulting synthetic formulation may be, for example, wollastonite, CaSiO<sub>3</sub>, having a 1:1 ratio of a:b. However, for synthetic formulation where M is mostly calcium and Me is mostly silicon, it is believed that a ratio of a:b between approximately 2.5:1 to approximately 0.167:1 may undergo a carbonation reaction because outside of this range there may not be a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the energy consumption or sufficient carbonation may not occur. For example, for a:b ratios greater than 2.5:1, the mixture would be M-rich, requiring more energy and release of more CO<sub>2</sub>. Meanwhile for a:b ratios less than 0.167:1, the mixture would be Me-rich and sufficient carbonation may not occur.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In another example, the M in the first raw material includes a substantial concentration of calcium and magnesium. Thus, for example, the first raw material may be or include dolomite, which has a first concentration of calcium, and the synthetic formulation have the general formula (Mg<sub>u</sub>Ca<sub>v</sub>M<sub>w</sub>)<sub>a </sub>(Si<sub>y</sub>,Me<sub>z</sub>)<sub>b</sub>O<sub>c </sub>or (Mg<sub>u</sub>Ca<sub>v</sub>M<sub>w</sub>)<sub>a </sub>(Si<sub>y</sub>Me<sub>z</sub>)<sub>b</sub>(OH)<sub>d</sub>, wherein M may include one or more additional metals other than calcium and magnesium that can react to form a carbonate and Me may include one or more elements other than silicon that can form an oxide during the carbonation reaction. In another example, the Me in the first raw material includes a substantial concentration of silicon and aluminum and the synthetic formulations have the general formula (Ca<sub>v</sub>M<sub>w</sub>)<sub>a</sub>(Al<sub>x</sub>Si<sub>y</sub>,Me<sub>z</sub>)<sub>b</sub>O<sub>c </sub>or (Ca<sub>v</sub>M<sub>w</sub>)<sub>a</sub>(Al<sub>x</sub>Si<sub>y</sub>,Me<sub>z</sub>)<sub>b</sub>(OH)<sub>d</sub>, (Ca<sub>v</sub>M<sub>w</sub>)<sub>a</sub>(Al<sub>x</sub>Si<sub>y</sub>,Me<sub>z</sub>)<sub>b</sub>O<sub>c</sub>(OH)<sub>d</sub>, or (Ca<sub>v</sub>M<sub>w</sub>)<sub>a</sub>(Al<sub>x</sub>Si<sub>y</sub>,Me<sub>z</sub>)<sub>b</sub>O<sub>c</sub>(OH)<sub>d</sub>.(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>e</sub>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Compared to Portland cement, which has an a:b ratio of approximately 2.5:1, the exemplary synthetic formulations of the present invention result in reduced amounts of CO<sub>2 </sub>generation and require less energy to form the synthetic formulation, which is discussed in more detail below. The reduction in the amounts of CO<sub>2 </sub>generation and the requirement for less energy is achieved for several reasons. First, less raw materials, such as limestone for example, is used as compared to a similar amount of Portland Cement so there is less CaCO<sub>3 </sub>to be converted. Also, because fewer raw materials are used there is a reduction in the heat (i.e. energy) necessary for breaking down the raw materials to undergo the carbonation reaction.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Other specific examples of carbonatable materials consistent with the above are described in U.S. Pat.
