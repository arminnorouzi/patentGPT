The current solutions for providing interactivity and user control, however, are limited in the amount of user control that they provide for an audience member. These online communications applications limit flexibility, integration, and user selections in a variety of ways in order to streamline and limit the size and complexity of the application.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, current direct online applications limit flexibility by restricting the amount of customization that can be achieved within an individual communications component. None of the existing direct online platforms use a completely separate, encapsulated architecture for implementing communications component customization per web cast, and none of them allow an audience member to set up and view a webcast per their own interests. They also limit integration by restricting the amount of interactivity provided to a highly-customized communications. For example, existing webcasting platforms do not have an open platform for integrating third-party communications components of any significant size or complexity. The integration of third-party communications components in communication applications are limited in direct communications to simple image or animation components. Attempts to expand flexibility in current solutions involve creation of a collection of closed &#x201c;widgets&#x201d; which become the non-expandable limitations of the application.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Downloaded executable installed applications do exist currently that use a component model, but the requirement to download, execute, and install a desktop executable application in a client computer make the current use of these indirect executable applications less secure and more cumbersome from an initial use perspective. None of the existing applications function in a context that is fully-online, without a downloaded desktop application.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one potential implementation, flexibility of the application is increased by using completely separate, encapsulated architecture for implementing communications component customization per web cast, and none of them allow an audience member to set up and view a webcast per their own interests.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another potential implementation, integration is increased by using an open platform for integrating third-party communications components of any significant size or complexity. Another potential implementation targets each communications component in the direct application as being a fully self contained piece of the whole system, relying on the platform to provide common services, but able to function independently if needed. So not only is the service layer accessible to communications components, but also the look and feel of the communications components themselves is inherited from the parent platform, without the need for an unsafe executed application.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an application interface according to one aspect of the innovations herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an illustration of a communication system according to one aspect of the innovations herein.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>is an illustration of one aspect of a rich internet application component according to one aspect of the innovations herein.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>is an illustration of one aspect of a rich internet application component according to one aspect of the innovations herein.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>c </i></figref>is an illustration of one aspect of a rich internet application component according to one aspect of the innovations herein.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>d </i></figref>is an illustration of one aspect of a rich internet application component according to one aspect of the innovations herein.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>e </i></figref>is an illustration of a rich internet application component according to one aspect of the innovations herein.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an illustration of a communication system according to one aspect of the innovations herein.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram of a database for use with a communication console system according to one aspect of the innovations herein.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram of a communication console system according to one aspect of the innovations herein.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> illustrates an example of a book a meeting widget that is part of the communication console system.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> illustrates an example of a request a demo widget that is part of the communication console system.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a method for capturing audience buying intent signals with realtime actionable data using the communication console.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates more details of the method for capturing audience buying intent signals with realtime actionable data using the communication console.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ONE OR MORE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Reference will now be made in detail to the present innovations, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

The programming interface <b>220</b> may also be used to standardize interfaces, both of elements from base platform <b>230</b> and components and applications created to use the programming interfaces <b>220</b>. This may be done to allow a unifying look-and-feel to be applied by default to components developed by disparate sources and third parties who may never interact with each other.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Live or On-Demand Rich Media Internet Applications require complex interactivity between the various parts, or communications components, of the application. At the same time, new communications components or customization of existing communications components which may conflict in a closed system are possible, this requires communication components using programming interface <b>220</b> to create new functionality and perform its individual role without concerns of conflicts with other communications components. The communications components may also be integrated into the final presentation in a way that masks their individual and different sources, and shows the appearance of a single unified application despite the different development sources and/or times of various communication components.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The complex interaction within the various components is managed by a central &#x201c;Communications Manager&#x201d; object, which registers events or requests from individual components, identifies the priority of each event, and determines the callback mechanism to deliver information back to the calling component. This object then applies a layer of security filters to verify that the calling component has the appropriate permissions to access the resources it is requesting, and that it has not exceeded its quota of requests within a given time frame. Once all these filters are passed and the Communications Manager determines that the event or method being called can in fact be acted on&#x2014;the event or method is allowed to proceed in a metered and organized way. Registered event listeners, or method calls return the information to the component via a callback method, including the requested information, if any, and status of the original request. In this way, the platform enables the limited resources available on the browser to be allocated with the appropriate priority and rationing so as to allow for a smooth, seamless, and integrated user experience. Contrast this organized platform approach with a mashup of components&#x2014;each unaware of the other, and each competing for the limited resources available to the browser (CPU, threads, number of concurrent request to the back-end systems available, etc.), degrading performance in unpredictable and undesirable ways.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, <b>3</b><i>c</i>, and <b>3</b><i>d </i></figref>show an embodiment of console wrapper definitions which may be used to create and modify a component such as Twitter&#x2122; component <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>e </i></figref>which may then be presented in a console such as console <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

The signals/data that results from the captured buying intent of the audience member may be passed onto the monetizing component of the communication console system that performs the analysis process (<b>804</b>) that performs various analysis and processing processes. For example, the system may filter out a buying intent signal which may take about 3 minutes (near real time) and makes use of an commercially available Oracle DB reader and a router application or any alternative custom code that can look for changes to the data in a database, such as an Oracle database, to detect these signals. For example, in one embodiment, the router app may be a commercially available Striim apps from Striim Inc. There may be a different router app for different buying intent event types. At this stage, the code may preprocess of the buy intent data to filter duplicates and other edge cases out of the data. The method may utilize the commercially available Azure event hub and each app subscribes to the Event Hub for New Registrants. The method may then look up the client ID that causes an event hub trigger. The method may also, using the Azure function, look up whether the Event ID or Client ID in question has an active integration configuration to connect to an external system. A REST hooks engine may add a register hook endpoint to provide a unique URL for each buying intent that may be passed on external system for performing the monetization of the buying intent (<b>806</b>). Using the method, any buying intent captured by the widgets of the communication console and, in realtime, analyzed and can be acted on by someone like the sales executive shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The foregoing description, for purpose of explanation, has been with reference to specific embodiments.
