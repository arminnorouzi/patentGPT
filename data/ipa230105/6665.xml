The temperature sensor senses the temperature of the circuit that is to be protected from excessively high temperatures. Responsive to detecting a temperature that exceeds a threshold, the temperature sensor provides an alert signal to the thermal protection device, which takes mitigating action to preventing overheating of the circuit. Such temperature sensors often include bipolar junction transistors (BJTs). A parameter of the BJT, such as the base-emitter voltage of the BJT, varies with temperature, and this parameter is used as a proxy to determine the temperature of the circuit to be protected.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Some BJT structures suffer from design limitations that may negatively impact temperature sensing accuracy. For instance, the collector of the BJT may abut the substrate of the BJT at a junction. The junction is reverse biased to isolate the collector from the substrate and to prevent majority-carrier current flow from the substrate to the collector, because such current flow would adversely impact the operation of other components coupled to the collector and result in poor temperature sensing performance. In certain applications, including switching power applications, a relatively large concentration of minority carriers may exist in the substrate, and the reverse biasing between the collector and the substrate will not preclude these minority carriers from crossing the collector-substrate junction into the collector. The number of minority carriers entering the collector may be sufficiently large so as to adversely impact the operation of other components (e.g., comparators) coupled to the collector and result in poor temperature sensing performance. Furthermore, the substrate is capacitively coupled to the collector through the collector-substrate junction, and this capacitance at the collector-substrate junction couples substrate noise (e.g., large fluctuations in substrate voltage) into the collector. The substrate noise manifests in the collector as current, and as described above, currents entering the collector can adversely impact temperature sensing accuracy.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">This description provides various examples of a temperature sensor that remedies the challenges described above. The temperature sensor described herein may be useful in high-temperature applications, such as switching power applications. The temperature sensor includes a first current source adapted to be coupled to a voltage source. The temperature sensor includes a resistor having a first resistor terminal and a second resistor terminal, with the first resistor terminal coupled to the first current source. The temperature sensor includes an npn-BJT (which, in some examples, may be a pnp-BJT) having a base, a collector, and an emitter, with the base coupled to the first resistor terminal, the emitter coupled to the second resistor terminal, and the collector adapted to be coupled to the voltage source. The temperature sensor includes a second current source coupled to the emitter and the second resistor terminal, with the second current source adapted to be coupled to ground. The temperature sensor includes a Schmitt trigger (or other component configured to convert an analog signal at the emitter into a digital signal, such as a comparator, multiple comparators to provide hysteresis, etc.) having an input coupled to the emitter, the second resistor terminal, and the second current source. The npn-BJT includes a substrate, a collector abutting the substrate, a base abutting the collector, and an emitter abutting the base, so the substrate is separated from the emitter and base by the collector. Because the Schmitt trigger and current source described above are coupled to the emitter, and because the emitter is distanced from the substrate, the negative impacts caused by proximity to the substrate do not affect the base, the emitter, or the components (e.g., Schmitt trigger) coupled to the base or the emitter. Furthermore, although substrate noise and minority carriers may cross the collector-substrate junction, the collector is coupled to the voltage source through a relatively low impedance path. This low impedance permits the collector to source or sink displacement or minority-carrier currents crossing the collector-substrate junction without causing substantial variation in collector voltage and therefore without coupling substantial noise into either the base or the emitter of the transistor. Consequently, the substrate noise and minority carriers do not adversely impact other components in the temperature sensor and thus do not adversely impact temperature sensing accuracy. Various examples of the temperature sensor are now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example system implementing a temperature sensing circuit in various examples.

In some examples, the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b> is positioned inside the switching power circuit <b>102</b>, meaning that the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b> is physically positioned among the circuitry of the switching power circuit <b>102</b> without being coupled to the circuitry of the switching power circuit <b>102</b>. The system <b>100</b> includes a thermal protection circuit <b>106</b> coupled to the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b> and to the switching power circuit <b>102</b> (e.g., to an enable/disable input of the switching power circuit <b>102</b> configured to enable and disable the switching power circuit <b>102</b>). In operation, the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b> monitors the temperature of the switching power circuit <b>102</b> as switching power circuit <b>102</b> operates. Responsive to the temperature of the switching power circuit <b>102</b> remaining within a target range, the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b> provides a first signal to the thermal protection circuit <b>106</b> that causes the thermal protection circuit <b>106</b> to permit the switching power circuit <b>102</b> to continue operation. Responsive to the temperature of the switching power circuit <b>102</b> leaving the target range by exceeding a threshold, the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b> provides a second signal to the thermal protection circuit <b>106</b> that causes the thermal protection circuit <b>106</b> to perform a protective action, e.g., to temporarily disable the switching power circuit <b>102</b>. In such cases, responsive to the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b> determining that the temperature of the switching power circuit <b>102</b> has returned to the target range, the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b> causes the thermal protection circuit <b>106</b> to enable the switching power circuit <b>102</b> to resume operation.

Greater proximity of the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b> to the switching power circuit <b>102</b> increases the amount of noise and minority carrier injection the switching power circuit <b>102</b> provides to the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b>. However, unlike other solutions, the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b> described herein is not vulnerable to such increased noise and minority carrier injection, thus enabling the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b> to be positioned inside the switching power circuit <b>102</b>. By being positioned inside (or closer to) the switching power circuit <b>102</b> without being negatively impacted by the added noise and minority carrier injection, the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b> increases the accuracy of its temperature measurements.

The metal layer <b>422</b> is adapted to be coupled to voltage source <b>302</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, in operation at room temperature, the current source <b>300</b> and current source <b>310</b> provide currents I<b>1</b> and I<b>2</b> respectively, with I<b>2</b> being greater than I<b>1</b>. For example, I<b>1</b> may be 1 microamp (uA), and I<b>2</b> may be 2 uA. Thus, in this example, the current source <b>300</b> provides 1 uA to the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b>, and the current source <b>310</b> sinks 2 uA to ground <b>312</b>. Because the base <b>316</b> receives a negligible amount of current, if any, and thus I<b>1</b> flows through the resistor <b>304</b> (e.g., 500 kilohms), generating a voltage VBE from the base <b>316</b> to the emitter <b>320</b> (in this example, VBE may be approximately 0.5 V). Because VBE is fixed at a relatively low voltage such as 0.5 V, the emitter <b>320</b> may provide substantially less current than I<b>1</b> or I<b>2</b>. For example, at room temperature, the current provided by the emitter <b>320</b> may be approximately 1 nano Amp (nA). In this example, the current source <b>310</b> is to sink 2 uA to ground <b>312</b>, and it receives 1 uA from current source <b>300</b>, but of the remaining 1 uA that the current source <b>310</b> is to sink to ground <b>312</b>, only 1 nA is available from the emitter <b>320</b>. Consequently, the current source <b>310</b> (e.g., a one-quadrant current source) pulls the node <b>308</b> low enough toward ground so the voltage at node <b>308</b> causes the Schmitt trigger <b>322</b> to provide a digital bit <b>0</b> on the output <b>326</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As the ambient temperature rises, the VBE to sustain a constant current decreases. For example, for each 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, the VBE to sustain a constant current decreases by 2 mV. However, because VBE is fixed, a rise in temperature causes a rise in current. As temperature continues to rise, the BJT <b>314</b> continues to increase the amount of current provided to the current source <b>310</b>. Eventually, the temperature rises to a level at which the current source <b>310</b> is sinking the full amount of current it was designed to sink (e.g., 2 uA, with 1 uA from the current source <b>300</b> and the other 1 uA from the BJT <b>314</b>). At this level, the node <b>308</b> still remains low, and the Schmitt trigger <b>322</b> still provides a digital bit <b>0</b> at output <b>326</b>. However, as the temperature rises even further, the current source <b>310</b> is no longer able to sink the continued increase in current provided by the BJT <b>314</b>. Thus, the extra current causes the voltage at node <b>308</b> to rise. As the voltage at node <b>308</b> rises with increasing temperature, the voltage at node <b>306</b> rises, because VBE remains static at approximately 0.5 V in this example. However, the voltage at node <b>306</b> cannot rise indefinitely, because the current source <b>300</b> (e.g., a one-quadrant current source) cannot pull node <b>306</b> above VCC. Thus, the node <b>306</b> will stop rising at VCC, and thus the node <b>308</b> has a maximum voltage of VCC less the VBE drop across the BJT <b>314</b> (e.g., 0.5 V) and less the saturation voltage (e.g., 0.2 V) of current source <b>300</b> (e.g., VCC&#x2212;(0.5 V)&#x2212;(0.2 V), or VCC&#x2212;(0.7 V)). This voltage is sufficiently high to cause the Schmitt trigger <b>326</b> to provide a digital bit <b>1</b> on the output <b>326</b>. The Schmitt trigger <b>322</b> has a hysteresis with high and low thresholds to mitigate jitter at output <b>326</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">During the operation described above, the high temperature, high currents, and high noise in the switching power circuit <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>) may introduce substantial minority carrier currents and noise currents into the heavily n-doped buried layer <b>402</b> via the collector-substrate junction at the top of the substrate <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). However, because the collector <b>318</b> is coupled directly to the voltage source <b>302</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>), and further because the collector <b>318</b> provides a low-impedance pathway to the voltage source <b>302</b>, the noise and minority carrier currents flow to the voltage source <b>302</b> and have minimal or no impact on the operation of the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b>. Further, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows, the emitter <b>320</b> is coupled to the Schmitt trigger <b>322</b> and is thus potentially vulnerable to noise and minority carrier currents. However, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows, because the emitter (the heavily n-doped region <b>444</b>) is positioned far from the substrate <b>400</b> and the collector-substrate junction, no noise or minority carrier currents can reach the emitter. For example, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows and as described above, the base and the collector are between the emitter and the substrate <b>400</b>, and thus the base and collector separate the emitter from the substrate <b>400</b> and prevent noise and minority carrier currents from reaching the emitter. Accordingly, even though the emitter is vulnerable to noise and minority carrier currents, these currents cannot reach the emitter, and thus these currents do not materially impact the function of the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a circuit schematic diagram of the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b> in various examples. The temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> includes the same components as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, with the following modifications. The resistor <b>304</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> as including two separate resistors <b>304</b>A and <b>304</b>B coupled to each other at a node <b>500</b>. Node <b>308</b> is coupled to the drain of a transistor (e.g., n-type FET) <b>502</b>, which has a gate that is coupled to the gate of another transistor (e.g., n-type FET) <b>504</b>. The transistors <b>502</b> and <b>504</b> combine to form a current mirror. The sources of the transistors <b>502</b> and <b>504</b> are coupled to ground <b>312</b>. A node <b>506</b> is coupled to the gates of the transistors <b>502</b> and <b>504</b>, the drain of the transistor <b>504</b>, and a current source <b>508</b>. A transistor (e.g., n-type FET) <b>510</b> has a drain coupled to node <b>500</b> and a source coupled to node <b>308</b>. An inverter <b>512</b> is coupled to the output <b>326</b>, and the gate of the transistor <b>510</b> is coupled to the inverter <b>512</b> at a node <b>514</b>. An inverter <b>516</b> is coupled to the node <b>514</b> and has an output <b>518</b>. A capacitor <b>520</b> is coupled to output <b>326</b> and to input <b>324</b> to smooth jitter in the output of the Schmitt trigger <b>322</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The operation of the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is the same as that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, with the following exceptions. The current source <b>508</b> provides a current to the transistor <b>504</b>, and the current mirror configuration of the transistors <b>502</b> and <b>504</b> causes a current to be provided in the transistor <b>502</b>. The current mirror sinks current to ground <b>312</b>. The current source <b>300</b> provides some of this current, with the BJT <b>314</b> providing the remainder of the current. At room temperature, the current provided by the BJT <b>314</b> is low, and thus the current mirror pulls the voltage at node <b>308</b> low. Because the voltage at node <b>308</b> is low, the Schmitt trigger <b>322</b> provides a digital bit <b>0</b> at output <b>326</b>. The pair of inverters <b>512</b>, <b>516</b> provides a digital bit <b>0</b> at output <b>518</b>. As the temperature rises, the current provided by the BJT <b>314</b> increases, and as this current increases, the current mirror is closer to satisfying its target sink current, as described above. After the current mirror is sinking a target amount of current, further temperature increases and the resulting increases in current provided by the BJT <b>314</b> cause the voltage at node <b>308</b> to rise. As this voltage at node <b>308</b> rises, it eventually reaches a level that exceeds a threshold of the Schmitt trigger <b>322</b>, causing the Schmitt trigger <b>322</b> to provide a digital bit <b>1</b> at output <b>326</b>. The pair of inverters <b>512</b> and <b>516</b> provides a digital bit <b>1</b> at output <b>518</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The transistor <b>510</b> is optional. Responsive to the Schmitt trigger <b>322</b> providing a digital bit <b>0</b> at output <b>326</b>, the inverter <b>512</b> provides a digital bit <b>1</b> at node <b>514</b>, causing the transistor <b>510</b> to turn on. Responsive to being on, the transistor <b>510</b> forms a short across the resistor <b>304</b>B, thus eliminating resistor <b>304</b>B from the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b>. However, responsive to the Schmitt trigger <b>322</b> providing a digital bit <b>1</b> at output <b>326</b>, the inverter <b>512</b> provides a digital bit <b>0</b> at node <b>514</b>, causing the transistor <b>510</b> to turn off. Responsive to the transistor <b>510</b> being off, the resistor <b>304</b>B is introduced to the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b>. The resistances of the resistors <b>304</b>A and <b>304</b>B combine to raise the voltage VBE. Increasing VBE adds hysteresis to the temperature sensing circuit <b>104</b> beyond that provided by the Schmitt trigger <b>322</b>. Specifically, raising the voltage VBE reduces the temperature at which the BJT <b>314</b> conducts enough current to raise node <b>308</b> high. Therefore as the temperature rises, it first reaches one threshold TH at which the output of the circuit goes high with only resistor <b>304</b>A present. The output will remain high until the temperature drops below a second, lower, threshold TL corresponding to the insertion of both resistors <b>304</b>A and <b>304</b>B in the circuit by turning off transistor <b>510</b>. The difference between thresholds TH and TL constitutes hysteresis. It is not necessary to use a Schmitt trigger in this case because the hysteresis provided by <b>510</b> is larger than that provided by the Schmitt trigger, but it may be advantageous to use a Schmitt trigger even in this case because it helps reject high-frequency jitter. A usual Schmitt trigger has an upper threshold voltage of about two-thirds of its supply voltage from voltage source <b>302</b>, and a lower threshold of about one-third of this supply voltage. These thresholds may be adjusted by changing transistor sizes within the Schmitt trigger, and by this it is possible to ensure that the upper threshold lies significantly lower than the voltage at which node <b>308</b> resides at high temperatures. Similarly, the lower threshold of the Schmitt trigger can be placed well above the saturation voltage of the current source formed by transistors <b>504</b> and <b>502</b>, which approximately equals the voltage on node <b>506</b> minus the threshold voltage of transistor <b>502</b> (which is assumed to equal the threshold voltage of transistor <b>504</b>). The threshold temperature in each case equals the temperature at which the transistor conducts just sufficient current to pull node <b>308</b> high. The base-emitter voltage to pull a given current through the transistor decreases by about two millivolts per degree Celsius. Thus, the voltage generated by resistors <b>304</b>A and <b>304</b>B combined will provide a lower temperature threshold than resistor <b>304</b>A alone.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Because the Schmitt trigger and current source described above are coupled to the emitter, and because the emitter is distanced from the substrate, the negative impacts caused by proximity to the substrate do not affect the base, the emitter, or the components (e.g., Schmitt trigger) coupled to the base or the emitter. Furthermore, although substrate noise and minority carriers may cross the collector-substrate junction, the collector is coupled to the voltage source through a relatively low impedance path. This low impedance permits the collector to source or sink displacement or minority-carrier currents crossing the collector-substrate junction without causing substantial variation in collector voltage and therefore without coupling substantial noise into either the base or the emitter of the transistor. Consequently, the substrate noise and minority carriers do not adversely impact other components in the temperature sensor and thus do not adversely impact temperature sensing accuracy.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The term &#x201c;couple&#x201d; is used throughout the specification.
