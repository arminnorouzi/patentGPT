To facilitate their function of generating electricity and to improve performance, photovoltaic arrays are generally combined together and mounted on a framework that forms part of a fixed or pivotal support structure. The modules are electrically connected, in parallel or in series, to produce a combined power output that is connected to a voltage load such as one or more storage batteries. Often, it is desirable to mount solar panels outdoors at an angle from the horizontal so that they will more directly face the sun during peak daylight hours as opposed to being mounted flat on the ground. As such, in many instances it can be useful to rotate arrays of photovoltaic (PV) modules while they are attached to a mounting framework. For example, in many instances it is useful to rotate attached modules with the movement of the sun as the sun moves relative to the array over the course of a day.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, providing a framework and mechanism capable of rotating multiple photovoltaic modules can be challenging. For example, such designs will require a design that can accommodate one or more actuators and appropriately controlling such actuators. Further, such designs will require a framework that is capable of supporting PV modules in a variety of rotational positions while also providing enough downward lift resistance to satisfy local codes or regulations on satisfying wind load resistance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2019/0199276 to Bailey et al. describes a rotatable solar panel assembly including an elongated structural member extending along and parallel to a row of photovoltaic panels. Protrusions are coupled to the elongated structural member with an actuator and drive mechanisms coupled to the photovoltaic modules. Actuation of the actuator can move the elongated structural member, the movement of the elongated structural member can move the protrusions, the movement of the protrusions can move the drive mechanisms, and the movement of the drive mechanisms can rotate the photovoltaic modules. Additional disclosure includes U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,136,783; 8,413,391; 9,960,730; and 10,720,541; and U.S. Publications 2011/0290306; 2014/0069483; 2015/0052834; and 2019/0199276. These patents and publications are hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Improvements to existing solar module frameworks and/or techniques for rotating PV modules would be welcome.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to embodiments of the present disclosure a header for a ballasted support system for photovoltaic modules is disclosed.

In various embodiments the system <b>100</b> includes a plurality of A-frame side supports including a first A-frame structure <b>102</b> and a second A-frame structure <b>104</b>. The first and second A-frame structures <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> are each connected to a ground ballast <b>106</b> that provides uplift resistance for the support system <b>100</b> to secure the system to the ground. In one or more embodiments, the first and second A-frame structures <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> have an A-frame shape with a pair of side arms <b>108</b> and one or more cross-beams <b>110</b>. The side arms <b>108</b> are most separated at a bottom portion <b>112</b> of the structure <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> where they are connected to the ground ballast <b>106</b> and are angled to come together to connect at a top portion <b>114</b> of the structure <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In various embodiments, the first and second A-frame structures <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> are established on the ground, oriented generally parallel to one another, and are separated by a gap <b>116</b>. In one or more embodiments, the gap <b>116</b> is approximately 17-18 feet. However, the size of this gap <b>116</b> can vary and can be larger or smaller as desired for a scaled up or down embodiment. For example, in various embodiments, the size of the gap <b>116</b> will depend on the length of a header <b>118</b>. In various embodiments, the system <b>100</b> includes the header <b>118</b> which has a first end <b>120</b> and a second end <b>122</b> and that spans the gap <b>116</b> between the first and second A-frame structures <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. In various embodiments the header <b>118</b> is attached to the top portion <b>114</b> of each of the A-frame structures <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. In various embodiments the header <b>118</b> is pivotally attached to the A-frame structures <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> such that the header <b>118</b> is configured to rotate about a central lengthwise axis.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In such embodiments, the A-frame structures <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, ground ballasts <b>106</b>, and the attached header <b>118</b> define a base portion for mounting the remaining elements of the system <b>100</b>.

In various embodiments, the distance <b>310</b> is approximately seven (7) feet. In one or more embodiments the height <b>312</b> is approximately seven (7) to eight (8) feet. However, these values can be scaled up or down as desired to produce structures of various sizes.

In such embodiments, the basket <b>303</b> can be loaded with as much or as little material as needed to satisfy uplift requirements of the ballast <b>106</b>.

In various embodiments, the bottom most cross beam <b>110</b> includes a plurality of anchors <b>308</b> bolted to, welded to, or otherwise attached to the bottom cross-beam <b>110</b> and connecting the A-frame structure to the ballast. In various embodiments the concrete slab <b>305</b> has a size that corresponds to the desired uplift capacity of the ballast <b>304</b>. For example, where more uplift capacity is required a larger slab can be poured while where conversely a smaller slab can be poured where a lower uplift capacity is required.
