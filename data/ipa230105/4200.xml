However, such mobile devices are power constrained under many workloads and operating environments. These power limitations are driven by issues such as decreasing form factors, user preference for passively cooled designs, and increasing number of IP (Internet Protocol) and I/O (Input/Output) devices. At the same time, mobile systems are taking on more computationally intensive tasks and require higher level of performance to deliver responsiveness and fluid user experience.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Because most mobile applications events are by their nature brief in operation with long periods of idleness, systems on chips (SoCs) and other mobile computing systems often support a mode or operation, which may be referred to as a Turbo mode, in which steady state power constraints/limits can be exceeded provided that there is energy available in an energy budget, with the energy budget being replenished when the system is idle or is in another reduced operation state. The energy budget is intended to protect the system from excessive thermal energy while allowing the operation of brief events that may exceed steady state limits.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, such conventional energy budgeting does not provide support for operations and services (generally referred to as system events) that require maximum performance even when energy budget is not available and the system is operating under steady state power and thermal constraints. As a result, device performance and user experience may be severely affected in a depleted energy budget state as the implementation of events, including events that are essential for proper user experience, are throttled back.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments described here are illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals refer to similar elements.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an illustration of a mechanism to support priority events in a system according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an illustration of a process flow for enhanced power management to support execution of priority events in a system according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an illustration of an enhanced power management process to provide support for priority events according to an embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an illustration of an embodiment of a mobile electronic device including enhanced power management according to an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments described herein are generally directed to enhanced power management for support of priority system events.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For the purposes of this description:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">&#x201c;Mobile system&#x201d; or &#x201c;mobile device&#x201d; refers to a smartphone, smartwatch, tablet computer, notebook or laptop computer, handheld computer, mobile Internet device, wearable technology, or other mobile electronic device that includes processing capability.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">&#x201c;System on chip&#x201d; or &#x201c;SoC&#x201d; refers to a chip or integrated circuit (IC) that includes all components of a computing system, including, for example, all components of a computer.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">&#x201c;Event&#x201d; refers to an application, operation, service, or other function that is executed by a system.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">&#x201c;Priority event&#x201d; refers to an event for a mobile computing system that is designated as high priority, critical, or other enhanced priority by one or more means.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the operation of a mobile system, the execution of certain events is of critically important for user experience and interaction. Launching an application, responding to an UI (user interface) event, or maintaining fluidity of experience during touch inputs (utilizing a touch sensitive surface) or other user interactions (for example a photo application) are certain examples of system events for which the quality of system performance is extremely important for the overall user experience. During such priority system events, it is important for the system to deliver maximum performance. If performance lags for a priority event, a mobile device will appear to be sluggish or unresponsive to user control, greatly diminishing the user experience in utilizing the mobile device.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">To implement a Turbo mode to address the execution of priority events, power management algorithms (which may be referred to as Turbo algorithms) are utilized to determine whether energy in a system energy budget may be expended for a particular request (which may be referred to as a Turbo request). The Turbo algorithm is generally implemented by a Power Control Unit (PCU) or other power element in the SoC or other computing system.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">However, a power management algorithm is commonly designed to use the available energy budget for the Turbo requests, and, when the energy budget is depleted, to then throttle the system performance back to levels needed to maintain the steady state operation and thermal limitations for the system, wherein the thermal limitations may include skin temperature and other thermal issues.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">However, existing hardware and software power management algorithms for computing systems do not sufficiently account for priority events in system operation. Conventional power management algorithms commonly provide for utilizing the energy budget for an application or other event whenever the energy budget is available, and, when the energy budget is then depleted, significantly reducing SoC or other system performance to remain within the thermal and power limits for the system. For this reason, device performance and user experience may be severely affected in when the system is in a depleted energy budget state.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, an apparatus, system, or process includes an enhanced power management mechanism to maintain responsiveness and performance for priority system events that can directly impact user experience, wherein the power management mechanism provides support for such priority events even as energy budget limitations and soft thermal limitations (i.e., thermal limitations that are not critical to device operation) are faced. In contrast, conventional logic implementations allow for exhausting the available energy budget on non-priority execution, and thus do not adequately support priority events. Further, conventional implementations prohibit violation of soft thermal limits even if a brief allowance of soft thermal limit violations would significantly benefit device performance and user experience for certain critical events.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">An event may be designated as a priority event by applications, by the OS (operating system), or by an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and registered with the system. Embodiments are not limited to a single priority designation, and may include designation of one of a plurality of enhanced priority levels, for example designation of events as high priority or critical.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, a second residual energy budget is maintained to enable energy budgeting for events that are deemed to be priority events when the first general energy budget is depleted or insufficient for execution of a particular event. The status of the system energy budget is utilized to determine whether a certain event or application execution that requires a certain thermal energy is allowed to provide the user experience for the execution of the event. In some embodiments, the system energy budget is expended prior to expending the residual energy budget, and the residual energy budget is replenished (or filled) prior to replenishing the system energy budget to enable execution of priority events before other non-priority events. In some embodiments, certain designated priority events are allowed to exceed the energy budget by drawing on the residual energy budget. In some embodiments, certain designated events, such as critical events, are further allowed to proceed despite depletion of the residual budget by authorizing exceeding of a soft thermal limit by a certain margin.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, an apparatus, system, or process provides a power management mechanism to maintain responsiveness and performance for priority system events including the following:</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">(1) Residual Energy Budget&#x2014;The apparatus, system, or process is to maintain a sufficient residual energy budget (a second energy budget) in addition to the system energy budget to allow execution of priority events. The designation of specific events as priority events may be specified by, for example, applications run on a computing system, the OS (operating system) for the computing system, or by an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) with the OEM designations then being registered with the system. In some embodiments, the system maintains a list of such designated priority events as well as their expected duration. When priority events occur or are executed in the system, the operating detects the priority event and provides a notification to the hardware to prioritize the execution of the event and enable the use of the residual energy budget even if the overall system energy budget is not available.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">(2) Request to Exceed Limits for Critical Events&#x2014;For events that are critical for system functionality and responsiveness, the OS may request the SoC or system to exceed soft thermal limits (thermal limits that are not essential for device operation, and thus violation of which won't result in, for example, a system malfunction or crash) by a certain margin.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">An example of a soft thermal limit that may be exceeded by a certain margin is skin temperature, T<sub>SKIN</sub>, as skin temperature of a system is generally a comfort factor rather than an operational limit. The allowance of reasonable violations of such thermal limits allows critical system events to be provided a highest level of performance despite violation of some of the &#x201c;soft&#x201d; power and thermal limits.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, an apparatus, system, or process provides a registry means to maintain information regarding which events are priority events, and provides means for supporting such registry in hardware or software. In some embodiments, an apparatus, system, or process includes a determining means for determining whether that a priority event is occurring and enabling execution of such event dependent on the residual budget and allowance for exceeding thermal limits. In some embodiments, an apparatus, system, or process includes an enhanced algorithm to determine whether to expend energy for events based on the priority of the event, the energy required for the event, the state of the energy budget and residual energy budget, and the potential exceeding of soft thermal limits.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an illustration of a mechanism to support priority events in a system according to an embodiment.
