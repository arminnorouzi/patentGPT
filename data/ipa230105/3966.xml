Typical reflective road or driveway markers include one or more reflectors mounted on a support standard, such as a support post or support rod that can be inserted into the ground adjacent the road or driveway. The reflectors are illuminated by vehicle headlights/taillights and reflect light back toward the vehicle, thereby serving to guide the driver of the vehicle, especially in nighttime driving conditions. Because a driveway (or road) may intersect a road (or another portion of the driveway) at a substantially right angle, it may be desirable to have a pair of reflectors of the reflective marker facing in two generally orthogonal direction at the intersection such that a first reflector of the pair of reflectors may be seen when illuminated by vehicle headlights of vehicles traveling along the first road (or driveway) and a second reflector, positioned orthogonally with respect to the first reflector, may be seen when illuminated by vehicle headlights of vehicles traveling along the second orthogonal road (or driveway). However, in other road or driveway layouts where marking the edge or boundary of the road or driveway, the vehicle traffic may be only along a single direction (e.g., vehicles travel along the driveway or road in an east/west direction only), in such situations, it would be desirable to have both reflectors facing in the same direction for maximum visibility. Thus, it would be desirable to provide a road or driveway marker with a pair of reflectors that may be reconfigured by the user to have the reflectors positioned on the standard to face in the same direction or to have the reflectors positioned on the standard to face in substantially orthogonal directions.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Roadway or driveway markers including an interfitting pair of stacked reflectors configured to permit a number of angular relationships between the two reflectors positioned in stacked relationship on a support standard, such as support rod or post, are known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,716,288 to Kennenberg discloses a driveway reflector wherein two or more reflectors may be mounted in a stacked relationship on a standard. For each reflector, a circular frame provides opposing annular seats for supporting a pair of reflecting members. The frame includes a pair of spring-like arms for holding the reflector in place on the rod by compressive force. The frame also includes an octagonal shaped projection extending from an outer circumference of the frame and a mating embossment defining an orthogonal shaped opening extending from the outer circumference of the frame, the projection and embossment being spaced 180 degrees apart. The octagonal shaped projection of the embossment of one reflector is received in the mating the octagonal shaped opening of the embossment of the adjacent reflector. The interfitting of the two stacked reflectors, that is, the interfitting of the octagonal projection and the octagonal opening of the two stacked reflectors, allows the user to select/change the angular relation between the two stacked reflectors between eight possible orientations, for example, from an orientation where the two reflectors are in parallel relationship to an orientation where the two reflectors are in an orthogonal relationship. U.S. Pat. No. 3,768,434 to Pinter also discloses a driveway reflector having an octagonal interfitting of an octagonal shaped boss of an upper reflector into a hexagonal hole in a boss of a lower reflector. Again, the two stacked reflectors allow for changing the orientation of the two stacked reflectors.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In both of the aforesaid patents, the pair of reflectors are in a vertically stacked relationship on the standard, that is, the entirety of the first reflector is vertically positioned above the second reflector in any angular desired relationship of the reflectors, i.e., the pair of reflectors is in a vertically stacked relationship on the standard when the angular relationship of the reflectors are parallel (both reflectors facing in the same direction) and when the angular relationship of the reflectors are orthogonal (the reflectors being at right angles, that is, facing in directions that are 90 degrees apart), or any other angular relation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 3,292,569 to Trigilio discloses a portable, foldable roadside warning device for disabled vehicles. The reflector assembly includes a spinning vane having two reflectors. The vane includes a central tubular portion which is welded to a semicircular central channel. The central tubular portion of the vane is rotatably mounted on a rod. The vane spins under wind pressure. Mounted to the upper portion of the vane is a pair of upper reflectors. The upper reflectors are mounted to a metal frame. Projecting ends of the metal frame slide over the outer surfaces of the central tubular portion and the semicircular central channel, thereby providing a rigid interlocking of the metal frame and the vane such that the metal frame and the upper reflectors spin with the vane. The direction of the upper reflectors is 90 degrees offset from the two reflectors mounted on the vane. Again, in the aforesaid '569 patent, the pair of upper reflectors is positioned vertically above the spinning vane reflectors with respect to the rod.</p><heading id="h-0003"

includes reflector assembly <b>200</b>, which one exemplary embodiment comprises a pair of reflectors <b>210</b>, mounted to a mounting or support post, support rod, or support standard <b>110</b>. The support post <b>110</b> is typically driven into ground adjacent an edge or boundary of a driveway or road/roadway to mark the edge or boundary of a driveway or road/roadway and, thus, is typically installed in a vertical position. That is, a longitudinal extent or longitudinal axis LA of the mounting post <b>110</b> extends in a vertical direction V with respect to the ground or substrate. The roadway or driveway marker <b>100</b> of the present disclosure may also be used to mark sidewalks, bike paths, hiking trails, obstructions, and the like. The pair of reflectors <b>210</b>, including a first or upper reflector <b>220</b> and a second or lower reflector <b>320</b>, are advantageously reconfigurable between a parallel positional relationship <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>7</b></figref>), wherein both reflectors aligned to face in the same direction, and an orthogonal positional relationship <b>410</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b>B</figref>), wherein the respective reflectors are facing in directions 90 degrees apart. Advantageously, the reconfigurable road or driveway marker <b>100</b> of the present disclosure, the pair of reflectors <b>210</b> are configured to be interfitting, interlocking and overlapping such that when configured in the orthogonal positional relationship <b>410</b> (that is, the first and second reflectors being at right angles or orthogonal to each other), the first and second reflectors <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> are at substantially the same vertical height, that is, the reflectors <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> are in an overlapping position or overlapping configuration <b>412</b> along the longitudinal extent or longitudinal axis LA of the support post <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">By contrast, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, when the pair of reflectors <b>210</b> ae configured in the parallel position relationship <b>400</b> (that is, the first and second reflectors being aligned and facing in the same direction), the pair of reflectors <b>210</b> are in a stacked position or stacked configuration <b>402</b>, that is, the first and second reflectors <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> are at different vertical heights as measured along the longitudinal axis LA of the support post <b>110</b>. Advantageously, when the marker <b>100</b> of the present disclosure is used in the orthogonal positional relationship <b>410</b>, the pair of reflectors <b>210</b> present a compact and aesthetically pleasing appearance since they are in the overlapping configuration <b>412</b>. Additionally and advantageously, the road marker <b>100</b> of the present disclosure also provides for an interlocking of the first and second reflectors <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> of the reflector assembly <b>200</b> in both the parallel position relationship <b>400</b> and the orthogonal positional relationship <b>410</b>, thus, avoiding any undesirable separation of the pair of reflectors <b>210</b> along the support post <b>110</b> in either the overlapping configuration <b>412</b> or the stacked configuration <b>402</b>.
