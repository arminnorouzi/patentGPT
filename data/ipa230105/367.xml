The present disclosure also relates to a calibration method for said medical capsule.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Background of the Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Acute upper gastrointestinal bleedings (GI bleedings) from ulcers or esophago-gastric varices are life threatening medical conditions which require immediate endoscopic therapy. Despite successful endoscopic hemostasis, there is a significant risk of rebleeding often requiring close surveillance of these patients e.g. in the intensive care unit. Any time delay to recognize bleeding may lead to a high blood loss and increases the risk of death. The presence of Biliverdin, which has similar light absorption properties as blood, in the duodenum of patients with certain liver associated conditions may lead to false blood detection readings. Hence, a reliable way to detect the presence of blood is necessary.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">EP 2 057 934 A1 and EP 1 875 858 A1 of the present inventor disclose a swallowable sensor with a measurement gap between a light source and a detecting element in order to detect active bleeding in the stomach by measuring characteristic optical properties of blood. EP 3 269 298 A1 discloses a different blood detection device which is anchored within a hollow organ. Specifically, the high absorption in the range of violet light with a wavelength of 380 nm-450 nm (preferably 415 nm) in combination with the low absorption of red light with a wavelength of 620 nm-750 nm (preferably 700 nm) constitute to the characteristic optical property of blood. Transmission of violet light is up to three orders of magnitude lower than transmission of red light depending on the optical density of the blood sample. By calculating a quotient of the measured intensity of red light divided by the measured intensity of violet light, an indicator value is provided to predict the presence of blood in the measurement gap of the sensor. In other words, a higher concentration of blood occurs when the quotient increases with decreasing measured intensity of violet light. By telemetric communication with an extracorporeal receiver, information about the bleeding status is transmitted and can be displayed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The optical sensor can be designed to allow a differentiation between blood and bile. Bile contains Bilirubin as colorant that has similar optical characteristics as blood, yet much less pronounced. In clinical use, the exposure of the sensor to bile is very likely, as bile is often present in high concentrations in the duodenum, through which the optical sensor naturally travels on its way through the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Bilirubin is a product of the Haem molecule, an essential part of blood, which is responsible for the optical characteristics exploited by this optical sensor for the detection of blood. A differentiation between blood and bile can be accomplished e.g. by means of a threshold to which the quotient of red and violet light transmission is compared.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The chemical reactions that are responsible for producing bile may be disturbed for patients with certain liver-associated conditions (e.g. liver cirrhosis). In particular, the conversion process from Haem to Bilirubin may be impeded, resulting in the presence of Biliverdin as an intermediate product of this reaction chain. Biliverdin is categorized as a colorant in bile, similar to Bilirubin. In such cases, the composition of colorants in the bile juice and therefore its optical absorption properties are altered. In particular, Biliverdin exhibits a higher absorption of violet light with a wavelength of around 415 nm than Bilirubin (however still less than Haem), resulting in a lower transmission intensity of violet light. Therefore, the presence of Biliverdin may cause the quotient of the measured intensity of red light divided by the measured intensity of violet light to increase to values comparable to that of the quotient in case blood is present (in low concentrations), which may be interpreted as false positive reading by the user when applying the optical sensor in patients with suspected GI bleeding. It has been observed in experiments, that the concentration of Biliverdin in patients can, under certain circumstances and in rare cases, reach an unusually high concentration level at which the measured sensor values might falsely suggest the presence of blood (false-positive reading).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, it is an object of the disclosed sensor to improve its detection capabilities and especially to allow a differentiation between a presence of blood and a presence of bile containing Biliverdin when the quotient of the measured intensity of red light divided by the measured intensity of violet light is close to or in the range of an indication for the presence of blood, resulting in a risk reduction of false positive readings of the sensor.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The object of the disclosed sensor as discussed above is achieved with a medical capsule according to claim <b>1</b> and its calibration methods according to claims <b>4</b> and <b>7</b>. Further advantageous developments and embodiments of the disclosure are subject-matter of the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A medical capsule according to the disclosure is being equipped with a sensor device comprising at least one light emitting element and at least one photosensitive/light receiving/light detecting element with the sensor device being adapted to detect the presence or non-presence of blood and/or Biliverdin based on the light absorption properties of blood and Biliverdin. The medical capsule is provided with a casing/shell forming a recess/gap at its outer surface. Alternatively, the outer surface of the medical capsule comprises two recesses/gaps. The at least one light emitting element, preferably at least one LED, alternatively/alternatingly or parallelly emits (preferably monochromatic) violet light, preferably of a wavelength of about 380-450 nm, green light, preferably of a wavelength of about 530-580 nm, and red light, preferably of a wavelength of about 620-750 nm (respectively), whereas the at least one light detecting element generates a separate sensor signal associated with measured light intensities I<sub>violet</sub>, I<sub>green</sub>, and I<sub>red </sub>of at least each of the wavelength ranges of the light from the light emitting element.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In other words, the at least one light emitting element of the sensor device of the medical capsule according to the present disclosure is capable of emitting (preferably monochromatic) green light of a third wavelength of about 530-580 nm (preferably 570 nm). The at least one light detecting element of the sensor device, arranged on the other side of the recess, which faces the light emitting element, is preferably designed to be sensitive to all ranges of the light emitted alternatively by the at least one light emitting element and generates a separate sensor signal associated with the measured light intensity of the violet, green, and red light respectively, after the light has passed through the measuring gap located on the medical capsule surface.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The light of the at least one emitting element of the medical capsule according to the disclosure passes through the sensor gap in which it is absorbed, reflected, and/or transmitted to different degrees depending on the content/substance in the gap between the at least one light emitting element and the at least one light detecting element. Preferably, the at least one light emitting element generates voltage levels as the separate sensor signal associated with the measured light intensity of the violet, green, and red light.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The preferably monochromatic light is light of essentially a single color, having a spectral half width generally associated with the use of respective LEDs or filters. The monochromatic light can be generated by the light emitting elements (e.g. in case of the use of color LEDs) or by applying a filter between a light emitting element and a photo detector/light detecting element. Such a filter can be positioned on either side of the recess. In other words, the at least one light emitting element of the medical capsule is provided as a plurality of LEDs that emit the light with the respective wavelengths. Alternatively, the at least one light emitting element is provided as a single LED with a plurality of filters, each associated with the wavelength of the respective light.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As the absorption characteristics of blood and bile containing Biliverdin are similar (however differently pronounced) for light in the violet and red ranges of the visible spectrum, they differ for green light in the range of 530-590 nm, for which bile containing Biliverdin shows a transmission percentage in the range of 90% while blood shows a high degree of absorption. Specifically, undiluted bile containing a high concentration of Biliverdin can lead to the same or a very similar quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>violet </sub>of the measured intensity of red light divided by the measured intensity of violet light as blood in very low concentrations. Therefore, green light with a wavelength range of 530-590 nm is introduced as a third output emitted by the at least one light emitting element of the medical capsule, in order to be able to distinguish a quotient of the measured intensity of red light divided by the measured intensity of violet light in the case where undiluted bile containing Biliverdin in high concentrations is present from a quotient of the measured intensity of red light divided by the measured intensity of violet light in the case highly diluted blood is present (as to not to mistake a presence of Biliverdin for a presence of blood in low concentrations).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to an aspect of the invention, the sensor device of the medical capsule differentiates the presence of blood from the presence of bile containing Biliverdin by evaluating a quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>of the measured intensity of red light I<sub>red </sub>divided by the measured intensity of green light I<sub>green </sub>transmitted to the at least one light detecting element.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In other words, the newly introduced quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>of the intensity of red light divided by the intensity of green light measured by the at least one light detecting element of the medical capsule is used to desensitize the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>violet </sub>of the measured intensity of red light divided by the measured intensity of violet light in a case when the value of I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>is above an empirical evaluated threshold. With an increasing concentration of blood, the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>of the measured intensity of red light divided by the measured intensity of green light rises significantly, similar to the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>violet </sub>whereas it remains almost the same when bile containing Biliverdin is present, since bile containing Biliverdin shows a low absorption of green light, leading to a high intensity for green light I<sub>green </sub>measured by the light detecting element.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to calibrate the measurement process of the medical capsule according to a first embodiment, a measurement value HI for the likelihood of presence of blood is defined as</p><p id="p-0019" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>HI</mi>   <mo>=</mo>   <mn>0</mn>  </mrow>  <mo>,</mo>  <mrow>   <mrow>    <mn>5</mn>    <mo>&#xb7;</mo>    <mi>log</mi>   </mrow>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mtext>  </mtext>   <mrow>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mfrac>      <msub>       <mi>I</mi>       <mrow>        <mi>r</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mi>e</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mi>d</mi>       </mrow>      </msub>      <msub>       <mi>I</mi>       <mi>violet</mi>      </msub>     </mfrac>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>    <mo>&#xb7;</mo>    <mi>C</mi>   </mrow>  </mrow>  <mo>,</mo> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0020" num="0000">with C being a correction factor.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0018">The purpose of applying the logarithm function on the quotient is to generate an indicator value which can be displayed in a graph on a linear rather than a logarithmic axis.

Generally, the value HI increases with an increasing quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>violet</sub>, meaning a higher HI value results in a higher possibility that blood is present in the measurement gap of the medical capsule.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0020">The correction factor C for the measurement value HI according to the first embodiment of the present invention is defined as C=1 if the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>is above a predetermined threshold T and as C&#x3c;1 if the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>is below the threshold T. A correction factor of C=1 results in an unchanged HI value when the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>is above the certain threshold T in case blood is detected in the measurement gap of the medical capsule. A value of C=1 is selected for this scenario in the first embodiment but it is noted that the correction factor C could also be set to a different value. In case the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>is below a threshold T, a lower correction factor C is preferred (lower than in a case when the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>is above the certain threshold T), thus reducing the measurement value HI, in order to prevent falsely indicating the presence of blood when bile containing Biliverdin is present in the measurement gap of the medical capsule.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0021">The correction factor C in a preferred modification of the first embodiment of the invention is defined as C=1 if the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>is above the predetermined threshold T and as C=I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green</sub>&#xb7;1/T if the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>is below the predetermined threshold T.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0022">This means, the correction factor C is a function of the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>and the threshold T in this preferred modification of the first embodiment. This prevents a jumping of the HI value in case the correction factor C is continuously changing between two constant values in case the value of the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>is crossing the predetermined threshold back and forth. Instead, the correction factor C is reduced depending on the difference/distance between the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>and the threshold T. In case the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>is essentially the same as the threshold T, the correction factor C is essentially 1, while the correction factor C gets lower, the further the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>is below the threshold T.

It comprises a light transmitting/permeable casing <b>2</b>, preferably made of a resin material, with a substantially cylindrical outer shape with rounded end portions and edges in order to make the swallowing process easier. A circuit board <b>4</b> with a plurality of electronic facilities (not explicitly shown), e.g. a data memory and/or data transmission member, a CPU, and an energy source like a battery, is located inside the casing <b>2</b> of the medical capsule <b>1</b>. The casing <b>2</b> has a lengthy recess or gap <b>5</b> being orientated substantially rectangular to the longitudinal axis of the medical capsule <b>1</b> at its outer surface while the width of the gap <b>5</b> extends in the longitudinal direction of the medical capsule <b>1</b>. A sensor device <b>6</b> comprising at least one light emitting element <b>8</b> and at least one light detecting element <b>9</b> is located on top of the circuit board <b>4</b> in view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The light emitting element <b>8</b> and the light detecting element <b>9</b> are arranged in such a way that each element <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> is located on one side of the gap <b>5</b> in the casing <b>2</b> respectively while also facing each other. The light emitting element <b>8</b> emits (preferably monochromatic) light in visual violet (about 415 nm), green (about 570 nm), and red (about 700 nm) range, (respectively) through the gap <b>5</b> along the longitudinal direction of the medical capsule <b>1</b> which is then being detected by the light detecting element <b>9</b> located on the other side of the gap <b>5</b>, when seen in the width direction of the gap <b>5</b> opposite to the light emitting element <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a diagram of the transmission spectroscopy for the light of different wavelengths received by the light detection element <b>9</b> for various blood to water ratios. A percentage value of a transmission value through a blood solution compared to a transmission value through clear water, with the percentage value being 100% for a transmission in clear water, is described by the ordinate axis while the abscissa shows different wavelengths for light ranging from 350 nm to 800 nm. Additional vertical lines in the diagram emphasize the characteristic wavelengths for the visual violet (415 nm), green (570 nm), and red (700 nm) light preferably emitted by the light emitting element <b>8</b>. The diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows three graphs for blood solutions with three specific blood to water ratios, namely 0.1% (dashed-dotted line), 1% (dashed line), and 5% (solid line). A solution containing blood absorbs a larger amount of violet light with a wavelength in the range of 380 nm to 450 nm which results in a lower transmission value of said light, and therefore, a lower measured intensity I<sub>violet </sub>detected by the light detecting element <b>9</b>. Even for a blood solution with a low blood to water ratio of 0.1%, a significant absorption of violet light is noticeable. The minimum of the dash-dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows that the maximal absorption of light occurs at the characteristic wavelength of 415 nm for violet light, which represents a transmission percentage of around 27%. By increasing the wavelength, the transmission percentage increases to a value of around 95% until reaching the wavelength range of green light (530 nm-580 nm) where the transmission percentage drops twice to around 85%. By further increasing the wavelength, the transmission percentage jumps to substantially 100% and stays at this level for the wavelengths 600 nm and higher, meaning almost no red light with a wavelength in the range 620 nm to 750 nm is getting absorbed by the blood solution with a blood to water ratio of 0.1%.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0039">Similar transmission/absorption characteristics of light can be noticed for the curves representing blood solutions with a blood to water ratio of 1% and 5%. Both curves are shifted in negative y-direction by increasing the ratio of blood to water if compared to the course of the dashed-dotted line described above. A solution with a blood to water ratio of 1% (dashed line) shows a transmission percentage of substantially 0% for violet light and a transmission percentage of around 35% for green light in the characteristic wavelength ranges of 415 nm and 570 nm, respectively, while approximately 95% of red light is being transmitted through said blood solution. A solution with a blood to water ratio of 5% (solid line) shows a transmission percentage of substantially 0% for violet light and 0%-5% for green light in the wavelength ranges of 415 nm and 570 nm, respectively, while approximately 80% of red light is being transmitted. In other words, only 20% of red light but around 95% of green light is being absorbed by the blood solution with a blood to water ratio of 5%.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a similar diagram of the transmission spectroscopy for the light of different wavelengths received by the light detection element <b>9</b> for various bile to water ratios, in which Biliverdin is present. Corresponding to the transmission spectroscopy for blood solutions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a percentage value of a transmission value through a bile solution compared to a transmission value through clear water, with the percentage value being 100% for a transmission in clear water, is described by the ordinate axis while the abscissa shows different wavelengths for light ranging from 350 nm to 800 nm. The diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows three graphs for bile solutions, which contain Biliverdin, with three specific bile to water ratios, namely 6.25% (dashed-dotted line), 25% (dashed line), and 100% (solid line). All three graphs for the Biliverdin containing bile solutions show a noticeable decline in the transmission percentage for violet light with a wavelength ranging from 380 nm to 450 nm. A minimum of the light transmission percentage is around 10%, around 57%, and around 87% for the above mentioned bile solutions with bile to water ratios of 100%, 25%, and 6.25%, respectively. The higher the bile to water ratio, the more light is being absorbed. When the wavelength increases, i.e. by leaving the wavelength range of violet light, the light transmission percentage increases and the respective graphs start to flatten at a wavelength of around 525 nm for all three bile solutions. The graphs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> show that the majority of green light as well as red light is not being absorbed by a solution with bile containing Biliverdin, contrary to solutions containing blood. Pure bile with Biliverdin, represented by the solid line, transmits around 90% of green light and around 95% of red light, while the solutions with diluted bile containing Biliverdin absorb substantially no green and red light at all.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a logarithmic diagram portraying the value of the measured intensity of red light divided by the measured intensity of green light I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>over a concentration of blood and over a concentration of bile containing Biliverdin. It is assumed that the measured intensity signals for red light and green light are essentially equal when no absorption takes place in the measurement gap <b>5</b> of the medical capsule <b>1</b>, therefore, the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>is essentially 1 if the measurement gap <b>5</b> of the medical capsule <b>1</b> is empty. Due to the low absorption of green light by bile containing Biliverdin, the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>remains constantly low (around 1, up to about 2) over all concentrations of bile containing Biliverdin (see the line indicated by black squares in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). On the other hand, the quotient I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>rises significantly with the presence of blood with an increasing concentration of blood (see the line indicated by white circles).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0042">As the transmission and/or the absorption value of light in the range of visible green light are significantly different for bile containing Biliverdin and for blood, the above discussed value I<sub>red</sub>/I<sub>green </sub>of the measured intensity of red light divided by the measured intensity of green light is a reliable means to exploit these characteristics as differentiation features between Biliverdin and blood in order to differentiate the presence of blood from the presence of bile containing Biliverdin and thereby avoiding the risk of false-positively detecting blood.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230000368A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="6.01mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230000368A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00002" nb-file="US20230000368A1-20230105-M00002.NB"><img id="EMI-M00002" he="6.01mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230000368A1-20230105-M00002.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00003" nb-file="US20230000368A1-20230105-M00003.NB"><img id="EMI-M00003" he="6.01mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230000368A1-20230105-M00003.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00004" nb-file="US20230000368A1-20230105-M00004.NB"><img id="EMI-M00004" he="6.01mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230000368A1-20230105-M00004.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00005" nb-file="US20230000368A1-20230105-M00005.NB"><img id="EMI-M00005" he="6.35mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230000368A1-20230105-M00005.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00006" nb-file="US20230000368A1-20230105-M00006.NB"><img id="EMI-M00006" he="6.01mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230000368A1-20230105-M00006.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00007" nb-file="US20230000368A1-20230105-M00007.NB"><img id="EMI-M00007" he="6.01mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230000368A1-20230105-M00007.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
