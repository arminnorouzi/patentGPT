Therefore, the thickness of the polyimide resin layer decreases by irradiating laser light, and the thickness of the polyimide resin layer after the peeling may be smaller than the thickness of the polyimide resin layer originally formed. In other words, the thickness of the polyimide resin layer of the organic EL display device after the peeling is 150 nm or less, preferably 100 nm or less, more preferably 90 nm or less and even more preferably 80 nm or less. A lower limit of the thickness of the polyimide resin layer is not particularly limited, however, the thickness is, for example, greater than 0.01 nm, 0.1 nm or greater, 1 nm or greater, 5 nm or greater, or 10 nm or greater. The thickness of the polyimide resin layer may be measured by observing, for example, the cross section using a transmission electron spectroscope (TEM).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0078">In existing technologies, there has been a problem in that, when a 10 &#x3bc;m to 150 &#x3bc;m thin layer glass substrate is used as a support substrate and this thin layer glass substrate is in direct contact with a glass substrate as a carrier substrate, peeling the thin layer glass substrate from the glass substrate becomes difficult when exposed to a high temperature during a process of forming a TFT circuit. The peeling process of the present disclosure is a case of installing a polyimide resin layer with high heat resistance between a glass substrate as a carrier substrate and a thin layer glass substrate, and using the thin layer glass substrate as a support substrate by changing the interface between the polyimide resin layer and the glass substrate using laser light, and the support substrate may be readily peeled from the glass substrate even when exposed to a high temperature. Accordingly, the present disclosure also relates to a use of a polyimide resin composition for peeling a 10 &#x3bc;m to 150 &#x3bc;m thin layer glass substrate from a glass substrate as a carrier substrate, and this polyimide resin composition forms a polyimide resin layer having a thickness of 150 nm or less.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0079">According to the method for manufacturing an organic EL display device of the present disclosure, an organic EL display device including a support substrate for a display device formed with a TFT glass substrate having a thickness of 10 &#x3bc;m to 150 &#x3bc;m and a polyimide resin layer having a thickness of 150 nm or less installed in contact with the TFT glass substrate may be manufactured, and as a result, an organic EL display device having high transparency while being thin and having flexibility may be manufactured.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0080">Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the following example and comparative example. However, the present disclosure is not limited to the descriptions of the following example.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example</heading><p id="p-0086" num="0081">A varnish including 4,4&#x2032;-oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA) as an acid dianhydride and 2,2&#x2032;-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzidine (TFMB) as a diamine was coated to a thickness of 500 nm on a glass substrate having a thickness of 0.5 mm using a slot die. The result was introduced to a nitrogen oven (manufactured by Koyo Thermo Systems Korea, Co., Ltd.), and dried for 30 minutes at 50&#xb0; C., then dried for 30 minutes at 100&#xb0; C., dried for 30 minutes at 150&#xb0; C., dried for 30 minutes at 200&#xb0; C., dried for 30 minutes at 250&#xb0; C., dried for 30 minutes at 300&#xb0; C., and cured for 30 minutes at 350&#xb0; C. to form a polyimide resin layer having a thickness of 100 nm. Subsequently, thin layer glass (manufactured by Nippon Electric Glass Co., Ltd.) having a thickness of 50 &#x3bc;m was laminated on the polyimide resin layer as a TFT glass substrate, and the result was heated for 10 minutes at 350&#xb0; C. to adhere the polyimide resin layer and the thin layer glass as a TFT glass substrate. Subsequently, a TFT circuitry layer and a light emitting layer were formed on the thin layer glass using known methods, and an encapsulation layer was formed on the light emitting layer to form a display device on the glass substrate. In the process of forming a TFT circuitry layer, a semiconductor layer was annealed for 2 hours at 450&#xb0; C. Lastly, the polyimide resin layer was peeled from the glass substrate by irradiating laser light with a wavelength of 308 nm on the polyimide resin layer from a surface opposite to the display device-laminated surface of the glass substrate using a laser lift off method, and as a result, an organic EL display device was obtained. The thickness of the polyimide resin layer of the obtained organic EL display device measured by observing a cross-section TEM was 70 nm.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Comparative Example</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0082">An organic EL display device was manufactured in the same manner as in Example except that thin layer glass was laminated on an epoxy resin layer using a general epoxy resin layer instead of the polyimide resin layer, and then the result was heated for 10 minutes at 160&#xb0; C. In the process of forming a TFT circuitry layer, the epoxy resin layer foamed when annealing a semiconductor layer for 2 hours at 450&#xb0; C., and an organic EL display device was not able to be manufactured since the epoxy resin layer and the thin layer glass were peeled off.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0083">[Evaluation]</p><p id="p-0089" num="0084">(Visible Light Transmission Test)</p><p id="p-0090" num="0085">Transmittance of the organic EL display device obtained in Example for visible light was measured using a visible light transmittance meter (manufactured by Nippon Spectroscopy, UV-500). The organic EL display device of Example had total light transmittance of 90% or greater in a visible region. Therefore, the organic EL display device of the present disclosure had excellent transparency.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading><p id="p-0091" num="0086">The support substrate for a display device of the present disclosure has high transparency, and, for example, is particularly useful for electronic devices equipped with a plurality of modules such as smart phones or tablets. For example, in electronic devices such as portable information terminals equipped with a camera module and a display device, it is possible to install the camera module on the back of the display device.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230006157A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230006157A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230006157A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230006157A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230006157A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230006157A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230006157A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230006157A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00005" cdx-file="US20230006157A1-20230105-C00005.CDX" mol-file="US20230006157A1-20230105-C00005.MOL"/><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
