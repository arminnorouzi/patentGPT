Some devices such as mediastinoscopes are generally configured to create a working space within naturally occurring cavities; however, there remains a need for improved devices, systems, and methods for performing minimally invasive surgical procedures between tissue layers, particularly where adhesions or other tissue conjoins adjacent layers.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A device for minimally invasive, inter-layer surgical procedures advantageously forms a wedge for advancing between adjacent tissue layers and provides a jaw that can be actuated to create a working space for a cutting tool and other instruments within a plane between the tissue layers. The device may also usefully employ an open or wireframe structure for the opposing jaws to preventing tissue or fluid accumulation between the jaws and to maximize visibility around the surgical site.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, an endoscopic device disclosed herein may include: a tube having a distal end region, a proximal end region, and a central axis passing through the distal end region, the tube defining a channel from the proximal end region to the distal end region; a first jaw extending from the distal end region of the endoscopic device on a first side of a plane through the central axis, the first jaw having a first interior surface oriented toward the central axis and a first exterior surface oriented away from the central axis, the first jaw defining a first opening passing through the first jaw from the first interior surface to the first exterior surface; a second jaw extending from the distal end region of the endoscopic device, the second jaw pivotally coupled to the distal end region by a pivot on a second side of the plane opposing the first side, the second jaw including a second interior surface facing the first jaw and a second exterior surface facing away from the first jaw, the second jaw defining a second opening passing through the second jaw from the second interior surface to the second exterior surface, the second jaw having a closed position in which the first jaw and the second jaw are bounded by a wedge formed by two planar surfaces intersecting at a vertex on the first side of the plane, and the second jaw movable about the pivot to an open position where a second distal end of the second jaw moves across central axis to the second side of the plane to create a working volume about the plane between a first distal end of the first jaw and the second distal end of the second jaw; and an actuator operable to move the second jaw between the closed position and the open position.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Implementations may include one or more of the following features. The endoscopic device may further include a camera having a field of view directed toward the working volume between the first distal end of the first jaw and the second distal end of the second jaw. The wedge may contact a cross section of the first exterior surface of the first jaw and the second exterior surface of the second jaw in a second plane orthogonal to the plane through the central axis, where the wedge forms an angle of about five degrees to about thirty degrees. The wedge may form an envelope about the first exterior surface of the first jaw and the second exterior surface of the second jaw having an angle of about five to about sixty degrees. The wedge may be an asymmetrical wedge. A first planar surface of the wedge may extend from and be parallel to an exterior side of the tube. The vertex of the wedge may be radially closer to an exterior of the tube than the central axis of the tube. The wedge may include a first planar surface substantially parallel to the central axis and aligned with a point on an exterior surface of the distal end region of the tube, and a second planar surface intersecting a radially opposing point on the exterior surface of the distal end region of the tube. The first planar surface and the second planar surface may form an interior angle of the wedge of about ten to thirty degrees. The first exterior surface of the first jaw may extend from and be aligned with an exterior surface of the distal end region of the tube. The first jaw may be a wireframe structure formed about the first opening such that the first opening spans a majority of a surface area of the first exterior surface. The second jaw may be a wireframe structure formed about the second opening such that the second opening spans a majority of a surface area of the second exterior surface. The endoscopic device may further include a handle on the proximal end region of the tube, the handle coupled to the second jaw through a jaw transmission configured to rotate the second jaw about the pivot in response to a movement of the handle. The endoscopic device may further include a sheet metal linkage for communicating a force from the handle to the distal end region for rotation of the second jaw about the pivot. The endoscopic device may further include a gear and capstan for communicating a force from the handle to the distal end region for rotation of the second jaw about the pivot. The endoscopic device may further include serrations on the first exterior surface of the first jaw oriented to resist a retreat of the endoscopic device along a forward surgical path.

In general, the endoscopic device <b>100</b> may include a tube <b>110</b>, a first jaw <b>130</b>, a second jaw <b>150</b>, and an actuator <b>170</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The tube <b>110</b> may have any circular, elliptical, or other cross-sectional shape, and may generally have an exterior surface with a finish suitable for use in surgical procedures. The tube may be formed, for example, from any biocompatible plastic, surgical stainless steel, or other suitable materials. The tube <b>110</b> may include a distal end region <b>112</b> to be deployed to a surgical site during use, and a proximal end region <b>114</b> from which a surgeon or other operator can control the endoscopic device <b>100</b> during a procedure. The tube <b>110</b> may define a channel <b>116</b> from the proximal end region <b>114</b> to the distal end region <b>112</b>, e.g., for coupling controls on the proximal end region <b>114</b> to components on the distal end region <b>112</b>, for coupling electronics on the proximal end region <b>114</b> to a camera or other active components positioned at the distal end region <b>112</b>, for deploying other surgical tools and the like to a surgical site, and so forth. The tube <b>110</b> may also generally include a central axis <b>118</b> passing through and extending from the distal end region <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The first jaw <b>130</b> may be, e.g., a fixed jaw or the like extending from the distal end region of the endoscopic device. The second jaw <b>150</b> may be pivotally coupled to the distal end region by a pivot <b>152</b> and may be controllably rotated by an actuator to extend away from the first jaw <b>130</b>. As an advantage, a fixed jaw simplifies mechanical design of the endoscopic device <b>100</b>, and can provide a strong, fixed contact surface that is able to support consistent, forward movement of the endoscopic device <b>100</b> during a procedure. However, it will be understood that the first jaw <b>130</b> may also be a movable jaw that can pivot or otherwise move to displace tissue and create a working volume for a dissection or other procedure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">An actuator <b>170</b> may be positioned at the proximal end region <b>114</b> of the endoscopic device <b>100</b> and may be operable to move the second jaw <b>150</b> between a closed position and an open position, e.g., by rotating the second jaw <b>150</b> about the pivot <b>152</b>. In general, the actuator <b>170</b> may include a handle <b>172</b> or other user-operable control coupled to the second jaw <b>150</b> through a jaw transmission <b>174</b> configured to rotate the second jaw <b>150</b> about the pivot <b>152</b> in response to a movement of the handle <b>172</b>. The jaw transmission <b>174</b> may, for example, include a second pivot <b>176</b> and an arm <b>178</b> that couple the handle <b>172</b> to a linkage <b>180</b> such as a sheet metal linkage that translates movement of the handle <b>172</b> into a linear movement along (or parallel to) the central axis <b>118</b> of the tube <b>110</b> in order to communicate a force from the handle <b>172</b> to the distal end region <b>112</b> for rotation of the second jaw <b>150</b> about the pivot <b>152</b>. The jaw transmission <b>174</b> may also include a spring <b>182</b> or other mechanism that biases the actuator <b>170</b> so that the second jaw <b>150</b> is in a closed position in the absence of external forces, e.g., in the absence of a user activation of the handle <b>172</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, this bias includes a clockwise bias of the handle <b>172</b> about the second pivot <b>176</b> so that the linkage <b>180</b> is biased to the left and the second jaw <b>150</b> is responsively biased in a counter-clockwise or closed position. It will be understood that other configurations are possible for the actuator <b>170</b>, for example by positioning the handle <b>172</b> on the opposite side of the actuator <b>170</b> and configuring the jaw transmission <b>174</b> to open the second jaw <b>150</b> in response to a clockwise movement (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the handle <b>172</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a cross-section of an endoscopic device with a jaw in an open position. In general, the endoscopic device <b>200</b> may be any of the endoscopic devices described herein, except as specifically noted otherwise.

In response to this rotation, a force may be applied to move a linkage <b>280</b> toward a distal end region <b>212</b> of the endoscopic device <b>200</b>, causing a second jaw <b>250</b> to rotate clockwise about a pivot <b>252</b> into an open position where a second jaw <b>250</b> is separated from a first jaw <b>230</b> to create a working space <b>285</b> therebetween. It will be noted that the illustrated embodiment includes a fixed jaw (the first jaw <b>230</b>) and a moving jaw (the second jaw <b>250</b>). While this is not strictly required for a working dissection device, this approach advantageously reduces the number of moving parts and failure points in the design, while permitting the limited cross-section and volume of an endoscopic device to be focused on the mechanically integrity and strength of a single, moving jaw. This is also well adapted to use in certain clinical applications, such as to prepare for a resternotomy, where the fixed jaw can rest against a relatively rigid structure such as the sternum and the moving jaw can displace relatively soft tissue and structures adjacent to the sternum.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The coupling of the handle <b>272</b> to the second jaw <b>250</b> is generally illustrated by a series of arrows (<b>201</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>203</b>, <b>204</b>) showing a direction of movement of the handle <b>272</b>, the spring <b>282</b>, the linkage <b>280</b>, and the second jaw <b>250</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a cross-section of an endoscopic device with a jaw in a closed position.

The endoscopic device <b>700</b> may be any of the endoscopic devices described herein, except as specifically noted otherwise. In general, first jaw <b>350</b> and the second jaw <b>370</b> may have a closed position that is bounded by a wedge <b>702</b>. This wedge shape, described in greater detail below, can advantageously facilitate advancement of the endoscopic device <b>700</b> along a space between two tissue layers to permit dissection of tissue coupling the adjacent layers.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In general, the wedge <b>702</b> described herein may be formed by two planar surfaces <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> contacting two opposing sides of the tube <b>310</b> at the distal end region of the endoscopic device <b>700</b> and intersecting at a vertex <b>708</b> on the first side <b>304</b> of the plane passing through the central axis <b>318</b>.

Stated differently, the two planar surfaces <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> may extend normally from the plane of the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. The two planar surfaces <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> may be generally parallel to an axis of rotation of the pivot <b>352</b>, and normal to the plane described above that divides the endoscopic device <b>700</b> into a first side <b>304</b> and a second side <b>306</b> along the central axis <b>318</b>. Thus, in one aspect, the wedge <b>702</b> may contact a cross section of the first exterior surface <b>356</b> of the first jaw <b>350</b> and the second exterior surface <b>386</b> of the second jaw <b>370</b> in a second plane orthogonal to the plane through the central axis <b>318</b>. At the vertex <b>708</b>, the two planar surfaces <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> may form an interior angle <b>710</b> of about five degrees to about thirty degrees, or an interior angle of about five to about sixty degrees, or about ten to thirty degrees, or about ten to about sixty degrees, or any angle or range of angles between any of these example ranges.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In another aspect, the wedge <b>702</b> may be an asymmetrical wedge with the vertex <b>708</b> away from the central axis <b>318</b>. For example, a first planar surface <b>704</b> of the wedge <b>702</b> may extend from and be parallel with an exterior side of the tube <b>310</b> where the tube <b>310</b> joins the first jaw <b>350</b>. In another aspect, the wedge <b>702</b> may include a first planar surface <b>704</b> substantially parallel to the central axis <b>318</b> and aligned with a point <b>710</b> on an exterior surface of the distal end region <b>312</b> of the tube <b>310</b>, and a second planar surface <b>706</b> intersecting a radially opposing point <b>712</b> on the exterior surface of the distal end region <b>312</b> of the tube, where, as generally noted above, the two planar surfaces <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> envelope the two jaws <b>350</b>, <b>370</b> in the closed position. More generally, an asymmetrical wedge may be formed with the vertex <b>708</b> of the wedge <b>702</b> radially closer to an exterior of the tube than the central axis <b>318</b> of the tube, e.g., when looking along the central axis <b>318</b>, or within a projection along the central axis <b>318</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It will be appreciated that, while the points of contact <b>710</b>, <b>712</b> between the wedge <b>702</b> and the tube <b>310</b> are illustrated as being at similar axial positions lengthwise along the central axis <b>318</b>, this is not strictly geometrically required. The distal end region <b>312</b> of the endoscopic device <b>700</b> may take many generally wedge-like shapes, and the wedge <b>702</b> may more generally contact any point or points along a convex hull of the distal end region <b>312</b> such that the wedge <b>702</b> contacts at least one point on each side of the plan passing through the central axis <b>318</b>, and the wedge <b>702</b> wholly encompasses (inclusively, e.g., including points of contact) the distal end region <b>312</b> when the endoscopic device <b>700</b> is in a closed position.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In general, this wedge shape, and in particular, the asymmetrical wedge shape, advantageously permits the endoscopic device <b>700</b> to be advanced between two layers of tissue within a surgical site, with the first jaw <b>350</b> remaining in contact with one of the tissue layers in order to preferentially follow that tissue layer while advancing. The ends of the first jaw <b>350</b> and the second jaw <b>370</b> may converge near the vertex <b>708</b> of the wedge <b>702</b> to steer the endoscopic device <b>700</b> between the two layers and urge the tissue layers apart as the endoscopic device <b>700</b> advances.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an endoscopic device used in a surgical procedure. In general, the tip or vertex of the jaw is advanced toward adhesions or other connective structures between two adjacent tissue planes or layers. When inserted into this space, the jaws may be opened (e.g., by actuating a handle of the endoscopic device) to create a working volume between the two tissue layers. An endoscopic tool such as a cutting tool may then be advanced through a working channel of the endoscopic device to cut, cauterize, or otherwise dissect or remove the connective structures, thus clearing a path for the endoscopic device to be further advanced in a direction toward a surgical site where a surgery is to be performed.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one aspect, the surgery may include a procedure such as dissecting retrosternal adhesions prior to a resternotomy. In general, adhesions may form between the heart and the sternum after a sternotomy, increasing the time and risk for subsequent sternotomies. In this context, a minimally invasive tool for interlayer tissue dissection can facilitate subsequent procedures by providing a device targeted at dissection of adhesions of the conjoined tissue without requiring open surgery. This principle may also or instead be usefully employed in a range of minimally invasive procedures involving interlayer dissection such as a minimally invasive coronary artery bypass surgery, a minimally invasive thymectomy, or other surgical applications such as mediastinoscopy, endoscopic breast surgery, or extraperitoneal ventral hernia repairs.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a jaw transmission for an endoscopic device. In general, the endoscopic device <b>900</b> may be any of the endoscopic devices described herein, except as specifically otherwise noted. In one aspect, the endoscopic device <b>900</b> may include a gear and capstan assembly <b>902</b> including a handle <b>904</b> with a gear <b>906</b> that couples the handle <b>904</b> to a capstan <b>908</b>, which in turn drives a linkage to a moving jaw <b>910</b>. This arrangement provides an additional mechanism&#x2014;the gearing ratio&#x2014;for controlling the degree of mechanical advantage provided in the transmission of force from the handle to the moving jaw <b>910</b>. Other techniques such as a cable/pulley system, multiple gears, hydraulic systems, or the like may also or instead be employed to transmit manual force by a user to actuate the moving jaw <b>910</b> of the endoscopic device <b>900</b>. It will also be appreciated that, while the endoscopic device <b>900</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is illustrated with a rigid housing, the exterior of the endoscopic body may also or instead include a flexible length as necessary and/or helpful for use in different surgical contexts, e.g., for adaptation to different physiological geometries and surgical procedures.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows an endoscopic device <b>1000</b>.

In an embodiment, the ends <b>1002</b> of the jaws <b>1004</b> of the endoscopic device <b>1000</b> may flair outward from the envelope of the tube and provide a straight edge at the distal end orthogonal to the direction of movement. This general shape, where geometrically suitable to a surgical site, can increase the effective width of the working volume provided by the separating jaws, thus affording a greater range of movement for a cutting tool or other endoscopic tool deployed through a working channel of the device <b>1000</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows an endoscopic device <b>1100</b>. The endoscopic device <b>1100</b> may be any of the endoscopic devices described herein, except as specifically noted otherwise. In an embodiment, the leading edge <b>1102</b> or distal end of the jaws may provide a straight edge orthogonal to the direction of movement. It will also be noted that the tips of the first jaw and second jaw may meet closer to a center access of the endoscopic device <b>1100</b>, thus driving the wedge more centrally between two tissue layers, rather than preferentially following one of the layers with the surface of the fixed jaw, e.g., when using one of the asymmetrical wedges described above. Although the two jaws meet in a location closer to the central axis, the pivot may still preferably be placed on a side of the central axis opposing the first (stationary) jaw, in order to facilitate a motion that creates a working volume aligned to the center axis for deployment of surgical tools and the like.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It will also be understood that the endoscopic device <b>1100</b> may usefully have a generally circular cross-section along its length. This shape can facilitate deployment through a conventional, minimally invasive trocar while permitting axial rotation as necessary or helpful during a surgical procedure. In another aspect, the cross-section may be flattened, e.g., to form an oval, rectangle (e.g., with rounded edges, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), or the like, to resist axial rotation of the endoscopic device during a procedure.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows an endoscopic device <b>1200</b>.

In one aspect, the endoscopic device <b>1200</b> may include serrations <b>1202</b> on at least one of the first exterior surface (of the first, stationary jaw) and the second exterior surface (of the second, moving jaw). These serrations may form teeth or the like oriented to resist a retreat of the first jaw and the second jaw along a forward surgical path of the endoscopic device <b>1200</b>. Thus, as distinguished from the smooth finish illustrated in the preceding drawings, the endoscopic device <b>1200</b> may include lateral serrations with ridges running perpendicular to the central axis of the device (e.g., perpendicular to a direction of motion of the endoscopic device <b>1200</b>), cross serrations such as a cross-hatched pattern of serrations, or any other pattern or combination of patterns suitable for engaging the jaw(s) with surrounding tissue to retain position and minimize unintended movement of the endoscopic device <b>1200</b> forward and/or backward along a path toward a surgical site during a procedure.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Numerous variations and adaptations are possible.
