In the cross section perpendicular to the tire axial direction TA, the inclination angle &#x3b8; of the inclined surface <b>32</b>, which has curved shape, with respect to the tire radial direction TR is formed to increase gradually from the inner side in the tire width direction to the outer side the tire width direction. The operation of the shoulder lateral groove (lateral groove) <b>30</b> having the inclined surface <b>32</b> with curved shape on at least one of the groove walls <b>31</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> to <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the tire rolls, a deformation of the tread section <b>10</b> on the kick-out side on the contact surface of the tire starts by widening the groove width of the shoulder lateral groove <b>30</b> on an outer side of the tire width direction TW, that is, on the tread end TE side of the tire in this embodiment, and then on an inner side of the tire width direction TW.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">At the boundary position t<b>1</b> between the tire and the ground illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the inclined surface <b>32</b> with curved shape of the present embodiment has a configuration, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>(<i>c</i>) and <b>4</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, of being inclined significantly with respect to the tire radial direction TR on the tread end TE side (outer side in the tire width direction) where the groove width starts to widen. Therefore, the snow column formed by pressing a snow entered into the shoulder lateral groove <b>30</b> at the contact surface of the tire is easily detached from the groove wall at outer side in the tire width direction TW on the inclined surface <b>32</b> with curved shape.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, the inclined surface <b>32</b> with curved shape of the present embodiment includes a configuration in which the inclination angle &#x3b8;, the inclination angle from the groove bottom <b>33</b> to the tread surface <b>35</b>, with respect to the tire radial direction TR, becomes gradually smaller toward the inner side in the tire width direction TW as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>4</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> in the cross section perpendicular to the tire axial direction TA.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Since a portion moved to a state not in contact with the ground surface, which is a state the portion being not subjected to the ground contact pressure, can be deformed in the tire circumferential direction larger than a portion in a state being in contact with the ground surface, the inclined surface <b>32</b> with curved shape of the present embodiment is torsionally deformed as the boundary position between the tire and the ground surface illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shifts from t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b> and then from t<b>2</b> to t<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Thus, the inclined surface <b>32</b> with curved shape facilitates detachment of snow from the groove wall <b>31</b> of the shoulder lateral groove <b>30</b>. That is, snow hardly remains in the groove on the other groove wall of the shoulder lateral groove <b>30</b> opposed to the groove wall <b>31</b>. According to this configuration, the shoulder lateral groove <b>30</b> can grasp new snow when contacting the ground again by the tire rolling. Therefore, a snow column shearing force, the force generated when shearing a snow in the shoulder lateral groove <b>30</b>, is enhanced, and the on-snow performance of the tire is improved.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the present embodiment, the inclined surface <b>32</b> with curved shape is formed in the groove wall <b>31</b> of the shoulder lateral groove <b>30</b>. However, a portion where the inclined surface <b>32</b> with curved shape is formed is not limited to the shoulder lateral groove <b>30</b> formed in the shoulder land region SR. The portion where the inclined surface <b>32</b> with curved shape is formed may be formed in a lateral groove extending in the tire width direction TW.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Specifically, in the lateral groove extending in the tire width direction TW, if the inclination angle &#x3b8; of the inclined surface <b>32</b>, which has curved shape, with respect to the tire radial direction TR in the cross section perpendicular to the tire axial direction TA is gradually increased from the inner side in the tire width direction TW on the tire equatorial line CL side to the outer side of the tire width direction TW, the inclined surface <b>32</b> with curved shape exhibits excellent on-snow performance.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the case where the center land region CR has a structure in which a plurality of land blocks are densely arranged as in the present embodiment, the center land region CR is partitioned by the circumferential narrow grooves <b>200</b>. Therefore, the blocks or ribs partitioned by the circumferential narrow grooves <b>200</b> support each other along the circumferential direction during deformation, and deformation of the blocks or ribs in the tire width direction TW is suppressed. Therefore, uneven wear resistance in the center land region CR can be improved. Further, the rolling resistance of the tire can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">When the center land region CR has a structure, in which a plurality of land blocks are densely arranged, deformation of the center land region CR in the tire width direction TW is suppressed. As a result, the ground pressure in the shoulder land region SR is relatively increased. Accordingly, deformation of the shoulder land region SR becomes large. In such a configuration, when the inclined surface <b>32</b> with curved shape is formed in the lateral groove <b>30</b> of the shoulder land region SR, a dynamic torsional deformation of the block <b>40</b> becomes large, and the on-snow performance is further improved.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the circumferential narrow groove <b>210</b> may communicate with the inclined surface with curved shape. Since the circumferential narrow groove <b>210</b> is shallower than the groove depth of the shoulder lateral groove <b>30</b>, the block <b>40</b> can be deformed circumferentially to such an extent that the dynamic torsional deformation of the inclined surface <b>32</b> with curved shape extending in the tire width direction TW is not inhibited. Therefore, the uneven wear resistance of the tire can be improved while securing the effect of improving on-snow performance by the inclined surface <b>32</b> with curved shape.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>3</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, when the inclined surface <b>32</b> with curved shape is inclined linearly from the groove bottom <b>33</b> of the groove wall <b>31</b> to the tread surface in the cross section perpendicular to the tire axial direction TA, the deformed shape due to the dynamic torsional deformation of the block <b>40</b> on the inclined surface <b>32</b> with curved shape is more stable, and the effect of improving the on-snow performance can be stably secured.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>4</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, when the inclined surface <b>32</b> with curved shape is a surface from the groove bottom <b>33</b> of the groove wall <b>31</b> to the tread surface <b>35</b> that is inclined in a downward convex manner in the cross section perpendicular to the tire axial direction TA, the durability of the inclined surface <b>32</b> with curved shape against dynamic torsional deformation can be improved.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">This application claims priority under Japanese patent application 2019-216888, filed Nov. 29, 2019, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Thus, although embodiments of the invention have been described, it should not be understood that the arguments and drawings that form part of this disclosure limit the invention.
