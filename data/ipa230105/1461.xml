num="0003">BACKGROUND ART</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, semiconductors are manufactured by iteratively performing a series of processes, such as lithography, deposition, and etching. Contaminants, such as various particles, metal impurities, or organic materials, remain on a surface of a substrate of a semiconductor due to the iterative processes. Due to the contaminants on the substrate, the semiconductor may be less reliable, and thus, to remove the contaminants, a process of cleaning a substrate in a manufacturing process of a semiconductor is required.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, a substrate processing process using a supercritical fluid has been adopted. In the processing process using the supercritical fluid, high pressure is required to be formed inside a processing space to satisfy a condition of the supercritical fluid. To withstand the high pressure formed inside the processing space, a method of clamping a chamber and a door has been used. However, although the chamber and the door are clamped, there is a problem that the high pressure formed inside the processing space pushes the door and the like and while the door is pushed, components are grounded due to friction between the components. Accordingly, there is a demand for a substrate processing apparatus having a structure that may effectively withstand the high pressure formed inside the processing space.</p><p id="p-0007"

In the processing space S, a substrate processing process may be performed. A supercritical fluid may be provided to the processing space S. A seating portion for mounting the substrate may be provided in the processing space S. The chamber unit <b>11</b> may include an opening O for loading and unloading the substrate to the processing space S. In addition, one side of the chamber unit <b>11</b> may include an inclined chamber surface <b>111</b> inclinedly formed. For example, the inclined chamber surface <b>111</b> may be inclined in a direction in which an inclined surface thereof faces the ground. The opening <b>0</b> may be formed in the inclined chamber surface <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The door unit <b>12</b> may be coupled to the chamber unit <b>11</b> to open and close the processing space S. When the door unit <b>12</b> is coupled to the chamber unit <b>11</b>, the processing space S and the opening O may be closed. The door unit <b>12</b> may include an inclined door surface <b>121</b> corresponding to the inclined chamber surface <b>111</b>. That is, the inclined chamber surface <b>111</b> and the inclined door surface <b>121</b> may be formed by inclination angles corresponding to each other. When the door unit <b>12</b> is coupled to the chamber unit <b>11</b>, the inclined door surface <b>121</b> may contact the inclined chamber surface <b>111</b>. In other words, when the door unit <b>12</b> is coupled to the chamber unit <b>11</b>, the opening O formed in the inclined chamber surface <b>111</b> may be closed as the inclined door surface <b>121</b> covers the inclined chamber surface <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The door unit <b>12</b> may be driven by the door driving unit <b>13</b>. The door driving unit <b>13</b> may move the door unit <b>12</b> in parallel to couple the door unit <b>12</b> to the chamber unit <b>11</b>. In other words, by moving the door unit <b>12</b> in parallel, the door driving unit <b>13</b> may open or close the processing space S. For example, the door driving unit <b>13</b> may drive the door unit <b>12</b> in the vertical direction. The door driving unit <b>13</b> may include a piston, a cylinder, and a motor.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As described above, when a contact portion of the chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b> is formed in an inclined surface, the inclined chamber surface <b>111</b> and the inclined door surface <b>121</b> may contact each other by vertical driving of the door driving unit <b>13</b>, and thus, a grinding issue occurring by the contact may be minimized. Accordingly, a particle occurring due to abrasion of a member may be minimized. In addition, since the inclined chamber surface <b>111</b> is inclined in a direction toward the ground, even if a particle has generated, an inflow of the particle into the processing space S through the opening O may be prevented. In addition, the contact between the inclined chamber surface <b>111</b> and the inclined door surface <b>121</b> may collectively include a direct contact as well as an indirect contact. For example, the inclined door surface <b>121</b> may indirectly contact the inclined chamber surface <b>111</b> through the sealing unit <b>14</b> described below.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b> may further include a structure for increasing coupling. An upper surface of the door unit <b>12</b> may include a protrusion <b>122</b> protruding upward. The chamber unit <b>11</b> may include a recess <b>112</b> formed in a corresponding shape for inserting the protrusion <b>122</b> of the door unit <b>12</b>. As the door unit <b>12</b> moves toward the chamber unit <b>11</b> in the vertical direction, the protrusion <b>122</b> may be inserted into the recess <b>112</b>. According to the structure described above, by the high pressure formed inside the processing space S, the door unit <b>12</b> may be prevented from being pushed in the horizontal direction (or a front-rear direction) with respect to the chamber unit <b>11</b>. That is, a movement in the horizontal direction (or the front-rear direction) of the door unit <b>12</b> may be restricted as the protrusion <b>122</b> and the recess <b>112</b> are coupled to each other. Meanwhile, one surface of the protrusion <b>122</b> may include at least a portion of the inclined door surface <b>121</b>. That is, the protrusion <b>122</b> may be formed on an extended surface of the inclined door surface <b>121</b>. The other surface of the protrusion <b>122</b> may be inclined in an opposite direction to the inclined door surface <b>121</b>. Alternatively, the other surface of the protrusion <b>122</b> may be formed in the vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The sealing unit <b>14</b> may maintain sealing of the chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b>. The sealing unit <b>14</b> may be installed on the contact portion of the chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b> along the circumference of the opening O. For example, the sealing unit <b>14</b> may be installed in the inclined door surface <b>121</b> of the door unit <b>12</b>. The sealing unit <b>14</b> may also be installed in the inclined chamber surface <b>111</b> of the chamber unit <b>11</b>. The sealing unit <b>14</b> may seal the periphery of the opening O when the chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b> are coupled to each other. For example, the sealing unit <b>14</b> may include a U-shaped sealing member. The U-shaped sealing member may be disposed to connect a U-shaped space to the processing space S. According to the structure described above, as a supercritical fluid that flowed into the processing space S flows into the U-shaped space of the U-shaped sealing member, the U-shaped sealing member may stretch on both sides and a sealing force may increase. The sealing unit <b>14</b> may include an O-ring.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The clamp unit <b>15</b> may clamp the chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b> when the chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b> are coupled to each other. The clamp unit <b>15</b> may be formed in a frame shape having a hollow inside. The clamp unit <b>15</b> may enclose at least a portion of the door unit <b>12</b> and the chamber unit <b>11</b>. That is, the chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b> may be prevented from being separated from each other by inserting at least a portion of the door unit <b>12</b> and the chamber unit <b>11</b> into the hollow of the clamp unit <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The clamp unit <b>15</b> may include a lower clamp body <b>151</b>, an upper clamp body <b>152</b>, and a side clamp body <b>153</b>. The lower clamp body <b>151</b> may contact the door unit <b>12</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the lower clamp body <b>151</b> may be inserted into a clamp insert groove <b>123</b> formed in the door unit <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the lower clamp body <b>151</b> may support the door unit <b>12</b> from a lower direction by contacting a lower surface of the door unit <b>12</b>. The upper clamp body <b>152</b> may be disposed on an upper side of the lower clamp body <b>151</b> and be apart from the lower clamp body <b>151</b>. For example, the upper clamp body <b>152</b> may support the chamber unit <b>11</b> from an up direction by contacting an upper surface of the chamber unit <b>11</b>. The side clamp body <b>153</b> may connect both sides of the lower clamp body <b>151</b> to both sides of the upper clamp body <b>152</b>, respectively. According to the structure described above, the clamp unit <b>15</b> may be formed in a frame shape having a hollow inside.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The clamp unit <b>15</b> may be driven by the clamp driving unit <b>16</b>. The clamp driving unit <b>16</b> may move the clamp unit <b>15</b> in parallel such that the clamp unit <b>15</b> is coupled to the chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b>. For example, the clamp driving unit <b>16</b> may drive the clamp unit <b>15</b> in the front-rear direction. The clamp unit <b>15</b> may move in a direction approaching the chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b> by the clamp driving unit <b>16</b> and at least a portion of the door unit <b>12</b> and the chamber unit <b>11</b> may be inserted into the hollow inside of the clamp unit <b>15</b>. The clamp driving unit <b>16</b> may include a piston, a cylinder, and a motor.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As described above, when the chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b> are coupled to each other, as the clamp unit <b>15</b> encloses at least a portion of the chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b>, the chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b> may be prevented from being separated in the vertical direction even if high pressure is formed in the processing space S. That is, by the pressure formed inside the processing space S, the door unit <b>12</b> may be prevented from being pushed in the vertical direction (or an up-down direction) with respect to the chamber unit <b>11</b>. Accordingly, a movement in the vertical direction (or the up-down direction) of the door unit <b>12</b> may be restricted. The door unit <b>12</b> may further include a clamp insert groove <b>123</b>. The clamp insert groove <b>123</b> may be a space into which the lower clamp body <b>151</b> is inserted. The clamp insert groove <b>123</b> may be inwardly recessed from a counter surface of the door unit <b>12</b> to a surface of the chamber unit <b>11</b>. The counter surface to the chamber unit <b>11</b> may be a surface that does not contact the chamber unit <b>11</b>. For example, the clamp insert groove <b>123</b> may be formed in a front surface of the door unit <b>12</b>. As described above, when the clamp insert groove <b>123</b> is formed in the door unit <b>12</b>, the size of the clamp unit <b>15</b> may decrease. More particularly, the length in the vertical direction of the clamp unit <b>15</b> may be less in the structure in which the lower clamp body <b>151</b> is inserted into the clamp insert groove <b>123</b> formed in the door unit <b>12</b>, compared to the structure in which the lower clamp body <b>151</b> contacts the lower surface of the door unit <b>12</b>. Accordingly, as the size of the clamp unit <b>15</b> decreases, cost and power may decrease and stability may be secured.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">An upper surface <b>123</b><i>a </i>of the clamp insert groove <b>123</b> may be downwardly inclined in a moving direction of the clamp unit <b>15</b>. Here, the moving direction of the clamp unit <b>15</b> may be a direction in which the clamp unit <b>15</b> approaches the door unit <b>12</b>. In addition, an upper surface <b>151</b><i>a </i>of the lower clamp body <b>151</b> may be downwardly inclined in the moving direction of the clamp unit <b>15</b> to correspond to the upper surface <b>123</b><i>a </i>of the clamp insert groove <b>123</b>. As described above, in case the upper surface <b>151</b><i>a </i>of the lower clamp body <b>151</b> and the upper surface <b>123</b><i>a </i>of the clamp insert groove <b>123</b> are inclined, the lower clamp body <b>151</b> may be inserted into the clamp insert groove <b>123</b> without a collision even if there is a difference in heights. Accordingly, the clamp unit <b>15</b> may improve insertion stability.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the clamp unit <b>15</b> may further include a clamp uneven portion <b>154</b> formed on the lower surface of the upper clamp body <b>152</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the clamp uneven portion <b>154</b> may protrude from the lower surface of the upper clamp body <b>152</b>. The clamp uneven portion <b>154</b> may be recessed in the lower surface of the upper clamp body <b>152</b>. A plurality of clamp uneven portions <b>154</b> may be provided. The chamber unit <b>11</b> may include a chamber uneven portion <b>113</b> formed on the upper surface of the chamber unit <b>11</b> to be coupled to the clamp uneven portion <b>154</b>. The chamber uneven portion <b>113</b> may be formed in a shape and a number corresponding to the clamp uneven portion <b>154</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the chamber uneven portion <b>113</b> may be recessed in the upper surface of the chamber unit <b>11</b>. The chamber uneven portion <b>113</b> may protrude from the upper surface of the chamber unit <b>11</b>. A plurality of chamber uneven portions <b>113</b> may be provided. When the clamp unit <b>15</b> moves toward the chamber unit <b>11</b>, the clamp uneven portion <b>154</b> may be coupled to the chamber uneven portion <b>113</b> by being inserted into the chamber uneven portion <b>113</b>. According to the structure described above, by the high pressure formed inside the processing space S, the chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b> may be prevented from being pushed in a left-right direction.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The clamp unit <b>15</b> may further include an inclined connecting part <b>155</b>. The inclined connecting part <b>155</b> may be formed in an inclined surface at a connection portion in which the side clamp body <b>153</b> is connected to at least one of the lower clamp body <b>151</b> and the upper clamp body <b>152</b>. In other words, the inclined connecting part <b>155</b> may inclinedly connect the side clamp body <b>153</b> to a vertical connection portion in which the lower clamp body <b>151</b> connects to the upper clamp body <b>152</b>. At least one of the chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b> may further include inclined chamfers <b>114</b> and <b>124</b> formed in an inclined surface at a corner thereof for inserting the inclined connecting part <b>155</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b> may include the inclined chamfers <b>114</b> and <b>124</b> respectively at corners. As described above, when the inclined connecting part <b>155</b> and the inclined chamfers <b>114</b> and <b>124</b> are included, the clamp unit <b>15</b> may be prevented from colliding with a corner when entering the chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b>. Accordingly, the insertion stability of the clamp unit <b>15</b> may be improved.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The pressurizer <b>17</b> may press the door unit <b>12</b> in a constant direction for the chamber unit <b>11</b> and the door unit <b>12</b> to be in close contact. The pressurizer <b>17</b> may be driven while a supercritical processing process is performed. The pressurizer <b>17</b>, for example, may press the door unit <b>12</b> in the front-rear direction. The pressurizer <b>17</b> may press the door unit <b>12</b> in the vertical direction. As the pressurizer <b>17</b> presses the door unit <b>12</b> with respect to the chamber unit <b>11</b>, horizontality and verticality of the door unit <b>12</b> may be corrected and a sealing force may increase. In addition, the pressurizer <b>17</b> may be integrally formed with the door driving unit <b>13</b> as one.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A sensor <b>18</b> may measure a coupling state of the door unit <b>12</b> and the chamber unit <b>11</b>. The sensor <b>18</b> may measure at least one of a distance and an inclination angle between the door unit <b>12</b> and the chamber unit <b>11</b>, and a pressure applied between the door unit <b>12</b> and the chamber unit <b>11</b>. For example, by measuring at least one of the distance between the door unit <b>12</b> and the chamber unit <b>11</b>, the inclination angle, and the pressure applied between the door unit <b>12</b> and the chamber unit <b>11</b>, the sensor <b>18</b> may measure a degree of close contact between the door unit <b>12</b> and the chamber unit <b>11</b>, whether the door unit <b>12</b> and the chamber unit <b>11</b> are coupled in a regular position, and whether the opening <b>0</b> is closed. Based on a measurement result measured by the sensor <b>18</b>, an alert may be generated based on a determination that the door unit <b>12</b> and the chamber unit <b>11</b> do not closely contact each other, the door unit <b>12</b> and the chamber unit <b>11</b> are not coupled in the regular position, or the opening O is not closed. Specifically, based on the determination that the door unit <b>12</b> and the chamber unit <b>11</b> do not closely contact each other, the door unit <b>12</b> and the chamber unit <b>11</b> may closely contact each other by driving the pressurizer <b>17</b>. Based on the determination that the door unit <b>12</b> and the chamber unit <b>11</b> are not coupled in the regular position or the opening O is not closed, the door unit <b>12</b> and the chamber <b>11</b> may be coupled to each other again by driving the door driving unit <b>13</b> again. The sensor <b>18</b>, for example, may include an infrared sensor, a gyro sensor, a touch detection sensor, and a pressure sensor. The sensor <b>18</b> may be positioned at the contact portion of the door unit <b>12</b> and the chamber unit <b>11</b>. For example, the sensor <b>18</b> may be positioned on the inclined door surface <b>121</b> of the door unit <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">A number of example embodiments have been described above.
