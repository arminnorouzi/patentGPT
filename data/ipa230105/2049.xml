For example, certain military aircraft are configured to discharge various types of stores, such as munitions including bombs, missiles, rockets, or the like, and non-munitions, such as electronic equipment, devices, chaff, decoys, and/or the like. As another example, commercial aircraft can be configured to discharge various stores, such as products for delivery (which may be coupled to parachutes).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Known methods for internal store deployment include doors opening in the inboard or outboard direction about an axis that is parallel to a longitudinal axis of an aircraft. Such systems are configured to allow the stores to drop down from the aircraft. Such methods for store deployment are suitable for subsonic and supersonic store release.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in relation to hypersonic aircraft, extreme air-loads and temperatures associated with store release make traditional known deployment methods impossible or next to impossible. In particular, during hypersonic flight, aerodynamic flow fields along with a turbulent boundary layer proximate to the hypersonic aircraft create strong shocks on surfaces (such as bay doors) protruding from a mold line of the aircraft. Additionally, cavity flow in a store bay can cause intense acoustic shocks on the bay structure. Further, air friction can generate extreme heat on surfaces of the hypersonic aircraft.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A need exists for an efficient and effective system and method for deploying one or more stores from an aircraft. Further, a need exists for a system and method for deploying one or more stores from a hypersonic aircraft.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">With those needs in mind, certain embodiments of the subject disclosure provide a system for ejecting a store from an aircraft. The system includes a stowage tube configured to retain the store. The stowage tube includes an open rear end. A door panel is coupled to the stowage tube. An actuator driven linkage is coupled to the door panel. The actuator driven linkage is configured to rotate the door panel about a pivot axis at a forward edge opposite from an aft end between a closed position associated with a stowed position of the system and an open position associated with a deployed position of the system. The stowage tube is configured to rearwardly eject the store out of the open rear end when the system is in the deployed position.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In at least one embodiment, the system also includes an ejector valve in fluid communication with a chamber having a piston. The piston is configured to engage the store. The ejector valve provides pressurized fluid to move the piston to eject the store when the system is in the deployed position. As an example, the piston is configured to travel over a stroke of at least twenty four inches.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In at least one example, the ejector valve includes a regulating orifice sized to controllably regulate flow of the pressurized fluid to cause an applied force to the piston to increase with stroke. The piston is configured to impart a high end-of-stroke velocity to the store. As a further example, the ejector valve also includes a poppet valve.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In at least one embodiment, a lower surface of the door panel is flush with an outer mold line of the aircraft when the system is in the stowed position.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In at least one embodiment, the aircraft is a hypersonic aircraft.

In at least one embodiment, the aircraft is a hypersonic aircraft. The systems and methods include one or more drive mechanisms configured to direct the store(s) into an external air-stream. In particular, the stores are ejected in an aft direction away from a forward end of the aircraft, thereby reducing aerodynamic forces impacted on a mold line of the aircraft and the store. In at least one example, stored energy in the form of pressurized gas (for example, Nitrogen or Air) is utilized to eject the store(s) in the aft direction. In at least one example, a piston assembly provides a long impulse with low peak ejection forces, thereby ensuring a high end-of-stroke velocity (for example, 40 ft/sec) while reducing load on the store.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Certain examples of the subject disclosure provide an ejector system for ejecting a store from an aircraft. The ejector system includes an actuator drive linkage configured to cause an aft end of a door panel to rotate about a forward edge or end of the door panel between a stowed position (in which the door panel is flush with a mold line of the aircraft) and a deployed position. In at least one embodiment, a valve pressurizes a piston to push the store in a tube out through an open aft end into an air stream.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic block diagram of an aircraft <b>100</b> including a system <b>102</b> for ejecting one or more stores <b>104</b>, according to an embodiment of the subject disclosure.

In order to move the system <b>102</b> into the deployed position, the actuator driven linkage <b>106</b> is activated into an extended position. For example, the actuator(s) <b>142</b> are operated to pivot the lower link arm <b>144</b> and the upper link arm <b>145</b> into a straight (or substantially straight) position, thereby forcing the door panel <b>110</b> to open about the pivot axis <b>112</b>. In this manner, the stowage tubes <b>116</b> are pivoted downwardly below the mold line <b>164</b> such that the open rear ends <b>134</b> of the stowage tubes <b>116</b> are exposed below and rearwardly. At the same time, the lower surface <b>133</b> of the door panel <b>110</b> shields the stores <b>104</b> from an air stream <b>170</b>.
