present application claims priority to Republic of Korea Patent Application No. 10-2021-0085964, filed on Jun. 30, 2021, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus, and more particularly to a flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus strengthened in the rigidity of a bending portion thereof.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A display apparatus has recently been developed to have excellent characteristics including thin thickness, light weight, low power consumption, etc., and is widely applied to various fields.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A flexible organic light-emitting display (OLED) apparatus, also called a flexible organic light emitting diode display or an organic electroluminescent display apparatus, refers to an apparatus that emits light as electric charges are injected into an emissive layer (EML) formed between an electron injection electrode, (e.g., a cathode) and a hole injection electrode, (e.g., an anode), and excitons formed by a combination of electrons and holes are extinguished. Such a flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus can be formed even on a plastic or the like flexible substrate, has a high contrast ratio because it is a self-emissive type, has a response time of several microseconds (&#x3bc;s), is easy to realize a moving image, has no limitations to a view angle, is stable at low temperature, and has a driving circuit easily manufactured and designed because it can be driven by a relatively low voltage of 5V to 15V.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the organic light-emitting display apparatus, the EML of organic material is disposed between two electrodes, (e.g., the anode and the cathode). When holes from the anode are injected into the EML and electrons from the cathode are injected into the EML, the injected electrons and holes are recombined to form the excitons in the EML, thereby emitting light.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this case, the EML includes a host material and a dopant material that interact with each other. The host material serves to generate excitons based on electrons and holes and transfer energy to the dopant material, and the dopant material, which is a small amount of organic dye material to be added, serves to receive energy from the host material and convert the energy into light.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus including an organic EML is encapsulated with glass, metal or a film to block inflow of water or oxygen from the outside, thereby preventing the EML and the electrode from being oxidized and protecting the EML and the electrode against mechanical or physical impact from the outside.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The organic light-emitting display apparatus does not need a separate light source and is thus suitable for a flexible display apparatus. In this case, plastic, thin-film metal film (e.g., metal foil), or the like flexible material is used as the substrate for the organic light-emitting display apparatus.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Meanwhile, research has been carried out to implement the organic light-emitting display apparatus as a flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus and bend or curve various portions of the display apparatus based on flexibility. Such research is being generally conducted for a new design, user interface/user experience (UI/UX), and efforts to reduce the thickness of the flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus are being continuously made.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Besides, efforts are also being continuously made to prevent wiring of the flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus from being cracked in an area where a flexible substrate is bent.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The disclosure is to provide a structure for reducing the problem that wiring is cracked in a bending area of a substrate in flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, the disclosure is to provide a structure for strengthening the rigidity of a bending area in flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Subject matters in the disclosure are not limited to the subject matters mentioned above, and other subject matters not mentioned will be clearly understood by those skilled in the art from the following description.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, a flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus comprises: a substrate comprising a first area including a plurality of pixels, a bending area that is bent and extends from one side of the first area, and a second area that extends from one side of the bending area and faces at least a portion of the first area; and a backplate on a rear of the substrate and in contact with the rear of the substrate, the backplate comprising a bending structure that reduces stress applied to the bending area of the substrate and repulsive force while the bending area of the substrate is bent.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, a flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus comprises: a substrate comprising a first area including a plurality of pixels, a second area that faces the first area and including a pad portion, and a bending area that is bent and is between the first area and the second area, the bending area including a plurality of wires that extend from the first area to the second area; and a backplate in contact with a surface of the substrate, the backplate including a first portion that overlaps the first area of the substrate, a second portion that overlaps the second area of the substrate, and a bendable backplate portion that overlaps the bending area of the substrate, the bendable backplate portion more bendable than the first portion and the second portion of the backplate.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Detailed matters of other embodiments are included in the detailed description and the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to embodiments of the disclosure, a bending structure having plurality slit patterns is provided in a bending portion of a backplate placed on a rear surface of a substrate, thereby preventing damage or deformation when the external force is applied to a bending area of the substrate. In other words, it is possible to secure the rigidity of the bending area of the substrate. Further, due to the bending structure from which the backplate is partially removed, repulsive force is more decreased than that of no bending structure so that the backplate can maintain curvature without being folded.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Matters of the disclosure described in problems to be solved, means for solving the problem, and effects do not specify the essential features of claims, and therefore the scope of claims are not limited by the described matters.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a plan view schematically illustrating an exemplary flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus that may be included in an electronic apparatus according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a partial cross-sectional view schematically illustrating a pixel included in flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view schematically illustrating flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a partial cross-sectional view schematically illustrating a stacked structure of a flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a plan view schematically illustrating a backplate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> according to one embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Advantages and characteristics of the present disclosure, and a method of achieving the advantages and characteristics will be clear by referring to the embodiments described below in detail together with the accompanying drawings.

One or more inactive areas I/A may be disposed around the active area A/A. For example, the inactive area I/A may be adjacent to one or more sides of the active area A/A.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The inactive area I/A surrounds a quadrangular active area. However, the shape of the active area A/A and the shape/layout of the inactive area I/A adjacent to the active area A/A are not limited to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The shapes of the active area A/A and inactive area I/A may be suitable for designing an electronic apparatus with the flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus <b>100</b>. The active area A/A may, for example, be shaped like a pentagon, a hexagon, a circle, an oval, or the like, but not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Pixels in the active area A/A may be connected to pixel circuits. The pixel circuits may include one or more switching transistors and one or more driving transistors on a backplane. Each pixel circuit may be electrically connected to gate lines and data lines to communicate with one or more driving circuits, such as a gate driver and a data driver provided in the inactive area.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A driver <b>112</b> may be embodied as a thin-film transistor (TFT) in the inactive area I/A. The driver <b>112</b> may be called a gate-in-panel (GIP). Further, some parts such as a data driver integrated circuit (IC) may be mounted to a printed circuit board. A flexible printed circuit board (FPCB), a chip on film (COF), a tape-carrier-package (TCP) or the like circuit film may be used to couple with a connection interface (e.g., a pad, a bump, a pin, etc.) provided in the inactive area I/A.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus <b>100</b> may include various additional elements for generating various signals or driving the pixels in the active area A/A. The additional elements for driving the pixels may include an inverter circuit, a multiplexer, an electrostatic discharge (ESD) circuit, etc. The flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus <b>100</b> may also include additional elements related to functions other than the function of driving the pixels.

For example, the flexible substrate <b>110</b> may be provided as a thin plastic film made of polyimide, polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or the like polymer, but not limited thereto. Therefore, the flexible substrate <b>110</b> is bendable. For example, the flexible substrate <b>110</b> is bendable in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction. Therefore, the flexible substrate <b>110</b> may be bendable in a combination of the vertical, horizontal and diagonal directions based on a design required for the flexible display apparatus <b>100</b>, but there are no limits to a bending direction.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The flexible substrate <b>110</b> includes a first area, a bending area B/A extended from one side of the first area, and a second area extended from one side of the bending area. The first area may be defined as a non-bending area N/A including the active area A/A, and the second area may be defined as a non-bending area N/A including the inactive area I/A placed opposite to the first area with respect to the bending area.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The flexible substrate <b>110</b> may be partially bent, for example, in a lower end portion of the active area as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, the flexible substrate <b>110</b> may be bent in the bending area B/A so that the second area can be folded behind the first area.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows that the inactive area I/A of the flexible substrate <b>110</b> is bent, and the active area of the flexible substrate <b>110</b> is partially bent. In this case, an image may be displayed in a bent area of the active area, and the flexible display apparatus <b>100</b> may include a substantially flat active area and a bent active area.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the inactive area I/A of the second area of the flexible substrate <b>110</b>, a pad portion <b>114</b> or a similar interface is provided. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the pad portion <b>114</b> may, for example, be provided in the inactive area I/A adjacent to the bending area B/A in the lower end portion of the flexible substrate <b>110</b>. The pad portion <b>114</b> is connected to the FPCB or the like circuit film, and may include a connection terminal for connecting the circuit film and a wiring <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A thin film transistor connecting with a flexible organic light-emitting diode in the active area is provided.

In other words, an attaching process for the first backplate <b>320</b>A and the second backplate <b>320</b>B is as follows. First, the backplate formed of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is attached to the entire rear surface of the flexible substrate. After the attachment, the backplate is partially removed corresponding to the bending area of the flexible substrate so that the flexible substrate can be bent. In this case, a laser is used, and a laser cutting condition needs to be precisely controlled for a cutting size of the backplate. However, the low precision of laser cutting may cause an uneven cut surface. Further, the backplate is removed from the rear of the substrate corresponding to the bending area in consideration of the curvature of the bending area in the flexible substrate <b>310</b>, thereby lowering the rigidity of the bending area. When the external force is applied to the bending area of which the rigidity is lowered, the bending area may be damaged due to stress acting on the substrate. Accordingly, the present inventors devised an improved structure for solving the foregoing problems.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a partial cross-section view schematically showing a flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus according to another embodiment of the disclosure, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a plan view for describing a backplate <b>420</b> in an unbent state.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a flexible substrate <b>410</b> may include a first area <b>401</b> corresponding to a plurality of display pixels, a bending area <b>402</b> extending from one side of the first area <b>401</b>, and a second area <b>403</b> extending from one side of the bending area <b>402</b> away from the first area <b>401</b> and facing at least a portion of the first area <b>401</b>. The first area <b>401</b> may be defined as a non-bending area including the active area A/A, and the second area <b>403</b> may be defined as a non-bending area including the inactive area and placed opposite the first area <b>401</b> with respect to the bending area.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The backplate <b>420</b> may be provided in a lower portion, of the flexible organic light-emitting display apparatus <b>400</b> (e.g., on the rear surface of the flexible substrate <b>410</b>) to increase the strength and/or solidity of the flexible substrate <b>410</b>. The backplate <b>420</b> may include a first portion <b>420</b>A corresponding to the first area <b>401</b> of the flexible substrate <b>410</b>, a bending portion <b>420</b>C corresponding to the bending area <b>402</b>, and a second portion <b>420</b>B corresponding to the second area <b>403</b>.

In the second area <b>403</b>, a printed circuit board <b>488</b>, rigid or flexible, may be attached on the flexible substrate <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the backplate <b>420</b> placed on the rear surface of the flexible substrate <b>410</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> includes the bending structure <b>421</b> in the bending portion <b>420</b>C. The bending structure <b>421</b> may be provided in the form of a plurality of slit patterns penetrating the backplate <b>420</b> as the material of the backplate <b>420</b> is patterned. Thus, the first portion <b>420</b>A, second portion <b>420</b>B, and the bending portion <b>420</b> are made of the same material, but the bending portion <b>420</b> is more bendable than the first portion <b>420</b>A and the second portion <b>420</b>B due to having the plurality of slits <b>420</b>. In this case, the plurality of slit patterns may be shaped like discontinuous lines. When the bending structure <b>421</b> is shaped like the lines, the bending structure <b>421</b> may be disposed in parallel with the bending axis of the bending area <b>402</b>. The slit patterns of the bending structure <b>421</b> may include a width W<b>1</b> in a first direction parallel with the bending axis, and a width W<b>2</b> in a second direction perpendicular to the first direction. The width W<b>1</b> of the bending structure <b>421</b> in the first direction may be less than the width of the flexible substrate <b>410</b> in a folding axial direction, and may be formed throughout the bending portion <b>420</b>C of the backplate <b>420</b>. For example, the width W<b>1</b> of the bending structure <b>421</b> in the first direction may be less than 10% of the width in the folding axial direction. For example, the width W<b>1</b> in the bending structure <b>421</b> in the first direction may be 5.0 mm or less. The width W<b>2</b> of the bending structure <b>421</b> in the second direction may be less than the width of the flexible substrate <b>410</b> in the direction perpendicular to the folding axis, (e.g., the width of the bending area). For example, the width W<b>2</b> of the bending structure <b>421</b> in the second direction may be less than 15% of the width in the bending area. For example, the width W<b>2</b> of the bending structure <b>421</b> in the second direction may be 0.2 mm or less. In other words, the width W<b>1</b> of the bending structure <b>421</b> in the first direction may be at least 25 times greater than the width W<b>2</b> in the second direction.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The plurality of slit patterns are disposed being spaced apart at a certain distance from each other. A distance between adjacent slit patterns of the plurality of slit patterns in a first direction parallel with the bending axis is greater than a distance of the adjacent slit patterns in a second direction perpendicular to the bending axis.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The distance between the bending structures <b>421</b> in the second direction may be less than the width of the bending structure <b>421</b> in the second direction. Each end of the bending structure <b>421</b> may have a semicircular shape having a predetermined curvature. For example, if the end of the bending structure <b>421</b> is rectangularly formed, stress may be concentrated at opposite end corners of the bending structure <b>421</b> when the flexible substrate <b>410</b> is bent. However, when the end of the bending structure <b>421</b> is rounded to have a predetermined curvature, the stress is more dispersed than that of when each end of the bending structure <b>421</b> is rectangularly formed. For example, the stress of about 29 Mpa is generated when the end of the bending structure <b>421</b> is rectangularly formed. On the other hand, the stress of about 14 Mpa is generated when the end of the bending structure <b>421</b> is rounded. The bending structure <b>421</b> may be shaped like a mesh, but not limited thereto. Alternatively, the bending structure <b>421</b> may have various shapes.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">As the backplate <b>420</b> shaped like a mesh is provided on the rear of the bending area <b>402</b> of the flexible substrate <b>410</b>, it is possible to reduce damage or deformation when an external impact or the like is applied to the bending area <b>402</b> of the flexible substrate <b>410</b> as described in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In other words, it is possible to reduce a crack of the flexible substrate <b>410</b> or disconnection of the wiring in the bending area <b>402</b>. Further, it is possible to support the flexible substrate <b>410</b> and maintain a bending shape.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">To securely fasten the first portion <b>420</b>A and the second portion <b>420</b>B of the backplate <b>420</b>, an adhesive layer <b>440</b> may be provided between the first portion <b>420</b>A and the second portion <b>420</b>B.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The adhesive layer <b>440</b> may include a pressure-sensitive adhesive, a foam-type adhesive, a liquid adhesive, and a light cured adhesive or other suitable adhesive materials.

The protection layer <b>484</b> may also extend from the bending area <b>402</b> to part of the first portions <b>420</b>A and <b>420</b>B. The protection layer <b>484</b> may be a flexible material such as resin, plastic or rubber but it is not limited to these material.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">When the flexible substrate <b>410</b> is bent, tensile pressure is applied to an outer surface of the flexible substrate <b>410</b>, and compressive pressure is applied to an inner surface. Therefore, the wiring provided on the bending area <b>402</b> of the flexible substrate <b>410</b> is subjected to the tensile pressure, and therefore a problem may arise in that the wiring is disconnected. This is because the winging is more vulnerable to the tensile pressure than the compressive pressure.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">By applying the protection layer <b>484</b> to the bending area <b>402</b>, the flexible substrate <b>410</b> in the bending area <b>402</b> is increased in thickness as much as the thickness of the protection layer, and therefore the position of a neutral surface is moved up to the position where the wiring is formed.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The neutral surface refers to a surface on which neither the tensile pressure nor the compressive pressure acts even though tensile pressure is applied to the outer surface of the flexible substrate <b>410</b> and compressive pressure is applied to the inner surface when the flexible substrate <b>410</b> is bent. Further, the flexible substrate <b>410</b> is increased in thickness by applying the protection layer <b>484</b>, and the position of the neutral surface that is free from the tensile pressure of the outer surface and the compressive pressure of the inner surface of the flexible substrate <b>410</b> is moved.
