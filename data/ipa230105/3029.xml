2021, and having Ser. No. 63/217,816, by the same inventor and entitled &#x201c;A POWER TOOL FOR REMOVING ROOF SHINGLES&#x201d; which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to power tools for removing roof shingles.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the past, various tools have been used to remove roof shingles. One of such tools is the Rapid Roof Remover, described at www.rapidroofremover.com. This device uses pneumatic pressure to lift the shingles from the roof deck. Another tool is the Shingle Hog described at www.shinglehog.net. This device operates much like the Rapid Roof Remover except it pivots at a different point.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Rapid Roof Remover, weighs approximately 50 lbs. The Shingle Hog is lighter, but still about 25 lbs. The weight of these tools is a significant factor affecting their use.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While these tools have enjoyed some success and have been used in the past, they are in need of some improvements.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">These mechanisms are so heavy that in some situations their weight makes them difficult to maneuver and to carry onto a roof. The weight of such machines above also prevent their effective use on steep-pitched roofs. The weight of these machines above also increases the risk to the roofer of falling off the roof because the forward momentum of the heavy device can pull the roofer forward and off balance should the front teeth fail to engage with the roof.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additionally, these use relatively little leverage in their powertrains and consequently have relatively large actuators which fill relatively slowly. The operators often have to wait for the machine to work.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, the lack of an automatic trigger mechanism consistently costs time in having to push the button.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These systems are bulky in size. This factor is similar to weight but independently troublesome. Carrying such systems up a ladder to a rooftop without the help of a second person or the use of some other device(s) would often be difficult and dangerous.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">These devices can be dangerous owing to stored energy being continuously supplied to the moving parts, especially in situations when debris gets caught in the mechanism. Such energy supplied to the moving parts could injure the operator when they are trying to remove the debris.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Consequently, there exists a need for improved methods and systems for removing shingles from a roof.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is an object of one aspect of the present invention to provide a system of reducing the effort expended and time required to remove shingles from a roof.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is a feature of one aspect of the present invention to utilize in the actuator a relatively small piston, with a quick charging time. Such an actuator, in combination with a powertrain design with mechanical advantage, can provide ample force for removing shingles.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is an advantage of the present

description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0068">Now referring to the drawings wherein like numerals refer to like matter throughout and more particularly referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there is shown a perspective view of a power tool for removing shingles, generally designated <b>100</b>, and including an upper handle portion <b>110</b>, with upper handle grip <b>111</b>, a lower handle portion <b>130</b> with lower handle grip <b>131</b> a lower handle shaft <b>133</b>, a lift plate <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0069">Power tool for removing shingles <b>100</b> is shown as a full assembly, where the lower unit <b>150</b> contains power generation and transmission mechanisms used to raise the leading edge of the tool, i.e. the saw tooth portion of lift plate <b>160</b>. Above and to the rear of the lower unit <b>150</b> is lower handle <b>130</b>, this is where the operator holds the power tool for removing shingles <b>100</b>, with one hand. The lower handle <b>130</b> contains the actuation device and the enablement device (both not shown). Above and rearward of the lower handle <b>130</b> is upper handle <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0070">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the tool <b>100</b> is used to remove shingle and fastener <b>200</b> from a supporting surface (not shown). One example of this would be a roof covered with shingles which are fastened to the roof deck using nails. To operate the machine <b>100</b>, the operator grasps the tool <b>100</b> by the Lower Handle <b>130</b> and the Upper Handle <b>110</b> and sets the Lower Unit <b>150</b> onto the surface. The operator will then place the leading edge of the lift plate <b>160</b> under the material to be dislodged from the work surface with a sliding motion. While sliding forward, the leading edge of lift plate <b>160</b> will impact one or more fasteners holding the material to the deck. When this occurs, the Lower Unit <b>150</b> will be impeded from further forward movement, but the forward motion of the operator will apply additional pressure on the Lower Handle <b>130</b> and activate the actuation device plunger (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> #<b>1335</b>) in the Lower Handle <b>130</b>. This causes the machinery within the Lower Unit <b>150</b> to raise the leading edge which dislodges the material from the deck. Once the material is dislodged, the leading edge of lift plate <b>160</b> automatically lowers to the starting position and the operator repeats the cycle by sliding the machine forward again into the fastened materials.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0071">One advantage of the present invention over the current state of the art is that the design of the power generation and transmission mechanism is more compact and lightweight. This makes the device <b>100</b> easier to transport to the work surface, which may be on top of a multi-story building. The low weight and compact size also makes the machine <b>100</b> more maneuverable with less energy than the current state of the art.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0072">A second advantage of the present invention over the state of the art is the automatic actuation mechanism. This reduces the time required to operate the machine. From the perspective of the operator, there is no second step required to activate the machine. They simply move the machine into place and the dislodging action occurs without thought or need for further action.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0073">A third advantage to this machine is the additional operator safety provided with the enablement mechanism. The present invention may require the operator to be actively grasping and controlling the machine before it will operate. This prevents accidental triggering of the automatic actuation mechanism when the operator is not presently engaging the controls.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0074">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there is shown a side view of the power tool for removing shingles <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The arrow away from the shingle and fastener <b>200</b> shows the direction of motion of the shingle and fastener <b>200</b> as the lift plate <b>160</b> is actuated upwardly.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0075">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, there is shown a lower Unit subassembly <b>150</b> from above. The lower unit frame <b>151</b>, lift plate <b>160</b> and lift plate bracket <b>312</b> can be seen in this view. The Lift Plate Bracket <b>312</b> pivotably orients the Lift Plate <b>160</b> within reach of the drivetrain components by providing the plate arm pivot shaft <b>164</b> for the lift plate bracket <b>312</b> and attached lift plate <b>160</b> to pivot toward and away from the lower unit frame <b>151</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0076">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, there is shown, from below, in addition to some items of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, skid plate <b>166</b> and a partial view of the actuator/piston <b>158</b>, which resides within the lower unit frame <b>151</b>. The Skid Plate <b>166</b> is the point of contact that the tool <b>100</b> makes with the work surface and should be made of a material that allows the machine to slide freely upon the work surface.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0077">Now generally referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, and first specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, which represent the power tool for removing shingles <b>100</b> with some parts omitted from view to show the more internal components of the lower unit <b>150</b> while the lift plate <b>160</b> is in the retracted orientation. Next referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>10</b></figref> which depict actuated orientation The Powertrain within the Lower Unit Assembly <b>150</b> are shown with actuator <b>158</b>, piston assembly <b>157</b>, lever arm <b>152</b>, center linkage <b>155</b>, center cam <b>910</b>, driveshaft <b>1162</b>, outside cams <b>163</b>, and outer linkage <b>154</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). Together, this system generates the force to actuate the lift plate <b>160</b>, multiplies the force to obtain more lifting ability, and redirects the force from a predominately horizontal direction to a mostly vertical direction. The Actuator <b>158</b> could be a pneumatic cylinder in the primary embodiment, but other embodiments could utilize hydraulic cylinders, electric linear actuators, and combustion cylinders. The actuator <b>158</b> is powered in both directions in the primary embodiment and is powered in the direction of actuation but returned to the original position utilizing spring force built into the actuator <b>158</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0078">The geometry of the components and their attachment points to the lower unit frame <b>151</b> combine to provide the mechanical advantage and direction change to the force applied by the actuator <b>158</b> within a compact space. A more thorough understanding of the power tool for removing shingles <b>100</b> can be aided by now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, which is an exploded view of the drive train components of the lower unit <b>150</b>, note that hoses for transferring working fluids have not been shown in the exploded figures.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0079">Lower Handle Subassembly <b>130</b> and Upper Handle <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0080">Two embodiments are described below in detail with additional embodiments expressed as part of each discussion.

These subassemblies are connected to the Lower Unit subassembly <b>150</b> using the Lower Handle Shaft <b>133</b>. The Upper handle <b>110</b> is connected to the Lower Handle subassembly <b>130</b> using the Upper Handle Shaft <b>113</b>. The Lower Handle Subassembly <b>130</b> comprises Lower Housing <b>1210</b>, the Upper Housing <b>1212</b>, and the Lower handle <b>130</b>. The Enablement Lever <b>1331</b> is located within the Lower Handle <b>130</b>. The Enablement Device <b>1333</b> is found in the Upper Housing <b>1212</b> the Power Supply Connecter <b>1214</b> can be found within the Upper Handle <b>110</b>. Within the Primary Enablement, the Actuation Device <b>132</b> is housed within the Upper Housing <b>1212</b>, in another embodiment (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>22</b></figref>) the Actuation Device <b>132</b> is found within the Lower Housing <b>1210</b>.

The proximal end of the Enablement Lever <b>1331</b> rotates around the enablement lever pivot point <b>1335</b> and pushes on the plunger <b>1334</b> to go within the Enablement Device <b>1333</b> which triggers the Enablement Device <b>1333</b> to supply energy to the Actuation Device <b>132</b>. This energizes the system and it is ready for an actuation event.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0084">Note that while the primary embodiment of this machine only optionally includes this enablement functionality, other embodiments of this need not include it. The Primary Embodiment is powered with compressed air, thus the enablement device <b>132</b> is a pneumatic valve. Other Embodiments utilize pressurized liquids, electricity, or combustion events. The Enablement Device <b>1331</b> in such cases is a hydraulic valve, electric switch, and fuel supply valve, respectively.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0085">Actuation is accomplished using the Actuation Device <b>132</b> and the relative motion between the Lower Housing <b>1210</b> and the Upper Housing <b>1212</b> when the operator pushes against the Lower handle and/or the Upper Handle. The operator pushes the machine forward using the Lower Handle <b>130</b> and the Upper Handle <b>110</b>. The machine will slide forward on the Skid Plate <b>166</b> until a fastener contacts the leading edge of the Lift Plate <b>160</b>. The machine will stop moving forward, but the continued forward pressure on the Lower Handle <b>130</b> and the Upper Handle will cause the top edge of the Lower Housing <b>1210</b> and the Upper Housing <b>1212</b> to move towards each other. This motion pushes upon the enablement plunger <b>1334</b> built into the actuation device <b>132</b>, causing it to activate which supplies the compressed air (or pressurized liquid or electricity or combustion gas for hydraulic, electric, or combustion embodiments, respectively) to the drivetrain within the Lower Unit <b>150</b>. For machine embodiments utilizing an Actuator <b>158</b> that is powered in both directions, the Actuation device will supply power to the actuator <b>158</b> in the opposite direction to return the machine to its retracted state. This occurs when the operator stops applying forward push on the handles or when the enablement lever <b>1331</b> is released.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0086">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref> in the primary embodiment, the motion between the lower housing <b>1210</b> and the upper housing <b>1212</b> is rotational around the pivot point <b>1410</b> where the housings are attached to each other. Other embodiments use linear motion along shafts connecting the housings.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0087">As discussed above, various different types of power sources could be utilized in the present invention depending upon the specific application (e.g. pneumatic, hydraulic, electrical, and/or mechanical). In each of these specific applications, the activation energy is only supplied to the Activation Device <b>132</b> when tool <b>100</b> has been enabled using the enablement device <b>1331</b>. The source of power is provided from the Power Supply Connector to the enablement device <b>1333</b>, then to the actuation device <b>132</b>, and finally to the Lower Unit drivetrain using hoses or wires, which are not pictured in the diagrams for clarity.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0088">The above-described features may be better understood by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, which is an exploded view of the actuation and enablement features of the present invention. These above-described configurations are believed to possibly be preferred.
