Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Crates or containers for storing objects are well known. Collapsible crates that may be adjusted between a collapsed (or substantially flat) position and an erect (or substantially upright) position provide a user with the ability to store objects when needed and to reduce the area required to store an empty crate, for example, a crate that is not in use. However, many existing collapsible rates may be heavy, costly and/or difficult to manufacture, and may employ complicated mechanisms that keep the crate in an erect position. Stability and swift assembly and disassembly are desirable features in a collapsible crate. Moreover, lids are desirable for such collapsible crates so that the interior and contents can be protected and secured, and additional collapsible crates or other objects can be stacked on top. It is also desirable that such lids be structurally reinforced to support additional weight and load from such stacked crates and objects and that such lids lie at least flush with an upper rim of the crate to promote stability of the crates or objects stacked above. It is yet also desirable that such lids be releasably latched to the crates when deployed to cover the crates and be releasably latched to a bottom of the crates for stowage. It is further desirable that such lids when deployed in covering the crates be configured to allow users to partially open the lids as a convenience for access the interior and contents without complete removal of the lids.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one or more embodiments, a collapsible crate movable between an erect configuration and a

In particular, a user can place the lid portions <b>102</b>M and <b>102</b>N next to each other with their inner surfaces facing a sturdy supporting surface. The edges <b>109</b> and <b>117</b> should be generally aligned with the pins <b>132</b> of the male knuckles <b>131</b>M resting above respective notch openings <b>137</b> of the female knuckles. The user can then push down on the male knuckles <b>131</b>M to snap each pin <b>132</b> into its respective hole <b>135</b> of the female knuckles <b>131</b>F. Once the pins <b>132</b> are snapped into the holes <b>135</b>, the male and female knuckles are interlocked to form the hinge <b>130</b> that allows the lid portions <b>102</b>M and <b>102</b>N to form a singular plane or be folded directionally along the hinge.
