However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the description.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Throughout the application, ordinal numbers (e.g., first, second, third, etc.) may be used as an adjective for an element (i.e., any noun in the application). The use of ordinal numbers is not to imply or create any particular ordering of the elements nor to limit any element to being only a single element unless expressly disclosed, such as using the terms &#x201c;before&#x201d;, &#x201c;after&#x201d;, &#x201c;single&#x201d;, and other such terminology. Rather, the use of ordinal numbers is to distinguish between the elements. By way of an example, a first element is distinct from a second element, and the first element may encompass more than one element and succeed (or precede) the second element in an ordering of elements.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Embodiments disclosed herein are directed to combining a surface seismic dataset recorded in the two-way seismic time domain with well logs recorded in the depth domain to produce a calibrated surface seismic dataset. Features, such as a reflected signal, detected in the surface seismic dataset over a large spatial area, may then be correlated with features, such as a presence of hydrocarbon indicated by a resistivity well log or a high porosity zone indicated by a sonic log, detected by a well log at a single spatial location. The embodiments disclose training a network, such as a neural network implemented on a computer processor. This training use a set of &#x201c;training wells&#x201d; which have both borehole seismic datasets and sonic well logs recorded in them. The embodiment further describes applying the trained network to a set of &#x201c;application wells&#x201d;, which have sonic well logs but do not have borehole seismic datasets recorded in them.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with one or more embodiments, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of a surface seismic dataset (<b>100</b>) for a range of spatial positions on the Earth's surface indicated by the horizontal axis (<b>102</b>). The surface seismic dataset (<b>100</b>) is recorded and displayed as a function of two-way seismic travel-time indicated on the vertical axis (<b>104</b>). Two-way seismic travel-time is the elapsed time between a firing of a seismic source and the detection of a data sample. Dark bands (<b>106</b>) in the surface seismic dataset (<b>100</b>) indicate large values of the detected signal. A large value of the detected signal may be caused by the arrival of large reflection at a seismic receiver located at, or near, the Earth's surface. A large reflection may be generated by the reflection of a down-going seismic wave, generated by a seismic source located on the Earth's surface, at a significant subsurface discontinuity. A subsurface discontinuity may be a geological layer boundary, a fault or fracture, or an interface between different fluids occupying pores within the rock. The two-way seismic travel-time is the sum of the time taken for the down-going seismic wave to travel from the seismic source to the subsurface discontinuity and the time taken for the reflection to travel from the subsurface discontinuity back to the receiver at the surface.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The two-way seismic travel-time (<b>104</b>) of a surface seismic dataset (<b>100</b>) may range from zero to eight seconds or more, depending on the depth of subsurface discontinuity. The surface spatial extent (<b>102</b>) of a surface seismic dataset (<b>100</b>) may cover many tens of kilometers in two orthogonal directions. Consequently, a seismic reflection (<b>106</b>) may be detected in a surface seismic dataset (<b>100</b>) over an area of hundreds of square kilometers. However, because the velocity of seismic wave propagation in the subsurface may be uncertain, the transformation of the two-way seismic travel-time of a reflection to the corresponding depth of the subsurface discontinuity that generated it may contain large uncertainties.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows examples of a plurality of well logs (<b>200</b>). Well logs are recorded by lowering one or more well logging tools into a well and measuring physical quantities of the geological formation surrounding the well. These physical quantities may include, without limitation, the sonic wave propagation speed (<b>210</b>), the gamma ray emissions (<b>212</b>), the mass density of the rock (<b>214</b>), and the electrical resistivity of the rock (<b>216</b>). The well logging tools may be lowered from the surface on a conveyance, such as a wireline cable, a string of drill pipes, and a slickline. The measured depth at which each sample of the well log is recorded may be determined from the length of the conveyance spooled into the well. This measured depth is the distance along the well at which the sample is recorded. If the well is vertical the measured depth is also the depth below the earth's surface. In this case the measured depth is known as the &#x201c;true vertical depth&#x201d;, as shown on the vertical axis (<b>202</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In cases where the well has a deviated or horizontal segment, corrections may be made base on the spatial trajectory of the well to determine the true vertical depth below the surface at which the sample was recorded. Thus, the true vertical depth of features in the well log, such as the high resistivity zones (<b>218</b>) that may be oil bearing geological formations, may be determined with low uncertainty.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a borehole seismic survey, in accordance with one or more embodiments. Unlike surface seismic datasets, which are acquired using a plurality of seismic sources and seismic receivers located on the earth's surface, a borehole seismic survey typically has at least one seismic source on the surface (<b>302</b>) and a plurality of seismic receivers (<b>304</b>) located in a well (<b>306</b>) that may penetrate a plurality of geological layers (<b>308</b>) in the subsurface region of interest. The plurality of seismic receivers (<b>304</b>) may be suspended from a drill rig (<b>310</b>) or a crane (not shown) using a wireline cable (<b>312</b>). In addition to providing mechanical support to the plurality of seismic receivers (<b>304</b>) in the well (<b>306</b>), the wireline cable (<b>312</b>) may provide electrical power to the plurality of seismic receivers (<b>304</b>) and transmit data recorded by the plurality of seismic receivers (<b>304</b>) to a recording facility (<b>314</b>) on the surface. In operation on land the recording facility (<b>314</b>) may be mounted on a truck. In operation at the recording facility (<b>314</b>) may be part of a drilling rig or production platform or ship (not shown). When the plurality of seismic receivers (<b>304</b>) are deployed into the well the length of cable unspooled may be monitored, thus the depth of each member of the plurality of seismic receivers (<b>304</b>) may be known at any time with a high level of certainty. In particular, the depth of each member of the plurality of seismic receivers (<b>304</b>) may be known at the time at which a borehole seismic dataset is record with a high level of certainty.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">When the seismic source (<b>302</b>) is excited, seismic waves (<b>316</b>) may propagate from the seismic source (<b>302</b>) directly to the plurality of seismic receivers (<b>304</b>) where they are recorded. In addition, seismic waves may be reflected from geological discontinuities (<b>318</b>) and these reflected seismic waves (<b>320</b>) may be recorded by the plurality of seismic receivers (<b>304</b>). Borehole seismic datasets may be recorded by Vertical Seismic Profiles (VSP) and/or by Checkshot Surveys (CS). Both VSP and CH may be used to determine the one-way seismic travel-time between the surface and the depth of each member of the plurality of seismic receivers (<b>304</b>). However, while CS are typically used to determine only one-way seismic travel-times, VSP are often also used to record reflected seismic waves (<b>320</b>) from geological discontinuities (<b>318</b>) and to form images thereof, in addition to determining one-way seismic travel-times. CS further differs from a VSP in the number and density of seismic receiver depths recorded. In CS seismic receiver positions may be widely and irregularly located in the well, whereas a VSP usually has numerous seismic receivers positioned at closely and regularly spaced intervals in the well. In both CS and VSP the plurality of seismic receivers (<b>302</b>) may record seismic waves (<b>316</b>) from one or more excitations of the seismic source (<b>302</b>) and then be moved to a deeper or a shallower location in the well (<b>304</b>) before recording data from subsequent excitations of the seismic source (<b>302</b>).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a borehole seismic dataset (<b>400</b>), in accordance with one or more embodiments. The variation of displacement with time, known as waveforms (<b>406</b>), caused by the seismic waves (<b>320</b>) and recorded by the plurality of seismic receivers (<b>304</b>) are shown as a function of time, indicated on the horizontal axis (<b>402</b>), and seismic receiver depth, indicated on the vertical axis (<b>404</b>). The one-way seismic travel-time from the surface to each seismic receiver may be determined based, at least in part, on the time (<b>408</b>) at which the seismic wave (<b>316</b>) is first detected on the waveform (<b>406</b>). The curve of one-way seismic travel-time versus depth (<b>410</b>) is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Borehole seismic datasets may allow the determination of one-way seismic travel-time versus depth (<b>410</b>). One-way seismic travel-time versus depth (<b>410</b>) may be converted to two-way seismic travel-time (<b>104</b>) in which surface seismic datasets are recorded by multiplying the one-way seismic travel-time versus depth (<b>410</b>) by a factor of two to obtain a first estimate of the two-way seismic travel-time versus depth curve.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A second estimate of the two-way seismic travel-time versus depth curve may be generated from the sonic well log by integrating the sonic well log slowness values over the recorded depth values of the sonic well log. Slowness is the reciprocal of velocity and is usually expressed in units of microsecond/ft or microseconds/meter. Since sonic well logs do not typically have samples extending over the full length of the well, i.e., from the toe of the well to the surface, the second estimate of the two-way seismic travel-time versus depth curve has an arbitrary origin, i.e., the value of the two-way seismic travel-time at shallowest sample point of the sonic well log is unknown.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In accordance with one or more embodiments, when both a sonic well log (<b>210</b>) and a borehole seismic dataset (<b>400</b>) are recorded in a well they may be combined to produce a transformed sonic well log in the two-way seismic travel-time domain. An important step in producing a transformed sonic well log is to ensure the sonic well log and the borehole seismic dataset are of sufficient quality with sufficiently low levels of noise or other errors. This quality control (QC) procedure may include the calculation of a sonic drift (SD) curve which quantifies the difference between the first estimate and the second estimate of the two-way seismic travel-time versus depth curve. Even with high-quality and low-noise datasets these two estimates frequently do not agree because the sonic well log is recorded using elastic waves with frequencies typically in the range of 8,000 to 20,000 Hertz and the borehole seismic datasets are recorded using elastic waves typically in the range of 50 to 150 Hertz. Dispersion, the variation of propagation velocity with frequency, is often observed for elastic waves propagating in the earth, and so sonic and seismic waves with very different frequencies are expected to travel with different velocities.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In accordance with one or more embodiments, the problem in calculating an SD curve caused by the arbitrary origin of the second estimate of the two-way seismic travel-time versus depth curve may be overcome by defining the first estimate and the second estimate of the two-way seismic travel-time versus depth curve to be equal at the depth of a &#x201c;regional marker&#x201d;. In this context, a regional marker refers to a geological feature clearly visible on both sonic well logs (<b>210</b>) and surface seismic datasets (<b>100</b>) which extends over a large geographical area, for example an entire hydrocarbon field or an entire sedimentary basin.

A TCN may include an input layer (<b>702</b>), an output layer (<b>704</b>), and one of more hidden layers (<b>706</b><i>a</i>, <b>706</b><i>b</i>). Each layer (<b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b><i>a</i>, and <b>706</b><i>b</i>) includes a sequence of cells (<b>708</b>). For each sequence of input values {x<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, . . . x<sub>N-2</sub>, x<sub>N-1</sub>, x<sub>N</sub>} entered at the input layer (<b>702</b>) the network produces a single output value y<sub>N </sub>(<b>710</b>). In accordance with one or more embodiments, the TCN iteratively receives sequences of input values displaced by unit to either right, such that x<sub>N </sub>of the previous iteration becomes x<sub>N-1 </sub>in the current iteration. The TCN produces one output value y<sub>1 </sub>for each completed iteration. The network produces an output sequence of the same length as the input sequence after the completion of all iterations.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In accordance with one or more embodiments, the TCN network may be casual in the sense that the output value y<sub>N </sub>depends only on the input value x<sub>i</sub>, i&#x2264;N, and does not depend on x<sub>i</sub>, i&#x3e;N. For example, when used to generate a transformed sonic well log in the two-way travel time the input values x<sub>i</sub>, i&#x3c;N, may be shallower sonic well log values than the input value x<sub>N</sub>. In accordance with other embodiments, the TCN may be non-causal and may predict outputs based on shallower or earlier samples as well as deeper or later samples.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A TCN may be characterized by a number of hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden layers; the number, stride, and length of convolutional filters in each layer; and the dilutional parameters. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> four layers are depicted, including an input layer (<b>702</b>), an output layer (<b>704</b>), and two hidden layers (<b>706</b><i>a</i>, <b>706</b><i>b</i>). The number of convolutional filters describe the number of values calculated in the next layer. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> the input layer (<b>702</b>) has seven convolutional filters, the first hidden layer (<b>706</b><i>a</i>) has three convolutional filters, and the second hidden layer (<b>706</b><i>b</i>) has one convolution filter. The stride of the convolutional filter describes the degree of overlap exhibited by the inputs to each adjacent convolutional filter. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the input layer (<b>702</b>) has a stride of one, implying that the first input value of one convolution is adjacent to the final input of the preceding convolutional filter. In contrast, the first hidden layer (<b>706</b><i>a</i>) has a stride of zero, implying that the first input value of one convolution is also the final input of the preceding convolutional filter. The length of the convolutional filter is the number of input values combined to give the output value. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the length of the convolutional filter in the input layer (<b>702</b>) is two and the length of the convolutional filter in the first hidden layer (<b>706</b><i>a</i>) and the second hidden layer (<b>706</b><i>b</i>) are both three. Finally, the dilatation parameter describes the spacing between input values of the filter. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the dilatation parameter for the input layer (<b>702</b>) is one, the dilatation parameter of the first hidden layer (<b>706</b><i>a</i>) is two, and the dilatation parameter of the second hidden layer (<b>706</b><i>b</i>) is four.
