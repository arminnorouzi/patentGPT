Specifically, the embodiments relate to a polyester film that can be recycled since its crystallinity is controlled and to a heat-shrinkable label and a packaging material that comprise the same and can be applied to various containers.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, as containers for beverages or foods are manufactured in various forms, or there are increased cases in which full packaging is applied in order to attract the attention of consumers, heat shrinkable labels and packaging materials are attracting attention. A heat shrinkable label or packaging material takes advantage of the feature of a polymer film that tends to shrink to a shape before stretching thereof at a certain temperature or higher once it has been oriented by stretching thereof. A typical process of labeling or packaging is carried out in which a heat shrinkable film is cut, printed in a desired design, rolled up, bonded at both ends with an adhesive solvent, loosely wrapped around a container, and then shrunk as heat is applied thereto.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A film used in the above heat shrinkage process is required to have not only such basic properties as thermal resistance, chemical resistance, weatherability, and printability, but also container sealability, heat shrinkage uniformity, sliding characteristics in the longitudinal direction, and crack resistance. Conventionally, polyvinyl chloride films, polystyrene films, polypropylene films, and the like have been used for this heat shrinkage process. In recent years, polyester films having such properties as high thermal resistance and weatherability, the convenience of incineration, and excellent printability have been widely used.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, since a conventional polyester film has a fast shrinkage speed and a high shrinkage stress, there have been defects caused by non-uniform shrinkage or distortions of a plastic container. Thus, Korean Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2002-0062838 discloses a technique in which 5% by weight or more of a polyester elastomer is added to a heat shrinkable polyester film to suppress the generation of wrinkles, shrinkage stains, distortions, and the like when the film is used for full packaging of plastic bottles.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As such, polyester films used in the heat shrinkage process are prepared with lower crystallinity by blending a soft component with a polyester resin. In addition, they have been developed to have thermal properties such as shrinkage rate and shrinkage stress with respect to temperature, chemical resistance suitable for the seaming process, and recyclability that has recently emerged due to a waste plastic problem.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">(Patent Document 1) Korean Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2002-0062838</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since it is difficult to recycle heat shrinkable labels or packaging materials composed of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film despite their excellent thermal properties and chemical resistance, most of them are disposed of after use. This is because, when a PET film is introduced into the current recycling process, the PET film causes various process defects during a high-temperature process for a long period of time, resulting in an increase in costs. Or even if it is recyclable, there is a problem in that the seaming characteristics are poor due to the high crystallinity of a PET film when it is applied to the variable sleeve offset printing (VSOP) method.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, the embodiments aim to provide a polyester film prepared while the crystallinity of a copolymerized polyester film is controlled to have excellent shrinkage characteristics and excellent seaming characteristics in various printing methods, without fusion even upon prolonged high-temperature drying in a recycling process, and a heat-shrinkable label and a packaging material comprising the same.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an embodiment, there is provided a polyester film, which comprises a polyester resin in which a diol comprising ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol; and a dicarboxylic acid are copolymerized, wherein the difference between the crystallization temperature (T<sub>c</sub>) and the melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) measured by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) is 100&#xb0; C. or less, and the film has an endothermic peak at 100&#xb0; C. to 150&#xb0; C. when measured with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) upon treatment with a 1% aqueous solution of NaOH at 85&#xb0; C. for 15 minutes.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another embodiment, there are provided a heat-shrinkable label and a packaging material comprising the polyester film.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The polyester film according to the embodiment prepared while the crystallinity of a copolymerized polyester film is controlled can be improved in thermal properties and chemical properties. Specifically, it has not only an excellent shrinkage rate with respect to temperature, but also excellent adhesive strength by a solvent even when applied to gravure printing, UV curing printing, and VSOP printing, making it suitable for a heat shrinkage process and a seaming process. In addition, the polyester film can be applied to a recycling process since it has an appropriate change in crystals during washing with an aqueous solution of NaOH, and the occurrence of fusion is suppressed even upon prolonged high-temperature drying. Such crystal characteristics of the polyester film can be achieved in a desired range by controlling the components and contents of a copolymerized polyester resin constituting it and controlling the process conditions in the preparation process. Accordingly, the polyester film according to the embodiment can be advantageously applied as a heat shrinkable label or packaging material to containers of various products including beverages and foods.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> each show DSC curves before and after treatment of the polyester films with an aqueous solution of NaOH in Test Example 2.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the polyester films in Test Example 3.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a difference in heat capacity (&#x394;C<sup>0</sup><sub>p </sub>and &#x394;C<sub>p</sub>) before and after Tg in a DSC curve of a polyester film.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a difference (T<sub>m</sub>&#x2212;T<sub>c</sub>) between melting temperature and crystallization temperature in a DSC curve.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a method of measuring the adhesive strength of a polyester film by a solvent in Test Example 4.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a method of measuring the clumping ratio of a polyester film in Test Example 5.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a method of measuring the heat shrinkage of a polyester film in Test Example 6.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0021" num="0020"></p><p id="p-0022" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>&#x3c;Explanation of Reference Numerals&#x3e;</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1: label container</entry></row><row><entry>6: crusher</entry></row><row><entry>7: weight</entry></row><row><entry>8: sieve</entry></row><row><entry>10a: label flakes</entry></row><row><entry>10b: clumped label flakes</entry></row><row><entry>20a: container flakes</entry></row><row><entry>100: polyester film (before shrinkage)</entry></row><row><entry>100a;

Thus, it is possible to adjust the thermal resistance of a polymer by adjusting its crystallinity. The measurement of the crystallization temperature and the melting temperature may be carried out by methods well known in the art. For example, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) may be used.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">The polyester film according to an embodiment has a crystallization temperature (T<sub>c</sub>) and a melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) measured by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), and the difference between the crystallization temperature (Tc) and the melting temperature (Tm) is 100&#xb0; C. or less, specifically, less than 100&#xb0; C. For example, T<sub>m</sub>&#x2212;T<sub>c </sub>may be 95&#xb0; C. or less, 90&#xb0; C. or less, or 85&#xb0; C. or less, more specifically, 65&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C., 75&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C., or 80&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. The difference between the crystallization temperature and the melting temperature is directly related to the crystallization rate. Thus, when it is within the above preferred range, the crystallinity of the copolymerized polyester may be controlled such that the thermal properties and chemical properties of the polyester film are improved.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">The differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) may be specifically a modulated differential scanning calorimeter (modulated DSC or MDSC), more specifically a temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimeter (TMDSC).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, it may be difficult to distinguish an endothermic peak and an exothermic peak in a heat flow curve (C<sub>total</sub>) of a typical DSC. Thus, it is preferable to divide it into a non-reversible heat flow curve (C<sub>non-rev</sub>) and a reversible heat flow curve (C<sub>rev</sub>) for analysis. The reversible heat flow curve among them is suitable for obtaining a glass transition temperature (Tg). The non-reversible heat flow curve is suitable for obtaining a crystallization temperature (T<sub>c</sub>) and a melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">In the non-reversible heat flow curve (C<sub>non-rev</sub>) of DSC in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an exothermic peak appears at the crystallization temperature (T<sub>c</sub>), and an endothermic peak appears at the melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>).

For example, the endothermic peak temperature (T<sub>new</sub>) may be 100&#xb0; C. to 140&#xb0; C., 100&#xb0; C. to 130&#xb0; C., 100&#xb0; C. to 120&#xb0; C., or 100&#xb0; C. to 115&#xb0; C. In addition, the endothermic peak may have a melting enthalpy of 0.5 J/g to 10 J/g, specifically, 1 J/g to 5 J/g. The treatment with an aqueous solution of NaOH may be carried out by, for example, stirring the polyester film in a 1% aqueous solution of NaOH at 85&#xb0; C. for 15 minutes at a speed of 240 m/minute.

For example, in a reversible heat flow curve or heat capacity curve by DSC, the baseline is kept constant and then steeply changes around a certain temperature where the height of the baseline changes, which temperature may be determined as a glass transition.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">Meanwhile, in a DSC curve of a polymer, the change in baseline is observed over a certain temperature section, not at a specific temperature. This is because the glass transition of the polymer takes place over a certain temperature section rather than at a specific temperature. Thus, the temperature where an inflection point (i.e., the position where the curve starts to change from a convex shape to a concave shape, or vice versa) appears in the section in which the baseline of a DSC curve changes may be determined as Tg. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an inflection point in a section in which the DSC curve (b) changes from a first baseline (C<sub>p1</sub>) to a second baseline (C<sub>p2</sub>) may be defined as Tg.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">Thus, the reversible heat capacity before Tg may be determined as a heat capacity corresponding to the baseline (C<sub>p1</sub>) before the inflection point of the DSC curve (b), and the reversible heat capacity after Tg may be determined as a heat capacity corresponding to the baseline (C<sub>p2</sub>) after the inflection point of the DSC curve (b). Thus, the difference in the reversible heat capacity before and after Tg may be calculated as the difference in heat capacity (&#x394;C<sup>0</sup><sub>p</sub>) corresponding to the difference in the baseline before and after the inflection point of the DSC curve.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">Meanwhile, if a baseline is inclined in a DSC curve, the heat capacity difference can be calculated after the curve is corrected to be flat. In addition, in a DSC curve, it is also possible to calculate the difference in heat capacity corresponding to the intersection of the tangent at the inflection point and the tangent of each temperature section corresponding to 5&#xb0; C. to 15&#xb0; C. before or after the inflection point. Here, the tangent can be obtained by the least squares method.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">The polyester film according to an embodiment may have a difference in reversible heat capacity (&#x394;C<sup>0</sup><sub>p</sub>) of 0.25 J/g&#xb7;K or more before and after the glass transition temperature (Tg) as measured when it is subjected to first scan by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) from room temperature to 300&#xb0; C. at a temperature elevation rate of 3&#xb0; C./minute, followed by cooling thereof, and to second scan under the same conditions.

Thereafter, the cooled film is subjected to a second scan under the same conditions as those of the first scan, that is, a temperature elevation rate of 3&#xb0; C./minute from room temperature to 300&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the reversible heat capacity curve (a) obtained through the first scan by DSC and the reversible heat capacity curve (b) obtained through the second scan have some differences. This is because the second scan is carried out with the thermal history removed by the first scan and cooling procedures. The heat capacity measured through the first scan varies depending on the film composition as well as post-processing conditions such as stretching and heat-setting, whereas the heat capacity measured through the second scan once the thermal history has been removed is determined only by the inherent properties of the polymer constituting the film.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">The difference in heat capacity before and after Tg in a reversible heat capacity curve obtained by DSC is related to the amorphous region in a film.

A fountain solution is coated on the background area except for the area where an ink is in direct contact with the substrate when a label is printed. Since it is not well mixed with an ink like a relationship between water and oil, it allows the ink to be printed clearly without spreading. However, the film coated with such a fountain solution may prevent a solvent for seaming (1,3-dioxolane or the like) from reaching the surface of the substrate, thereby deteriorating the seaming characteristics Thus, it is preferable that the seaming characteristics at a certain level or more are achieved even after a fountain solution is coated on a substrate film as described above.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">Specifically, when one sheet of the polyester film is coated with a glycol-based solution and is then adhered with another sheet of the polyester film by 1,3-dioxolane, the peel strength may be 500 gf/in or more. Specifically, the peel strength after coating of a glycol-based solution and adhesion by 1,3-dioxolane may be 700 gf/in or more, 900 gf/in or more, 1,100 gf/in or more, 1,300 gf/in or more, or 1,500 gf/in or more, and, more specifically, 500 gf/in to 3,000 gf/in or 900 gf/in to 2,000 gf/in. The glycol-based solution is a component mainly used in a fountain solution. For example, it may be an aqueous solution comprising 10% to 20% by weight of glycerol. In addition, it may comprise 5% to 10% by weight of malic acid, 5% to 10% by weight of 1-propoxypropan-2-ol, and 1% by weight to 2.5% by weight of 2,2&#x2032;,2&#x2033;-nitriletriethanol, and the like.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">In addition, in the polyester film, clumping, which may take place in the high-temperature compression process of crushed flakes in a plastic recycling process may be suppressed. Clumping refers to an aggregate that may be formed in the regeneration process. The size of the aggregates may be, for example, at least three times the size of the flake particles before the thermal treatment. The clumping ratio refers to a ratio of the aggregates based on the total weight of the initial flakes, that is, the flakes before the thermal treatment. It may be calculated by the following equation.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Clumping ratio (%)=weight of aggregated flakes/weight of initial flakes&#xd7;100<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0070" num="0066">In the regeneration process of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) container in which a film is provided as a label, the flakes obtained by crushing them are passed through a sieve and then subjected to a thermal treatment process. In such an event, aggregates may be formed as the crushed flakes are clumped, which aggregates are called clumping. The aggregates are again filtered through a sieve, and the weight is measured. The weight ratio of the aggregates based on the total weight of the flakes before the thermal treatment is calculated as a clumping ratio. Thus, the higher the value of the clumping ratio, the lower the recyclability.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0067">Specifically, when the polyester film according to an embodiment is crushed to a particle size of 9.5 mm to 12 mm, thermally treated at a temperature of 210&#xb0; C. under a load of 2.5 kgf for 90 minutes, and passed through a sieve having a hole size of 12.5 mm, the ratio that does not pass may be 5% or less. More specifically, the ratio that does not pass through the sieve may be very small such as 3% or less, 2% or less, or 1% or less. This is attributable to the adjustment of crystallinity of the polyester film whereby fusion is suppressed under high-temperature conditions.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0068">If plastic flakes are fused in the regeneration process, it may cause various problems. Thus, the U.S. Association of Plastic Recyclers (APR) is preparing a procedure (APR PET-S-08) to evaluate a clumping ratio. Specifically, when 3 parts by weight of a polyester film and 97 parts by weight of a polyethylene terephthalate container are crushed to a particle diameter of 9.5 mm to 12 mm, respectively, thermally treated for 90 minutes at a temperature of 210&#xb0; C. under a pressure of 8.7 kPa (i.e., a load of 2.5 kgf applied to a cylinder having a diameter of 6 cm), and passed through a sieve having a hole size of 12.5 mm, the clumping ratio may refer to the ratio that does not pass.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0069">Composition of a Polyester Film</p><p id="p-0074" num="0070">The polyester film according to an embodiment comprises a copolymerized polyester resin.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0071">For example, the copolymerized polyester resin may be one in which two or more diols and a dicarboxylic acid are copolymerized.

Specifically, it has not only an excellent shrinkage rate with respect to temperature, but also excellent adhesive strength by a solvent even when applied to gravure printing, UV curing printing, and VSOP printing, making it suitable for a heat shrinkage process and a seaming process. In addition, the polyester film can be applied to a recycling process since it has an appropriate change in crystals during washing with an aqueous solution of NaOH, and the generation of fusion is suppressed even upon prolonged high-temperature drying. In addition, such crystal characteristics of the polyester film can be achieved in a desired range by controlling the components and contents of a copolymerized polyester resin constituting it and controlling the process conditions in the preparation process.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0101">Accordingly, the polyester film according to an embodiment can be advantageously applied as a heat shrinkable label or packaging material to containers of various products including beverages and foods. The heat shrinkable label or packaging material according to an embodiment comprises the polyester film, and it may further comprise a printing layer, a dye, an adhesive, or the like.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">MODE FOR THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0106" num="0102">Hereinafter, the present invention is explained in detail by Examples.
