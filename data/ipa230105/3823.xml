Solar tracking systems track the trajectory of the sun to more efficiently capture radiation, which is then converted to electrical energy. Solar tracking systems are less efficient when weather conditions change or when they do not account for local topographies that reduce the amount of light captured.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In accordance with the principles of the invention, a solar tracking system is controlled by a global performance model based on the weather and topography local to the solar tracking system. In one embodiment, the performance model uses a machine-learning algorithm that periodically updates its parameters, learning from weather and topography data. In one embodiment, the solar tracking system comprises multiple rows of solar panel modules, forming a grid of rows of solar panel modules, where each row is independently orientatable to a solar source (e.g., the sun) relative to the other rows. As one example, each row of solar panel modules can be oriented at a different incident angle to the solar source than each of the other rows of solar panel modules is oriented to the solar source. The performance model optimizes the total output of the grid, which, due to interactions (couplings) between adjacent rows, does not necessarily correspond to optimizing the output from each individual row.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one embodiment, the performance model is characterized by a polynomial, which determines orientations for each individual row of solar panel modules to optimize (e.g., maximize) the total energy output from the grid of solar panel modules. Preferably, the parameters of the performance model are determined based on the topography. The parameters are periodically updated based on weather conditions, such as forecast and historical weather data. In this way, the performance model is a learning model that continuously optimizes the solar tracking system to account for changing weather conditions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another embodiment, the performance model comprises a diffuse table, which correlates energy outputs for the solar tracking system to weather conditions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with the invention, topography is determined using laser site survey, learned survey using energy readings on photovoltaics coupled to the solar panel modules, energy readings on the solar panel modules, airplane and drone imaging that correlates the position of the sun and resulting shading to topographic position, to name only a few examples. Weather conditions are determined using satellite weather forecasts informed by local data (&#x201c;ground truth&#x201d;), cameras looking at the sky, power measurements on the solar panel modules and voltage measurement on the photovoltaics.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The solar tracking system in accordance with the embodiments uses a mesh network that provides fail safe functionality.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The following figures are used to illustrate embodiments of the invention.

It will be appreciated that for large energy-generating systems, such as those generating hundreds of megawatts, a small percentage gain in efficiency translates to large gains in energy output.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accordance with one embodiment, a solar tracking system comprising individual rows of solar panel modules adjusts each row independently of the others to provide more finely tuned tracking and also efficiently captures diffuse radiation to increase the total energy output by the system. Preferably, the solar tracking system is based on a performance model that is periodically tuned based on learning algorithms that compare predicted values (e.g., radiance incident on the solar panels or output generated at the solar panels) to the actual values and updates the performance model accordingly. In one embodiment, the performance model is generated by plotting weather conditions (e.g., ratios of diffuse fraction index to optimal diffuse gain or ratios of diffuse radiance to direct radiance) and fitting a curve (the performance model) to the data using regression. In another embodiment, this data is stored in a diffuse table.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a portion of a solar tracking system <b>100</b> including multiple solar panels <b>110</b>A-D forming a grid of solar panel modules, used to explain the principles of the invention. Each of the solar panel modules <b>110</b>A-D has a light-collecting surface for receiving solar radiation, which is later converted into electricity for storage in a battery and for distribution to a load. Embodiments of the invention determine a performance model, predicting the output of the grid, used to orient each of the rows of solar panel modules to the sun or other radiation source to optimize the total energy output from the grid. Preferably, the performance module is determined from a topography of the area containing the grid, local weather conditions for each of the solar panel modules, or both. As one example, the performance model accounts for dependencies (coupling) between the rows (adjacent and otherwise) of solar panels. For example, if the row of solar panel modules <b>110</b>A shades or partially shades the row of solar panel modules <b>110</b>B, the two are said to be coupled. In other words, due to shading at a particular time of day or other relationships between the rows <b>110</b>A and <b>110</b>B, maximizing the global energy output by the entire grid does not necessarily correspond to maximizing the energy output by the row <b>110</b>A and <b>110</b>B. Instead, the global energy output might be maximized by coordinating the outputs, such as by orienting the row <b>110</b>A to generate 80% of its maximum and the row <b>110</b>B to generate 10% of its maximum. The performance model determines these coefficient or gains (and thus the orientation angles to the sun) for each of the all the rows in the system <b>100</b>, including the rows <b>110</b>A and <b>110</b>B.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, in one embodiment, &#x201c;orient&#x201d; means to change an angle between the normal to a solar panel module and the line to the sun (the &#x201c;incident angle&#x201d;), to change any combination of x-y-z coordinates of a solar panel module with respect a fixed location (e.g., GPS location), to rotate the solar panel module along any of the x-y-z coordinate axes, or any combination of these. After reading this disclosure, those skilled in the art will recognize other ways to orient a row of solar panel modules to change an amount of radiation impinging on it and converted to electrical energy.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a solar tracking system <b>200</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The solar tracking system <b>200</b> is a distributed peer-to-peer network. The solar tracking system <b>200</b> includes multiple rows of solar panel modules (SPMs) SPM<sub>1 </sub>. . . SPM<sub>8</sub>, together forming a grid of solar panel modules. Each SPM, (here i=1 to 8, though other values are contemplated) is coupled to a corresponding self-powered controller (SPC<sub>i</sub>) and drive assembly (DA<sub>i</sub>, not shown). Each SPC<sub>i </sub>has logic for orienting its corresponding drive assembly (DA<sub>i</sub>) and thus SPM<sub>i </sub>based on orientation commands. As one example, an SPC<sub>i </sub>receives an orientation command from a network control unit (described below) to orient an incident angle Oi between the SPC<sub>i </sub>and the sun. The corresponding drive assembly DA<sub>i </sub>positions the SPM<sub>i </sub>to the angle &#x3b8;i.

The storage media SM<sub>i </sub>. . . SM<sub>8 </sub>are ganged together and electrically coupled through a distribution panel <b>215</b> to customer loads <b>220</b>. Network control units (NCU) NCU<sub>1 </sub>and NCU<sub>2 </sub>are each wirelessly coupled to one or more of the SPMs. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, NCU<sub>1 </sub>is wirelessly coupled to SPCs SPC<sub>1 </sub>to SPC<sub>4 </sub>and NCU<sub>2 </sub>is wirelessly coupled to SPCs SPC<sub>5 </sub>to SPC<sub>8 </sub>NCU<sub>1 </sub>and NCU<sub>2 </sub>are both coupled over an Ethernet cable to an NXFP switch <b>250</b>. The switch <b>250</b> couples NCU<sub>1 </sub>and NCU<sub>2 </sub>to a NX Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) <b>260</b>, which in turn is couple to a switch <b>270</b> coupled to a remote host <b>296</b> over a network such as a cloud network. In some embodiments, the remote host <b>296</b> performs processing such as generating performance models, retrieving weather data, to name only a few such tasks. For ease of reference, the combination of NCU<sub>1</sub>, NCU<sub>2</sub>, NX SCADA <b>260</b> and NXFP switch <b>250</b> is referred to as an &#x201c;SCU&#x201d; system controller <b>265</b>. Together, the components enclosed by the dotted line <b>280</b> are collectively referred to as &#x201c;grid&#x201d; or &#x201c;zone&#x201d; <b>280</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably, each NCU in the zone <b>280</b> is coupled to each of the remaining NCUs in the zone <b>280</b>, thereby forming a mesh architecture. Thus, if for any reason NCU<sub>1 </sub>loses communication to the NX SCADA <b>260</b>, NCU<sub>1 </sub>can communicate with the NX SCADA <b>260</b> through NCU<sub>2</sub>. In other words, each NCU in the zone <b>280</b> acts as a gateway to the NX SCADA <b>260</b> for any other NCU in the zone <b>280</b>. This added redundancy provides a fail-safe network. In one embodiment, the NCUs in the zone <b>280</b> are wirelessly coupled to each other.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each NCU in the zone <b>280</b> has added functionality. As some examples, the NCUs in the zone <b>280</b> together ensure that the performance model is globally optimized and the components in the zone <b>280</b> are operating properly. If, for example, SPC<sub>1 </sub>instructs NCU<sub>1 </sub>that it is shaded but, according to the performance model SPC<sub>1 </sub>should not be shaded, the NCU<sub>1 </sub>determines that an error has occurred. Each SPC also informs its associated NCU when it has changed its orientation. Using this information, the NCUs can thus keep track of the orientations of the solar panel modules SPM<sub>i</sub>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with one embodiment, if a row of solar panel modules suffers catastrophic failure and cannot communicate with its associated SCADA, the solar panel module enters a default mode. As one example, in default mode, an SPM, optimizes its energy conversion independently of the energy conversion for the entire grid.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It will be appreciated that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> has been simplified for ease of illustration. In other embodiments, the zone <b>280</b> contains fewer, but preferably more, than 8 SPMs and 2 NCUs. In one embodiment, the ratio of SPCs to NCUs is at least between 50:1 to 100:1. Thus, as one example, during normal operation, NCU<sub>1 </sub>communicates with SPC<sub>1 </sub>through SPC<sub>50</sub>, NCU<sub>2 </sub>communicates with SPC<sub>51 </sub>to SPC<sub>100</sub>, etc.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In operation, a performance model is generated for each of the solar panel modules, based on the topography of the area containing a particular solar panel module, the weather local to the particular solar panel module, or both. In one embodiment, the weather comprises amounts of direct light, amounts of direct normal irradiance (DNI), global horizontal irradiance (GHI), diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI), any combination of these, ratios of any two of these (e.g., DHI/GHI), or any function of these. After reading this disclosure, those skilled in the art will recognize functions of DNI, GHI, and DHI that can be used to generate performance models in accordance with the principles of the invention. By fitting the weather conditions to output, a base performance model is determined using regression or other curve-fitting techniques. It will be appreciated that each SPM has its own performance model, based, among other things, on its topography and local weather conditions. As explained below, each base performance model is then updated based on diffuse fraction sky.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As one example, the parameters of the base performance model are pushed to an SPC associated with a solar panel module SPM<sub>i</sub>. These parameters reflect an orientation for a solar panel module if no adjustments based on &#x201c;diffuse fraction&#x201d; sky were needed. To account for diffuse radiation, parameters based on the diffuse angle adjustment are also sent to the particular SPC<sub>i</sub>. As one example, the parameters for a base performance model indicate that, for global optimization of the performance model, a solar panel module should be oriented at an incidence angle of 10 degrees. Diffuse angle adjustor data indicate that 10 degrees is not optimal for this SPM, but instead 70% (a factor of 0.7) of this angle should be used. Thus, the diffuse angle adjustor (gain factor) of 0.7 is pushed to the particular solar panel. When the particular SPC receives both parameters, it orients its associated solar panel to an incidence angle of (0.7)*(10 degrees)=7 degrees. Preferably, the diffuse angle adjustment is performed periodically, such as once every hour, though other periods are able to be used.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Some embodiments of the invention avoid shading in the morning, by using backtracking. The performance model thus generates some gains (e.g., target angles for orienting an SPM) for early morning tracking (to avoid shading) and another gain for other times. The system in accordance with these embodiments are said to operate in two modes: regular tracking and backtracking. That is, the system uses a backtracking algorithm (performance model) at designated times in the early morning and a regular tracking algorithm at all othertimes.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The performance model differentiates between forecasted weather and instantaneous weather. For example, an instantaneous change in weather (e.g., a momentary drop in radiance) may be attributable to a passing cloud rather than an actual change in weather. Thus, preferably the performance model gives more weight to forecasted weather.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of a diffuse control architecture NX SCADA <b>300</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The NX SCADA <b>300</b> receives as input weather forecast (e.g., DFI), NCU and SPC data (unmodified tracking angle), site configuration parameters (e.g., SPC Yield state and Diffuse table) and outputs tracking and backtracking optimal ratios for each SPC. A diffuse table in accordance with one embodiment of the invention plots optimal diffuse gain versus diffuse fraction indexes for determining a performance model.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the steps <b>400</b> of a process for determining parameters for performance models in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. Though the process is performed for each row of solar panels in a grid, the following explanation describes the process for a single row of solar panel modules in a grid. It will be appreciated that the process will be performed for the remaining rows of solar panel modules. First, in the step <b>405</b>, the sun position angle (SPA) is calculated from the latitude and longitude for the particular row of solar panel modules and the time of day. Next, in the step <b>410</b>, it is determined whether the Bit<b>0</b> in the yield state is ON. Here, Bit<b>0</b> and Bit<b>1</b> are a two-bit sequence (Bit<b>0</b>Bit<b>1</b>) used to describe which of a possible <b>4</b> modes the solar tracker is in: Bit<b>0</b>=0/1 corresponds to row-to-row (R2R) tracking being OFF/ON, and Bit<b>1</b>=0/1 corresponds to diffuse tracking being OFF/ON. Thus, for example, Bit<b>0</b>Bit<b>1</b>=01 corresponds to R2R tracking OFF and diffuse tracking ON, Bit<b>0</b>Bit<b>1</b>=10 corresponds to R2R tracking ON and diffuse tracking OFF, etc. In other embodiments, Bit<b>0</b>=1/0 corresponds to R2R tracking being OFF/ON and Bit<b>1</b>=1/0 corresponds to diffuse tracking is OFF/ON. The designations are arbitrary.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">If Bit<b>0</b> is not ON, the process proceeds to the step <b>415</b> in which SPA Tracker is set to the SPA Site, and continues to the step <b>425</b>. If, in the step <b>410</b>, it is determined that the Bit<b>0</b> in the yield state is ON, then the process continues to the step <b>420</b>, where the SPA for the tracker is translated, from which the process continues to the step <b>425</b>. In the step <b>425</b>, &#x201c;backtracking&#x201d; is calculated. From the step <b>425</b>, the algorithm proceeds to the step <b>430</b>, in which it is determined whether Bit<b>1</b> in the yield state is ON. If Bit<b>1</b> is ON, the process continues to the step <b>435</b>; otherwise, if Bit<b>1</b> in the yield state is OFF, the process continues to the step <b>455</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the step <b>435</b>, the process determines whether a diffused ratio has been received in the last 70 minutes. If a diffused ratio has been received in the last 70 minutes, the process continues to the step <b>440</b>; otherwise, the process continues to the step <b>455</b>. In the step <b>440</b>, the process determines whether the particular SPC is in the backtracking mode. If it determined that the SPC is not in the backtracking mode, the process continues to the step <b>445</b>; otherwise, the process continues to the step <b>450</b>. In the step <b>445</b>, the tracker target angle is set to (tracker target angle) * diffused ratio. From the step <b>445</b>, the process continues to the step <b>455</b>. In the step <b>450</b>, the target tracker angle is set to (target tracker angle) * diffused_backtrack_ratio. From the step <b>455</b>, the process continues to the step <b>455</b>.

As used herein, a skinny solar panel, like individual solar panels in an SPM, is able to read an amount of radiation (e.g., solar radiation) striking its surface. Like an SPM, this amount of radiation is able to be related to an orientation (e.g., incidence angle) of the surface to a solar source. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a torque tube supporting both a skinny solar panel <b>910</b> and a row of solar panel modules <b>901</b>, the SPM <b>901</b> comprising individual solar panels <b>901</b>A-J.
