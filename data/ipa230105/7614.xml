It is estimated that NR may provide bitrates on the order of 10-20 Gbit/s or higher, and may support at least enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency-communication (URLLC) as well as massive machine type communication (mMTC). NR is expected to deliver extreme broadband and ultra-robust, low latency connectivity and massive networking to support the Internet of Things (IoT). With IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication becoming more widespread, there will be a growing need for networks that meet the needs of lower power, low data rate, and long battery life. It is noted that, in 5G, the nodes that can provide radio access functionality to a user equipment (i.e., similar to Node B in UTRAN or eNB in LTE) may be named gNB when built on NR radio and may be named NG-eNB when built on E-UTRA radio.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For proper understanding of example embodiments, reference should be made to the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example signal diagram for UE-based positioning NLOS error mitigation, according to some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example probability distribution function for NLOS bias, according to some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a mixture of Gaussian approximations of a NLOS bias histogram, according to some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates example downlink time difference of arrival (DL-TDOA) positioning errors with a <b>5</b> megahertz (MHz) positioning reference signal (PRS), according to some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example flow diagram of a method, according to some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example flow diagram of a method, according to some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>a </i></figref>illustrates an example block diagram of an apparatus, according to an embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrates an example block diagram of an apparatus, according to another embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION:</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It will be readily understood that the components of certain example embodiments, as generally described and illustrated in the figures herein, may be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following detailed description of some example embodiments of systems, methods, apparatuses, and computer program products for UE-based positioning NLOS error mitigation is not intended to limit the scope of certain embodiments but is representative of selected example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The features, structures, or characteristics of example embodiments described throughout this specification may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more example embodiments. For example, the usage of the phrases &#x201c;certain embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;some embodiments,&#x201d; or other similar language, throughout this specification refers to the fact that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with an embodiment may be included in at least one embodiment. Thus, appearances of the phrases &#x201c;in certain embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;in some embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;in other embodiments,&#x201d; or other similar language, throughout this specification do not necessarily all refer to the same group of embodiments, and the described features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additionally, if desired, the different functions or operations discussed below may be performed in a different order and/or concurrently with each other.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, if desired, one or more of the described functions or operations may be optional or may be combined. As such, the following description should be considered as merely illustrative of the principles and teachings of certain example embodiments, and not in limitation thereof.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">UE-based positioning may refer to when a UE is the device that is performing the actual positioning calculation. In cellular networks, the network side has typically performed the positioning calculation based on measurement reports made either at the UE or at the network side (e.g., at the location management function (LMF)). UE-based positioning may reduce the latency needed relative to downlink (DL) UE-assisted positioning since the UE may not have to make any measurement reports to the network before the position calculation can be done by the network. This latency reduction may be, for example, important for use cases with tight latency needs, such as for private networks or vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications. During UE-based positioning, the location of one or more network nodes (e.g., gNBs) may have to be signalled to the UE so that it can perform the positioning calculation locally.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In LTE, one of the commonly deployed positioning solutions is observed time difference of arrival (OTDOA). NR OTDOA (which may be referred to as downlink time difference of arrival (DL-TDOA)) may be implemented in NR. Using DL signals, the time difference of arrival (TDOA) between multiple network nodes' transmissions may be estimated at a UE. In LTE, the DL signal used for OTDOA may be called the positioning reference signal (PRS), which may again be introduced. The UE may measure the reference signal time difference (RSTD) using PRSs from different cells and may report the RSTD measurements to a location server, as an example of a network node. The UE may communicate with the location server using the LTE positioning protocol (LPP). The location server, which may be called an LMF in NR, may then use the known positions of the network nodes (e.g., base stations) and the RSTD measurements to calculate the position of the UE. In the case of UE-based positioning, the positions of the network nodes may be communicated to the UE and, therefore, the RSTD measurement report may not have to be sent.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">One challenge for positioning using radio frequency (RF) signals may include the existence of NLOS conditions. For timing-based techniques, the time of arrival of the signal may be positively biased away from the true propagation time of the signal between devices due to the additional time it takes for the signals to arrive in NLOS conditions. Additional bias of the time of arrival of the signal on the order of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds (ns) may not be atypical for NLOS signals in cellular environments, for example. In this example, 50 ns of bias of the time of arrival of the signal may cause a ranging error of 15 meters (m) if uncompensated. To be sufficient for many commercial use cases for NR positioning, it may be needed to address the NLOS bias of time of arrival of the signal.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">One possible solution to the NLOS bias problem for positioning is to use a blind learning-type algorithm for channel bias distribution estimation (which may be referred to as a NLOS mitigation algorithm or a channel bias estimation). A blind learning-type algorithm may learn the distribution of the bias of the time of arrival caused by NLOS conditions and may use this to improve the positioning accuracy.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Some embodiments described herein may provide for use of a blind-learning-type algorithm for channel bias distribution estimation for UE-based positioning. For example, the UE may perform a calculation of a positioning of the UE using NLOS bias distribution information received from a network node, as described elsewhere herein. In this way, the UE may perform UE-based positioning, which may reduce latency relative to network node-based positioning. Reducing latency may improve communications between devices, and in particular, URLLC communications.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example signal diagram for UE-based positioning NLOS error mitigation, according to some embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a network node (e.g., an LMF, a base station, and/or the like) and a UE.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As illustrated at <b>100</b>, the UE may transmit, and the network node may receive, a minimization drive test (MDT) report including NLOS bias information. The NLOS bias information may include reference signal time difference (RSTD)-related information or time of arrival (TOA)-related measurements. This may provide UE reporting of NLOS bias information as a new MDT measurement so that it can be gathered and used using the MDT mechanism. The UE NLOS bias information report may include a collection of RSTD measurements over time or a collection of RSTD bias estimates over time.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The NLOS bias information may be reported in a UEInformationResponse radio resource control (RRC) message to a network node (e.g., a gNB), which the network node may distribute to another network node (e.g., a LMF) using new radio positioning protocol A (NRPPa) (in some embodiments, NLOS bias information may be reported directly to a network node (e.g., a LMF) using the long-term evolution positioning protocol (LPP)). The full RSTD measurement report used in LPP may not be needed when the MDT reporting mechanism is used. The collection of RSTD measurements and RSTD bias estimates may be tailored for use by the network node (e.g., the LMF) for blind-learning-type algorithms as the RSTD measurements reported in MDT may not be used to compute the UE location by the network node. The UE may report locally computed statistical parameters (described elsewhere herein) or may report a performance of a latest blind learning algorithm model for network evaluation/refinement.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As illustrated at <b>102</b>, the network node may determine at least one estimation of a NLOS bias distribution and at least one statistical parameter associated with representing the NLOS bias distribution. For example, the network node may perform an estimation of NLOS bias distribution based on one or more reporting mechanisms. Although some embodiments are described in the context of DL-TDOA, certain embodiments described here may apply equally to observed time difference of arrival (OTDOA).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The statistical parameters may include a mean of a mixture of Gaussian distributions of NLOS bias (e.g., a mixture of Gaussian distributions may be a Gaussian distribution of multiple Gaussian distributions), a standard deviation of the mixture of Gaussian distributions of NLOS bias, a weight of Gaussian distributions included in the mixture of Gaussian distributions, and/or the like. These parameters may be associated with recreating or representing an NLOS bias distribution. The network node may also report how many RSTD measurements it used to calculate the statistical parameters.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As one example, in some scenarios, two Gaussian distributions may be sufficient to represent the NLOS bias distribution. In this case, two weights, two means, and two standard deviations may be included in the statistical parameters. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, described below, illustrates an example of how the distribution may be visualized and the parameters that describe it. Each of the parameters may be represented by a certain number of bits in a message or in signalling. The number of bits may depend on the overall positioning accuracy that is desired. In certain embodiments, the statistical parameters may be any statistical parameter that can be used to represent the NLOS bias distribution, which may be different than the example parameters described above for a mixture of Gaussian distributions. In some embodiments, the NLOS bias distribution may be different than a Gaussian distribution, such as a Poisson distribution, an exponential distribution, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the number of distributions used may differ depending on the type of device performing the blind learning algorithm For example, the mean and standard deviation of three Gaussian distributions may be sufficient for an entity other than the network node to recreate the NLOS bias distribution and to, therefore, use a blind learning algorithm</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As illustrated at <b>104</b>, the UE and the network node may communicate with each other to perform a positioning request. As illustrated at <b>106</b>, the UE may transmit, and the network node may receive, a request for NLOS bias distribution information. For example, a UE performing UE based positioning may request NLOS bias distribution information. This request may be in the form of an accuracy threshold (e.g., the UE may request accuracy above or below a threshold and the network node (e.g., the LMF) may determine that the UE-based blind learning algorithm is to be used based on this). The accuracy threshold may also be in the form of Quality of Service (QoS) information. Additionally, or alternatively, the request may include subscription information that identifies a subscription of the UE (e.g., the network node may determine NLOS bias distribution information based on the subscription). The request may be sent over LPP, for example, and may be an extension of an LPP OTDOA-RequestAssistanceData information element (IE).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A timer may be configured by the network node and expiration of the timer may be tracked by the UE to determine when the NLOS bias distribution information is outdated. In some embodiments, the network node may signal the UE that new NLOS bias distribution information is available and may then transmit the NLOS bias distribution information to the UE. For example, updating NLOS bias distribution information may occur in the case of a dynamic environment change that may have an updated model.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the network node may determine to transmit the NLOS bias distribution information without receiving a request for the NLOS bias distribution information (e.g., based on a subscription of the UE). For example, the network node may store subscription information for particular UEs and may transmit the NLOS bias distribution information based on this subscription (e.g., the network node may determine which UEs pay for use of a UE-based blind learning algorithm and may signal parameters to that UE when it is configured for DL-TDOA).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated at <b>108</b>, the network node may transmit, and the UE may receive, the NLOS bias distribution information. This transmission may occur over LPP, for example, and may be an extension of the LPP OTDOA-ProvideAssistanceData IE. The non-line of sight (NLOS) bias distribution information may include a statistical parameter associated with representing a NLOS bias distribution. For example, the NLOS bias distribution may include the number of Gaussian distributions included in the mixture of Gaussian distributions (which may represent the NLOS bias distribution), the mean of the Gaussian distributions, the variance of the Gaussian distributions, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Additionally, or alternatively, the NLOS bias distribution information may be associated with information that identifies a location of one or more gNBs (or other network nodes). The statistics of the bias may be relatively stable over time due to relatively consistent operation of the gNBs over time. As a result, to save on downlink bandwidth, the bias parameters may not have to be communicated by the network node to a UE if the UE already received the values for those parameters and if the values have not changed. Similarly, the gNB locations may not change with time. As a result, the network node may not have to communicate this information if the UE received it previously.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As illustrated at <b>110</b>, the UE may perform a positioning reference signal (PRS) reception and/or measurement. As illustrated at <b>112</b>, the UE may perform a calculation of a position of the UE using the NLOS bias distribution information. In some embodiments, performing the calculation may comprise computing a bias realization for the network node. For example, for a given positioning estimate of the UE (e.g., obtained through use of a blind learning algorithm), the UE may compute a bias realization for each gNB by subtracting the measured time of flight (derived from the RSTD for that gNB and the estimated transmit time) from a line of sight (LOS) time of flight determined from the distance between the gNB and the estimated UE position.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this way, some embodiments described herein facilitate the use of a blind learning algorithm during UE-based positioning by providing signalling for the UE to obtain an NLOS bias distribution. The use of a blind learning algorithm may facilitate the UE calculating its position more accurately while still doing so in a low latency manner (due to these operations being UE based). Without obtaining the NLOS bias distribution, UE-based positioning relying on timing-based techniques, such as DL-TDOA, may be limited in the accuracy it can achieve. The network derivation of a NLOS bias distribution may be performed using the MDT measurements gathered and provided to the network node (e.g., a positioning server). Providing this information to a positioning server may facilitate improved calculation of NLOS bias distributions based on a large quantity of UEs reporting the NLOS bias information to the positioning server.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As described above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is provided as an example.
