A detection substrate is provided, wherein: the detection substrate includes a substrate; a plurality of pillar structures, and a plurality of first target-analyte linking substances; the pillar structures are disposed on the substrate; the pillar structures have a Raman active surface; and the first target-analyte linking substances are disposed on the pillar structures. A liquid sample is provided on the detection substrate, wherein: the liquid sample includes a liquid solution, a sample, a plurality of particles, a plurality of second target-analyte linking substances, and a plurality of Raman tags; the sample is in the liquid solution; the particles are also in the liquid solution; the second target-analyte linking substances are disposed on the particles; and the Raman tags are provided on the particles. After the liquid sample is provided on the detection substrate, a Raman signal of the sample is measured under conditions where the liquid solution is present.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, in the detection method of SERS mentioned above, after providing the liquid sample on the detection substrate, the Raman signal of the sample may be measured without cleaning.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, in the detection method of SERS mentioned above, under conditions where an intensity of the Raman signal of the sample reaches a specific Raman-signal intensity, it is determined that the sample includes a target analyte, and under conditions where the intensity of the Raman signal of the sample does not reach the specific Raman-signal intensity, it is determined that the sample does not include the target analyte.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, in the detection method of SERS mentioned above, the ratio of the maximum length of the top-view pattern of the pillar structures to the gap between the adjacent pillar structures may range from 0.2 to 0.4.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, in the detection method of SERS mentioned above, the material of the substrate is, for example, plastic.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Based on the above, in the detection substrate of SERS and the detection system of SERS proposed by the present disclosure, since the ratio of the maximum length of the top-view pattern of the pillar structures to the gap between the adjacent pillar structures is in the range of 0.2 to 0.4, it may effectively enhance the intensity of the Raman signal and facilitate the pathogen screening in a convenient and rapid way. In addition, the detection system of SERS proposed by the present disclosure provides a solution of sandwich capture technique. That is, the target analyte is captured by linking the first target-analyte linking substances on the pillar structures and the second target-analyte linking substances on the particles respectively to the target analyte, which increases specificity and sensitivity.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, in the detection method of SERS proposed in the present disclosure, the first target-analyte linking substances on the pillar structures, the second target-analyte linking substances on the particles, and the sample may undergo a one-pot reaction. Under conditions where the sample includes the target analyte, the target analyte is bound to the first target-analyte linking substances on the pillar structures and the second target-analyte linking substances on the particles. In this way, as the particles combined with the target object are close to the hot spot above the detection substrate, a clear Raman signal is generated by the Raman tags on the particles to perform the pathogen screening. In addition, since the SERS measurement is highly related to distance, particles that are not bound to the target object are suspended on the surface of the liquid sample and thus do not affect the measurement result. In this way, after the liquid sample is provided on the detection substrate, the Raman signal of the sample may be measured under conditions where the liquid solution is present (for example, without cleaning), and therefore, the pathogen screening may be carried out in a convenient and rapid way without being affected by background noise (e.g., the particles that are not bound to the target analyte).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In order to make the above-mentioned features and advantages of the present disclosure more comprehensible, the following specific embodiments are described in detail in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a detection substrate of SERS according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a top view of the detection substrate of the SERS in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a detection system of SERS according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart of a detection method of SERS according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a detection substrate of SERS according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a top view of the detection substrate of the SERS in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a detection substrate <b>10</b> of SERS includes a substrate <b>100</b>, a plurality of pillar structures <b>102</b>, and a plurality of target-analyte linking substances <b>104</b>.

In some embodiments, the ratio of a maximum length L of the top-view pattern of pillar structures <b>102</b> to a gap S<b>2</b> between adjacent pillar structures <b>102</b> ranges from 0.2 to 0.4.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Then, a liquid sample <b>300</b> is provided on the detection substrate <b>10</b> in step S<b>102</b>. For the liquid sample <b>300</b>, reference may be made to the description of the foregoing embodiment, as the same description is not repeated herein.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">After the liquid sample <b>300</b> is provided on the detection substrate <b>10</b>, under conditions where a liquid solution <b>302</b> is present, a Raman signal of the sample <b>304</b> is measured in step S<b>104</b>. That is, after the liquid sample <b>300</b> is provided on the detection substrate <b>10</b>, the Raman signal of the sample <b>304</b> may be measured without cleaning, so that the pathogen screening is carried out in a convenient and rapid way. In some embodiments, the Raman signal of the sample <b>304</b> can be measured by the Raman spectrometer <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, under conditions where the intensity of the Raman signal of the sample <b>304</b> reaches a specific Raman-signal intensity, it is determined that the sample <b>304</b> includes a target analyte (e.g., the virus that causes COVID-19), and under conditions where the intensity of the Raman signal of the sample <b>304</b> does not reach the specific Raman-signal intensity, it is determined that the sample <b>304</b> does not include the target analyte.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Based on the foregoing embodiments, it can be known that in the foregoing detection method of SERS, the target-analyte linking substances <b>104</b> on the pillar structures <b>102</b>, the target-analyte linking substances <b>308</b> on the particles <b>306</b>, and the sample <b>304</b> may undergo a pot reaction. Under conditions where the sample <b>304</b> includes the target analyte, the target analyte is bound to the target-analyte linking substances <b>104</b> on the pillar structures <b>102</b> and the target-analyte linking substances <b>308</b> on the particles <b>306</b>. In this way, as the particles <b>306</b> combined with the target object are close to the hot spot above the detection substrate <b>10</b>, a clear Raman signal is generated by the Raman tags <b>310</b> on the particles <b>306</b> to perform the pathogen screening. In some embodiments, before the target analyte bound to the particles <b>306</b> is combined with the target-analyte linking substances <b>104</b> on the substrate <b>10</b>, as long as the particles <b>306</b> bound to the target analyte are close to the hot spot above the detection substrate <b>10</b>, a clear Raman signal may be generated by the Raman tags <b>310</b> on the particles <b>306</b>, which further speeds up the process of the pathogen screening. In addition, since the SERS measurement is highly related to distance, the particles <b>306</b> that are not bound to the target object are suspended on the surface of the liquid sample <b>300</b> and thus do not affect the measurement result. In this way, after the liquid sample <b>300</b> is provided on the detection substrate <b>10</b>, the Raman signal of the sample <b>304</b> may be measured under conditions where the liquid solution <b>302</b> is present (for example, without cleaning), and therefore, the pathogen screening may be carried out in a convenient and rapid way without being affected by background noise (e.g., the particles that are not bound to the target analyte).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In summary, in the inspection substrate and the inspection system of SERS in the above embodiments, since the ratio of the maximum length of the top-view pattern of the pillar structures to the gap between the adjacent pillar structures ranges from 0.2 to 0.4, the intensity of the Raman signal may be enhanced effectively, and the pathogen screening may be facilitated in a convenient and rapid way. In addition, the detection system of SERS in the above embodiment provides a solution of sandwich capture technique that increases specificity and sensitivity. Moreover, in the detection method of SERS in the above embodiment, after providing the liquid sample on the detection substrate, the Raman signal of the sample may be measured under conditions where the liquid solution is present, so that the pathogen screening may be carried out in a convenient and rapid way without being affected by background noise.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although the present disclosure has been disclosed in the above embodiments, they are not intended to limit the present disclosure.
