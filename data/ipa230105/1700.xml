In addition, the introduction pipe <b>20</b> provided to the sub-tank <b>22</b> described later also has a third valve mechanism <b>60</b>.

This needle hole <b>29</b>B, as described below, performs a function the same as or similar to that of the second atmosphere communication portion <b>25</b> in the first and second embodiments. Hence, the rear wall portion <b>21</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>21</b> in the present embodiment does not have the second atmosphere communication portions <b>25</b> described in the first and second embodiments. The needle <b>24</b>B has openings at both the front and rear ends.
