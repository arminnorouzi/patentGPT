An aerosol source for an aerosol provision system may thus comprise a heater having a heating element arranged to receive source liquid from the reservoir, for example through wicking/capillary action. While a user inhales on the device, electrical power is supplied to the heating element to vaporize source liquid in the vicinity of the heating element to generate an aerosol for inhalation by the user. Such devices are usually provided with one or more air inlet holes located away from a mouthpiece end of the system. When a user sucks on a mouthpiece connected to the mouthpiece end of the system, air is drawn in through the inlet holes and past the aerosol source. There is a flow path connecting between the aerosol source and an opening in the mouthpiece so that air drawn past the aerosol source continues along the flow path to the mouthpiece opening, carrying some of the aerosol from the aerosol source with it. The aerosol-carrying air exits the aerosol provision system through the mouthpiece opening for inhalation by the user.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Other aerosol provision devices generate aerosol from a solid material, such as tobacco or a tobacco derivative. Such devices operate in a broadly similar manner to the liquid-based systems described above, in that the solid tobacco material is heated to a vaporization temperature to generate an aerosol which is subsequently inhaled by a user.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When heating a material to generate aerosol, several factors may determine the efficiency of heating and delivery of aerosol to a user.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various approaches are described which seek to help address some of these issues.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008"

discussed/described herein. Some aspects and features of certain examples and embodiments may be implemented conventionally and these are not discussed/described in detail in the interests of brevity. It will thus be appreciated that aspects and features of examples and embodiments discussed herein which are not described in detail may be implemented in accordance with any conventional techniques for implementing such aspects and features.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present disclosure relates to a &#x201c;non-combustible&#x201d; aerosol provision system. A &#x201c;non-combustible&#x201d; aerosol provision system is one where a constituent aerosolizable material of the aerosol provision system (or component thereof) is not combusted or burned in order to facilitate delivery of an aerosol to a user. Furthermore, and as is common in the technical field, the terms &#x201c;vapor&#x201d; and &#x201c;aerosol&#x201d;, and related terms such as &#x201c;vaporize&#x201d;, &#x201c;volatilize&#x201d; and &#x201c;aerosolize&#x201d;, may generally be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some implementations, the non-combustible aerosol provision system is an electronic cigarette, also known as a vaping device or electronic nicotine delivery system (END), although it is noted that the presence of nicotine in the aerosolizable material is not a requirement. Throughout the following description the terms &#x201c;e-cigarette&#x201d; or &#x201c;electronic cigarette&#x201d; are sometimes used but these terms may be used interchangeably with aerosol (vapor) provision system.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Typically, the non-combustible aerosol provision system may comprise a non-combustible aerosol provision device and an article (sometimes referred to as a consumable) for use with the non-combustible aerosol provision device. However, it is envisaged that articles which themselves comprise a means for powering an aerosol generating component may themselves form the non-combustible aerosol provision system.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The article, part or all of which, is intended to be consumed during use by a user. The article may comprise or consist of aerosolizable material (also referred to as an aerosol generating material). The article may comprise one or more other elements, such as a filter or an aerosol modifying substance (e.g. a component to add a flavor to, or otherwise alter the properties of, an aerosol that passes through or over the aerosol modifying substance).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Non-combustible aerosol provision systems often, though not always, comprise a modular assembly including both a reusable aerosol provision device and a replaceable article. In some implementations, the non-combustible aerosol provision device may comprise a power source and a controller (or control circuitry). The power source may, for example, be an electric power source, such as a battery or rechargeable battery. In some implementations, the non-combustible aerosol provision device may also comprise an aerosol generating component. However, in other implementations the article may comprise partially, or entirely, or consist of, the aerosol generating component.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some implementations, the aerosol generating component is a heater capable of interacting with the aerosolizable material so as to release one or more volatiles from the aerosolizable material to form an aerosol. The heater (or a heating element) may comprise one or more electrically resistive heaters, including for example one or more nichrome resistive heater(s) and/or one or more ceramic heater(s). The one or more heaters may comprise one or more induction heaters which includes an arrangement comprising one or more susceptors which may form a chamber into which an article comprising aerosolizable material is inserted or otherwise located in use. Alternatively or in addition, one or more susceptors may be provided in the aerosolizable material. Other heating arrangements may also be used.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The article for use with the non-combustible aerosol provision device generally comprises an aerosolizable material. Aerosolizable material, which also may be referred to herein as aerosol generating material, is material that is capable of generating aerosol, for example when heated, irradiated or energized in any other way. Aerosolizable material may, for example, be in the form of a solid, liquid or gel which may or may not contain nicotine and/or flavorants.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the following disclosure, the aerosolizable material is described as comprising an &#x201c;amorphous solid&#x201d;, which may alternatively be referred to as a &#x201c;monolithic solid&#x201d; (i.e. non-fibrous). In some implementations, the amorphous solid may be a dried gel. The amorphous solid is a solid material that may retain some fluid, such as liquid, within it. In some implementations, the aerosolizable material may for example comprise from about 50 wt %, 60 wt % or 70 wt % of amorphous solid, to about 90 wt %, 95 wt % or 100 wt % of amorphous solid.

Generally, the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> or amorphous solid may comprise a gelling agent (sometimes referred to as a binder) and an aerosol generating agent (which might comprise glycerol, for example). The gelling agent may comprise one or more compounds selected from cellulosic gelling agents, non-cellulosic gelling agents, guar gum, acacia gum and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the cellulosic gelling agent is selected from the group consisting of: hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), cellulose acetate propionate (CAP) and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the gelling agent comprises (or is) one or more of hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), carboxymethylcellulose, guar gum, or acacia gum. In some embodiments, the gelling agent comprises (or is) one or more non-cellulosic gelling agents, including, but not limited to, agar, xanthan gum, gum Arabic, guar gum, locust bean gum, pectin, carrageenan, starch, alginate, and combinations thereof. In preferred embodiments, the non-cellulose based gelling agent is alginate or agar.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The gelling agent may further comprise a setting agent (e.g., a calcium source). In certain implementations, the setting agent comprises or consists of calcium acetate, calcium formate, calcium carbonate, calcium hydrogencarbonate, calcium chloride, calcium lactate, or a combination thereof. In certain implementations, the setting agent comprises or consists of calcium formate and/or calcium lactate. In particular examples, the setting agent comprises or consists of calcium formate. The inventors have identified that, typically, employing calcium formate as a setting agent results in an amorphous solid having a greater tensile strength and greater resistance to elongation.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The aerosol generating material <b>44</b> or amorphous solid may comprise one or more of the following: an active substance (which may include a tobacco extract), a flavorant, an acid, and a filler. Other components may also be present as desired. In certain embodiments, the aerosol-generating material <b>44</b> or amorphous solid comprises a gelling agent comprising a cellulosic gelling agent and/or a non-cellulosic gelling agent, an active substance and an acid.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The acid may be an organic acid. In some of these embodiments, the acid may be at least one of a monoprotic acid, a diprotic acid and a triprotic acid. In some such embodiments, the acid may contain at least one carboxyl functional group. In some such embodiments, the acid may be at least one of an alpha-hydroxy acid, carboxylic acid, dicarboxylic acid, tricarboxylic acid and keto acid. In some such embodiments, the acid may be an alpha-keto acid. In some such embodiments, the acid may be at least one of succinic acid, lactic acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid, levulinic acid, acetic acid, malic acid, formic acid, sorbic acid, benzoic acid, propanoic and pyruvic acid. Suitably the acid is lactic acid. In other embodiments, the acid is benzoic acid. In other embodiments the acid may be an inorganic acid. In some of these embodiments the acid may be a mineral acid. In some such embodiments, the acid may be at least one of sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, boric acid and phosphoric acid. In some embodiments, the acid is levulinic acid. The inclusion of an acid is particularly preferred in embodiments in which the aerosol-generating material <b>44</b> comprises nicotine. In such embodiments, the presence of an acid may stabilize dissolved species in the slurry from which the aerosol-generating material <b>44</b> is formed. The presence of the acid may reduce or substantially prevent evaporation of nicotine during drying of the slurry, thereby reducing loss of nicotine during manufacturing.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The amorphous solid may comprise a colorant. The addition of a colorant may alter the visual appearance of the amorphous solid. The presence of colorant in the amorphous solid may enhance the visual appearance of the amorphous solid and the aerosol-generating material <b>44</b>. By adding a colorant to the amorphous solid, the amorphous solid may be color-matched to other components of the aerosol-generating material <b>44</b> or to other components of an article comprising the amorphous solid.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">A variety of colorants may be used depending on the desired color of the amorphous solid. The color of amorphous solid may be, for example, white, green, red, purple, blue, brown or black. Other color are also envisaged. Natural or synthetic colorants, such as natural or synthetic dyes, food-grade colorants and pharmaceutical-grade colorants may be used. In certain embodiments, the colorant is caramel, which may confer the amorphous solid with a brown appearance. In such embodiments, the color of the amorphous solid may be similar to the color of other components (such as tobacco material) in an aerosol-generating material <b>44</b> comprising the amorphous solid. In some embodiments, the addition of a colorant to the amorphous solid renders it visually indistinguishable from other components in the aerosol-generating material <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The colorant may be incorporated during the formation of the amorphous solid (e.g. when forming a slurry comprising the materials that form the amorphous solid) or it may be applied to the amorphous solid after its formation (e.g. by spraying it onto the amorphous solid).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">An amorphous solid aerosolizable material offers some advantages over other types of aerosolizable materials commonly found in some electronic aerosol provision devices. For example, compared to electronic aerosol provision devices which aerosolize a liquid aerosolizable material, the potential for the amorphous solid to leak or otherwise flow from a location at which the amorphous solid is stored is greatly reduced. This means aerosol provision devices or articles may be more cheaply manufactured as the components do not necessarily require the same liquid-tight seals or the like to be used.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Compared to electronic aerosol provision devices which aerosolize a solid aerosolizable material, e.g., tobacco, a comparably lower mass of amorphous solid material can be aerosolized to generate an equivalent amount of aerosol (or to provide an equivalent amount of a constituent in the aerosol, e.g., nicotine). This is partially due to the fact that an amorphous solid can be tailored to not include unsuitable constituents that might be found in other solid aerosolizable materials (e.g., cellulosic material in tobacco, for example). For example, in some implementations, the mass per portion of amorphous solid is no greater than 20 mg, or no greater than 10 mg, or no greater than 5 mg. Accordingly, the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> can supply relatively less power to the aerosol generating article <b>4</b> and/or the aerosol generating article <b>4</b> can be comparably smaller to generate a similar aerosol, thus meaning the energy requirements for the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the amorphous solid comprises tobacco extract. In these embodiments, the amorphous solid may have the following composition (by Dry Weight Basis, DWB): gelling agent (preferably comprising alginate) in an amount of from about 1 wt % to about 60 wt %, or about 10 wt % to 30 wt %, or about 15 wt % to about 25 wt %; tobacco extract in an amount of from about 10 wt % to about 60 wt %, or from about 40 wt % to 55 wt %, or from about 45 wt % to about 50 wt %; aerosol generating agent (preferably comprising glycerol) in an amount of from about 5 wt % to about 60 wt %, or from about 20 wt % to about 40 wt %, or from about 25 wt % to about 35 wt % (DWB).

Resistive heating elements <b>24</b> receive an electrical current and convert the electrical energy into heat. The resistive heating elements <b>24</b> may be formed from, or comprise, any suitable resistive heating material, such as NiChrome (Ni20Cr80), which generates heat upon receiving an electrical current. In one implementation, the heating elements <b>24</b> may comprise an electrically insulating substrate on which resistive tracks are disposed.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional, top-down view of the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> showing the arrangement of the heating elements <b>24</b> in more detail. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the heating elements <b>24</b> are positioned such that a surface of a heating element <b>24</b> forms a part of the surface of the receptacle <b>25</b>. That is, an outer surface of a heating element <b>24</b> is flush with the inner surface of the receptacle <b>25</b>. More specifically, the outer surface of a heating element <b>24</b> that is flush with the inner surface of the receptacle <b>25</b> is a surface of heating element <b>24</b> that is heated (i.e., its temperature increases) when an electrical current is passed through the heating element <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the present example, the heating element <b>24</b> is formed of an electrically-conductive plate, which defines the surface of the heating element <b>24</b> that is arranged to increase in temperature. The electrically-conductive plate may be formed of a metallic material, for example, NiChrome, which generates heat when a current is passed through the electrically-conductive plate. In other implementations, a separate electrically-conductive track may pass on a surface of, or through, a second material (e.g., a metal material or a ceramic material), with the electrically-conductive track generating heat that is transferred to the second material. That is, the second material in combination with the electrically-conductive track form the heating element <b>24</b>. In the latter example, the surface of the heating element <b>24</b> that is arranged to increase in temperature is defined by the perimeter of the second material.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the described implementation, the surfaces of the heating elements <b>24</b> that are arranged to increase in temperature are also planar and are generally located in a plane parallel to a wall of the receptacle <b>25</b>. However, in other implementations, the surfaces may be curved; that is to say, the plane in which the surfaces of the heating elements <b>24</b> are located may have a radius of curvature in one axis (e.g., the surface may be approximately parabolic). The heating elements <b>24</b> are arranged such that, when the article <b>4</b> is received in the receptacle <b>25</b>, each heating element <b>24</b> aligns with a corresponding discrete portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. Hence, in this example, six heating elements <b>24</b> are arranged in a two by three array broadly corresponding to the arrangement of the two by three array of the six discrete portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. However, as discussed above, the number of heating elements <b>24</b> may be different in different implementations, for example there may be 8, 10, 12, 14, etc. heating elements <b>24</b>. In some implementations, the number of heating elements <b>24</b> is greater than or equal to six but no greater than 20.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">More specifically, the heating elements <b>24</b> are labelled <b>24</b><i>a </i>to <b>24</b><i>f </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and it should be appreciated that each heating element <b>24</b> is arranged to align with a corresponding portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> as denoted by the corresponding letter following the references <b>24</b>/<b>44</b>. Accordingly, each of the heating elements <b>24</b> can be individually activated to heat a corresponding portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. It is also contemplated that heating elements <b>24</b> may sequentially heat different portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. In such implementations (not shown) the heating element <b>24</b> and portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may move relative to each other. For example, the aerosol generating article <b>4</b> may slide along, or revolve around, the receptacle <b>25</b>.

In either case, the aerosol generating article <b>4</b> contacts the surfaces of the heating elements <b>24</b> when present in the receptacle <b>25</b> such that heat generated by the heating elements <b>24</b> is conducted to the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> through the carrier component <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some implementations, to improve the heat-transfer efficiency, the receptacle may comprise components which apply a force to the surface of the carrier component <b>42</b> so as to press the carrier component <b>42</b> onto the heater elements <b>24</b>, thereby increasing the efficiency of heat transfer via conduction to the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the heater elements <b>24</b> may be configured to move in the direction towards/away from the aerosol generating article <b>4</b>, and may be pressed into the surface of carrier component <b>42</b> that does not comprise the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In use, the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> (and more specifically the control circuitry <b>23</b>) is configured to deliver power to the heating elements <b>24</b> in response to a user input. Broadly speaking, the control circuitry <b>23</b> is configured to selectively apply power to the heating elements <b>24</b> to subsequently heat the corresponding portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> to generate aerosol. When a user inhales on the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> (i.e., inhales at mouthpiece end <b>26</b>), air is drawn into the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> through air inlet <b>27</b>, into the receptacle <b>25</b> where it mixes with the aerosol generated by heating the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, and then to the user's mouth via air outlet <b>28</b>.

Collectively, the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> and inhalation sensor <b>30</b> act as mechanisms for receiving a user input to cause the generation of aerosol, and thus may more broadly be referred to as user input mechanisms. The received user input may be said to be indicative of a user's desire to generate an aerosol.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> may be a capacitive touch sensor and can be operated by a user of the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> placing their finger or another suitably conductive object (for example a stylus) on the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b>. In the described implementation, the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> includes a region which can be pressed by a user to start aerosol generation. The control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to receive signaling from the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> and to use this signaling to determine if a user is pressing (i.e. activating) the region of the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b>. If the control circuitry <b>23</b> receives this signaling, then the control circuitry <b>23</b> is configured to supply power from the power source <b>22</b> to one or more of the heating elements <b>24</b>. Power may be supplied for a predetermined time period (for example, three seconds) from the moment a touch is detected, or in response to the length of time the touch is detected for.

The inhalation sensor <b>30</b> is located in fluid communication with the air flow pathway (that is, in fluid communication with the air flow path between air inlet <b>27</b> and air outlet <b>28</b>). In a similar manner as described above, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to receive signaling from the inhalation sensor <b>30</b> and to use this signaling to determine if a user is inhaling on the aerosol provision system <b>1</b>. If the control circuitry <b>23</b> receives this signaling, then the control circuitry <b>23</b> is configured to supply power from the power source <b>22</b> to one or more of the heating elements <b>24</b>. Power may be supplied for a predetermined time period (for example, three seconds) from the moment inhalation is detected, or in response to the length of time the inhalation is detected for.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the described example, both the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> and inhalation sensor <b>30</b> detect the user's desire to begin generating aerosol for inhalation. The control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to only supply power to the heating element <b>24</b> when signaling from both the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> and inhalation sensor <b>30</b> are detected. This may help prevent inadvertent activation of the heating elements <b>24</b> from accidental activation of one of the user input mechanisms. However, in other implementations, the aerosol provision system <b>1</b> may have only one of a touch sensitive panel <b>29</b> and an inhalation sensor <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">These aspects of the operation of the aerosol provision system <b>1</b> (i.e. puff detection and touch detection) may in themselves be performed in accordance with established techniques (for example using conventional inhalation sensor and inhalation sensor signal processing techniques and using conventional touch sensor and touch sensor signal processing techniques).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some implementations, in response to detecting the signaling from either one or both of the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> and inhalation sensor <b>30</b>, the control circuitry <b>23</b> is configured to sequentially supply power to each of the individual heating elements <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">More specifically, the control circuitry <b>23</b> is configured to sequentially supply power to each of the individual heating elements <b>23</b> in response to a sequence of detections of the signaling received from either one or both of the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> and inhalation sensor <b>30</b>. For example, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to supply power to a first heating element <b>24</b> of the plurality of heating elements <b>24</b> when the signaling is first detected (e.g., from when the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> is first switched on). When the signaling stops, or in response to the predetermined time from the signaling being detected elapsing, the control circuitry <b>23</b> registers that the first heating element <b>24</b> has been activated (and thus the corresponding discrete portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> has been heated). The control circuitry <b>23</b> determines that in response to receiving subsequent signaling from either one or both of the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> and inhalation sensor <b>30</b> that a second heating element <b>24</b> is to be activated. Accordingly, when the signaling from either one or both of the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> and inhalation sensor <b>30</b> is received by the control circuitry <b>23</b>, the control circuitry <b>23</b> activates the second heating element <b>24</b>. This process is repeated for remaining heating elements <b>24</b>, such that all heating elements <b>24</b> are sequentially activated.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Effectively, this operation means that for each inhalation a different one of the discrete portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is heated and an aerosol generated therefrom.

Hence, this mode may be most effective when each portion of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> of the aerosol generating article <b>4</b> is substantially identical; that is, portions <b>44</b><i>a </i>to <b>44</b><i>f </i>are formed of the same material.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some other implementations, in response to detecting the signaling from either one or both of the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> and inhalation sensor <b>30</b>, the control circuitry <b>23</b> is configured to supply power to one or more of the heating elements <b>24</b> simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In such implementations, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to supply power to selected ones of the heating elements <b>24</b> in response to a predetermined configuration.

In some implementations, the user may also be able to set the power level to be supplied to each heating element <b>24</b> in response to receiving the signaling.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a top-down view of the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> in accordance with such implementations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> schematically shows outer housing <b>21</b> and touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> of aerosol provision device <b>2</b> as described previously. The touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> comprises six regions <b>29</b><i>a </i>to <b>29</b><i>f </i>which correspond to each of the six heating elements <b>24</b>, and a region <b>29</b><i>g </i>which corresponds to the region for indicating that a user wishes to start inhalation or generating aerosol as described previously. The six regions <b>29</b><i>a </i>to <b>29</b><i>f </i>each correspond to touch-sensitive regions which can be touched by a user to control the power delivery to each of the six corresponding heating elements <b>24</b>. In the described implementation, each heating element <b>24</b> can have multiple states, e.g., an off state in which no power is supplied to the heating element <b>24</b>, a low power state in which a first level of power is supplied to the heating element <b>24</b>, and a high power state in which a second level of power is supplied to the heating element <b>24</b> where the second level of power is greater than the first level of power.

For example, the user may repeatedly tap the regions <b>29</b><i>a </i>to <b>29</b><i>f </i>to cycle through the different states (e.g., off, low power, high power, off, etc.). Alternatively, the user may press and hold the region <b>29</b><i>a </i>to <b>29</b><i>f </i>to cycle through the different states, where the duration of the press determines the state.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> may be provided with one or more indicators for each of the respective regions <b>29</b><i>a </i>to <b>29</b><i>f </i>to indicate which state the corresponding heating element <b>24</b> is currently in. For example, the touch-sensitive panel may comprise one or more LEDs or similar illuminating elements, and the intensity of the LEDs signifies the current state of the corresponding heating element <b>24</b>. Alternatively, a colored LED or similar illuminating element may be provided and the color indicates the current state.

Hence, this mode may be most effective when portions of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> of the aerosol generating article <b>4</b> are different from one another. For example, portions <b>44</b><i>a </i>and <b>44</b><i>b </i>are formed of one material, portions <b>44</b><i>c </i>and <b>44</b><i>d </i>are formed of a different material, etc. Accordingly, with this mode of operation, the user may select which portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> to aerosolize at any given moment and thus which combinations of aerosols to be provided with.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In both of the simultaneous and sequential activation modes, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to generate an alert signal which signifies the end of use of the aerosol generating article <b>4</b>, for example when each of the heating elements <b>24</b> has been sequentially activated a predetermined number of times, or when a given heating element <b>24</b> has been activated a predetermined number of times and/or for a given cumulative activation time and/or with a given cumulative activation power. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> includes an end of use indicator <b>31</b> which in this implementation is an LED.

In some implementations, the indicator <b>31</b> may be combined with or otherwise provided by the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> (e.g., if the touch-sensitive panel includes a display element). The aerosol provision device <b>2</b> may prevent subsequent activation of the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> when the alert signal is being output. The alert signal may be switched off, and the control circuitry <b>23</b> reset, when the user replaces the aerosol generating article <b>4</b> and/or switches off the alert signal via a manual means such as a button (not shown).</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In more detail, in implementations where the sequential mode of activation is employed, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to count the number of times signaling from either one or both of the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> and inhalation sensor <b>30</b> is received during a period of usage, and once the count reaches a predetermined number, the aerosol generating article <b>4</b> is determined to have reached the end of its life. For example, for an aerosol generating article <b>4</b> comprising six discrete portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, the predetermined number may be six, twelve, eighteen, etc. depending on the exact implementation at hand.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In implementations where the simultaneous mode of activation is employed, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to count the number of times one or each of the discrete portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is heated. For example, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may count how many times a nicotine containing portion is heated, and when that reaches a predetermined number, determine an end of life of the aerosol generating article <b>4</b>. Alternatively, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to separately count for each discrete portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> when that portion has been heated. Each portion may be attributed with the same or a different predetermined number and when any one of the counts for each of the portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> reaches the predetermined number, the control circuitry <b>23</b> determines an end of life of the aerosol generating article <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In either of the implementations, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may also factor in the length of time the portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> has been heated for and/or the temperature to which the portion of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> has been heated. In this regard, rather than counting discrete activations, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to calculate a cumulative parameter indicative of the heating conditions experienced by each of the portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. The parameter may be a cumulative time, for example, whereby the temperature to which the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is heated is used to adjust the length of time added to the cumulative time. For example, a portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> heated at 200&#xb0; C. for three seconds may contribute three seconds to the cumulative time, whereas a portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> heated at 250&#xb0; C. for three seconds may contribute four and a half seconds to the cumulative time.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The above techniques for determining the end of life of the aerosol generating article <b>4</b> should not be understood as an exhaustive list of ways of determining the end of life of the aerosol generating article <b>4</b>, and in fact any other suitable way may be employed in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The described implementations are arranged so as to heat discrete portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> to generate a suitable aerosol for inhalation. An advantage of these systems is that they offer the ability to heat different portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> at different times during a session of use. For example, in the sequential mode of operation, portion <b>44</b><i>a </i>can be heated at a first time to deliver aerosol and portion <b>44</b><i>b </i>can be heated at a second time to deliver the same or a different aerosol.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">However, because these systems offer flexibility in in terms of which portions of aerosol can be heated for any given inhalation, these systems ideally should be able to begin generating aerosol quickly in response to receiving a user's instruction to start generating aerosol. In part, this will depend upon the rate at which energy can be transferred from the heating element to the portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> to be heated, but also on the properties of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> to be heated such as the mass, density, thickness, and constituents present in the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> to name but a few factors. For example, the thickness of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may be a significant factor in how quickly the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> can be heated and subsequently how long until the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> starts to generate an inhalable aerosol. Generally speaking, the thicker the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, the longer the time until an inhalable aerosol is generated (all other conditions being the same).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In addition, each portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may be designed to deliver a certain quantity of aerosol when heated, for example, if a different discrete portion is heated per puff. In other words, the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may have a certain mass in order to be able to generate a desired amount of aerosol when heated. Assuming a fixed thickness and a fixed density of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, the areal extent of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is taken into account in order to provide the desired mass delivery. Put simply, assuming a fixed thickness and a fixed density, the greater the areal extent of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> (and the greater the areal extent of a corresponding heating element <b>24</b>), the greater the expected mass of aerosol generated from the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The above two factors are suggestive of rather large areal extents of the heating elements <b>24</b> and/or the portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> and relatively thin thicknesses of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> to provide quick aerosol generation times and sufficient quantities of aerosol. However, there is a tendency for aerosol provision systems to be miniaturized/handheld, so that the systems are portable. Devices which have a footprint much beyond the size a of palm of a human hand (e.g., 9 cm by 7 cm) start to become more difficult for a user to hold (particularly in one hand) and also tend to be more cumbersome and inconvenient to use during a session of inhaling aerosol. In the aerosol provision system <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, a plurality of portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> are to be vaporized, e.g., six portions as shown, which means there are practical limitations on how great the areal extent of the portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> can be (which translates, from a device point of view, to limitations on the areal extent of the heating elements <b>24</b>). A balance may be struck between the parameters in order to arrive at a system that delivers sufficient aerosol per portion, quickly, and does not have a large footprint.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The inventors have found that a good compromise exists when a surface of the heating element <b>24</b> that is arranged to increase in temperature during use defines an area (e.g., a superficial surface area) that is no greater than 130 mm<sup>2 </sup>or 145 mm<sup>2</sup>. A heating element <b>24</b> having a surface that defines an area no greater than 130 mm<sup>2 </sup>or 145 mm<sup>2 </sup>leads to a device which is able to aerosolize a plurality of different portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> while still having a relatively small overall footprint. A heating element <b>24</b> having a surface any greater than 130 mm<sup>2 </sup>or 145 mm<sup>2 </sup>and the device footprint tends to increase in size particularly when there are a plurality of heating elements, such as six or more, to an extent which is ergonomically undesirable (especially when considering the presence of outer housing <b>21</b>, power source <b>22</b>, and any thermal insulation (not shown) to prevent the outer housing <b>21</b> reaching unpleasant temperatures).</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some implementations, the surface of the heating element <b>24</b> defines an area that is no less than 10 mm<sup>2</sup>. As mentioned, a number of factors may influence the aerosol that is generated from a portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. If the mass of aerosol to be delivered is considered to be an important quantity, then for a heating element <b>24</b> to have a surface which is less than 10 mm<sup>2 </sup>will require a relatively thicker portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> to be heated to generate the same amount of aerosol. However, as mentioned, a thicker portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> takes longer to heat and generate aerosol, so the aerosol provision system <b>1</b> offers a poor responsiveness. One can adjust the responsiveness by increasing the rate of energy transfer (e.g., by heating the heating element <b>24</b> to a higher temperature), however this increases the chance of charring the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. For example, the operational temperature (that is the temperature at which aerosol is generated from the portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>) may be in the range of between 160&#xb0; C. to 350&#xb0; C. Heating a portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> to above 350&#xb0; C. may significantly increase the chances of charring which can lead to unpleasant tastes in the aerosol that is subsequently generated. Accordingly, having a heating element <b>24</b> with an areal extent of less than 10 mm<sup>2 </sup>is found to lead to poorer aerosol output.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In some implementations, the surface of the heating element <b>24</b> defines an area which is between 30 mm<sup>2 </sup>to 130 mm<sup>2</sup>; that is, equal to or greater than 30 mm<sup>2 </sup>and less than or equal to 130 mm<sup>2</sup>. In other implementations, the surface of the heating element <b>24</b> defines an area which is between 80 mm<sup>2 </sup>to 130 mm<sup>2</sup>, 35 mm<sup>2 </sup>to 80 mm<sup>2</sup>, or between 40 mm<sup>2 </sup>to 75 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The inventors have found that using an aerosol generating material <b>44</b> which is an amorphous solid comprising about 20 wt % alginate gelling agent, about 48 wt % Virginia tobacco extract and about 32 wt % glycerol (DWB), and heated to a temperature of around 290&#xb0; C. using a heating element <b>24</b> having an area of between 40 mm<sup>2 </sup>to 75 mm<sup>2</sup>, should have a thickness in the range of 0.05 mm to 2 mm to be able to generate a sufficient amount of aerosol in a fairly rapid manner.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional, top-down view of the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> showing the arrangement of the heating elements <b>24</b> in more detail in accordance with the present disclosure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, six heating elements <b>24</b> are shown in an array, and each heating element <b>24</b> is depicted as having a circular cross-section. The body of the heating elements <b>24</b> themselves may have any shape as necessitated by the specific design of the heating element <b>24</b> used, and the body of the heating elements <b>24</b> may be provided below the inner surface of the receptacle. However, each heating element <b>24</b> at the very least comprises a surface (in this example a circular surface) which is arranged to increase its temperature, e.g., in response to receiving power from the power source <b>22</b>, and is provided to face into the receptacle <b>25</b>. It should be appreciated that in other implementations, the area defined by the heating element <b>24</b> need not be circular and may have any other desired shape (e.g., rectangular, triangular, hexagonal or square).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The surfaces (e.g., outwardly facing superficial surfaces) of the heating elements <b>24</b> have a diameter d. As discussed previously, each portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is provided to have a substantially similar areal extent as the surface of the corresponding heating elements <b>24</b> such that the heating elements <b>24</b> substantially overlap the corresponding portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. This may avoid the heating elements <b>24</b> heating a region of the aerosol generating article <b>4</b> that does not contain aerosol generating material <b>44</b> (which would otherwise be a waste of energy). Hence the diameter d is substantially the same as the diameter d of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, although it should be appreciated in some implementations the diameters may be different.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In the presently described implementations, the surfaces of each of the heating elements <b>24</b> have substantially the same area.

In the described implementation, each of elements <b>24</b><i>a </i>to <b>24</b><i>f </i>have the same diameter d. In this way, each heating element can be operated in substantially the same way and under the same heating conditions to generate a consistent aerosol from each portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>.

However, in some implementations, the diameter d may be between 7.1 mm and 9.8 mm (corresponding to an area of between around 40 mm<sup>2 </sup>to around 75 mm<sup>2</sup>). Further, it is contemplated that other shapes (e.g., rectangular, triangular, hexagonal or square) and/or sizes of heating element may be used having similar dimensions (diameter, width and/or height) corresponding to areas of up to 145 mm<sup>2 </sup>or up to 170 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the heating elements <b>24</b> are separated from one another in the length direction by a separation distance S<sub>2 </sub>and in the width direction by a separation distance S<sub>1</sub>. The separation distances S<sub>1 </sub>and S<sub>2 </sub>are set such that, when one portion of aerosol generation material <b>44</b> is heated by one heating element (e.g., heating element <b>24</b><i>a </i>and corresponding portion <b>44</b><i>a</i>), the heat from this heating element <b>24</b><i>a </i>does not cause a substantial increase in the temperature of an adjacent portion of aerosol generating material, e.g., portions <b>44</b><i>b </i>and <b>44</b><i>c</i>. In other words, the separation distances S<sub>1 </sub>and S<sub>2 </sub>are arranged such that the adjacent portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> are not inadvertently heated to an extent that the adjacent portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> begin generating aerosol. The separation distances S<sub>1 </sub>and S<sub>2 </sub>may be influenced by the expected operational temperatures that the heating elements <b>24</b> are expected to operate at.

The process is described by Faraday's law of induction and Ohm's law. An induction heater may comprise an electromagnet and a device for passing a varying electrical current, such as an alternating current, through the electromagnet. When the electromagnet and the object to be heated are suitably relatively positioned so that the resultant varying magnetic field produced by the electromagnet penetrates the object, one or more eddy currents are generated inside the object. The object has a resistance to the flow of electrical currents. Therefore, when such eddy currents are generated in the object, their flow against the electrical resistance of the object causes the object to be heated. This process is called Joule, ohmic, or resistive heating.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">A susceptor is material that is heatable by penetration with a varying magnetic field, such as an alternating magnetic field. The heating material may be an electrically-conductive material, so that penetration thereof with a varying magnetic field causes induction heating of the heating material. The heating material may be magnetic material, so that penetration thereof with a varying magnetic field causes magnetic hysteresis heating of the heating material. The heating material may be both electrically-conductive and magnetic, so that the heating material is heatable by both heating mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">Magnetic hysteresis heating is a process in which an object made of a magnetic material is heated by penetrating the object with a varying magnetic field. A magnetic material can be considered to comprise many atomic-scale magnets, or magnetic dipoles. When a magnetic field penetrates such material, the magnetic dipoles align with the magnetic field. Therefore, when a varying magnetic field, such as an alternating magnetic field, for example as produced by an electromagnet, penetrates the magnetic material, the orientation of the magnetic dipoles changes with the varying applied magnetic field. Such magnetic dipole reorientation causes heat to be generated in the magnetic material.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142">When an object is both electrically-conductive and magnetic, penetrating the object with a varying magnetic field can cause both Joule heating and magnetic hysteresis heating in the object.

For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the susceptors <b>224</b><i>b </i>may be provided above the induction work coils <b>224</b><i>a </i>and arranged such that the susceptors <b>224</b><i>b </i>contact the lower surface of the carrier component <b>242</b> (in an analogous way to the aerosol provision system <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0153" num="0151">Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> describes a more concrete implementation where induction heating may be used in an aerosol provision device <b>202</b> to generate aerosol for user inhalation to which the techniques described in the present disclosure may be applied.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0152">Although the above has described a system in which an array of aerosol generating components <b>24</b> (e.g., heating elements <b>24</b>) are provided to energize the discrete portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, in other implementations, the aerosol generating article <b>4</b> and/or an aerosol generating component <b>24</b> may be configured to move relative to one another. That is, there may be fewer aerosol generating components <b>24</b> than discrete portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> provided on the carrier component <b>42</b> of the aerosol generating article <b>4</b>, such that relative movement of the aerosol generating article <b>4</b> and aerosol generating components <b>24</b> is required in order to be able to individually energize each of the discrete portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. For example, a movable heating element <b>24</b> may be provided within the receptacle <b>25</b> such that the heating element <b>24</b> may move relative to the receptacle <b>25</b>. In this way, the movable heating element <b>24</b> can be translated (e.g., in the width and length directions of the carrier component <b>42</b>) such that the heating element <b>24</b> can be aligned with respective ones of the discrete portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. This approach may reduce the number of carrier components <b>42</b> required while still offering a similar user experience.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0153">Although the above has described implementations where discrete, spatially distinct portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> are deposited on a carrier component <b>42</b>, it should be appreciated that in other implementations the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may not be provided in discrete, spatially distinct portions but instead be provided as a continuous sheet of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. In these implementations, certain regions of the sheet of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may be selectively heated to generate aerosol in broadly the same manner as described above. However, regardless of whether or not the portions are spatially distinct, the present disclosure describes heating (or otherwise aerosoling) portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. In particular, a region (corresponding to a portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>) may be defined on the continuous sheet of aerosol generating material based on the dimensions of the heating element <b>24</b> (or more specifically a surface of the heating element <b>24</b> designed to increase in temperature). In this regard, the corresponding area of the heating element <b>24</b> when projected onto the sheet of aerosol generating material may be considered to define a region or portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. In accordance with the present disclosure, each region or portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may have a mass no greater than 20 mg, however the total continuous sheet of aerosol generating material may have a mass which is greater than 20 mg.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0154">Although the above has described implementations where the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> can be configured or operated using the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> mounted on the aerosol provision device <b>2</b>, the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> may instead be configured or controlled remotely. For example, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be provided with a corresponding communication circuitry (e.g., Bluetooth) which enables the control circuitry <b>23</b> to communicate with a remote device such as a smartphone. Accordingly, the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> may, in effect, be implemented using an App or the like running on the smartphone. The smartphone may then transmit user inputs or configurations to the control circuitry <b>23</b>, and the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to operate on the basis of the received inputs or configurations.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0155">Although the above has described implementations in which an aerosol is generated by energizing (e.g., heating) aerosol generating material <b>44</b> which is subsequently inhaled by a user, it should be appreciated in some implementations that the generated aerosol may be passed through or over an aerosol modifying component to modify one or more properties of the aerosol before being inhaled by a user. For example, the aerosol provision device <b>2</b>, <b>202</b> may comprise an air permeable insert (not shown) which is inserted in the airflow path downstream of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> (for example, the insert may be positioned in the outlet <b>28</b>). The insert may include a material which alters any one or more of the flavor, temperature, particle size, nicotine concentration, etc. of the aerosol as it passes through the insert before entering the user's mouth. For example, the insert may include tobacco or treated tobacco. Such systems may be referred to as hybrid systems. The insert may include any suitable aerosol modifying material, which may encompass the aerosol generating materials described above.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0156">Although it has been described above that the heating elements <b>24</b> are arranged to provide heat to a portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> at an operational temperature at which aerosol is generated from the portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, in some implementations, the heating elements <b>24</b> are arranged to pre-heat portions of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> to a pre-heat temperature (which is lower than the operational temperature). At the pre-heat temperature, a lower amount or no aerosol is generated when the portion is heated at the pre-heat temperature. However, a lower amount of energy is required to raise the temperature of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> from the pre-heat temperature to the operational temperature. This may be particularly suitable for relatively thicker portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, e.g., having thicknesses above 400 which require relatively larger amounts of energy to be supplied in order to reach the operational temperature. In such implementations, the energy consumption (e.g., from the power source <b>22</b>) may be comparably higher, however.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0157">Although the above has described implementations in which the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> comprises an end of use indicator <b>31</b>, it should be appreciated that the end of use indicator <b>31</b> may be provided by another device remote from the aerosol provision device <b>2</b>. For example, in some implementations, the control circuitry <b>23</b> of the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> may comprise a communication mechanism which allows data transfer between the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> and a remote device such as a smartphone or smartwatch, for example. In these implementations, when the control circuitry <b>23</b> determines that the aerosol generating article <b>4</b> has reached its end of use, the control circuitry <b>23</b> is configured to transmit a signal to the remote device, and the remote device is configured to generate the alert signal (e.g., using the display of a smartphone). Other remote devices and other mechanisms for generating the alert signal may be used as described above.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0158">In addition, when the portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> are provided on a carrier component <b>42</b>, the portions may, in some implementations, include weakened regions, e.g., through holes or areas of relatively thinner aerosol generating material, in a direction approximately perpendicular to the plane of the carrier component <b>42</b>. This may be the case when the hottest part of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is the area directly contacting the carrier component <b>42</b> (in other words, in scenarios where the heat is applied primarily to the surface of the aerosol generating material that contacts the carrier component <b>42</b>). Accordingly, the through holes may provide channels for the generated aerosol to escape and be released to the environment/the air flow through the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> rather than causing a potential build-up of aerosol between the carrier component <b>42</b> and the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. Such build-up of aerosol can reduce the heating efficiency of the aerosol provision system <b>1</b> as the build-up of aerosol can, in some implementations, cause a lifting of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> from the carrier component <b>42</b> thus decreasing the efficiency of the heat transfer to the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. Each portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may be provided with one of more weakened regions as appropriate.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0159">Thus, there has been described an aerosol provision device <b>2</b> for generating aerosol from an aerosol generating material <b>441</b>. The aerosol provision device <b>2</b> comprises at least one heating element <b>24</b> arranged so as to be adjacent aerosol generating material <b>44</b> when the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is present in the aerosol provision device <b>2</b>, wherein the heating element <b>24</b> has a surface arranged to increase in temperature when supplied with energy, the surface defining an area of no greater than 130 mm<sup>2</sup>, or in some implementations an area of no greater than 145 mm<sup>2</sup>, or in some further implementations an area of no greater than 170 mm<sup>2</sup>. Accordingly, an aerosol provision device <b>2</b> being able to generate sufficient aerosol and being spatially efficient is provided.
