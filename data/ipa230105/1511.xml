The laser beam may be focused to a relatively small spot, resulting in a high power density and small heat-affected zone. Laser welding is therefore an attractive technique when accuracy and a high degree of control is required. Furthermore, laser welding lends itself well to automation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In laser welding, the focused laser beam locates each weld spot or line precisely, while minimizing collateral heating. It is useful to distinguish two main laser welding regimes. Conduction welding occurs at lower laser powers and lower laser power densities. Absorbed laser power heats the irradiated material, thereby melting material in each part to be joined, which flows, mixes, and then solidifies. Keyhole welding occurs at higher laser powers and higher laser power densities that are sufficient to vaporize some of the irradiated material. Pressure of the vaporized material on surrounding melted material opens a channel through the melted material. This channel, known in the art as a keyhole, has a characteristic narrow and deep profile, which allows deep penetration of the laser beam. Finished keyhole welds are generally narrower, deeper, and stronger than conduction welds.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Laser welding has been successfully applied to a wide range of welding problems involving a variety of materials arranged in a variety of configurations. In some instances, laser welding replaces another welding technique. In other instances, laser welding enables welding of structures not suitable for welding by conventional, non-laser welding techniques.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The automotive industry is one of several manufacturing industries that are increasingly adopting laser welding. In the automotive industry, laser welding is currently used to weld many different vehicle parts, such as chassis, body frames, doors, engine parts, and batteries (for electric and hybrid vehicles). With the benefit of a small heat-affected zone and a generally well-controlled and finely tunable process, laser welding may be used to automatically and reliably weld thinner and smaller parts than when using conventional welding techniques. Laser welding has thus helped advance auto manufacturing technology to meet the demands for lighter and more efficient vehicles. For example, laser welding facilitates accurate welding of light-weight body parts, as well as connections within and to electrochemical batteries (e.g., connections between metal foil stacks and battery tabs, and connections between battery tabs and bus bars). In the case of body parts, the welded materials are typically steel, aluminum, and/or aluminum alloys. In the case of batteries, the welded materials often include copper but can also include aluminum or aluminum alloys.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Spot welding is one of numerous welding styles that may be used to laser weld overlapping parts. When spot laser-welding together two overlapping parts, the laser beam is incident on one of the parts and locally melts through this part, all the way to the interface with the second part, and at least some distance into the second part. Spot laser-welding may be applied to stacks of two, three, or more metal parts. Keyhole welding has been shown to form strong spot-weld joints in many scenarios. To form a larger spot weld than can be achieved with a stationary laser beam, the laser beam may be steered to trace a spiral pattern.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Disclosed herein are spiral laser-welding methods configured to spot-weld together a stack of metal parts by tracing spiral-shaped patterns with dual-beam laser radiation. The dual-beam laser radiation is incident on the metal stack from one side and melts through the stack to reach the most-distant metal part. The metal parts may be a stack of two or more metal sheets. Alternatively, the most-distant metal part of the stack, farthest from the side of the stack that receives the laser radiation, may be a thicker, non-sheet-like metal structure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The presently disclosed methods utilize keyhole welding and are specifically tailored to achieve a strong weld joint in certain particularly challenging scenarios. Although keyhole welding is effective at melting and mixing material, the quality of the resulting weld joint can be compromised by issues such as entrapped gas, cooling rate discrepancies, and material loss due to spatter.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Spatter is an undesirable effect in keyhole welding where the convection in the keyhole is sufficiently violent that metal droplets are ejected during the welding process. This ejection of droplets reduces the volume of the weld nugget in a poorly controlled fashion.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Gas in the melt pool potentially imposes several problems. The presence of gas bubbles in the melt pool may cause spatter. When gas remains trapped during the final cooling process, residual stresses caused by the presence of entrapped gas may lead to cracking in the weld joint. If not released before or during cooling, the entrapped gas forms substantially sized voids and/or smaller pores in the resulting weld nugget.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Cooling rate discrepancies are particularly likely to occur when dissimilar materials are welded together. When laser welding parts of identical or similar materials, a true metallurgical bond between the parts may be formed at the weld joint and the material composition of the weld nugget is relatively uniform. When laser welding dissimilar materials, it may not be possible to form metallurgical bonds between the different materials. Instead, the weld may contain a mix of the two materials. When the mix is non-uniform, any substantial cooling-rate discrepancy between the two materials may lead to stress-induced cracking upon cooling of the melt pool.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Cracking, voids, porosity, and material loss may compromise the strength of the weld joint. In addition, in scenarios where the welded structure is intended to carry electrical current, for example in battery applications, the conductivity of the weld joint may be adversely affected by these effects.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the present methods, laser welding is performed by dual-beam laser radiation that includes two beams: a center beam and annular beam surrounding the center beam. The respective powers of the center and annular beams are controlled independently of each other to achieve the desired outcome. This dual-beam laser radiation can maintain a more stable and well-controlled keyhole than a single laser beam. The greater stability of the present keyhole simultaneously (a) minimizes spatter and (b) maximizes the duration of the keyhole being open and thereby capable of facilitating release of entrapped gas. The present methods trace the dual-beam laser radiation along spiral-shaped patterns to reliably create a strong weld joint with minimal entrapped gas and minimal (or no) cracks, even in scenarios involving materials otherwise prone to gas-entrapment and cracking. Also for the purpose of avoiding or at least minimizing cracking, the methods conclude with a controlled laser-power ramp-down while moving toward the center of the spiral pattern.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Benefitting from the above-mentioned process features, the present methods are capable of welding dissimilar metals, metals with entrapped gas, and metals with coatings that evaporate during the welding process. One method is tailored to weld together aluminum parts with entrapped gas and traces the same region with both an outward spiral and an inward spiral, with pulsing of the center beam along a portion of the inward spiral, in order to properly release entrapped gas. The aluminum parts may be of dissimilar compositions. Another method traces an inward spiral and is tailored to weld coated metal parts, such as zinc-coated steel or nickel-coated copper. Conventional laser-welding methods struggle to reliably produce a good weld joint in the presence of such coatings, especially when there is no gap between the parts. The present method reliably achieves a high-quality weld joint even for zero-gap configurations. In fact, the weld-joint quality of the present method is essentially insensitive to the gap size, within the range extending from zero gap up to gaps of, for example, about 0.5 millimeters or possibly more, depending on the thickness of the parts.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one aspect, a laser welding method for joining aluminum includes steps of focusing laser radiation onto a first aluminum sheet disposed on an aluminum part, and controlling the focused laser radiation to trace a plurality of paths on the first aluminum sheet so as to weld the first aluminum sheet to the aluminum part. The laser radiation includes a center beam and an annular beam surrounding the center beam. The controlling step includes tracing an outward spiral path while sustaining respective first powers of the center and annular beams. The outward spiral path starts at a central location and spirals about and away from the central location. The controlling step further includes, after tracing the outward spiral path, tracing an outer path while ramping down powers of the center and annular beams from the respective first powers to respective second powers. The outer path is peripheral to the spiral path as viewed from the central location. In addition, the controlling step includes, after tracing the outer path, tracing an inward spiral path toward the central location while first (a) ramping up the powers of the center and annular beams from the respective second powers to respective third powers, subsequently (b) sustaining the third power of the annular beam and repeatedly pulsing the center beam between its third power and a lower fourth power, and finally (c) turning off the center beam and ramping down the power of the annular beam to zero.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another aspect, a laser welding method for joining a stack of metal parts having a coating at an interface includes focusing laser radiation onto the stack of metal parts, and controlling the focused laser radiation to trace at least one path on a first metal sheet of the stack of metal parts so as to weld together the stack of metal parts whereby also at least partly evaporating the coating at the interface. The metal parts include (i) the first metal sheet, (ii) a most-distant metal part, and (iii) zero, one, or several intervening metal sheets between the first metal sheet and the metal part. At least one of the metal parts has a coating at an interface with a neighboring metal part. The interface is configured with direct contact between the two neighboring metal parts or with a gap therebetween. The laser radiation is incident on the first metal sheet and includes a center beam and an annular beam surrounding the center beam. The controlling step includes tracing an inward spiral path, and, while tracing the inward spiral path, first (a) sustaining respective first powers of the center and annular beams, subsequently (b) simultaneously ramping down power of the center beam from its first power to zero watts and ramping down power of the annular beam from its first power to a non-zero second power, and finally (c) turning off the annular beam.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, schematically illustrate preferred embodiments of the present invention, and together with the general description given above and the detailed description of the preferred embodiments given below, serve to explain principles of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a laser welding apparatus for welding metal parts with dual-beam laser radiation, according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the transverse laser profile of the laser radiation generated by the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as focused on a target, according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart for a method for joining aluminum using spiral laser welding with the dual-beam laser radiation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an exemplary configuration of metal parts as laser welded by the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

Herein, the term metal sheet refers to a metal part with a thickness that is no greater than 10 millimeters, such that focused laser radiation with an average power in the kilowatt range can melt through the thickness. The term metal sheet, as used herein, includes metal foils with thicknesses less than 100 micrometers, as well as metal parts that are not flat. The term metal sheet, as used herein, also refers to local sheet-like portions of metal parts that have one or more other portions that are thicker than 10 millimeters. Thus, the thickness <b>112</b>T of metal sheet <b>112</b> is 10 millimeters or less. While joining of metal parts <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> by welding requires that laser radiation <b>120</b> melts through the thickness <b>112</b>T of metal sheet <b>112</b>, it is not necessary to melt through the thickness <b>114</b>T of metal part <b>114</b>.

Method <b>300</b> may be performed by apparatus <b>100</b> and may be used to weld an aluminum sheet to one or more other aluminum sheets and/or to another aluminum part. Each aluminum sheet/part is made substantially of aluminum or an aluminum alloy. Without departing from the scope hereof, surfaces may exhibit some degree of oxidization and/or contamination prior to welding.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Aluminum is relatively viscous when melted. Since aluminum generally contains some degree of trapped gas and the high viscosity impedes release of such gas, conventional laser welding of aluminum is particularly prone to produce weld nuggets with significant porosity and substantially-sized voids and also prone to spatter. Certain forms of aluminum, such as cast aluminum, tend to contain a relatively large amount of gas. Method <b>300</b> is tailored to optimize release of trapped gas. At least for this reason, method <b>300</b> is capable of forming high-quality, low-porosity weld joints between aluminum parts even when one or more of the parts has high gas content, such as when one or more of the parts is a cast aluminum part. For example, method <b>300</b> may be used to weld one or more extruded aluminum sheets to a cast aluminum part. In general, method <b>300</b> facilitates controlled release of entrapped gas and minimizes stress, thereby minimizing spatter and porosity, as well as the risk of cracks forming during cooling.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Method <b>300</b> includes steps <b>310</b> and <b>320</b>. Step <b>310</b> focuses laser radiation <b>120</b> onto a first aluminum sheet that is disposed on another aluminum part, optionally with one or more other, intervening aluminum sheets disposed therebetween. Step <b>320</b> controls laser radiation <b>120</b>, as focused, to trace a plurality of paths on the first aluminum sheet and thereby weld the first aluminum sheet to the aluminum part (and the intervening aluminum sheets, if present).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Before proceeding to discuss the details of steps <b>310</b> and <b>320</b>, we address different configurations of aluminum parts that may be welded by method <b>300</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b></figref> illustrate example configurations of metal parts, to which method <b>300</b> may be applied, as well as example weld nuggets formed by method <b>300</b>. Within the context of method <b>300</b>, each of the metal parts shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b></figref> is an aluminum part.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a configuration <b>400</b>, wherein metal sheet <b>112</b> is disposed on metal part <b>114</b> with no other, intervening metal sheets therebetween, and wherein metal melting caused by the performance of method <b>300</b> extends only partway into metal part <b>114</b>. Metal sheet <b>112</b> may be in direct contact with metal part <b>114</b> along an interface <b>414</b>F therebetween. Without departing from the scope hereof, small gaps may exist in places along interface <b>414</b>F, for example due to positioning tolerances or non-flatness of surfaces. Metal part <b>114</b> has a surface <b>414</b>S on the side of metal part <b>114</b> that is opposite interface <b>414</b>F. Metal sheet <b>112</b> and metal part <b>114</b>, as arranged in configuration <b>400</b>, have a combined thickness <b>410</b>T between surfaces <b>112</b>S and <b>414</b>S. In scenarios where metal sheet <b>112</b> and/or metal part <b>114</b> are non-planar, thickness <b>410</b>T is a local thickness measured in the region where laser radiation <b>120</b> is incident on metal sheet <b>112</b> during welding.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">When applying method <b>300</b> to configuration <b>400</b>, method <b>300</b> directs laser radiation <b>120</b> onto surface <b>112</b>S of metal sheet <b>112</b> to melt through metal sheet <b>112</b>, across interface <b>414</b>F, and into metal part <b>114</b>, but not all the way through metal part <b>114</b> to surface <b>414</b>S. Method <b>300</b> thereby forms a weld nugget <b>450</b> that starts at surface <b>112</b>S and terminates within an interior portion of metal part <b>114</b>, such that the depth <b>450</b>D of weld nugget <b>450</b> is less than thickness <b>410</b>T. Weld nugget <b>450</b> has a width <b>450</b>W that may exceed depth <b>450</b>D. For example, width <b>450</b>W may be in the range between one and five times depth <b>450</b>D. Since method <b>300</b>, in configuration <b>400</b>, does not seek to melt all the way through metal part <b>114</b> to surface <b>414</b>S, thickness <b>414</b>T of metal part <b>114</b> may substantially exceed thickness <b>112</b>T of metal sheet <b>112</b>, as long as the corresponding heat sink provided by metal part <b>114</b> does not prevent laser radiation <b>120</b> from melting across interface <b>414</b>F. In one example of configuration <b>400</b>, thickness <b>112</b>T is in the range between one and five millimeters, thickness <b>114</b>T is in the range between two and thirty millimeters, width <b>450</b>W is between three and fifteen millimeters, and depth <b>450</b>D extends into metal part <b>114</b> by at least one millimeter. Alternatively, depth <b>450</b>D may extend into metal part <b>114</b> by less than one millimeter, for example when metal part <b>114</b> is relatively thin and it is preferred that surface <b>414</b>S does not show signs of the welding process. Weld nugget <b>450</b> will typically be widest at or near surface <b>112</b>S, such that width <b>450</b>W is attained thereabout and the width of weld nugget <b>450</b> at interface <b>414</b>F is somewhat smaller.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a configuration <b>500</b> that is similar to configuration <b>400</b> except that metal melting, and the associated weld nugget <b>550</b>, generated by the performance of method <b>300</b> extend all the way through metal part <b>114</b> to surface <b>414</b>S. In configuration <b>500</b>, metal part <b>114</b> may be a metal sheet with a thickness <b>114</b>T that is similar to thickness <b>112</b>T. The width <b>550</b>W of weld nugget <b>550</b> may exceed thickness <b>410</b>T. However, since only the perimeter of weld nugget <b>550</b> is supported by solid portions of metal sheet <b>112</b> and metal part <b>114</b> during laser welding, it may be preferable to limit width <b>550</b>W to less than approximately three times thickness <b>410</b>T. If width <b>550</b>W is allowed to exceed this limit, laser radiation <b>120</b> may blow out substantial amounts of melted metal. Such blow-out may compromise the size and strength of weld nugget <b>550</b>, and in a worst case even form an aperture extending through metal sheet <b>112</b> and metal part <b>114</b>. In one example of configuration <b>500</b>, each of thicknesses <b>112</b>T and <b>114</b>T is in the range between one and three millimeters, and width <b>550</b>W is less than three times the resulting value of thickness <b>410</b>T.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a configuration <b>600</b> that is similar to configuration <b>400</b> except for including an intervening metal sheet <b>616</b> between metal sheet <b>112</b> and metal part <b>114</b>. Metal sheet <b>616</b> has a thickness <b>616</b>T that is similar to thickness <b>112</b>T. Metal sheets <b>112</b> and <b>616</b> meet at an interface <b>616</b>F, and metal sheet <b>616</b> and metal part <b>114</b> meet at an interface <b>614</b>F. Each of interfaces <b>616</b>F and <b>614</b>F has properties similar to interface <b>414</b>F. When method <b>300</b> is applied to configuration <b>600</b>, laser radiation <b>120</b> melts through metal sheet <b>112</b>, across interface <b>616</b>F, through metal sheet <b>616</b>, across interface <b>614</b>F, and into metal part <b>114</b>, but not all the way to surface <b>414</b>S.

In one example of configuration <b>600</b>, each of thicknesses <b>112</b>T and <b>616</b>T is in the range between one and three millimeters, thickness <b>414</b>T is in the range between two and thirty millimeters, and width <b>650</b>W is between three and fifteen millimeters.

Outward spiral path <b>810</b> starts at a central location L<sub>C </sub>at a time t<sub>1</sub>, and spirals about and away from central location L<sub>C </sub>to reach an outer location L<sub>O </sub>at a time t<sub>2</sub>. In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, spiral path <b>810</b> resembles an Archimedean spiral, such that successive revolutions about central location L<sub>C </sub>are approximately equidistant and characterized by a separation distance <b>812</b>. Separation distance <b>812</b> may be determined by diameter <b>212</b>A of annular beam <b>122</b>A and, for example, be at least as large as diameter <b>212</b>A but no greater than twice diameter <b>212</b>A. Without departing from the scope hereof, spiral path <b>810</b> may take on a different shape than the Archimedean spiral.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">While tracing outward spiral path <b>810</b>, step <b>324</b> sustains a power P<sub>C1 </sub>of center beam <b>122</b>C and a power P<sub>A1 </sub>of annular beam <b>122</b>A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). P<sub>A1 </sub>may be higher than P<sub>C1</sub>. These powers of center beam <b>122</b>C and annular beam <b>122</b>A are set to be sufficient to maintain a local melt pool with a keyhole extending from the surface of the aluminum sheet on which laser radiation <b>120</b> is incident (e.g., surface <b>112</b>S of metal sheet <b>112</b>), through any intervening aluminum sheets if present (e.g., metal sheet <b>616</b>), and into or through the aluminum part most distant from the aluminum sheet on which laser radiation <b>120</b> is incident (e.g., metal part <b>114</b>). The keyhole and surrounding melt pool move with laser radiation <b>120</b> along outward spiral path <b>810</b> during step <b>324</b>. The keyhole is localized to the region where laser radiation <b>120</b> is incident. The melt pool will generally have a tail behind laser radiation <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Conventionally, keyhole welding is performed by a single laser beam, typically with an approximately Gaussian or flat-top transverse intensity distribution. The power density of this single laser beam is set sufficiently high to form a keyhole. However, the convection mechanics of the keyhole are often so violent that significant spatter is unavoidable and the keyhole opens and closes unpredictably. Method <b>300</b>, on the other hand, benefits from the presence of an annular beam to (a) control the temperature gradients imposed in the metal and (b) reduce the power-density requirements to the center beam. When tracing outward spiral path <b>810</b> with laser radiation <b>120</b>, a portion <b>824</b>L of annular beam <b>122</b>A leads center beam <b>122</b>C, and another portion <b>824</b>T of annular beam <b>122</b>A trails center beam <b>122</b>C. Leading portion <b>824</b>L pre-heats the material, such that the keyhole is established and maintained with relative ease. The heating provided by trailing portion <b>824</b>T serves to more gently lower the temperature of the material behind the keyhole to reduce temperature gradients trailing the keyhole and minimize stress in the cooled material. Method <b>300</b> thereby achieves a stable keyhole with very little or no material lost through spatter and with minimal stress. The improved keyhole stability achieved by method <b>300</b> helps release gas entrapped in the aluminum, since entrapped gas can escape via the keyhole only when the keyhole is open.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">We have found that step <b>324</b> alone is insufficient to achieve a satisfactory weld joint between the aluminum parts when one or more of the parts contain substantial amounts of trapped gas. If step <b>324</b> is not accompanied by additional welding, gas remains entrapped in the melted material, typically resulting in the final weld nugget having substantially sized voids as well as related stress-induced cracks. Similarly, we have found step <b>324</b> alone to be insufficient for welding together aluminum parts of dissimilar compositions. Here, the single pass along outward spiral path <b>810</b> does not provide sufficient mixing, and the weld nugget therefore tends to crack upon cooling. Therefore, method <b>300</b> further includes step <b>328</b>. Step <b>328</b> traces an inward spiral path <b>830</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>, back toward central location L<sub>C</sub>. However, since the tracing of outward spiral path <b>810</b> in step <b>324</b> leaves the material at an elevated temperature, the material would get too hot if step <b>328</b> was initiated immediately upon concluding step <b>324</b> and with the same power levels. Spatter would likely be unavoidable. To prevent such overheating, step <b>328</b> (a) starts at reduced power levels and (b) is separated from step <b>324</b> by step <b>326</b> that irradiates an area that is peripheral to the spiral paths of steps <b>324</b> and <b>328</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Step <b>326</b> traces an outer path <b>820</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, between times t<sub>2 </sub>and t<sub>3</sub>.

The geometrical properties of inward spiral path <b>830</b> may be similar to those of outward spiral path <b>810</b>. Inward spiral path <b>830</b> starts where outer path <b>820</b> ends. Thus, inward spiral path <b>830</b> starts either at outer location L<sub>O </sub>(as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>) or at termination point L<sub>T</sub>. The process of tracing inward spiral path <b>830</b> takes place in three segments: (1) a first segment from outer location L<sub>O </sub>(or termination point L<sub>T</sub>) at time t<sub>3 </sub>to a location L<sub>P </sub>at time t<sub>4</sub>, (2) a second segment from location L<sub>P </sub>at time t<sub>4 </sub>to a location L<sub>R </sub>at time t<sub>5</sub>, and (3) a third segment from location L<sub>R </sub>at time t<sub>5 </sub>to central location L<sub>C </sub>at time t<sub>6</sub>. While tracing the first segment, step <b>328</b> ramps up the power of center beam <b>122</b>C and annular beam <b>122</b>A from P<sub>C2 </sub>and P<sub>A2</sub>, respectively, to powers P<sub>C3 </sub>and P<sub>A3</sub>, respectively (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>).

However, other relationships may be advantageous in some scenarios. Next, while tracing the second segment, step <b>328</b> (a) sustains power P<sub>A3 </sub>of annular beam <b>122</b>A and (b) repeatedly pulses center beam <b>122</b>C between P<sub>C3 </sub>and a lower power P<sub>C4 </sub>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). P<sub>C4 </sub>may be an off-power, i.e., zero watts. The pulsing rate of center beam <b>122</b>C may be in the range between 0.5 and 5 kilohertz. Finally, while tracing the third segment, step <b>328</b> reduces the powers of center beam <b>122</b>C and annular beam <b>122</b>A.

When P<sub>C4 </sub>is non-zero, step <b>328</b> may turn off center beam <b>122</b>C by (a) switching its power to zero watts, for example upon initiating the third segment, or (b) ramping down its power to zero watts during the tracing of the third segment. Without departing from the scope hereof, step <b>328</b> may conclude with a non-zero power in annular beam <b>122</b>A, for example 20% or less than P<sub>A3</sub>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The pulsing of center beam <b>122</b>C during the second segment of inward spiral path <b>830</b> has proved effective for releasing gas trapped in the melted material after the tracing of outward spiral path <b>810</b> in step <b>324</b>. The ramp-down of annular beam <b>122</b>A, as opposed to an abrupt turn-off, serves to slow cooling of the material to release stress and prevent cracking of the weld nugget. We have found that ramping down the power while laser radiation <b>120</b> is stationary tends to produce a hole or divot in the weld nugget. Therefore, step <b>328</b> performs the final ramp-down of laser radiation <b>120</b> while moving along inward spiral path <b>830</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Step <b>320</b> may further include a step <b>322</b> that precedes step <b>324</b>.

The energy deposited by laser radiation <b>120</b> in step <b>322</b> helps form the melt pool and establish the keyhole. Embodiments that omit step <b>322</b> initially turn on laser radiation <b>120</b> in step <b>324</b> with powers P<sub>C1 </sub>and P<sub>A1 </sub>of center beam <b>122</b>C and annular beam <b>122</b>A, respectively.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one embodiment, the duration of step <b>324</b> is between 150 and 300 milliseconds, the duration of step <b>326</b> is between 25 and 100 milliseconds, the duration of step <b>328</b> is between 150 and 300 milliseconds, and the duration of step <b>322</b> (if included) is between 25 and 100 milliseconds. Method <b>300</b> may be completed in less than one second. In certain implementations, each of P<sub>C0</sub>, P<sub>A0</sub>, P<sub>C1</sub>, P<sub>A1</sub>, P<sub>C3</sub>, and P<sub>A3 </sub>exceeds a kilowatt of average power.

The power levels may be tuned according to the thicknesses of the involved aluminum parts and based upon whether the resulting weld nugget should penetrate the most-distant aluminum part or rather terminate at an interior location thereof.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Method <b>300</b> may include providing a shield gas to the weld zone to further help prevent pores in the top layer of the weld nugget (e.g., nearest surface <b>112</b>S), to prevent plasma formation, and minimize exposure to ambient oxygen. The shield gas is, for example, argon or nitrogen.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Paths <b>810</b>, <b>820</b>, and <b>830</b> connect to form a single continuous path. Step <b>320</b> may trace each of paths <b>810</b>, <b>820</b>, and <b>830</b> in clockwise or counter-clockwise directions. The direction does not need to be the same for each path. For example, inward spiral path <b>830</b> may be identical to outward spiral path <b>810</b>, but traced in reverse and in the inward rather than outward direction. The area traced by the combination of paths <b>810</b>, <b>820</b>, and <b>830</b> may have a general extent, e.g., a diameter <b>870</b>D as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>, in the range between 3 and 15 millimeters. IG. <b>9</b> is a flowchart for one method <b>900</b> for joining metal parts that include a coating at an interface therebetween. Method <b>900</b> may be performed by apparatus <b>100</b>. Method <b>900</b> may be used to weld zinc-coated steel or nickel-coated copper.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The presence of a coating at the interface between metal parts to be welded presents a challenge when the coating evaporates at the temperatures lower than the temperatures required to melt the metal parts themselves. For example, the melting temperature of steel is typically around 1370 degrees Celsius, whereas the evaporation temperature of zinc is only 907 degrees Celsius. In the absence of an efficient gas escape route, the gas produced by evaporation of the coating causes significant spatter during keyhole welding. In conventional keyhole laser welding of such coated metal parts, the metal parts are separated from each other by a gap that is large enough to provide an alternative escape route for the gas. Method <b>900</b> does not require such a gap. Instead, method <b>900</b> is tailored to allow gas, produced by coating evaporation, to escape efficiently via the keyhole with minimal (or no) spatter. Method <b>900</b> is therefore capable of minimizing spatter and thus achieving a high-quality weld joint when the metal parts are in direct contact with each other. We have found that method <b>900</b> also minimizes spatter and achieves a high-quality weld joint when the parts are separated from each other by some amount of gap. In the case of zinc-coated steel, we have found that the weld-joint quality is insensitive to the existence of a gap as long as the gap is relatively small. Even without modifying any process parameters according to the gap size, the same weld-joint quality is achieved for small gaps and no gap. Since the keyhole tends to force molten metal from the top sheet (closer to the incoming laser radiation) onto the sheet or part below, the thickness of the top sheet is the primary factor defining the maximum gap size to which the weld-joint quality is insensitive. In certain scenarios, the weld-joint quality is insensitive to the gap size, as long as the gap is in the range between zero (no gap) and about 60% of the thickness of the top sheet.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Method <b>900</b> includes steps <b>910</b> and <b>920</b>. Step <b>910</b> focuses laser radiation <b>120</b> onto a stack of metal parts. The stack of metal parts consists of a first metal sheet disposed on a metal part, optionally with one or more intervening metal sheets disposed therebetween. The metal part may or may not be a metal sheet. Step <b>920</b> controls laser radiation <b>120</b>, as focused, to trace at least one path on the first metal sheet so as to weld the first metal sheet to the metal part (and the intervening metal sheet(s), if present).
