id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With increasing miniaturization of semiconductor devices, it is increasingly difficult to fabricate a high density interconnection structure because of the need for an extremely fine metal wire (which means a small grain size, an excessive barrier layer thickness and a resulting large resistance) and extremely small line spacing (which means misalignment, and difficulty in filling a contact hole). In addition, it is difficult to align a metal wire with a via hole, which may cause a short or open failure in an Integrated Circuit (IC) and thus increase manufacturing cost of the IC.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of this, an object of the present disclosure is, at least in part, to provide a metallization stack and a method of manufacturing the same, and an electronic device including the metallization stack.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a metallization stack is provided, and the metallization stack includes at least one interconnection line layer and at least one via hole layer arranged alternately on a substrate.

It should be understood, however, that these descriptions are merely exemplary and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure. In addition, in the following description, descriptions of well-known structures and technologies are omitted to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the concepts of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Various schematic structural diagrams according to the embodiments of the present disclosure are shown in the accompanying drawings. The figures are not drawn to scale. Some details are enlarged and some details may be omitted for clarity of presentation. The shapes of the various regions and layers as well as the relative size and positional relationship thereof shown in the figures are only exemplary. In practice, there may be deviations due to manufacturing tolerances or technical limitations, and those skilled in the art may additionally design regions/layers with different shapes, sizes and relative positions according to actual needs.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the context of the present disclosure, when a layer/element is referred to as being located &#x201c;on&#x201d; another layer/element, the layer/element may be located directly on the another layer/element, or there may be an intermediate layer/element between them. In addition, if a layer/element is located &#x201c;on&#x201d; another layer/element in one orientation, the layer/element may be located &#x201c;under&#x201d; the another layer/element when the orientation is reversed.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method of manufacturing a metallization stack. Different from existing techniques in which an interlayer dielectric layer is formed first, then a trench or hole is formed in the interlayer dielectric layer, and the trench or hole is filled with a conductive material to form an interconnection line or via hole, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a metal pattern may be formed first on a lower layer (e.g., a substrate on which a device is formed or a next layer in the metallization stack), and then a dielectric material is filled into a gap of the metal pattern to form the interlayer dielectric layer. The metal pattern may be formed by photolithography. Accordingly, a line width and a spacing of the interconnection line and a critical dimension (CD) and a spacing of the via hole may be determined by a line width or CD and a spacing of photolithography, such that the line width or CD and the spacing may be reduced, and thus an integration density may be increased. In addition, a difficult problem of metal filling in an existing process is avoided. Further, since a filling process is not used, a metal material such as ruthenium (Ru), molybdenum (Mo), rhodium (Rh), platinum (Pt), iridium (Jr), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), or chromium (Cr) may be used, and thus a diffusion barrier layer may not be necessary.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, in the existing process, a trench or hole formed by etching has a shape tapered from top to down, and then an interconnection line or a via hole formed therein has a corresponding shape. In contrast, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the interconnection line or via hole may be directly obtained by photolithography, and thus may have a shape tapered from bottom to top.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a pair of an interconnection line layer and a via hole layer adjacent to each other may be formed together. For example, a first metal layer used for the interconnection line layer and a second metal layer used for the via hole layer may be formed on the lower layer. The first metal layer and the second metal layer may be formed sequentially over an entire region where the metallization stack needs to be formed, e.g. over substantially an entire surface of the lower layer. The first metal layer and the second metal layer may be patterned, for example, into an interconnect pattern by photolithography, where the interconnect pattern may correspond to or be a layout of the interconnection line in the interconnection line layer. The second metal layer with the interconnect pattern may be patterned into a separate portion to form the via hole. In addition, the interconnection line may be formed by the first metal layer (possibly cut off at some regions) with the interconnect pattern. Thus, the interconnection line and the via hole thereon may be self-aligned to each other.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A spacer layer may be disposed between the first metal layer and the second metal layer. For example, the spacer layer may serve as an etch stop layer (to optimize a manufacturing process, especially an etching process therein) and/or a diffusion barrier layer (which improves an interconnection performance). The spacer layer may be patterned into an interconnect pattern together with the first metal layer and the second metal layer.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The metallization stack may include a plurality of the interconnection line layers and via hole layers, wherein at least part or even all of the interconnection line layers and via hole layers may be manufactured in this way.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the interconnect pattern may include a series of metal wires. These metal wires may have the same pattern as the layout of the interconnection line in the interconnection line layer. That is, the metal layer may be patterned according to the layout of the interconnection line. Alternatively, the interconnect pattern may have a pattern in which the metal wires extend according to the layout of the interconnection line, and the metal wires corresponding to separate interconnection lines arranged opposite to each other may extend continuously. In this case, it is advantageous to form the metal wires extending in the same direction for patterning. This layout may realize various interconnect routes by cooperating with metal wires extending in another direction that intersects (e.g., is orthogonal to) the direction in another interconnection line layer. For example, in the metallization stack, an interconnection line layer in which the interconnection line extends in a first direction and an interconnection line layer in which the interconnection line extends in a second direction orthogonal to the first direction may be alternately arranged in a vertical direction. After the second metal layer is patterned into the via hole, the metal wires formed by the first metal layer may be cut at a predetermined region according to the layout of the interconnection line so as to achieve separation between different interconnection lines.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the above manufacturing process, a dielectric material may be filled, between the metal wires after the metal wires are formed, and in a space due to the removal of the second metal layer after the via hole is patterned, so as to form an interlayer dielectric layer. Since the gap between the metal wires or the above space is small, an air gap or void may be formed in the filled dielectric material. The air gap or void may help to reduce capacitance. The position of the air gap or void may be adjusted by a deposition-etch-deposition method, as described below. In addition, the dielectric material for each filling may be the same or different.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the above method, the metallization stack according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may be obtained. As described above, at least part of the interconnection line and the via hole thereon may be obtained by the first metal layer and the second metal layer, respectively, through a same photolithography process (and then subjected to further cutting processes to form the interconnection line and the via hole, respectively), and thus they may be self-aligned with each other, such that a sidewall of the via hole may not exceed a sidewall of the interconnection line below. For example, a sidewall of the at least part of the interconnection line in a longitudinal extension direction is substantially coplanar with at least a lower portion of a corresponding sidewall of the via hole.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present disclosure may be presented in various forms, some examples of which will be described below. In the following description, a selection of various materials is involved. In the selection of materials, in addition to a function of the material (for example, a semiconductor material may be used to form the active region, a dielectric material may be used to form an electrical isolation, and a conductive material may be used to form the interconnection line and the via hole), the etching selectivity is also considered. In the following description, a required etching selectivity may or may not be indicated. It should be clear to those skilled in the art that when etching a material layer is mentioned below, if it is not mentioned or shown that other layers are also etched, then the etching may be selective, and the material layer may have an etching selectivity relative to other layers exposed to the same etching formula.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>16</b></figref> schematically show some stages in a process of manufacturing a metallization stack according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a substrate <b>1001</b> is provided.

According to an embodiment, the first metal layer <b>1015</b> and the second metal layer <b>1115</b> may have a certain etching selectivity with respect to each other, e.g., the first metal layer <b>1015</b> and the second metal layer <b>1115</b> may include different materials. In an example, the first metal layer <b>1015</b> is a Ru layer and the second metal layer <b>1115</b> is a Mo layer. The first metal layer <b>1015</b> may have a thickness, for example, in a range of about 5 nm to 100 nm, for the first interconnection line layer; the second metal layer <b>1115</b> may have a thickness, for example, in a range of about 5 nm to 100 nm, for the first via hole layer.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a Ru source may be purified by the following methods to obtain a high purity Ru metal. A gas stream including ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) may be introduced into one or more reaction chambers to contact the Ru source, thereby forming ruthenium tetroxide (RuO<sub>4</sub>) that is gaseous under the reaction condition. The ruthenium tetroxide, as well as unreacted ozone and remainder of the gas stream, may be fed to a collection chamber where the ruthenium tetroxide that is gaseous may be reduced to a ruthenium dioxide (RuO<sub>2</sub>) layer on a semiconductor substrate. A deposited ruthenium dioxide may then be reduced, for example, with hydrogen, to produce a high purity Ru metal. In addition, ozone may be used as an etching gas to etch and pattern a deposited Ru metal layer.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, the first metal layer <b>1015</b> and the second metal layer <b>1115</b> may be patterned into a series of metal wires. Patterning may be performed by a photolithography process, for example, partition wall pattern transfer photolithography or Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) photolithography, or the like. In photolithography, a Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) may be used, and the RIE may stop on the interlayer dielectric layer <b>1011</b> (or a contact portion <b>1013</b> therein) below the first metal layer <b>1015</b>. A spacing between the metal wires may define a spacing between the interconnection lines in the first interconnection line layer, for example, between about 5 nm and 150 nm. In addition, in order to avoid excessive fluctuation in a density of patterns in the same layer between different regions, a dummy metal wire may be formed such that the metal wires are arranged at substantially uniform intervals, for example. A line width of the metal wire may define a line width of the interconnection line in the first interconnection line layer, for example, between about 5 nm and 100 nm. In addition, at least part of the metal wires may contact and be electrically connected to the contact portion <b>1013</b> below.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In this example, the formed metal wire extends substantially in parallel in a first direction (horizontal direction on a paper surface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>), and may be matched with a metal wire formed later that extends in a second direction that intersects (e.g., is perpendicular to) the first direction so as to achieve various interconnection routes. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto. For example, different metal wires may extend in different directions, and the same metal wire may extend zigzag.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, an another interlayer dielectric layer may be formed on the interlayer dielectric layer <b>1011</b> to fill a gap between the metal wires <b>1015</b> and <b>1115</b>.

An etching of the metal wire <b>1015</b> may be stopped at the interlayer dielectric layer <b>1011</b> below to cut the metal wire <b>1015</b>.

Metal materials of the third metal layer <b>1025</b> and the fourth metal layer <b>1125</b> may be the same as or different from those of the first metal layer <b>1015</b> and the second metal layer <b>1115</b>.

Similarly, the third metal layer <b>1025</b> may have a thickness, for example, in a range of about 5 nm to 100 nm, for the second interconnection line layer; the fourth metal layer <b>1125</b> may have a thickness, for example, in a range of about 5 nm to 100 nm, for the second via hole layer.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Then, as described above in combination with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>3</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, the third metal layer <b>1025</b> and the fourth metal layer <b>1125</b> may be patterned into a series of metal wires. In this example, instead of patterning the third metal layer <b>1025</b> and the fourth metal layer <b>1125</b> into metal wires that extend continuously, the third metal layer <b>1025</b> and the fourth metal layer <b>1125</b> may be patterned directly according to a pattern of the second interconnection line layer. Thus, the third metal layer <b>1025</b> and the fourth metal layer <b>1125</b> may be patterned into a series of metal line segments. That is, the metal wire cutting process described above in combination with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>10</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref> is combined to be performed together with a metal layer patterning, such that a separate cutting photolithography process is not required. In addition, due to this patterning, the metal line segment may not be limited to a straight line segment, but may include a zigzag line segment.

In this example, since the metal line segments have the pattern of the second interconnection line layer, a density of the metal line segments in some regions may be low, or a gap between the metal line segments may be large.
