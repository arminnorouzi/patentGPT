More particularly, the present disclosure relates to smart trailers. Specifically, the present disclosure relates to a towing device and associated components provided on a trailer for applying torque and regenerative braking to at least one wheel on the trailer during towing operations.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Historically, a trailer, other towed vehicles, or the like, are forwardly and rearwardly controlled by a vehicle, such an automobile or truck, during a towing operation. The vehicle, generally, initiates the movement of the trailer when the vehicle and the trailer are at rest. During such initiation of movement, the vehicle experiences a significant reduction in both performance and fuel economy (i.e., the range per load of fuel) when towing a loaded trailer. For example, the performance of the vehicle may be hindered and/or negatively affected when the trailer is being pulled up an incline (e.g., a hill) by the vehicle during a short period of towing to a prolonged period of towing. As such, the movement of the trailer is completely controlled by the efforts of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, the speed of the trailer is generally reduced by the braking force caused by the vehicle. In other words, the braking system provided on the vehicle must reduce speed to both the vehicle and the trailer. While some trailers include braking systems, such braking systems only provide collective braking to all wheels on the trailer simultaneously. Such collective braking on the trailer could cause the trailer to sway and/or &#x201c;fishtail&#x201d; where the vehicle may lose control over the trailer.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The current trailers fail to provide solutions to avoid loss in performance, control, safety, and fuel economy in the vehicle while pulling a trailer. As such, continuous unmet needs have been presented for providing a trailer while avoiding loss in performance, control, safety, and fuel economy in the vehicle while pulling a trailer. The embodiments described and illustrated herein have provided solutions to the continuous unmet needs for providing a trailer while avoiding loss in performance, control, safety, and fuel economy in the vehicle while pulling a trailer.

This exemplary embodiment or another exemplary embodiment may further provide that the at least one switch further comprises a third switch provided on the actuator and operably connected to the at least one motor/generator and the vehicle, wherein the third switch sends a third signal to the controller via a braking force applied by the vehicle, wherein torque is prevented to the at least one wheel on the trailer via the at least one motors/generators. This exemplary embodiment or another exemplary embodiment may further provide that the at least one switch is provided proximate to the first end of the housing and is disposed inside of a first vertical chamber this is in fluid communication with the central chamber; and wherein the second switch is provided proximate to the second end of the housing inside of a second vertical chamber and is in fluid communication with the central chamber. This exemplary embodiment or another exemplary embodiment may further provide a biaser operably connected to the piston rod, the biaser is operable for biasing the piston such that the piston fails to apply any pressurized cavities inside the central chamber of the housing when the actuator is free of any force exerted by the vehicle. This exemplary embodiment or another exemplary embodiment may further provide a set of sensors provided on the towing device and operably connected to the controller for correcting the yaw of the trailer, wherein the set of laser sensors is directed towards the rear corners of the vehicle for preventing yaw of longitudinal and transverse axes defined by the trailer measured relative to the rear corners of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect, an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may provide a method of controlling a trailer via a towing device. The method comprises the steps of applying a first force, via a vehicle towing the trailer, to a piston rod of an actuator of the towing device; actuating a piston of the actuator, via the piston rod, to a first end of the actuator of the towing device; pressurizing a central chamber and a first vertical chamber defined by the actuator of the towing device, wherein at least one switch is disposed inside of the first vertical chamber; sending a first signal, via the at least one switch, to at least one motor/generator based on the pressure being applied to the at least one switch; and applying a first variable torque, via the at least one motor/generator, to at least one wheel operably connected to the trailer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This exemplary embodiment or another exemplary embodiment may further provide the step of sending the first signal, via the at least one switch, to a controller based on the pressure being applied to the first switch.

In other words, the second switch <b>104</b> will not impede the transfer of power between the controller <b>103</b> and the motors/generators <b>140</b> during a towing process.

Such forward acceleration allows the trailer <b>10</b> to provide a supplemental force to the vehicle <b>1</b> in which the trailer <b>10</b> is moving itself in conjunction with the forward movement provided by the vehicle <b>1</b>. As such, the forward acceleration of the trailer <b>10</b> via the first and second motors/generators <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B helps prevent the lack of performance and fuel mileage of the vehicle <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">During the accelerating stage, the first switch <b>104</b>A may supply a variable amount of power to the controller <b>103</b> that is dependent upon the amount of pulling force exerted by the vehicle <b>1</b> onto the coupler <b>16</b> of the trailer <b>10</b> and the piston rod <b>128</b> of the actuator <b>102</b>.

As such, the third switch <b>104</b>C electrically interfaces with both the vehicle <b>1</b> and the trailer <b>10</b> during a towing operation. In the illustrated embodiment, the third switch <b>104</b>C is independent of the actuator <b>102</b> such that the third switch <b>104</b>C does not interact with the pressurized states caused by the actuator <b>102</b> during the accelerating and braking stages. When the towing device <b>100</b> is placed in the braking stage, the third switch <b>104</b>C recognizes that a braking force is being applied by the vehicle <b>1</b> via the braking lights on the vehicle <b>1</b>.

In other words, controller <b>103</b> will correct a potential yaw of the trailer <b>10</b> if the set of sensors <b>160</b> detects that the rear corners of the vehicle <b>1</b> are at different distances relative to the trailer <b>10</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, the controller <b>103</b> may correct a potential yaw by applying forward torque to the one of the first and second motors/generators <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B to align the trailer <b>10</b> to the vehicle <b>1</b> until the rear corners of the vehicle <b>1</b> are at substantially equal distance as measured by the set of sensor <b>160</b>.

In these stages, the trailer <b>10</b> and the vehicle <b>1</b> are stopped on an uphill incline (i.e. a hill) where the trailer <b>10</b> may fall backwards and away from the vehicle <b>1</b> once the vehicle <b>1</b> is at a complete stop. To prevent against using extended electrical energy in this uphill incline stage to maintain the position of the trailer <b>10</b>, the towing device <b>100</b> may include two modes in which the towing device <b>100</b> and its associated components may maintain the position of the trailer <b>10</b> without using large amounts of electrical energy from the energy storage device <b>150</b>. The first mode of the towing device <b>100</b> may be utilized when the trailer <b>10</b> and the vehicle <b>1</b> are stopped for a short period of time (e.g., waiting for a traffic light on an incline). In this mode, the driver of the vehicle <b>1</b> is applying a braking force on vehicle <b>1</b>, which is detected by the towing device <b>100</b> via the third switch <b>104</b>C. In this mode, the first, second, and third switches <b>104</b>A, <b>104</b>B, <b>104</b>C remain in the open electrical stage where no torque is being applied to the wheels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, via the first and second motors/generators <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B, until the brakes of the vehicle <b>1</b> are released by the driver. The second mode of the towing device <b>100</b> may be utilized when the vehicle <b>1</b> and the trailer <b>10</b> are parked in a prolonged uphill lie stage. In this mode, the controller <b>103</b> will apply a timer for a predetermined time when the controller <b>103</b> reads no movement in the actuator <b>102</b>, via the first, second, and third switches <b>104</b>A, <b>104</b>B, <b>104</b>C, or no movement of the wheels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, via the first and second motors/generators <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B.

The towing device <b>100</b> may be &#x201c;woken up&#x201d; and turned on once the mechanical brakes <b>22</b> are applied on the vehicle <b>1</b>, as detected by the third switch <b>104</b>C, or movement is detected in the actuator <b>102</b> and/or the wheels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The towing device <b>100</b> may also include a breakaway safety line (not illustrated) that is operably attached from the actuator <b>102</b> to the vehicle <b>1</b>. During separation of the trailer <b>10</b> from the vehicle <b>1</b>, the breakaway safety line manually actuates the mechanical brakes <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B on the trailer <b>10</b> to stop the forward motion of the trailer <b>10</b>. As such, the breakaway safety line is substantially similar to a breakaway safety line used on legacy surge braking actuators for stopping a separated trailer. The breakaway safety line of the towing device <b>100</b> may also electrically open each of the first and second switches <b>104</b>A, <b>104</b>B to provide regenerative braking to the trailer <b>10</b> if the trailer <b>10</b> is separated from the vehicle <b>1</b> during a towing operation.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">While the controller <b>103</b> may control the first and second motors/generators <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B via the inputs provided by the first, second, and third switches <b>104</b>A, <b>104</b>B, and <b>104</b>C, a towing device may omit a controller and solely rely upon at least one motor/generator to control and/or operate a trailer based on inputs from either first, second, or third switches. In one exemplary embodiment, a first switch of a towing device may be operably connected to at least one motor/generator on a trailer where the at least one motor/generator may provide forward torque and/or acceleration to at least one wheel on the trailer based on pressure inputs from the first switch. In another exemplary embodiment, a second switch of a towing device may be operably connected to at least one motor/generator on a trailer where the at least one motor/generator may provide regenerative braking and/or a reverse torque to at least one wheel on the trailer based on pressure inputs from the second switch. In another exemplary embodiment, first and second switches of a towing device may be operably connected to at least one motor/generator on a trailer where the at least one motor/generator may provide torque to first and second wheels on the trailer based on pressure inputs from the first and second switches.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The towing device <b>100</b> may also be controlled via a software application through a computer or a smartphone device. The software application will be operably connected to the towing device <b>100</b>, specifically to the first switch <b>104</b>A through the controller <b>103</b>, for allowing the trailer <b>10</b> to move independently of the vehicle <b>1</b> via the first and second motors/generators <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B. As such, the towing device <b>100</b> may be controlled by a user to move the trailer <b>10</b> forwards and/or backwards when disconnected from the vehicle <b>1</b> depending on a user's input through the software application. In addition, the software application may control the towing device <b>100</b> to apply variable torque between the first and second motors/generators <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B for turning the trailer <b>10</b> depending on the user's input through the software application. As such, the software application allows a user to move the trailer <b>10</b> around corners or to pivot the trailer <b>10</b> about itself without being operably connected to the vehicle <b>1</b>. In other words, the movement of the wheels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B may be powered asynchronously such that the first and second motors/generators <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B may apply different amounts of torque and different rotations of torque onto the wheels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B at different time intervals when the trailer <b>10</b> is turning around a corner or is pivoting about itself.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, the software application may include multiple modes and/or methods for controlling the trailer <b>10</b> in certain situations. In one exemplary embodiment, the software application implemented into the towing device <b>100</b> may include a &#x201c;slow speed&#x201d; mode and/or method that is able to detect forward speeds that are less than three miles per hour via the first and second motors/generators <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B. In this mode, the controller <b>103</b> will able to apply variable torque to each of the wheels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B asynchronously, via the first and second motors/generators <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B, depending on the forward and reverse speeds of the wheels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B. As such, the controller <b>103</b> may apply greater torque to either of the first and second wheels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B based on the size of the turning radius determined by the set of sensors <b>160</b> on the towing controller <b>100</b>. Such variable and asynchronous torque applied to the first and second wheels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B prevents against &#x201c;pushing&#x201d; of the trailer <b>10</b> along a straight line that is tangential to the anticipated turning radius. This mode also helps reduce potential tire wear on the wheels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B on the trailer <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In another exemplary embodiment, the software application implemented into the towing device <b>100</b> may include a &#x201c;reverse&#x201d; mode when moving the trailer <b>10</b> backwards up an incline or over soft and/or uneven terrain. In this mode, the controller <b>103</b> would apply a suitable amount of torque to the wheels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, via the first and second motors/generators <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B, that would bypass the braking force between the actuator <b>102</b> and the mechanical brakes <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B. In this mode, the second switch <b>104</b>B would act substantially similar to the first switch <b>104</b>A by applying variable power to the controller <b>103</b> to variably apply torque to the first and second wheels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B. In addition, the third switch <b>104</b>C is disabled during this mode due to the driver &#x201c;riding&#x201d; the brakes of the vehicle <b>1</b> during a reverse maneuver of the trailer <b>10</b>. Moreover, the set of laser sensors <b>160</b> may detect the direction of the trailer <b>10</b>, via the laser beams &#x201c;L<sub>1</sub>&#x201d; through &#x201c;L<sub>5</sub>&#x201d;, so that the controller <b>103</b> may apply variable torque to the first and second wheels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B to keep the trailer <b>10</b> aligned with the vehicle <b>1</b>. Once the driver of the vehicle <b>1</b> ceases the reverse maneuvering and initiates forward movement, the &#x201c;reverse&#x201d; mode is automatically canceled.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The software application may also be able to operably control a dolly wheel (not illustrated) that may be a part of the trailer <b>10</b>.
