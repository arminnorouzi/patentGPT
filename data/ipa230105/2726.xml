Numerous factors varying from aging, chemotherapy, radiation exposure, virus infection and inflammation contribute to thymus involution, a phenomenon manifested as loss of thymus cellularity, increased stromal fibrosis and diminished na&#xef;ve T-cell output. Impaired immune surveillance consequent to thymic dysfunction leads to diseases ranging from autoimmunity to immunodeficiency and malignancy. There is need to restore or improve impaired immune functions due to thymus defects.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One of the major hurdles in translating experimental findings from animal models, such as mouse models, into clinical applicable therapies is the existence of species-specific differences between the mouse and human. Humanized mice, in which human immune cells are engrafted and populated in the immune deficient mice, provide a powerful tool to study the development and responses of human immune system in vivo. One of the major obstacles of recapitulating the human immune system in mice is the defective development of human T cells, due to the limitation of mouse thymic microenvironments in supporting human T cell development and selection. While co-transplantation of fetal liver and thymus in the human bone marrow-liver-thymus (BLT) mouse model can support robust T cell development, the frequent incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) result in short life spans of the hosts, rendering them prohibitory to be used for long-term studies. Potential ethical issues, as well as the lack of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) selection in fetal tissues, further limit the use of the BLT mice in modeling human immune responses under various pharmacological, physiological and pathological conditions.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This document addresses the needs mentioned above in a number of aspects.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the document provides a method for making a bioengineered thymus organoid. The method comprises obtaining a cell population comprising human thymic epithelial progenitor cells (TEPCs) or human thymic epithelial cells (TECs) or both; combining the cell population with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in a defined ratio to form a combination; seeding the combination into an extracellular matrix of a de-cellularized thymus scaffold to generate a thymus construct, and culturing the thymus construct under conditions permitting cellular attachment onto the extracellular matrix thereby making the bioengineered thymus organoid. The TEPCs, the TECs, or the HSCs can be derived from a donor human individual. The HSCs may comprise human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. The de-cellularized thymus scaffold can be from a human subject or a non-human donor animal. As mentioned below, various suitable animals can be used as the donor animal. Preferred examples include non-human mammals. The ratio of the TEPCs or TECs to the HSCs can range from 100:1 to 1:100, such as about 10:1 to 1:10, or about 1:10, 1:1, 2:1, or 5:1.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the cell population can be obtained by a process comprising encapsulating human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in a suspension medium that separates the hPSCs into single cells; culturing the hPSCs in a growth medium to increase the number thereof or to obtain progeny cells thereof without differentiation; differentiating the hPSCs or progeny cells to generate TEPCs or TECs in an encapsulation medium, and freeing the TEPCs or TECs from the encapsulation medium. Examples of the hPSCs can include human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) or human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some examples, the thymus construct can be placed into a flow cell in vitro with a continuous feed of a medium or nutrients and human cells to produce human immune cells. The thymus construct may comprise immune cells, such as B-cells and T-cells. The B-cells may be specific to a particular antigen or may produce antigen-specific antibodies. In one embodiment, the T cells may be transduced with a viral vector encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). For instance, the viral vector can be added to the flow cell to transduce the T cells. The thymus construct can be used for evaluating a drug candidate. In that case, the thymus construct can contacted with a drug candidate to test the impact of the drug candidate on immune cell development.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some other examples, the thymus construct can be surgically transplanted to a host animal. The host animal can be a preconditioned humanized immune-deficient animal, such as a preconditioned humanized immune-deficient pig, rat or mouse. The thymus construct may be placed in various suitable locations in the host animal, and preferably, at an anatomic site with rich blood vessel network, such as under the kidney capsule, in the thoracic area in the neck, or in the axillary region. The resulting host animal can be provided HSCs and produces human immune cells. For example, the host animal can be a non-human animal (e.g., a mouse, such as those developed by ABGENIX or MEDAREX) engineered to express human VDJ antibody sequences. Such an animal can produce increased quantities of fully human Immunoglobulin G and antibodies. The resulting host animal can also be used for evaluating a drug candidate. In that case, the host animal can be administered with a drug candidate to test the impact of the drug candidate on immune cell development. For instance, the TEPCs, the TECs, or the HSCs can be from a donor individual to test the impact of the drug candidate on the donor individual. The host animal can also be transplanted with cells or a tissue from the donor individual. Examples of the cells or the tissue may include cancer cells. In that case, the effect of the drug candidate on the cells or tissue from the donor individual can be evaluated.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the methods described above, the donor animal or the host animal can be a vertebrate including a non-mammal, such as bird, amphibian, reptile, fish (e.g., zebra fish) or other jawed vertebrates, or a non-human mammal. Examples of the non-human mammal include one selected from the group consisting of cow, pig, camel, llama, horse, goat, rabbit, sheep, hamsters, guinea pig, cat, dog, rat, mouse, and a non-human primate.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a second aspect, the document provides a bioengineered thymus organoid, comprising (i) human TEPCs (hTEPCs), human TECs (hTECs), or human HSCs (hHSCs) and (ii) a thymus scaffold that has been de-cellularized and comprises an extracellular matrix, wherein the hTEPCS, hTECs, or hHSCs attach to the extracellular matrix. Examples of the bioengineered thymus organoid includes a bioengineered thymus organoid prepared according to the methods described above. The bioengineered thymus organoid may comprise immune cells. The thymus scaffold can be heterologous or allogeneic to the hTEPCs, hTECs, or hHSCs. 29. In some examples, the hTEPCs or hTECs may be derived from hPSCs. The bioengineered thymus organoid can be in vitro or in vivo. Accordingly, within the scope of this document is a non-human animal comprising the bioengineered thymus organoid describe above. The non-human animal may be a mammal selected from the group consisting of cow, pig, camel, llama, horse, goat, rabbit, sheep, hamsters, guinea pig, cat, dog, rat, mouse, and a non-human primate.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further aspect, the document provides a method for evaluating of a drug candidate. The method comprises (a) contacting a drug candidate with the bioengineered thymus organoid described above and (b) detecting the impact of the drug candidate on development of cells that are in the bioengineered thymus organoid or emigrate therefrom. The method can be carried out in vitro or in vivo in a host animal. In one example, the bioengineered thymus organoid may be implanted in a host animal and the drug candidate is administered to the host animal.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">For evaluating of a drug candidate as described herein, the drug candidate can be one selected from the group consisting of a small molecule, a nucleic acid, a peptide, a polypeptide, an antibody, and an antibody fragment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In yet another aspect, the document provides a method of preparing thymic emigrant cells. The method includes (a) introducing progenitor cells into the bioengineered thymus organoid described above or the non-human animal described above, (b) maintaining the bioengineered thymus organoid or the non-human animal under conditions permitting differentiation of the progenitor cells to generate progeny cells thereof; (c) egressing the progeny cells from the bioengineered thymus organoid to generate thymic emigrant cells, and (d) isolating the thymic emigrant cells. Accordingly, within the scope of this document are thymic emigrant cells prepared according to the method. The thymic emigrant cells may comprise one or more transgenes encoding an antigen receptor, such as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The thymic emigrant cells can be included in a pharmaceutical composition comprising the thymic emigrant cells and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The thymic emigrant cells or the pharmaceutical composition can be used in a method for improving the immune function of a subject in need thereof. Accordingly, this document provides a method for improving the immune function of the subject. The method includes (a) administering to the subject an effective amount of the thymic emigrant cells, or (b) transplanting to the subject the bioengineered thymus organoid described above. In some examples, the subject may have a condition selected from the group consisting of cancer, autoimmune disorder, and infection.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, and <b>1</b>B</figref> are diagrams showing differentiation of human iPSCs into TEPCs in 3-D alginate hydrogel capsule. a.

The thymus organoids and animal models (such as mouse models) have various commercial and clinical uses, including generating humanized antibodies, making antigen-specific human T cells, inducing transplantation tolerance, rejuvenating thymus functions, and modeling human diseases.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The thymus gland is the primary lymphoid organ responsible for the development of T-cells. It is organized into two morphologically and functionally distinct compartments, the cortex and the medulla, which house two distinctive populations of thymic epithelial cells (TECs): the cortical TECs (cTECs) and the medullary TECs (mTECs), respectively. Other populations of thymic stromal cells (TSCs) include thymic fibroblasts, endothelial cells, as well as macrophages and dendritic cells of hematopoietic origin. Together, this network of TSCs provides both homing signals for the immigration of common lymphocyte progenitors (CLPs) originated from the bone marrow (BM), and trophic factors necessary for the differentiation and maturation of thymocytes and T-lymphopoiesis.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">T-lymphopoiesis is a well-coordinated process that involves continuous crosstalk between the developing thymocytes and the TECs. Early stages of T cell development (e.g. lineage specification, proliferation, TCR gene recombination, and positive selection) take place in the cortical region and are mediated mainly by cTECs. The resulting CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) cells express TCRs that can interact with the self-peptide presenting MHC (pMHC). Subsequently, DP cells are negatively selected in the medullary region, where cells expressing TCRs with high affinities to self-antigens are induced to undergo apoptosis by mTECs and APCs of hematopoietic origin, and differentiate into CD4+CD8&#x2212; or CD4&#x2212;CD8+ single-positive (SP) cells, before being released into circulation to be part of the diverse, but self-tolerant T-cell repertoire in the periphery.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The 3D organization of the thymic stroma is important for its function. Manipulation of the thymic stromal compartment, either in vitro or ex vivo, proves to be challenging. The bottleneck is mainly attributed to the unique architecture of the thymic stroma that is important for the survival and function of TECs. Unlike epithelial cells of other visceral organs typically forming in a 2D sheet-like structure, TECs are organized in a sponge-like, 3D network. TECs in 2D culture start to express markers of terminally differentiated, senescent epithelial cells, or even transdifferentiate into skin cells. Expression of key genes for the specification and proliferation of TECs (e.g. FoxN1, DLL-4, CLL-22 and Tbata) are also shown to be dependent on the 3D organization of the thymic stroma.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Thymus Organoids and Preparation Methods</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The document provides a bioengineered thymus organoid and a method of making the thymus organoid in vitro. An organoid is an in vitro, three-dimensional, miniature version of an organ. Thymus organoids produced by the method can mimic the physiology and function of a human thymus. A thymus organoid described herein may comprise, among others, thymic cells (e.g., TEPCs) derived from a human donor source and a scaffold derived from a different donor or a non-human animal. The thymus organoid can further comprise other cells (e.g., progenitor cells) from a human source, which can differentiate within the thymus organoid in vitro or in vivo in a host animal to produce cells useful for various purposes.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">TEPCs</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A thymus organoid described herein comprises, among others, thymic cells (e.g., TEPCs) derived from a human source. Various methods can be used to make the TEPCs. In certain embodiments, the method may comprise differentiating pluripotent stem cells into TEPCs in vitro. In this regard, the method may comprise culturing the pluripotent stem cells for a time and under conditions sufficient to differentiate the pluripotent stem cells into TEPCs. For example, the method may comprise culturing the pluripotent stem cells in different stages in the presence of members of the TGF&#x3b2; superfamily (e.g., activin A), or a combination of Wnt family member 3A (Wnt3A), bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Various pluripotent stem cells may be used to generate TEPCs. In general, such pluripotent stem cells have the capacity to give rise to any of the three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. Pluripotent stem cells may comprise, for example, stem cells, e.g., embryonic stem cells, nuclear transfer derived embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, etc. The pluripotent stem cells, e.g., iPSCs, may express any one or more of a variety of pluripotency-associated genes or markers. Pluripotency-associated genes or markers may include, but are not limited to, Oct-3/4, Sox2, Nanog, GDF3, REX1, FGF4, ESG1, DPPA2, DPPA4, hTERT, SSEA1, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, TRA-2-49/6E, and Nanog.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A number of protocols can be used for differentiating pluripotent stem cells (e.g., ESCs and iPSCs) into TEPCs. Although stem cell-derived TEPCs express markers of the thymic epithelium, further maturation in vivo (e.g., engraftment underneath the kidney capsules of athymic nude mice) can be used to gain the T-lymphopoiesis function. See, e.g., Parent, A. V. et al. Generation of functional thymic epithelium from human embryonic stem cells that supports host T cell development. <i>Cell stem cell </i>13, 219-229, doi:10.1016/j.stem.2013.04.004 (2013), Sun, X. et al. Directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into thymic epithelial progenitor-like cells reconstitutes the thymic microenvironment in vivo. <i>Cell stem cell </i>13, 230-236, doi:10.1016/j.stem.2013.06.014 (2013), and Chhatta, A. R. et al. De novo generation of a functional human thymus from induced pluripotent stem cells. <i>J Allergy Clin Immunol </i>144, 1416-1419 e1417, doi:10.1016/j.jaci.2019.05.042 (2019). Yet, none of the previously generated hPSC-TEPCs have shown the ability to induce the differentiation of human HSCs into T cell lineages in vitro. Notably, traditional 2-D culture conditions were used in all these methods.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The method described in this document may comprise differentiating pluripotent stem cells in a 3D culture where the cells may further differentiate into TEPCs and/or TECs, including cTECs and mTECs. These cell types can be assessed using one, two, or more corresponding markers, including EpCAM1, CK5, CK8, CK17, CK18, OCT4, SOX17, SOX2, HOXA3, EYA1, PAX9, FOXN1, PRASS16, ACKR4, CD205, &#x3b2;5T, AIRE, and CSN2. As disclosed herein, the 3D culture may be more effective for facilitating thymus organoid development as compared to 2D culture, e.g., 2D culture of thymic stromal cells in monolayer cultures. Suitable 3D culture systems may include any 3D culture system, such as suspension in alginate capsule, hanging drop plates, and ultra-low attachment multiwell plates.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The 3-D configuration of TECs in the thymic microenvironment is important to maintain their thymic epithelial gene signature. For example, the expression of Tbata, a key transcription regulator to maintain TEC size and proliferation, drops drastically in 2-D TEC culture. Moreover, TEC progenitors isolated from mouse embryos display markers of skin keratinocytes in 2-D adherent culture. In contrast, TECs cultured as aggregates in biocompatible hydrogel can maintain their molecular properties and prolong their survival for up to 7 days in vitro. The data from this document show that the alginate hydrogel capsules used in the study might provide critical 3-D matrix support for the survival of iPSC-derived TEPCs.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, in comparison to 2-D TEPCs, the expression of cTEC-specific genes (e.g. PRSS16, ACKR4, CD205, and &#x3b2;5t) that are initially transcribed in the thymus glands of late stage embryos and/or neonates, was increased significantly in 3-D iPSC-derived TEPCs. Similar increase was detected in the expression of epithelial markers (e.g. CK-5, CK-8, CK-17 and CK-18). These findings suggest that 3-D TEPCs represented later stages of developing TECs than those of 2-D cultures. Exposure of 3-D iPSC-derived TEPCs to the ECM microenvironment of decellularized thymus scaffolds promoted further maturation of TECs in vitro, as suggested by the significant increase of expression of genes associated with antigen presentation (e.g. MHC II and CD74). Indeed, human thymus organoids constructed with 3-D iPSC-derived TECs successfully supported the differentiation of human CD34+HSCs into both DP and SP T cells in vitro, highlighting their thymopoiesis function. Accordingly, in an embodiment, the thymus organoid produced by the method may comprise high expression levels of one, two, more, or all of the above makers, in particular, CK-5, CK-8, CK-17, CK-18, EYA1, PAX9, FOXN1, PRASS16, ACKR4, CD205, &#x3b2;5T, AIRE, and CSN2.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Thymus Scaffold</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As mentioned above, the unique architecture and microenvironment of the thymic stroma is important for the survival and function of TECs. The thymus organoid disclosed herein may contain a thymus scaffold, comprising an extracellular matrix from thymus, which provides the microenvironment for recolonization of TECs and related thymus function such as T-lymphopoiesis.

One example uses a detergent-perfusion based method that allows the clearance of the cellular compartment of almost any organ of any scale, while retaining its ECM components largely intact. Shown below is an example protocol to remove all the cells in the thymus gland, while retaining its 3D ECM structure. In this protocol, de-cellularization is achieved with several rounds of freeze/thaw cycles to induce intracellular ice crystal formation, in conjunction with detergent treatment for cell lysis. The example protocol includes:</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">(1) Thymus glands are harvested from 3-24 weeks old mice, and placed in a Styrofoam box and frozen for 25 min at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">(2) Frozen thymic samples are later thawed in 30&#xb0; C. water bath for 30 min.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">(3) Steps (1) and (2) are repeated 1-2 times.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">(4) Thymic samples are transferred to 12-well plates with 2 mL of 0.5% SDS solution and placed on a plate on a shaker at room temperature.

The molecular signature of thymus stroma is largely maintained in the thymus organoid, as demonstrated by RT-PCR analysis of TEC-specific genes.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The thymic organoid described herein has one or more of a variety of advantages. For example, human iPSC-derived thymic organoids produced by the method can produce thymic emigrant cells, such as cells of the T-cell lineage, which are useful for treating or preventing a condition in a mammal, e.g., cancer. Additionally, the method may provide an organoid that can mimic the positive selection processing that takes place in the thymus. The positive selection process refers to the ability of newly formed thymocytes to recognize and interact with MHC (major histocompatibility complex). During positive selection in the human thymus, only thymocytes that can bind to MHC will survive, migrate into the medulla, and differentiate into mature T cells.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the thymic organoid allows one to produce thymic epithelial cells in a 3D organization in a way resembling the human thymus.

For example, the document discloses methods of generating immune cells, such as T and NKT cells, for rare blood types for blood banking and the treatment of conditions or deficiencies, e.g., anemias and other cytopenias.

If needed, other cells can be injected into the thymus organoid. Examples may include, for example, mesenchymal stem cells or any other cell that commonly exists in the thymus and is not directly produced from TEPCs, such as endothelial cells and dendritic cells, among others. Shown below is an example protocol for culturing of human thymus organoids in fluidic chips (flow cells) to support human T cell generation in vitro:</p><p id="p-0064" num="0075">(1) Microfluidic chips used in these studies are designed based on the generic Aline chip design, and manufactured by ALINE, Inc.

The acrylic top layer includes 4 straight barbs designed for the influx and efflux of media.

Isolating the thymic emigrant cells from the thymus organoid may be carried out in any suitable manner. For example, the method may comprise gently removing the egressing cells by removing the media from the culture of the thymus organoid.

Such animals can be used as model system to study human physiology and diseases. The animals can also be used to produce therapeutic cells for human uses.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0084">While animal models have contributed significantly to understanding of human physiology and diseases, one of the major hurdles in translating these findings into clinic is the existence of species-specific differences between humans and animals. Humanized mice, in which human cells of hematopoietic lineage are transplanted into NOD.scid.IL2rg<sup>null </sup>(NSG) or other immunodeficient IL2rg<sup>null </sup>mouse lines, are powerful models that are used broadly to overcome these challenges. Hematopoietic humanized mice not only can support the long-term survival of the engrafted human cells, but also functionally recapitulate human immune responses to great extents, permitting their use as preclinical models for study of various human pathological conditions, such as infectious diseases, cancer, and autoimmunity. A comparison with other humanize mouse models of human hematopoietic cells illustrates their differences and demonstrates the benefits of the methods and models provided herein.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0085">Based on the type of human hematopoietic cells used and the route of engraftment, current humanized mice can be generally grouped into three types. The first type generated is the hu.PBL model, in which human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are intravenously (i.v.) injected in NSG mice. While engraftment of both lymphoid and myeloid cells can be readily established, hu.PBL mice develop lethal, xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease (xGVHD) within weeks due to the presence of host cell-reactive human T cells. The development of xGVHD limits the experimental time window to less than 3-4 weeks, and can complicate the interpretation of experimental findings profoundly. To overcome these defects, the hu.SRC (scid-repopulating cell) model was developed, in which recipient mice are infused with CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. Human cells of most of the hematopoietic lineages are effectively generated in these mice, with the exception of T cells. Because of the species-related differences (e.g. growth factors and cytokines) between mouse and human, the endogenous murine thymus in hu.SRC mice cannot fully support the development of functional human T cells. To achieve robust human T cell development, the hu.BLT (or BLT for bone marrow, liver and thymus) model was developed, in which pieces of human fetal thymus and liver are co-transplanted underneath the kidney capsules of immunodeficient IL2rg<sup>null </sup>recipients, together with i.v. infusion of CD34+HSCs from the same fetal donor. However, like the hu.PBL model, high incidences of xGVHD are observed in hu.BLT mice, making them unfit for long-term studies. Ethical issues regarding the use of human fetal tissue further limit their wide application in preclinical studies. Hence, the field is in dire need of novel murine models that can support the development of self-tolerant yet functional human T cells to mediate long-term adaptive immune responses.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0086">The thymus gland does not contain HSCs capable of self-renewal, instead relying on the recruitment of common lymphocyte progenitors (CLPs) from the bone marrow to maintain long-term thymopoiesis. Once inside the thymus, CLPs undergo a series of differentiation events, such as lineage specification and positive and negative selection, to become mature T cells. Thymic epithelial cells, the predominant population of cells in the thymus stroma, play important regulatory roles throughout thymopoiesis. TECs within the cortical region (cTECs) provide key signals for T cell fate specification and positively select T cells that can functionally interact with antigen present cells (APCs). TECs within the medullary region (mTECs), on the other hand, possess the unique characteristic of expressing and presenting tissue specific self-antigens (TSAs). These mTECs are critical for eliminating T cells with high auto-reactivity in the thymus, and thus maintaining immunologic self-tolerance.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0087">Functional thymus organoids can be constructed by repopulating decellularized thymus scaffolds with isolated murine TECs.

The three-dimensional network of extracellular matrix in the decellularized thymus scaffolds can maintain the long-term survival and function of the TECs both in vitro and in vivo. When transplanted under the kidney capsule of athymic nude mice, tissue-engineered murine thymus organoids can support the generation of a diverse and functional T cell repertoire in the recipient mice (Fan, Y. et al. Bioengineering Thymus Organoids to Restore Thymic Function and Induce Donor-Specific Immune Tolerance to Allografts. <i>Mol Ther </i>23, 1262-1277, doi:10.1038/mt.2015.77 (2015)). Thus, thymus organoids bioengineered with isolated TECs could offer complete physiologic thymic functions. However, ethical concerns and shortage of human thymus donor tissues prohibit the wide use of isolated human TECs for reconstituting the thymus function in humanized mice.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0088">In one embodiment, this document discloses an approach to circumvent these empirical and ethical challenges through the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSCs are stem cells reprogrammed from somatic cells by transiently overexpressing the Yamanaka factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc). See Takahashi, K. &#x26; Yamanaka, S.

Similar to pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs), iPSCs can be induced to differentiate into specific cell types (e.g. pancreatic islet beta cells, liver cells, neuronal cells, cardiomyocytes, etc.), and have been widely used in regenerative medicine research. TECs derived from human iPSCs can serve as a renewable source of cells for the generation of functional thymus organoids. Significant progress has been made in deriving TECs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs, both embryonic and induced).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0089">When transplanted in athymic nude mice, hPSC-derived TEPCs undergo further maturation to support the development of polyclonal mouse T cells. Similar approaches were used to differentiate human iPSCs into TEPCs.

For instance, as shown in the examples below, human iPSCs embedded in 3-D hydrogel capsules were subjected to an optimized multistep differentiation protocol to generate human TEPC aggregates. Human thymus organoids were constructed by repopulating decellularized murine thymus scaffolds with a combination of iPSC-TEPC aggregates and CD34+HSCs. When engrafted in hematopoietic humanized mice (designated as hu.Thor), iPSC-derived human thymus organoids support the generation of a diverse population of T cells that can mount robust alloreactive responses and effectively reject allogeneic teratomas. Sera of hu.Thor mice contain subsets of IgG, suggesting the occurrence of T cell-dependent immunoglobulin class switching in B cells. In addition, antigen (Ag)-specific IgGs against diphtheria toxoid are generated upon vaccination. Taken together, these data suggest that iPSC-derived thymus organoids can support the development of a functional human T cell compartment in hu.

Accordingly, the humanized mouse model can be used to model conditions and discords that are characterized with severe defects in thymic function and related life-threatening immunodeficient conditions, such as primary DiGeorge syndrome and acquired immunodeficient disorders (AIDS).</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Personalized Medicine</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0093">The thymus organoid or animal model described in this document can be used for personalized medicine. More specifically, the thymus organoid or animal model can be used as an immune model for a specific patient with a particular disorder in testing how the patient may respond to certain therapy or drug for treating the disorder. In that case, cells from the patent can be used to generate a thymus organoid in the manner disclosed herein, and the thymus organoid can be further implanted in a suitable animal. Both the thymus organoid and the animal can then be used to assess the therapy or drug. In one example, when the disorder is a tumor, a sample or cells from the patient's tumor can be implanted in the animal model in vivo or co-cultured with the thymus organoid in vitro. The growth of the tumor cells in the animal or in the culture can be examined. Increased cell death, lack of growth, or described size of the implanted or cultured tumor sample as compared to a proper control indicates that the therapy or drug is suitable for treating the patient.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0094">Humanized mouse model that has recently gained a lot of traction in cancer research is the personalized xenogenic humanized mice, in which immunocompromised mice are engrafted with PBMCs and tumor cells from the same patient. This is a powerful tool for drug testing, but as other hu.PBMC models, they will develop xenogenic graft-vs-host disease), which will limit the window of time for experiments. The humanized mouse model described in this document does not have these issues and therefore addresses the need for a more suitable model.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Drug Evaluation and Discovery</heading><p id="p-0084" num="0095">The thymus organoid or non-human animal described above can be used in evaluating or determining whether a test compound or candidate compound (e.g., a drug candidate) can be used for treating a condition or a disorder. Alternatively, the thymus organoid or non-human animal can be used for determining a prognosis of a disorder or condition in a subject.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0096">The evaluation methods described herein are useful to identify agents that can modulate (either promote or suppress) a disease or disorder. For example, the evaluation methods can be used to identify whether a subject has a risk of developing a disease or disorder associated with compromised immune function (e.g., inflammation, cancer, autoimmune disorder, or infection) in response to an agent. The assays can also be used to determine whether a subject is suitable to be administered with an agent (e.g., an agonist, antagonist, peptidomimetic, protein, peptide, nucleic acid, small molecule, or other drug candidate) to treat such a disorder. Information obtained from practice of the above assays is useful in prognostication, identifying progression of, and clinical management of diseases and other deleterious conditions affecting an individual's health status. In preferred embodiments, the diagnostic assays provide information useful in prognostication, identifying progression of and management of conditions that are characterized by inflammation, cancer, autoimmune disorder, or infection. The information more specifically assists a clinician in designing treatment regimes to treat or prevent such conditions.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0097">A test compound can be evaluated by incubating the thymus organoid in a test medium containing the test compound for a period of time; and determining an effect on cells in the thymus organoid or cells emigrate from the thymus organoid. A test compound can also be administered to the non-human animal. After a period of time, the animal or its cells can be examined for effects by the test compound. To that end, one can examine effects of the compound or composition on the thymus organoid in the animal, on cells in the thymus organoid, or on cells emigrate from the thymus organoid.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0098">In one embodiment, the method may include examining activation of T cells in or from the thymus organoid. T cell activation can be determined during and/or following co-culturing of the compound and the thymus organoid. Suitable assays for T cell activation include DNA replication assays (e.g., <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine incorporation), extracellular and/or cytokine production assays (e.g., ELISA, flow cytometry, and the like), and T cell activation marker assays (e.g., flow cytometry).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0099">In some example, T cell activation can be measured by extracellular or intracellular cytokine production, such as, IFN&#x3b3; and/or IL-2 production, and the like. Extracellular cytokine production can be measured by determining changes in levels of one or more cytokines in culture media. Typically an immunoassay (e.g., ELISA assay, sandwich assay, immunoprecipitation assay, or Western blotting) can be used, although other assays can also be suitable. (See, e.g., Harlow and Lane, Using Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York (1999)) For intracellular cytokine levels, immunoassays or other assays can be used. The T cells can optionally be separated from the organoid or animal (e.g., by collection based on expression of T cell markers), prior to assay for intracellular cytokine levels. (See, e.g., Harlow and Lane, supra). In additional embodiments, T cell activation can be determined by modulation of T cell activation markers. Such markers include, for example, CD25, CD69, CD44, CD125, and the like. The modulation of T cell activation markers can be measured, for example, by determining changes in protein levels or mRNA levels. Changes in protein levels can be determined by flow cytometry using labeled antibodies against the T cell activation markers, transcription factors or other proteins associated with T cell activation, by immunoassay, such as, ELISA or Western blotting, and the like. Changes in mRNA levels can be determined for the message encoding the T cell activation markers, transcription factors, and the like. mRNA levels can be determined by, for example, Northern blotting, polymerase chain reaction (e.g., RT-PCR), other hybridization assays (e.g., assays using probe arrays, and the like), or other assays.

The thymus gland is also extremely sensitive to external insults, such as chemotherapy, irradiation and infections, which can cause irreversible damages. Thus, there is a strong clinical need to rejuvenate thymus function for patients in need.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0104">Rejuvenating thymus function have broad clinical impacts for treatment of thymus deficiency. The thymus organoid described herein can be used to rejuvenate thymus function in a subject in need thereof. To that end, thymus organoids can be bioengineered from the subject's own PSCs (autologous) or PSCs from a matched donor (allogeneic). This document shows here that functional human thymus organoids are capable of supporting the development of human T cells from human HSCs both in vitro and in vivo can be tissue-engineered from human iPSCs.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0105">In some embodiments, the document provides a method for rejuvenating thymus function in a subject in need thereof. The method includes transplanting thymus organoids described herein into the subject. The thymus organoids can be allogeneic or preferably autologous. In some embodiments immune suppressive treatments can also administered as needed.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Cellular Immunotherapy.</heading><p id="p-0095" num="0106">The present document also relates to agents, methods and compositions to confer and/or increase immune responses mediated by cellular immunotherapy, such as by adoptively transferring antigen-specific genetically modified subsets of lymphocytes. Such an adoptive cell transfer or adoptive cell therapy (ACT) represents a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer patients. The document provides compositions comprising genetically modified lymphocytes that express chimeric antigen receptors having the ability to modulate the immune system and the innate and adaptive immune response. The disclosed agents, methods, and compositions provide genetically engineered lymphocytes with enhanced anti-tumor functions as well as methods of developing such lymphocytes.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0107">Genetically modified immune function cells, such as T cells and NK cells engineered to express foreign antigen receptors are effective immunotherapeutic for cancer and infectious diseases. Isolation of autologous antigen specific immune cells, such as T cells, for therapeutic application is a laborious task, and is not possible where such cells are absent or rare. Therefore, strategies have been developed to genetically transfer immune receptors specific to tumor or virus into patients' T cells. To this end, antigen receptors have been constructed that join antigen (Ag)-recognition domains to signaling domains of the TCR or Fc receptor. T cells expressing such antigen receptors can recapitulate the immune specific responses mediated by the introduced receptor.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0108">Chimeric antigen receptors (also known as chimeric immunoreceptors, chimeric T cell receptors or artificial T cell receptors) are receptor proteins that have been engineered to give T cells the new ability to target a specific protein. The receptors are chimeric because they combine antigen binding and T-cell activating functions into a single receptor. In addition to antigen-binding sites, a CAR can have one or more function domains.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0109">The thymus organoid and humanized animal described herein can be used to make genetically modified immune function cells, such as T cells and NK cells, expressing a CAR. In some embodiments, a lenti- or retro-viral vector containing one or more transgenes encoding, e.g., a specific T-cell receptor (both the alpha and beta chains) can be used to transduce CD34+ bone marrow progenitor cells. The transduced cells can be then seeded in the thymus organoid described herein and further differentiated to T cells and expanded using the thymus organoid system in vitro (e.g., the fluidic chip), or in vivo (in the humanized mouse). Using this approach, a sufficient amount of CAR-T cells can be made for treating disorders such as infection, cancer or a tumor.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0110">Transgenes can be introduced into target cells using various methods. These methods include, but are not limited to, transduction of cells using integration-competent gamma-retroviruses or lentivirus, and DNA transposition.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0111">A wide variety of vectors can be used for the expression of the transgenes. The ability of certain viruses to infect cells or enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and to integrate into a host cell genome and express viral genes stably and efficiently have made them attractive candidates for the transfer of foreign nucleic acids into cells. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, a viral vector is used to introduce a nucleotide sequence encoding one or more transgenes or fragment thereof into a host cell for expression. The viral vector may comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding one or more transgenes or fragment thereof operably linked to one or more control sequences, for example, a promoter. Alternatively, the viral vector may not contain a control sequence and will instead rely on a control sequence within the host cell to drive expression of the transgenes or fragment thereof. Non-limiting examples of viral vectors that may be used to deliver a nucleic acid include adenoviral vectors, adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, and retroviral vectors.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0112">Physical methods for introducing a polynucleotide into a host cell include calcium phosphate precipitation, lipofection, particle bombardment, microinjection, electroporation, and the like. Methods for producing cells comprising exogenous vectors and/or nucleic acids are well known in the art. See, for example, Sambrook et al. (2001, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0113">Chemical means for introducing a polynucleotide into a host cell include colloidal dispersion systems, such as macromolecule complexes, nanocapsules, microspheres, beads, and lipid-based systems including oil-in-water emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, and liposomes. An exemplary colloidal system for use as an in vitro and in vivo release vehicle is a liposome (e.g., an artificial membrane vesicle).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0114">In the case where a non-viral delivery system is used, an exemplary delivery vehicle is a liposome. The use of lipid formulations is contemplated for the introduction of the nucleic acids into a host cell (in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo). In another aspect, the nucleic acid may be associated with a lipid. The nucleic acid associated with a lipid may be encapsulated in the aqueous interior of a liposome, interspersed within the lipid bilayer of a liposome, bound to a liposome via a binding molecule that is associated with both the liposome and the oligonucleotide, entrapped in a liposome, in a complex with a liposome, dispersed in a solution containing a lipid, mixed with a lipid, combined with a lipid, contained as a suspension in a lipid, content or in a complex with a micelle, or associated otherwise with a lipid. The compositions associated with lipids, lipids/DNA or lipids/expression vector are not limited to any particular structure in solution. For example, they can be present in a bilayer structure, as micelles, or with a &#x201c;collapsed&#x201d; structure. They can also be simply interspersed in a solution, possibly forming aggregates that are not uniform in size or shape. Lipids are fatty substances that can be natural or synthetic lipids. For example, lipids include fatty droplets that occur naturally in the cytoplasm as well as the class of compounds containing long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives, such as fatty acids, alcohols, amines, amino alcohols, and aldehydes.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0115">Regardless of the method used to introduce exogenous nucleic acids into a host cell, the presence of the recombinant DNA sequence in the host cell can be confirmed by a series of tests. Such assays include, for example, molecular biology assays well known to those skilled in the art, such as Southern and Northern blot, RT-PCR and PCR; biochemical assays, such as the detection of the presence or absence of a particular peptide, for example, by immunological means (ELISA and Western blot) or by assays described herein to identify agents that are within the scope of this document.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Pharmaceutical Composition</heading><p id="p-0105" num="0116">The therapeutic cells (e.g., thymic emigrant cells, CAT-T cells, or NK-T cells) described above can be formulated into a composition, such as a pharmaceutical composition. Such a pharmaceutical composition may comprise any of the populations of cells described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can comprise a population of cells and another pharmaceutically active agent(s) or drug(s), such as a chemotherapeutic agents. Preferably, the carrier is a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier suitable for the particular population of cells under consideration. Such pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are well-known to those skilled in the art and are readily available to the public. Suitable formulations may include any of those for parenteral, subcutaneous, intratumoral, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, or interperitoneal administration.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0117">In one example, the composition of cells can be administered by injection, e.g., intravenously. When the population of therapeutic cells is to be administered, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for the therapeutic cells for injection may include any isotonic carrier such as, for example, normal saline (about 0.90% w/v of NaCl in water, about 300 mOsm/L NaCl in water, or about 9.0 g NaCl per liter of water), NORMOSOL R electrolyte solution, PLASMA-LYTE A, about 5% dextrose in water, or Ringer's lactate. In an embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is supplemented with human serum albumin.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0118">The amount or dose of the population of therapeutic cells or pharmaceutical composition administered (e.g., numbers of cells when the population of cells is administered) should be sufficient to effect, e.g., a therapeutic or prophylactic response, in the patient over a reasonable time frame. For example, the dose of the population of cells or pharmaceutical composition should be sufficient to treat or prevent a condition in a period of from about 2 hours or longer, e.g., 12 to 24 or more hours, from the time of administration. In certain embodiments, the time period could be even longer. The dose can be determined by the efficacy of the particular population of cells or pharmaceutical composition administered and the condition of the patient, as well as the body weight of the patient to be treated. Assays for determining an administered dose are known in the art. For example, an assay, which comprises comparing the extent to which target cells are lysed upon administration of a given dose of such therapeutic cells to a mammal among a set of mammals of which is each given a different dose of the cells, could be used to determine a starting dose to be administered to a patient. The extent to which target cells are lysed upon administration of a certain dose can be assayed by methods known in the art.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0119">The dose of the population of cells or pharmaceutical composition also will be determined by the existence, nature and extent of any adverse side effects that might accompany the administration of a particular population of cells or pharmaceutical composition. Typically, the attending physician will decide the dosage of the population of cells or pharmaceutical composition with which to treat each individual patient, taking into consideration a variety of factors, such as age, body weight, general health, diet, sex, population of cells or pharmaceutical composition to be administered, route of administration, and the severity of the condition being treated.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0120">This document also provides a method of treating or preventing a condition in a mammal.

In particular, the term &#x201c;antigen receptor&#x201d; includes engineered receptors, which confer an arbitrary specificity onto an immune effector cell such as a T cell. An antigen receptor according to this document may be present on T cells, e.g. instead of or in addition to the T cell's own T cell receptor. Such T cells do not necessarily require processing and presentation of an antigen for recognition of the target cell but rather may recognize preferably with specificity any antigen present on a target cell. Preferably, said antigen receptor is expressed on the surface of the cells. Specifically, the term includes artificial or recombinant receptors comprising a single molecule or a complex of molecules which recognize, i.e. bind to, a target structure (e.g. an antigen) on a target cell (e.g. by binding of an antigen binding site or antigen binding domain to an antigen expressed on the surface of the target cell) and may confer specificity onto an immune effector cell such as a T cell expressing said antigen receptor on the cell surface. Preferably, recognition of the target structure by an antigen receptor results in activation of an immune effector cell expressing said antigen receptor. An antigen receptor may comprise one or more protein units said protein units comprising one or more domains as described herein. The term &#x201c;antigen receptor&#x201d; preferably does not include naturally occurring T cell receptors. According to this document, the term &#x201c;antigen receptor&#x201d; is preferably synonymous with the terms &#x201c;chimeric antigen receptor&#x201d;, &#x201c;chimeric T cell receptor&#x201d; and &#x201c;artificial T cell receptor.&#x201d; Exemplary antigen recognizing receptors may be native or genetically engineered TCRs, or genetically engineered TCR-like mAbs (Hoydahl et al. Antibodies 2019 8:32) or CARs in which a tumor antigen-binding domain is fused to an intracellular signaling domain capable of activating an immune cell (e.g., a T-cell).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0127">The term &#x201c;Chimeric Antigen Receptor&#x201d; or &#x201c;CAR&#x201d; refers to a set of polypeptides, typically two in the simplest embodiments, which when in an immune effector cell, provides the cell with specificity for a target cell and with intracellular signal generation. In some embodiments, a CAR comprises at least an extracellular antigen binding domain, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic signaling domain (also referred to herein as &#x201c;an intracellular signaling domain&#x201d;) comprising a functional signaling domain derived from a stimulatory molecule and/or costimulatory molecule as defined below. In some embodiments, the set of polypeptides are in the same polypeptide chain, e.g., comprise a chimeric fusion protein. In some embodiments, the set of polypeptides are not contiguous with each other, e.g., are in different polypeptide chains. In some embodiments, the set of polypeptides include a dimerization switch that, upon the presence of a dimerization molecule, can couple the polypeptides to one another, e.g., can couple an antigen-binding domain to an intracellular signaling domain. In one aspect, the stimulatory molecule of the CAR is the zeta chain associated with the T cell receptor complex (e.g., CD3 zeta). In one aspect, the cytoplasmic signaling domain comprises a primary signaling domain (e.g., a primary signaling domain of CD3-zeta). In one aspect, the cytoplasmic signaling domain further comprises one or more functional signaling domains derived from at least one costimulatory molecule as defined below.

NK cells are a type of cytotoxic (cell toxic) lymphocyte that represent a major component of the inherent immune system. NK cells reject tumors and cells infected by viruses through the process of apoptosis or programmed cell death. T-cells play a major role in cell-mediated-immunity (no antibody involvement). Its T-cell receptors (TCR) differentiate themselves from other lymphocyte types. The thymus, a specialized organ of the immune system, is primarily responsible for the T cell's maturation. There are several types of T-cells, namely: Helper T-cells (e.g., CD4+ cells, effector T<sub>EFF </sub>cells), Cytotoxic T-cells (also known as TC, cytotoxic T lymphocyte, CTL, T-killer cell, cytolytic T cell, CD8+ T-cells or killer T cell), Memory T-cells ((i) stem memory T<sub>sccm </sub>cells, like naive cells, are CD45RO&#x2212;, CCR7+, CD45RA+, CD62L+(L-selectin), CD27+, CD28+ and IL-7Ra+, but they also express large amounts of CD95, IL-2R13, CXCR3, and LFA-1, and show numerous functional attributes distinctive of memory cells); (ii) central memory T<sub>sccm </sub>cells express L-selectin and are CCR7+ and CD45RO+ and they secrete IL-2, but not IFN&#x3b3; or IL-4, and (iii) effector memory TEM cells, however, do not express L-selectin or CCR7 but do express CD45RO and produce effector cytokines like IFN&#x3b3; and IL-4), Regulatory T-cells (Tregs, suppressor T cells, or CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells), Natural Killer T-cells (NKT), and Gamma Delta T-cells. T cells found within tumors are referred to as &#x201c;tumor infiltrating lymphocytes&#x201d; or &#x201c;TIL.&#x201d; B-cells, on the other hand, play a principal role in humoral immunity (with antibody involvement). It makes antibodies and antigens and performs the role of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and turns into memory B-cells after activation by antigen interaction. In mammals, immature B-cells are formed in the bone marrow, where its name is derived from.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0130">The term &#x201c;stem cell&#x201d; refers to a cell capable of self-replication and pluripotency or multipotency.

Only samples with DV200 values above than 70% were used in the study. 150-500 ng of total RNA was loaded to CAR-T cell gene profiling hybridization cartridge that can capture reporter probes for 771 genes (with unique barcode) specific to various pathways of T cell function, and was characterized with nCounter Max Gen 2 System (NANOSTRING TECHNOLOGIES, Seattle, Wash.). Splenocytes isolated from NSG mice were used as negative control, in which less than 15% of the genes were above background and were excluded from the analysis. All reads were analyzed with NSOLVER 4.0 Advanced analysis software. Specifically, pathway score analysis was performed, which condense each sample's gene expression profile into a small set of pathway scores. Pathway scores are fit using the first principal component of each gene set's data. They are oriented such that increasing score corresponds to mostly increasing expression (specifically, each pathway score has positive weights for at least half its genes).

The synergistic chemical and biophysical induction in the 3-D aggregate culture could significantly enhance the pancreatic islet specification of hESCs as compared to 2-D culture. A similar approach was adopted to promote the differentiation of iPSCs to TEPCs.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0177">Briefly, iPSCs were embedded in alginate capsules and subjected to a four-stage differentiation protocol, modified from those reported in Parent, A.

The 3-D environment of the alginate capsules maintained survival of iPSCs encapsulated as single cells, which propagated into small aggregates of approximately 50 um in diameter after 4 to 6 days of culture (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>). Encapsulated aggregates were further chemically induced towards definitive endoderm (D1-D4), which resulted in increase of mean aggregate size (box plot, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>) and shift in the distribution towards higher aggregate sizes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, solid lines in the left panel). Further differentiation towards TEPC lineage did not induce further proliferation, as judged from insignificant change in aggregate size, but significantly modified cell phenotype (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>). The overall efficiency of iPSC to TEPC differentiation was evaluated by examining the surface expression of EpCAM, a key marker for TECs, with flow cytometry (FCM) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>). About 84.6&#xb1;13% (n=5) of iPSC-derived TEPCs were EpCAM+. Similar patterns of TEPC aggregate formation and differentiation efficiency were observed in inducing hESC differentiation into TEPCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). These results highlight the effectiveness of the 3-D encapsulation to promote the derivation of TEPCs from hPSCs.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0178">To further characterize the iPSC-derived TEPCs, expression of TEC specific markers was analyzed via RT-qPCR analysis. Marked increases in expression of specific cytokeratin markers of thymic epithelium were seen in TEPCs generated in the 3-D alginate capsules when compared to those derived from the 2-D culture. Specifically, CK8 showed a 2-fold increase in expression, while CK17 and CK18 showed an approximate 6-fold and 5-fold increase, respectively. Conversely, both 2-D and 3-D TEPCs displayed significant loss of stem cell (OCT4 and SOX2) and definitive endoderm (SOX17) markers. Additionally, expression of ventral pharyngeal endoderm (VPE) and TEC progenitor markers were significantly increased, further suggesting the successful induction of iPSC differentiation into TEPC lineages. Notably, an approximate 5-fold increase in expression of FOXN1, the master regulator for TEC lineage development, was observed in 3-D TEPCs in comparison to those from 2-D, strongly confirming higher efficiency of TEPC differentiation under the 3-D alginate encapsulation conditions.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0179">Differentiation of epithelial precursors into mature TEC subsets (cTECs and mTECs) is critical for thymic organogenesis and function. To further investigate the progression of TEC differentiation, expression of genes specific to TEC subsets were examined. Genes specific to the cTEC subset that are critical for self-antigen procession and positive selection functions (e.g. PRSS16, ACKR4 and &#x3b2;5t) were expressed at significantly higher levels in 3-D TECs than those of 2-D TECs). Specifically, PRSS16 and ACKR4 showed a 2-fold and a 10-fold increase in expression, respectively. Similarly, the expression of AIRE, a key transcriptional regulator for TSA expression in mTECs that is critical for establishing immunologic self-tolerance, was promoted solely in the 3-D TECs. A similar expression pattern was shared by CSN2, a TSA whose expression in mTECs is regulated by AIRE. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the 3-D culture configuration is more efficient at promoting TEC lineage differentiation and maturation from iPSCs than the traditional adherent 2-D culture.

Conversely, only three hu.Thor mice (G2, n=0/8; G4, n=3/39) were lost within 30 days post-transplant. These findings suggest that the engrafted human thymus organoids may protect recipients from the detrimental effects associated with the conditioning regimens.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0186">To improve the survival of G1 and G3 mice so that enough controls could be obtained for the study, the cellular engraftment of CD34+HSC was increased five-fold in these mice to approximately 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mouse.

Thor mice after 350 days in the study, suggesting mutual tolerance between the engrafted hCD34+ human hematopoietic lineage cells and those of the NSG recipients. Even with less numbers of CD34+HSCs transplanted, higher levels of hCD45+ cells were found in the peripheral blood of hu.

Thor immune cells, focusing on pathways essential to T cell biology, such as T cell diversity, activation, TCR signaling, metabolism and exhaustion. Hu.Thor immune cells exhibited similar overall T cell gene expression profiling as hPBMCs, while differing significantly from hu.SRC cells. Specifically, both hu.Thor and PBMC cells showed higher levels of TCR diversity than hu.SRC cells, suggesting more diverse and complex TCR repertoire (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a</i></figref>). Both hu.Thor and PBMC cells also displayed higher TCR signaling phenotypes. Consistently, comparable pathway scores of T-helper subsets, including Th2, Th9, Th17 and Treg cells, were observed between hu.Thor and PBMC cells, notably higher than those of hu.SRC cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a</i></figref>). Interestingly, higher expression of activation markers were also observed in the hu.Thor and PBMC cells, whereas hu.SRC cells expressed higher T cell exhaustion markers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>b</i></figref>). Indeed, higher numbers of transcript reads of T cell exhaustion associated genes (e.g. PDCD1, TNFRSF9/CD137, CD244, HAVCR2/TIM3, and LAGS), as well as lower reads of terminal differentiated memory effector marker KLRG1, were detected in hu.SRC cell. Results from the gene expression profiling and pathway analysis further demonstrated the preeminence of hu. Thor mice over hu.SRC mice to recapitulate the molecular properties of human T cell-mediated immune pathways.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="1">Example 7 De Novo Generated Human T Cells in Hu.Thor Mice can Effectively Reject Allogeneic Tumor Grafts</heading><p id="p-0184" num="0191">It has been shown that neither hu.BLT nor hu.SRC mice are able to effectively reject stem cell-derived allogeneic grafts or teratomas, primarily due to the progressive differentiation of human T cells into the &#x201c;exhausted&#x201d; state, marked by increased expression of inhibitory receptors and reduced effector functions (Kooreman, N. G. et al. Alloimmune Responses of Humanized Mice to Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapeutics. <i>Cell Reports </i>20, 1978-1990, 2017). In contrast, hu.Thor T cells mounted effective responses when activated with either antigen-specific (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>e</i></figref>) or non-specific stimuli (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>d</i></figref>), and exhibited increased T cell activation pathway profiles (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>b</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0185" num="0192">To further challenge the model and test the function of hu.Thor T cells in vivo, teratomas derived from an allogeneic CC1 iPS cell line were generated in hu. Thor mice. Teratomas derived from Y1 iPS cells, with which thymus organoids were generated and engrafted, were used as syngeneic control. Dissociated small clusters of syngeneic Y1 and allogeneic CC1 stem cells were intramuscularly injected to the left and right hind limbs of hu.Thor mice, respectively. Teratomas were harvested at 3-weeks post-inoculation and were measured and weighed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). While robust growth of allogeneic CC1 teratomas was found in NSG and hu.SRC mice, significantly smaller tumor were found in hu.Thor mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, left panel). Histological examination revealed lymphocytic infiltration of CC1 tumors in both hu.SRC and hu.Thor mice, which is consistent with previous reports. Immunofluorescent analysis of teratoma sections showed increased infiltration of human (HLA-A+) CD3+ T cells in CC1 tumors harvested from the hu. Thor mice. Taken together, these results suggested that hu. Thor T cells can effectively mount alloreactive immune responses to reject allogeneic iPSC-derived tumors, which hu.SRC T cells are incapable of achieving. Of note, no significant difference of syngeneic Y1 tumor growth was observed between NSG, hu.SRC and hu. Thor mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, right panel), suggesting that Y1 thymus organoid may induce immune tolerance of syngeneic grafts in hu, Thor mice.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">Example 8 De Novo Generated Human T Cells from iPSC-Thymus Organoids can Mediate Humoral Response in Hu. Thor Mice</heading><p id="p-0186" num="0193">T cell-dependent activation of B cells plays important roles in both the primary and secondary humoral adaptive immune response. After initial antigen exposure, cytokines secreted by TH2 cells promote the plasma cells to undergo immunoglobulin class switching, shifting from producing IgM to IgG, IgA, or IgE. Recurrent antigen exposure promotes the further maturation of memory B cells to undergo V(D)J somatic hypermutation at the immunoglobulin loci to generate IgGs with higher affinities against the target antigens.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0194">Human antibody isotyping multiplex assays were performed to examine the levels of immunoglobulin classes and subclasses in the sera of hu. Thor mice, in comparison to hu.SRC controls. Major human immunoglobulin classes including IgG, IgM, IgA and IgE, were detected in hu. Thor sera (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a</i></figref>). Notably, significant higher levels of IgM and IgG subclasses (IgG1 and IgG3) were observed when compared to hu.SRC samples. These results suggest that human T cells generated from the engrafted iPSC-derived thymus organoids can facilitate B cell maturation and isotype switching function.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0195">To further evaluate their capability to mount effective humoral responses against specific antigens, hu. Thor mice were immunized with vaccines against diphtheria toxoid (DT). IgGs specific to DT were generated after the initial immunization and increased significantly after booster administration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>b</i></figref>). These results further prove that T-helper cells generated from iPSC-derived thymus organoids in hu.Thor mice promote the maturation of human B cells and can be used to model humoral responses of the human adaptive immune system.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0196">Hematopoietic humanized mice are powerful small animal models for studying the human immune system. While substantial progress has been made to improve the engraftment and differentiation of multiple lineage immune cells, development of a functional human T cell compartment remains as a major challenge, which significantly hampers the successful modeling of human adaptive immune responses. Over the years, a number of efforts have been made to improve the generation of the human T cells in these mice. Transgenic expression of human SCF, GM-CSF, and IL-3 in NSG-SGM3 mice promotes the stable engraftment of diverse hematopoietic lineages, including CD3+ T cells, CD19+ B cells and CD33+ myeloid cells. The recently generated RG SKI hIL-6 mouse line (Rag2<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>Il2rg<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>SIRPa<sup>h/m</sup>IL-6<sup>h/h</sup>), which expresses human IL-6, shows better support for survival of lymphoid lineage cells. These mice develop larger thymus glands and higher numbers of T cells, suggesting that hIL-6 can promote thymopoiesis. Successful IgG class-switch is also observed in antibody-producing B cells, suggesting effective T-helper function. Although transgenic expression of human cytokines/factors can boost the propagation and survival of human T cells, they remain reliant on mouse thymus microenvironments and murine MHCs for T cell education. Human T cells positively selected by mouse TECs will be largely restricted to interact with mouse MHC-expressing APCs, compromising their capability to model human immune responses. While interesting effects have been obtained by transgenically expressing human HLA molecules in mouse cells, the composition of human HLA genes is more complex than that of the mouse (e.g. three MHC I and three MHC II genes in human versus two MHC I and one MHC II genes in mouse). Moreover, formation of functional immunological synapses will depend on the interactions between human costimulatory molecules (e.g. CD28 and CD40) on human T cells and their mouse ligands (e.g. CD80/86 and CD40L) on mouse APCs, further undermining the capability of humanized mice to recapitulate human immune responses. In contrast, iPSC-derived TECs in thymus organoids of hu.Thor mice described herein support the selection of human T cells within a human thymic microenvironment. The data here demonstrate the development and functionality of T helper subsets, such as Th1 and Th17 cells that can produce IFN&#x3b3; and IL17A, respectively. Low but detectable levels of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) were also found in sera of hu. Thor mice, further suggesting that hu. Thor mice are adept at recapitulating the human immune responses.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0197">The presence of endogenous mouse thymus gland, while degenerated, might still compete with the engrafted thymus organoid for HSC homing. To limit its impact, 8-12 week old NSG mice can be used as recipients, as it has been shown that the hypoplastic thymus glands in NSG mice undergo irreversible, age-associated fibrosis. Indeed, no signs of recovery of endogenous mouse thymus in any hu. Thor mice examined were observed in the study described herein. To model the conditions of patients undergoing chemotherapy, a chemically induced myeloablation regimen, instead of total body lethal irradiation, was used to precondition the NSG mice. Both the age of the recipients and the chemical regimen used in the study could potentially negatively affect the levels of human cell chimerism achieved in the hu.Thor mice. Of interest, higher survival rates were observed in hu.Thor mice compared to hu.SRC controls, suggesting that human cytokines or factors produced from the human thymus organoids may mitigate the chemotoxicity of busulfan.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0198">Although as shown in the examples, HSCs with partially matched HLA can be used as the iPSC-thymus, a fully matched HLA between thymus organoids and transplanted HSCs can better facilitate the recapitulation of human adaptive immunity in hu. Thor mice. Accordingly, humanized mice with both TEPCs and HSCs from a single patient can further improve the modeling of the patient's adaptive immune system. Of note, no clinical signs of GVHD were observed during the life spans of the hu.Thor mice, some of which were kept alive for more than 12 months post-engraftment.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0199">This document discloses here the development of hu.Thor mice capable of generating a vast population of T cell multi-subsets that is able to maintain self-tolerance, as well as mount robust immune responses upon foreign antigen challenge.
