Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a structure for joining a column and beam frame and a shear wall in which a frame of a column and a beam of a reinforced concrete structure is joined with a shear wall of a reinforced concrete structure disposed in a structure plane of the frame using anchors.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When a shear wall of a reinforced concrete structure is disposed in a structure plane of a frame of a column and a beam of a reinforced concrete structure, and the shear wall is integrally joined with the frame, there has been a method in which a frame material made of steel is disposed in a space ensured between an inner peripheral surface of the frame and an outer peripheral surface of the shear wall, and the frame material is fixed to each of the frame and the shear wall using anchors (see Patent Literatures 1 to 3).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In Patent Literature 1, especially, a bonding strength and a friction force generated in a grout material filled in spaces ensured between the frame material and the frame and between the frame material and the shear wall are used, thereby intending to transmit most of the shear force between the frame and the shear wall (paragraph 0020). Consequently, an effect of reducing the number of the anchors disposed to extend between the frame and the shear wall is obtained (paragraph 0021).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, two types of anchors, the anchor that penetrates the frame material and is fixed to the frame and the anchor that is secured to the inner peripheral surface of the frame material and fixed to the shear wall, are required. Therefore, interposing the filler is not necessarily an efficient method.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In contrast, there has been a method in which a plate is interposed between a frame and a shear wall, and an anchor penetrates the plate and is fixed to both the frame and the shear wall (see Patent Literature 4). In this method, in the whole length of the anchor, a section buried in the frame and a section buried in the shear wall are restrained by the frame and the shear wall, respectively. Therefore, in a deformation (inter-story deformation) in a structure plane of the frame, that is, in a relative deformation between the frame and the shear wall, the respective buried sections try to behave integrally with the frame and the shear wall.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">Patent Literature 1: JP-A-2002-285708 (paragraphs 0018 to 0026, FIG. 1 to FIG. 3)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0008">Patent Literature 2: JP-A-2018-76677 (paragraphs 0019 to 0038, FIG. 1 to FIG. 3)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0009">Patent Literature 3: JP-A-2000-226938 (paragraphs 0010 to 0013, FIG. 1 to FIG. 4)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0010">Patent Literature 4: JP-A-2016-142021 (claim 1, paragraphs 0029 to 0072, FIG. 1 to FIG. 5)</li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0011">The plate of Patent Literature 4 tries to behave integrally with the shear wall in the relative deformation due to an anchor reinforcement (stud) that is disposed to protrude on the shear wall side and buried in the shear wall (claim 1, paragraph 0031). Here, in the anchor, while the section buried in the frame and the section buried in the shear wall are restrained by the frame and the shear wall as described above, the section inserted through the plate is not locked to the plate (paragraph 0033), and not restrained. Therefore, a shear force concentratedly acts to the section inserted through the plate of the anchor.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0012">Consequently, since the shear force concentratedly acts to the section not fixed to any of the frame or the shear wall in the relative deformation alternately in positive and negative directions, it is considered that the anchor is easily broken. Especially, since the anchors are not dispersedly disposed in a longitudinal direction of the shear wall (claim 1, FIG. 1, FIG. 7), it is not allowed to divide the shear force to the plurality of anchors via the plate, and the load per anchor easily becomes excessive.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0013">In Patent Literature 4, since a void (clearance) is ensured between a peripheral surface of the anchor and an inner peripheral surface of a through-hole of the plate (paragraph 0033), the shear force is not transmitted to the anchor via the plate in an early stage in which a relative deformation exceeding the void between the inner peripheral surface of the through-hole provided to the plate and the peripheral surface of the anchor is caused.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0014">Based on the background as described above, the present invention proposes a structure for joining a column and beam frame and a shear wall that reduces breaking of an anchor to enhance a transmission capability of a shear force between a frame and the shear wall by dividing the shear force to a plurality of anchors via a plate from an early stage in which a relative deformation is caused between the frame and the shear wall.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0015">A structure for joining a column and beam frame and a shear wall according to claim <b>1</b> of the invention is a structure for joining a column and beam frame and a shear wall in which a shear wall and a frame are joined using a plurality of anchors. The shear wall is disposed in a structure plane of the frame of a column and a beam of a reinforced concrete structure. The shear wall is a reinforced concrete structure. The plurality of anchors is disposed in a longitudinal direction and a height direction along an outer peripheral surface of the shear wall. One or a plurality of plates is disposed between an inner peripheral surface of the frame and the outer peripheral surface of the shear wall, integrated with any one of the frame and the shear wall, and continuous in each of the longitudinal direction and the height direction of the shear wall. The anchors are dispersedly disposed over a whole length in the longitudinal direction and a whole height in the height direction of the shear wall, and fixed to the frame and the shear wall in a state where the anchors penetrate the plate in a thickness direction and are locked to the plate in an in-plane direction. The anchors each include a lock portion locked to the plate, and the anchor has a cross-sectional area perpendicular to an axis of the anchor at the lock portion larger than cross-sectional areas perpendicular to the axis at other portions of the anchor.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">The term &#x201c;plate integrated with any one of the frame and the shear wall&#x201d; means that, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, anchoring devices <b>7</b>, such as studs (stud bolts) and anchor bolts, are disposed to protrude on a surface in a side at which a plate <b>6</b> is integrated, and as a result of burying the anchoring devices <b>7</b> in concrete of the side, the plate <b>6</b> is joined to the concrete of a frame <b>1</b> or a shear wall <b>4</b> in a state where the plate <b>6</b> behaves integrally with the frame <b>1</b> or the shear wall <b>4</b> to be integrated.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">The term &#x201c;one or a plurality of plates is disposed between an inner peripheral surface of the frame and the outer peripheral surface of the shear wall, and continuous in each of the longitudinal direction and the height direction of the shear wall&#x201d; means that the plates <b>6</b> are continuously disposed along a boundary surface between an inner peripheral surface of the frame <b>1</b> and an outer peripheral surface of the shear wall <b>4</b>, and means that a case where one continuous plate <b>6</b> is disposed in each direction and a case where a plurality of plates <b>6</b> is continuously disposed to be mutually butted in an axial direction are included.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">When a plurality of plates <b>6</b> is disposed in each direction, since the mutually adjacent plates <b>6</b>, <b>6</b> are mutually butted in the axial direction, it is substantially the same as a state where one continuous plate <b>6</b> is disposed. The term &#x201c;axial direction of the plate&#x201d; means a direction in which a plurality of plates <b>6</b> is arranged, and means a direction perpendicular to a width direction and a thickness direction. The reinforced concrete structures of the frame <b>1</b> and the shear wall <b>4</b> include a steel reinforced concrete structure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">When a pressure between the plates <b>6</b>, <b>6</b> due to the contact between end portions of the plates <b>6</b>, <b>6</b> in the two directions at a corner of the frame <b>1</b> possibly causes a problem in a deformation (inter-story deformation) of the frame <b>1</b> mainly in an in-plane direction of the structure plane, it is reasonable to discontinuously dispose the plates <b>6</b>, <b>6</b> in the two directions to avoid generation of an unnecessary stress by the pressure (claim <b>5</b>). The plates <b>6</b>, <b>6</b> in the two directions are the plate <b>6</b> disposed in the longitudinal direction and the plate <b>6</b> disposed in the height direction of the shear wall <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">The term &#x201c;discontinuously dispose&#x201d; means that a void (space) is ensured between end portions of the plate <b>6</b> in the longitudinal direction and the plate <b>6</b> in the height direction of the shear wall <b>4</b>, and includes a case where an end surface of the plate <b>6</b> in any direction abuts on a column <b>2</b> or a beam <b>3</b>. A &#x201c;void size&#x201d; is set corresponding to an assumed inter-story deformation angle of the frame <b>1</b>. The term &#x201c;void is ensured&#x201d; also can be referred that the plates <b>6</b> are not disposed in sections of parts of the column <b>2</b> and the beam <b>3</b> including the corner in the inner peripheral surface side of the frame <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">When the plates in the two directions are continuous at the corner of the frame as disclosed in Patent Literature 4 (paragraph 0031, FIG. 1), the corner between the plates in the two directions, that is, the butted part in the two directions is easily deformed forcibly by the frame in the deformation of the frame, and an excessive compressive stress is generated on the plate, thus possibly deforming the section other than the corner portion.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">In contrast, when the plates <b>6</b>, <b>6</b> in the two directions are not continuous at the corner of the frame <b>1</b> (claim <b>5</b>), the forcible deformation when the plates <b>6</b> follow the deformation of the frame <b>1</b> is reduced or released. Consequently, the following capability to the inter-story deformation angle of the plates <b>6</b>, <b>6</b> in the two directions is enhanced, and fatigue of the plate <b>6</b> due to the forcible deformation and breaking caused by the fatigue are easily avoided.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">Since the plate <b>6</b> is integrated with any one of the frame <b>1</b> and the shear wall <b>4</b>, the plate <b>6</b> behaves together with the frame <b>1</b> or together with the shear wall <b>4</b> in the deformation of the frame <b>1</b>. When the plate <b>6</b> is integrated with the shear wall <b>4</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and the following drawings, the plate <b>6</b> tries to relatively move with respect to the frame <b>1</b> in the deformation of the frame <b>1</b>, and when the plate <b>6</b> is integrated with the frame <b>1</b>, the plate <b>6</b> tries to relatively move with respect to the shear wall <b>4</b> together with the frame <b>1</b> in the deformation of the frame <b>1</b>. The integration of the plate <b>6</b> with the shear wall <b>4</b> or the frame <b>1</b> is allowed by providing the anchoring device <b>7</b> described above, which is fixed in the shear wall <b>4</b> or the frame <b>1</b>, disposed to protrude on any one of both surfaces of the plate <b>6</b> as illustrated in, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">When the plate <b>6</b> is integrated with the shear wall <b>4</b>, in the deformation of the frame <b>1</b>, the plate <b>6</b> receives a shear force from a lock portion <b>51</b> of an anchor <b>5</b> via a section buried in the frame <b>1</b> of the anchor <b>5</b> that behaves together with the frame <b>1</b>, and transmits the shear force to the shear wall <b>4</b> via a section buried in the shear wall <b>4</b> of the anchor <b>5</b>.

Therefore, a position at which the stress suddenly changes as a case where the force in the in-plane direction is concentrated in a part in the axial direction is not generated, thus reducing the breaking of the plate itself.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is an elevational view illustrating a state where a frame of a column and a beam is joined with a shear wall using plates and anchors;</p><p id="p-0051" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a partially enlarged view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0052" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a line x-x of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0053" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a plan view of a part of the plate disposed on an upper surface of the beam in a lower floor side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0054" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a partially enlarged view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrating the anchor and the plate between the shear wall and the beam in the lower floor side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> in detail;</p><p id="p-0055" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a line y-y of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0056" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is an enlarged view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrating a relation between plane areas when a fitting hole having a plane area larger than a plane area of a borehole is continuously formed in a side close to the plate of the borehole;</p><p id="p-0057" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> is an enlarged view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrating a relation between the plane areas when the plane area of the fitting portion is equal to or more than the plane area of the borehole;</p><p id="p-0058" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> in a perpendicular direction; and</p><p id="p-0059" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an elevational view illustrating a manufacturing example of the anchor when a lock portion is integrally formed with an anchor main body.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate a specific example of a joining structure in which a shear wall <b>4</b> of a reinforced concrete structure is joined to a frame <b>1</b> using a plurality of anchors <b>5</b>, the shear wall <b>4</b> is disposed in a structure plane of the frame <b>1</b> including a column <b>2</b> and a beam <b>3</b> of a reinforced concrete structure, and the plurality of anchors <b>5</b> is arranged in a longitudinal direction (horizontal direction) and a height direction (vertical direction) along an outer peripheral surface of the shear wall <b>4</b>.
