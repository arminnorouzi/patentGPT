to a process for preparing 2-(1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)ethyl acetate.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0002">Longtailed mealybug (scientific name: <i>Pseudococcus longispinus</i>) is a pest belonging to the order Hemiptera, the family Pseudococcidae, and suck juice of many agricultural plants, such as grapes, apples, citrus, and pears to damage these agricultural plants. Further, longtailed mealybugs discharge honeydew which contains sugar to cause fungi-induced diseases. These damage and diseases reduce the yield and quality of such agricultural plants, which is a serious problem.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">Generally, insecticides have been used for controlling mealybugs. However, mealybugs live in narrow spaces in leaves and/or plant barks and are themselves covered with a waxy substance. Therefore, insecticides are difficult to come in contact with the pest body. This results in insufficient effects of the insecticides.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">In the light of adverse effects of insecticides on the environment and human health, there is recently a demand for the development of a new highly safe, and eco-friendly control method such as mating disruption and/or mass trapping using sex pheromones of insects. Development of such a new control method requires the industrial and inexpensive preparation of a sex pheromone in a large amount.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">A sex pheromone of the longtailed mealybug is reported to be an optically active (&#x2212;)-2-(1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)ethyl acetate (Non-Patent Literature 1 listed below). Further, it is reported that there is no difference in the attracting activity for the longtailed mealybug between (&#x2212;)-2-(1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)ethyl acetate which is this sex pheromone and a racemic (&#xb1;)-2-(1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)ethyl acetate which is an equivalent mixture of the enantiomers (Non-Patent Literature 1). Therefore, for the establishment of a technique for controlling the pests utilizing sex pheromones, it is thought to be efficient to find a process for preparing the racemic (&#xb1;)-2-(1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)ethyl acetate, in view of the inexpensive supply of the pheromone and for an economical control method.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">One process for preparing this racemic pheromone is reported as follows. 3,4,4-Trimethyl-2-cyclopenten-1-ol is acetylated, and then, the reaction product is reacted with a base, and subsequently, reacted with t-butyldimethylsilyl chloride, the reaction product is subjected to an Ireland-Claisen rearrangement reaction to form (1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)acetic acid as an intermediate, and then, the functional group of the intermediate is converted into the functional group of the target compound (Non-Patent Literature 2 listed below).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">Like the aforesaid Ireland-Claisen rearrangement reaction, a Johnson-Claisen rearrangement reaction is known as a Claisen-type rearrangement reaction of allylalcohols such as a 2-cyclopenten-1-ol compound, in which the 2-cyclopenten-1-ol compound is reacted with a trialkyl orthoacetate in the presence of a weakly acidic catalyst such as propionic acid to form a (2-cyclopentenyl)acetate compound (Non-Patent Literature 3 listed below).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">LIST OF THE LITERATURES</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Non-Patent Literatures</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">[Non-Patent Literature 1] R.

Thus, the prior art fails to industrially and economically prepare a (1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)acetic acid and a (1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)acetate compound as the intermediate in a large amount.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0013">The present invention has been made in these circumstances, and aims to overcome the aforesaid problems of the prior art and to provide an industrial and economical process for preparing 2-(1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)ethyl acetate.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0014">As a result of intensive research, the present inventors have now provided a haloacetaldehyde alkyl 3,4,4-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl acetal compound which is a novel compound, and have found that it is possible to prepare a (1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)acetate compound, without using an ignitable starting material and an industrially expensive starting material, in an industrially readily applicable range of a reaction temperature, by subjecting the haloacetaldehyde alkyl 3,4,4-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl acetal compound to a dehydrohalogenation reaction in the presence of a base, followed by a rearrangement reaction.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0015">The present inventors have also found that it is possible to efficiently and industrially prepare 2-(1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)ethyl acetate by subjecting the alkoxycarbonylmethyl group (i.e., &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>C(&#x2550;O)OR) of the (1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)acetate compound thus prepared to a multi-step conversion to be converted into a 2-acetoxyethyl group (i.e., &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OAc) and, thus, have completed the present invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0016">According to one aspect of the present invention, the present invention provides a process for preparing 2-(1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)ethyl acetate (3) of the following formula (3):</p><p id="p-0017" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="16.68mm" wi="52.15mm" file="US20230002307A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0018" num="0000">wherein Ac represents an acetyl group,<br/>the process comprising:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">subjecting a haloacetaldehyde alkyl 3,4,4-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl acetal compound of the following general formula (1):</p><p id="p-0020" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="33.27mm" wi="49.19mm" file="US20230002307A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0021" num="0000">wherein R represents a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and Y represents a halogen atom,<br/>to a dehydrohalogenation reaction in the presence of a base, followed by a rearrangement reaction to obtain a (1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)acetate compound of the following general formula (2):</p><p id="p-0022" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-C00004" he="16.68mm" wi="51.56mm" file="US20230002307A1-20230105-C00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0023" num="0000">wherein R is as defined above, and</p><p id="p-0024" num="0018">subjecting the alkoxycarbonylmethyl group (i.e., &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>C(&#x2550;O)OR) of the (1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)acetate compound (2) to a multi-step conversion to be converted into a 2-acetoxyethyl group (i.e., &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OAc) to obtain 2-(1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)ethyl acetate (3).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0019">According to the present invention, the (1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)acetate compound (2) may be prepared without an ignitable starting material and an industrially expensive starting material, in an industrially readily applicable range of a reaction temperature. 2-(1,5,5-Trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)ethyl acetate (3) may be industrially and economically prepared by subjecting an alkoxycarbonylmethyl group (i.e., &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>C(&#x2550;O)OR) of the (1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)acetate compound (2) thus obtained to a multi-step conversion to be converted into a 2-acetoxyethyl group (i.e., &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OAc).</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0020">Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail below.
