Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the Internet open and laws related to location data modified, the location-based service (LBS) related industry has been activated. As a field of the LBS, vehicle navigation related industries for locating a current location of a vehicle equipped with a device or guiding a movement route to a destination have been activated and vehicle video recorder industry for recording driving images of the vehicle to determine a cause of an accident or an event which occurs has also been activated, so vehicles are increasingly equipped with a digital video recorder or a dashboard camera.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, in addition to a primary function of guiding a route and capturing driving images, application technologies for assisting a driver in driving a vehicle on the basis of various image processing technologies have been developed, and specifically, advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) has been developed and applied to analyze acquired images through various sensors installed in a vehicle and detect objects included in the images to determine driving related information and provide the determined information to a driver.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The ADAS provides guide information to the driver according to a variety of situations, as one the ADAS, a forward vehicle collision warning system (FVCWS) providing guide information to allow a driver to recognize a forward vehicle and maintain an appropriately safe distance with respect to the forward vehicle has been developed and applied.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The FVCWS may recognize in advance a possibility of a collision when a host vehicle is close to a forward vehicle by a predetermined distance while driving, a possibility of a collision with the forward vehicle if the host vehicle maintains a current speed, or an occurrence of an accident due to an accidental factor that maybe caused by the forward vehicle and provide corresponding warning information. In addition, technologies for providing driving guide information to the driver on the assumption of recognition of a forward vehicle such as a function of providing information on the departure of the forward vehicle in a state in which the host vehicle is waiting for the light to change or the host vehicle is stopped, besides the collision with the forward vehicle has also been continuously developed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, in order to increase accuracy of these technologies, it is essential to accurately detect the forward vehicle from the captured driving images.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An aspect of the present invention may provide a method of stably and accurately detecting a forward vehicle.

If detection of a forward vehicle, which actually exists, fails so it is erroneously recognized that the forward vehicle is not present, erroneous operation information may be provided to the user.
