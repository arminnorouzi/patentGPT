Such plasma processing apparatus can operate as an etching apparatus or a sputtering apparatus by the bias and/or the area ratio of the two electrodes. The plasma processing apparatus configured as a sputtering apparatus includes the first electrode that holds a target and the second electrode that holds a substrate. A high frequency is applied between the first and second electrodes, and plasma is generated between the first and second electrodes (between the target and the substrate). When plasma is generated, a self-bias voltage is generated on the surface of the target. This causes ions to collide against the target, and the particles of a material constituting the target are discharged from the target.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">PTL 1 describes a sputtering apparatus including a grounded chamber, a target electrode connected to an RF source via impedance matching circuitry, and a substrate holding electrode grounded via a substrate electrode tuning circuit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the sputtering apparatus described in PTL 1, the chamber can function as an anode in addition to the substrate holding electrode. The self-bias voltage can depend on the state of a portion that can function as a cathode and the state of a portion that can function as an anode. Therefore, if the chamber functions as an anode in addition to the substrate holding electrode, the self-bias voltage can change depending on the state of a portion of the chamber that functions as an anode. The change in self-bias voltage changes a plasma potential, and the change in plasma potential can influence the characteristic of a film to be formed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">If a film is formed on a substrate using the sputtering apparatus, a film can also be formed on the inner surface of the chamber. This may change the state of the portion of the chamber that can function as an anode. Therefore, if the sputtering apparatus is continuously used, the self-bias voltage changes depending on the film formed on the inner surface of the chamber, and the plasma potential can also change. Consequently, if the sputtering apparatus is used for a long period, it is conventionally difficult to keep the characteristic of the film formed on the substrate constant.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Similarly, if the etching apparatus is used for a long period, the self-bias voltage changes depending on the film formed on the inner surface of the chamber, and this may change the plasma potential. Consequently, it is difficult to keep the etching characteristic of the substrate constant.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent

The plasma processing apparatus <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment can operate as a sputtering apparatus that forms a film on the substrate <b>112</b> by sputtering the target <b>109</b>. The first electrode <b>106</b> is electrically connected to the first balanced terminal <b>211</b>, and the second electrode <b>111</b> is electrically connected to the second balanced terminal <b>212</b>.

The blocking capacitor <b>104</b> blocks a DC current between the first balanced terminal <b>211</b> and the first electrode <b>106</b> (or between the first balanced terminal <b>211</b> and the second balanced terminal <b>212</b>). Instead of providing the blocking capacitor <b>104</b>, an impedance matching circuit <b>102</b> (to be described later) may be configured to block a DC current flowing between the first unbalanced terminal <b>201</b> and the second unbalanced terminal <b>202</b>. The first electrode <b>106</b> can be supported by the vacuum container <b>110</b> via an insulator <b>107</b>.

Therefore, the influence of the state of the inner surface of the vacuum container <b>110</b> (the electrical characteristic of a film formed on the inner surface) is conspicuous, and the plasma potential changes depending on formation of a film.
