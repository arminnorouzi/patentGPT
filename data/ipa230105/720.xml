The energy consumption associated with the operation of such facilities is considerable and implies a need for optimization from both an ecological and economic point of view. In particular, there is the problem of varying occupancy numbers over the course of a day. Depending on the type of facility, time of day, day of week and/or season, some facilities may alternate between periods of vacancy and periods of high occupancy.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">DE19846678A1 relates to a generic thermal device. In particular, a commercially usable larger bathing cabin for saunas or steam bathing is described therein, which is operated over longer periods with fluctuating occupancy. In order to save heating energy, the air flow rate is adapted to the occupancy density, whereby this is accomplished by corresponding sensors, which utilize body weight or body contours for switching operations.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The object of the invention is to provide an improved thermal device, which, in particular, allows for a further reduction in energy consumption. A further object of the invention is to provide a method for operating the thermal device according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These objects are achieved by the thermal device defined in claim <b>1</b> and by the method defined in claim <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The thermal device according to the present invention comprises a heatable and ventilatable thermal cabin for at least one person, wherein the thermal cabin is equipped with adjustable heating means and with adjustable ventilation means and, optionally, with a temperate sensor. Due to the fact that detection means for the continuous detection of the presence of persons situated in the thermal cabin, wherein said detection means interact with a heating control device for the heating means in such manner that a base heating power is set when no one is present and that a comparatively higher operational heating power is set when someone is present, the energy requirement can be reduced by a surprising amount, in particular in case of fluctuating occupancy.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with the above approach, in the method according to the present invention, the heating means are operated with a base heating power when no one is present and are operated with a comparatively higher operational heating power when someone is present.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the present context, &#x201c;thermal device&#x201d; is to be understood as a collective term for any devices into which one or more persons access an environment of elevated temperature and possibly humidity for a certain period of time. Moreover, the term &#x201c;thermal cabin&#x201d; is to be understood quite generally as a well-defined room of the thermal device in which the said temperature and humidity environment is established and maintained. In addition to one, or optionally several, thermal cabin(s), the thermal device generally comprises further rooms and areas such as an entrance area, cloakroom, sanitary facilities and relaxation/break room(s).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, the present invention is used in particular in connection with hot air baths, saunas, steam baths and infrared cabins in all their embodiments. Accordingly, it is also understood that the heating power to be applied generally depends strongly on the size and type, but also on the construction of the respective thermal device. In certain cases, the device can be operated with a base heating power of zero, i.e., when no one is present, there is no heating at all. Moreover, it is understood that the device according to the present invention does not necessarily have to be operated according to the method of the present invention all around the clock.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In general, it should be noted that the extent of the reduction in heating power when no one is present compared to the operational heating power, and thus also the extent of the achievable energy savings, depends on a number of factors. This includes, in particular, the size and construction of the thermal cabin, but also the type of thermal cabin and the temperature range generally considered to be acceptable.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Advantageous embodiments and implementations are defined in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a simple embodiment, the detection means are only configured to detect and report of the presence as such of persons situated in the thermal cabin. Thus, one only detects whether the thermal cabin is unoccupied (&#x201c;no one is present&#x201d;) or whether at least one person is situated therein. According to an advantageous embodiment (claim <b>2</b>), the detection means are further configured to detect the number of persons situated in the thermal cabin. On the basis of this additional information, the heating power to be applied can be controlled in a more differentiated manner.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Although the presence-dependent control of the heating means provided according to the present invention allow for a considerable reduction in the energy requirement, it is advantageous (claim <b>3</b>) if the detection means further interact with a ventilation control device for the ventilation means in such manner that a base air flow rate is set when no one is present and that a comparatively higher operational air flow rate is set when someone is present. Accordingly (claim <b>14</b>), in an advantageous manner, the ventilation means are operated with a basic air flow rate when no one is present and are operated with a comparatively higher operational air flow rate when someone is present.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Devices for detecting the presence or number of persons in a defined room are basically known and can also be used accordingly within the scope of the present invention, provided that the sensors used for this purpose are compatible with the temperature and humidity conditions prevailing in the thermal cabin. To increase reliability, it may be appropriate, to use several sensors, in particular also several sensor types. According to an advantageous embodiment (claim <b>4</b>), the detection to mean comprise at least one infrared sensor and one door contact device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The thermal device according to the present invention can be implemented in diverse embodiments, whereby, in particular, various types of heating means are possible. In one embodiment (claim <b>5</b>), the adjustable heating means are configured as a sauna oven. As is well known, this is an oven encased in stones or the like, which acts to a certain extent as a heat accumulator.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a further embodiment (claim <b>6</b>), the adjustable heating means are configured as a steam generator as they are used in particular in steam baths, Turkish baths, hammams and the like. Moreover, for example, infrared heaters can also be used as heating means.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Depending on the type, the mentioned heating means are supplied with electricity, gas, oil or geothermal energy (heat pump).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment of the method (claim <b>8</b>), the base heating power is substantially constant. As already mentioned at the beginning, the base heating power can be zero (claim <b>9</b>), in other cases it is maintained at a base value to be determined in advance. Alternatively (claim <b>10</b>), the base heating power is controlled in such manner that a predefined base temperature range is maintained in the thermal cabin. These measures ensure that the temperature in the thermal cabin does not drop too much even during longer periods of vacancy. In the latter case, an undesirable waiting time until the intended cabin temperature is reached would have to be tolerated when a person enters after a longer period of vacancy.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment (claim <b>11</b>), the operational heating power, which is used when people are present in the thermal cabin, is substantially constant. In a further embodiment (claim <b>12</b>), the operational heating power is set according to the number of persons present in the thermal cabin. This embodiment does not necessarily require that a different operative heating power is set for each number of persons. In particular, in the case of larger thermal devices, it can be appropriate to set the operational heating power according to a stepwise criterion such as &#x201c;1 to 2 persons&#x201d;, &#x201c;3 to 5 persons&#x201d; and &#x201c;more than 5 persons&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to another embodiment (claim <b>13</b>), the operational heating power is controlled in such manner that a predefined effective temperature range is maintained in the thermal cabin. Also in this case, one basically determines in the manner according to the invention whether a person is present in the thermal cabin or not, and only in the case when someone is present, one generally switches to a comparatively higher operational heating power. However, the latter is now finely controlled with the aid of a temperature sensor provided for this purpose.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Examples of the invention will henceforth be described in more detail by reference to the drawings, which show:</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> a schematic view of a thermal device according to the present invention, in a perspective view;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> an exemplary operating diagram when using the method according to the present invention, and</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in each case, an exemplary operating diagram when using<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0025">a) a method according to prior art;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0026">b) the method according to the present invention during winter operation;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0027">c) the method according to the present invention during summer operation.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0028">The thermal device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> comprises a heatable and ventilatable thermal cabin <b>2</b>, which is equipped with adjustable heating means <b>4</b> in the form of a sauna oven.

The profile referred to as &#x201c;temperature&#x201d; actually consists of three curves, namely the measured values from two temperature sensors and the mean value thereof. The two measurement curves are practically congruent, and accordingly, also their mean value.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034">During the day there was mostly one person present, but occasionally there were two persons or no person in the sauna cabin. The operational heating power was provided as impulse operation with 7 kW peak power each time; a continuous feed of 1 kW was used as base heating power.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035">In the initial phase up to around 10.15 h, the cabin temperature was raised after the night break. From about 13.45 h to about 15.15 h, the sauna cabin was empty.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036">In this phase of absence, the heating power was reduced considerably, whereas the ventilation rate was not changed. In this example, despite the reduction of the heating power, there was only a very slight temperature decrease of about 5&#xb0; C., which would not even be noticed by a subsequently entering person.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037">A further example for the operation of a thermal device according to the present invention in comparison to a conventional thermal device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038">As in the previous example, the profile referred to as &#x201c;temperature&#x201d; actually consists of three curves, namely the measured values from two temperature sensors and the average value thereof.

Incidentally, the same behavior would be expected with the thermal device according to the present invention, if it were operated in the empty state.
