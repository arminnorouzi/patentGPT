Since integration of semiconductor devices is an important factor in determining product prices, increased integration is especially pursued/required. Since integration of two-dimensional, e.g. planar, semiconductor devices, integration is mainly determined by the area occupied by a unit memory cell, integration is greatly influenced by a level of a fine pattern forming technology. However, an extremely expensive cost of process equipment needed or used to increase pattern fineness sets a practical limitation on increasing integration for two-dimensional or planar semiconductor devices. To overcome such a limitation, three-dimensional semiconductor memory devices including three-dimensionally arranged memory cells have recently been proposed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some example embodiments of inventive concepts provides a three-dimensional semiconductor memory device with improved reliability.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to some example embodiments of inventive concepts, a semiconductor memory device includes a peripheral circuit structure on a substrate, a semiconductor layer on the peripheral circuit structure, an electrode structure on the semiconductor layer, the electrode structure including electrodes stacked on the semiconductor layer, a vertical channel structure penetrating the electrode structure and connected to the semiconductor layer, a separation structure penetrating the electrode structure, the separation structure extending in a first direction and horizontally dividing at least one of the electrodes of the electrode structure into a pair of electrodes, an interlayered insulating layer covering the electrode structure, and a through contact penetrating the interlayered insulating layer and electrically connected to the peripheral circuit structure.
