As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the laser projection apparatus <b>1</b> includes an apparatus housing <b>40</b> (only a portion of the apparatus housing <b>40</b> being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), and a laser source <b>10</b>, an optical engine <b>20</b>, and a projection lens <b>30</b> that are assembled in the apparatus housing <b>40</b>. The laser source <b>10</b> is configured to provide illumination beams (laser beams). The optical engine <b>20</b> is configured to modulate the illumination beams provided by the laser source <b>10</b> with image signals, so as to obtain projection beams. The projection lens <b>30</b> is configured to project the projection beams into an image on a screen or a wall.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The laser source <b>10</b>, the optical engine <b>20</b>, and the projection lens <b>30</b> are sequentially connected in a propagation direction of beams, and are each wrapped by a corresponding housing. The housings of the laser source <b>10</b>, the optical engine <b>20</b> and the projection lens <b>30</b> support their corresponding optical components respectively and make the optical components meet certain sealing or airtight requirements.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram showing a partial structure of a laser projection apparatus, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">An end of the optical engine <b>20</b> is connected to the projection lens <b>30</b>, and the optical engine <b>20</b> and the projection lens <b>30</b> are arranged in an exit direction of the projection beams of the laser projection apparatus <b>1</b> (referring to the N direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Another end of the optical engine <b>20</b> is connected to the laser source <b>10</b>. In an example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the laser source <b>10</b> and the optical engine <b>20</b> are arranged in sequence in the M direction, and the optical engine <b>20</b> and the projection lens <b>30</b> are arranged in sequence in the N direction, and the M direction and the N direction are perpendicular to each other. That is, the exit direction of the projection beams of the laser projection apparatus <b>1</b> is substantially perpendicular to an exit direction of the illumination beams of the laser projection apparatus <b>1</b> (referring to the M direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). On one hand, such a connection structure may adapt to characteristics of a beam path of a reflective light valve in the optical engine <b>20</b>, and on another hand, it is also conducive to shortening a length of a beam path in a one-dimensional direction, which is helpful for structural arrangement of the laser projection apparatus <b>1</b>. For example, in a case where the laser source <b>10</b>, the optical engine <b>20</b>, and the projection lens <b>30</b> are disposed in the one-dimensional direction (e.g., the direction M perpendicular to the direction N), a length of a beam path in the one-dimensional direction is long, which is not conducive to the structural arrangement of the laser projection apparatus <b>1</b>. The reflective light valve will be described below.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the laser source <b>10</b> may provide beams of three primary colors sequentially (beams of other colors may also be added on a basis of the beams of three primary colors). Due to a phenomenon of visual persistence of human eyes, what the human eyes see is white beams formed by mixing the beams of three primary colors. Alternatively, the laser source <b>10</b> simultaneously outputs the beams of three primary colors, so as to continuously emit the white beams. The laser source <b>10</b> includes a laser device <b>100</b>.

For example, the preset threshold is 1 nm or 2 nm or 3 nm. It will be noted that, the greater the difference between the center wavelengths of the laser beams emitted by two adjacent light-emitting components <b>102</b>, the less laser beams with a same wavelength in the laser beams emitted by the two light-emitting components <b>102</b>, thus, the interference phenomenon may be effectively improved.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Generally, in a case where the laser projection apparatus <b>1</b> whose laser source <b>10</b> includes the laser device <b>100</b> is to perform projection display, a speckle effect is usually generated. The speckle effect refers to an effect in which two laser beams emitted by a coherent beam source interfere in space after they scatter by irradiating a rough object (e.g., the screen of the laser projection apparatus <b>1</b>), and finally a granular bright and dark spot appears on the screen (e.g., a curtain). The speckle effect makes the display effect of the projected image poor, and these bright and dark unfocused spots are in a flickering state in the human eyes, which is prone to dizziness of the human when he or she keep watching for a long time, and the viewing experience of the user will be poor. Therefore, in a case where two adjacent light-emitting components <b>102</b> emitting laser beams with a same wavelength and a constant phase difference in the laser device <b>100</b> are coherent beam sources, the laser projection apparatus <b>1</b> is prone to generate the speckle effect.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">However, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, for two adjacent light-emitting components <b>102</b> whose laser beams have center wavelengths within a same wavelength range, the center wavelengths of the laser beams emitted by the two adjacent light-emitting components <b>102</b> are different, so the two light-emitting components <b>102</b> are not coherent beam sources. In this way, it is difficult for the laser beams emitted by the two light-emitting components <b>102</b> to interfere with each other, so that it is possible to reduce the speckle effect of the laser projection apparatus <b>1</b> whose laser source <b>10</b> includes the laser device <b>100</b> when performing projection display, the display effect of the projected image in turn is improved, and the feeling of dizziness when viewed by the human eyes is avoided.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In some embodiments, any wavelength of the laser beams emitted by the two adjacent light-emitting components <b>102</b>, whose laser beams have the center wavelengths within the same wavelength range, is different. For example, a maximum wavelength of the laser beam emitted by one light-emitting component <b>102</b> of the two light-emitting components <b>102</b> is less than a minimum wavelength of the laser beam emitted by another light-emitting component <b>102</b> of the two light-emitting components <b>102</b>, so that the two light-emitting components <b>102</b> are incoherent beam sources, so as to avoid interference of the laser beams emitted by the two light-emitting components <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>14</b></figref>, the laser device <b>100</b> further includes a heat sink <b>104</b>, and the heat sink <b>104</b> corresponds to at least one light-emitting component <b>102</b>.
