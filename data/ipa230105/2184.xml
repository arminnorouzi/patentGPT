The present invention also relates to creeling systems.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention further relates to methods for producing textiles having a plurality of designs, methods for producing a tufted textile, and methods for producing yarn.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Tufting machines are known in the art. A large number of yarns, even up to or more than 1000 yarns, are tufted simultaneously into a primary backing to provide a greige product. For each yarn tufted, a yarn cone is held in a rack of yarns.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the color or design of the greige fabric is to be changed, e.g. the same design is to be tufted in a different color palette or scheme. This may require the replacement of this huge number of cones in the rack. This is labor intensive and time consuming to make one change over.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">EP 2 885 235 B1 discloses a yarn packaging system comprising metered quantities of yarn for small lot size production of tufted or woven textiles. The packaging system comprises a plurality of vertical yarn containers. The yarns may be routed from the packaging system to a loom or tufting machine. A change-over between different packaging systems may be time consuming.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention in the first place aims at an alternative yarn storage system, wherein, in accordance with preferred embodiments, solutions are obtained for the problem with the yarn storage systems of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is, amongst others, an object of the present invention to provide a yarn storage system, which reduces the change over time for changing the greige product made in the tufting industry. It is also the object of the invention to provide yarn storage containers being part of such yarn storage system, and methods to store yarn in such yarn storage system. The invention further relates to a creeling system for filling such yarn storage system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a further object of the present invention to provide alternative methods for producing textiles having a plurality of designs, wherein, in accordance with preferred embodiments the change-over time between designs is limited. Further alternative methods for producing a tufted textile, and methods for producing yarn are aimed at, wherein, in accordance with preferred embodiments advantages over the methods of the prior art are obtained.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a first independent aspect of the invention, a yarn storage container and an yarn storage system are provided.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a first aspect of the invention, a yarn storage container for storing a yarn, said storage container comprising a tubular and/or elongated container, having an axial length, a tubular, and/or elongated perimetral, wall and a first and second axial extremity, the first axial extremity of said container having an opening for receiving an end of a yarn, said second axial extremity of said container being air-permeably closed, said wall is air permeable by means of a plurality of openings present along the axial length of said container. It is clear that said container is preferably tubular with a cylindrical perimetral wall, i.e. having a circular cross-section. According to variants the container may have a triangular, rectangular, square or hexagonal cross-section. Preferably the cross-section of the container is constant along the length of the container. According to a variant the cross-section of the container is tapering along a part or along the entire length thereof.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The yarn storage container is fit for storing non wound yarn, i.e. yarn in non-wound form.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the yarn storage container is internally void. In this way, any obstacles disturbing the yarn in the container is avoided. In so doing, loading the container with yarn can be executed in a uniform manner and tension variation in the yarn can be avoided while feeding a tufter or loom with yarn from the container. According to a variant the container may comprise internal means for guiding the yarn in a desired path. For example, the container may comprise a centrally located cone or frustum. In such case, the yarn is guided to lay freely about the perimeter of the cone or frustrum, ie without tension. Said internal means may be air permeable or impermeable.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As such, the wall, e.g. the tubular wall, of the container is air permeable and allows air passing in radial direction, in particularly from the inner side of the container to the outer side of the container. The container hence has a perforated wall. In the most preferred embodiment, the container is a tubular container having a perforated tubular wall.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each, e.g. tubular, container is preferably fit for holding only one yarn in non-wound form or appearance, wherein said yarn has a length being at least double, or at least 10 times the axial length of the container and/or a length being at least twenty, or at least hundred times the internal circumference of the cross-section of said container. Preferably said yarn has a length of at least 5 or at least 10 meter. Preferably, said length is shorter than 2 kilometers, or shorter than 750 meters, or shorter than 500 meters or shorter than 250 meters. Preferably, said length is at least 5 meters, and preferably in the range of 500 to 2500 meter. A minimum length of 5 m is desirable to allow fluent threading of the loom or tufter. Preferably a length of yarn is used which is at least 1.5 meter more than what is needed in accordance with the design to be created in the textile.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Yarns which are non-wound are yarns which are not wound or coiled on a spool or bobbin or alike. The yarn is laid down freely and unguided within the void inside the tubular container.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The second axial extremity of said container may be provided with an air permeable closing cap, such as e.g. a perforated cap from polymer or metal, which fits in or over the axial extremity of the tubular container. Alternatively, the second axial extremity of the tubular container is closed with a grid, e.g. a metal or polymer grid which is attached to the axial extremity. The open area of this air permeable closing cap may be in the range of 30 to 90% of the total surface of the cap, such as e.g. in the range of 40 to 80%, more preferred in the range of 45 to 75%.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A yarn storage system according to a second aspect of the invention comprises a plurality of yarn storage containers according to the first aspect of the invention. The working principle of the yarn storage system according to the invention is based upon the fact that such, e.g. tubular, containers can be filled with yarn by blowing yarn into the tube, e.g. by means of compressed fluid, such as air, via the opening at the first axial extremity of each of the containers. The yarn end blown into the container will be blown against the closure of the second axial extremity, and additional yarn length will gradually fill up the container as the yarn is laid freely in the volume of the tubular container. The fluid blown in, escapes the inner void of the container via the air permeable closure of the second extremity, and/or the openings in the wall. In other words, the yarns stuffs and fills the container at least partially. Once the required length of yarns is provided in the tubular container or containers, the yarn storage system may be moved to the apparatus which is to consume the yarns and convert it into the required textile product.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As an example, the yarns may be used by a tufting machine as pile yarn. During consumption of the yarns, the yarns may be gently dragged out of the tubular containers via the opening of the first axial extremity, hence in opposite direction as it was blown in. The yarn taken out of the container, will show very little to no variation on tension, which facilitates the tension control of the yarn during conversion into a textile fabric. The apparatus which is to consume the yarns and convert it into the required textile product may e.g. be a tufting machine, a weaving loom, a warp or weft knitting loom, a sewing or embroidering machine and alike.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to some embodiments of a yarn storage container according to the first aspect of the invention, the opening of the first axial extremity of said container for receiving an end of said non-wound yarn may be provided by leaving the first axial extremity of said container uncovered, hence open.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The tubular container has a perforated, e.g. tubular, wall, i.e. a wall with openings. The openings may have any suitable shape, e.g. circular, polygonal shaped such as triangular, square, rectangular, diamond shaped, pentagonal, hexagonal and alike, optionally all of these polygonal shapes having rounded corners; capsule shaped (i.e. rectangular but terminated with half a circle at the short side of the rectangle); dog bone shaped; elliptic, or alike. At the inner side of the tube, the perforations may have a rim free of burrs. The inner rim of the perforations is preferably flush with the inner surface of the tubular container.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to some embodiments the openings in the perforated, e.g. tubular, wall may be circular or rectangular, the latter optionally terminated with half a circle at the short side of the rectangle or having rounded corners. The rectangular opening, optionally terminated with half a circle at the short side of the rectangle (also referred to as capsule-shaped) or having rounded corners, may have its long side parallel or perpendicular to the axial length of the container.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The openings define a total sum of open area along the wall of the container, hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;open area&#x201d;. The average open area per surface unit of inner, e.g. tubular, wall may be in the range of 0.1 to 2.5%, more preferred in the range of 0.25 to 1%. Each opening preferably has a surface area in the range of 0.003 to 0.196 inch<sup>2</sup>, such as in the range of 0.008 to 0.05 inch<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferably, the openings may be distributed along the wall according to a geometrical pattern.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to some embodiments, the amount of open area per surface unit of inner, e.g. tubular, wall adjacent the first axial extremity may be smaller than the amount of open area per surface unit of inner, e.g. tubular, wall adjacent the second axial extremity. The amount of open area per surface unit of inner tubular wall may increase gradually from the first axial extremity to the second axial extremity. According to some embodiments, the amount of open area per surface unit of inner wall may increase stepwise from the first axial extremity to the second axial extremity.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The amount of open area per surface unit of inner, e.g. tubular, wall may increase stepwise (with at least one step) or gradually along the axial length of the container from the first axial extremity to the second axial extremity. Possibly the amount of open area increases stepwise from the first axial extremity to the second axial extremity. As such different sections along the axial length of the, e.g. tubular, wall of the, e.g. tubular, container are defined.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The open area per surface unit of wall near the first axial extremity of the container is in the range of 0.1 to 2.5%, more preferred in the range of 0.1 to 1% such as in the range of 0.1 to 0.5%.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The open area per surface of wall near the second axial extremity of the container is in the range of 0.1 to 2.5%, more preferred in the range of 0.5 to 2.5% such as in the range of 0.5 to 1.5%.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The open area may be varied over the surface of the container by varying the number of openings per surface unit, by varying the shape of the openings, by varying the dimensions of the openings or by any combination of these measures.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to some embodiments, the inner, e.g. tubular, wall may comprise at least two sections, the amount of open area per surface unit of inner tubular wall in the section adjacent the first axial extremity is less than the amount of open area per surface unit of inner wall in the section adjacent the second axial extremity.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some of its preferred embodiments, the, e.g. tubular, wall has two sections, i.e. with length Le<b>1</b> and Le<b>2</b>, each located adjacent to one of the extremities. The lengths Le<b>1</b> and Le<b>2</b> together is the axial length of the container. The length of the section adjacent the first axial extremity may have a length Le<b>1</b> being 50 to 85% of the total axial length of the container.

As such build-up of electrostatic charges can be prevented. The prevention of electrostatic charges may keep the yarn from sticking to the inner wall of the container, and thus may prevent the yarn from bridging inside the container, i.e. from forming an obstruction in the inner part of the container by self-accumulating before having reached the end of the inner void of the container. Such accumulation may lead to the yarn becoming entangled, and to a lack of volume to store sufficient yarn inside the container.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The above described problem of bridging is especially prevalent with such yarns that are based on PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PTT (poly tri methylene terephthalate), PP (polypropylene), PA (polyamide), wool or cotton.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The electrical conductivity of the inner wall of the container may be obtained by providing e.g. an electrically conductive coating along the whole inner wall.

For example, in the case of a tubular and cylindrical container, contacts or near contacts may be formed at the topmost and bottommost part and at the leftmost and the rightmost part of the outer wall, however several zones of the outer wall, for example the zone in between the topmost part and for example the rightmost part of the outer wall, are free from contact with any other container in the stack. The availability of voids in between the stacked containers is beneficial for the air to escape the stack while filling the respective containers in the stack with yarn.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The racks may be provided with a transporting system, rendering the yarn storage system movable.

The horizontal or slightly sloping orientation of the containers may improve the taking out of the yarn, for example when connected with a tufting machine. Due to the horizontal orientation or the substantially horizontal orientation of the containers, several storage systems, for example for subsequent designs to be tufted on the same tufting machine, can be placed on top of each other, and the change-over from one storage system to the other can be made fluently.

Any type of injector can be used. Preferably the injector uses the Venturi-effect to suck the yarn into the injector, where it is further propelled by the gas, preferably air, flowing in the Venturi tube. The person skilled in the art is well aware that the Venturi-effect is created by a pressure drop at a constriction in a liquid or gas flow.

The lengths of the yarns in the containers can be measured accurately and may be limited. As such a given &#x201c;minor&#x201d; length of a tufted greige carpet can be provided with little yarn waste being created. The latter because the yarn length in the containers can be calculated according to the yarn which will be consumed by the tufting machine to make the length of greige. For each kind of yarn or yarn color needed, only the number of spools are to be provided which together comprise the needed length of yarn. Only the leftovers on these spools used might be seen as waste. The number of spools is not linked to the number of needles in the tufting machine, hence a very significant waste reduction is obtained.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0111">The possibility to move the yarn storage system enables filling the yarn storage system at a dedicated location where the robot is present.

Said defining may be done by means of suitable software converting a design of a particular length into a set of yarns with defined properties, such as length, color, quality, needed for producing the design. Preferably, the length of yarn to be inserted is slightly larger than the actual length needed in the textile product, for example the actual length to be inserted can be 100 to 110% of said needed length.
