These described embodiments are only examples of the presently disclosed techniques. Additionally, in an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, all features of an actual implementation may not be described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">When introducing elements of various embodiments of the present disclosure, the articles &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements. The terms &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d; are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements. Additionally, it should be understood that references to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; of the present disclosure are not intended to be interpreted as excluding the existence of additional embodiments that also incorporate the recited features.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As briefly discussed above, a heating, ventilation, and/or air conditioning (HVAC) system may be used to regulate certain climate parameters within a space of a building, home, or other suitable structure. For example, the HVAC system may include an air handling unit having a fan or other flow generating device that is positioned within an enclosure of the air handling unit. The enclosure may be in fluid communication with the building or other structure via an air distribution system, such as a system of ductwork, which extends between the enclosure and the building. The fan may be operable to force an air flow along an interior of the enclosure and, thus, direct air into or out of the building and/or via the air distribution system. In particular, the fan may enable the air handling unit to exhaust return air from the building and/or to direct fresh outdoor air into the building. Accordingly, a supply of fresh air may be circulated through an interior of the building to improve or maintain an air quality within the building.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Typically, the HVAC system includes one or more diffusers that are fluidly coupled to terminal ends of the ductwork and are configured to facilitate distribution of air from the ductwork into the rooms or spaces of the building. For example, the diffusers may be positioned adjacent to ceilings of the rooms conditioned by the HVAC system and may be configured to discharge air from the ductwork, into the rooms or other spaces, and in directions extending generally from the ceilings toward floors of the rooms or spaces serviced by the HVAC system. Discharge of air from the diffusers (e.g., from near the ceiling in a generally downward direction with respect to gravity) at a relatively high velocity may result in the formation of turbulence (e.g., air vortices) within the room or space. As such, the diffusers may form a portion of an overhead mixed air distribution system, for example, which may be configured to facilitate mixing of air within the room or space serviced by the HVAC system. Unfortunately, such turbulent air mixing within the room or space may increase spread and/or distribution of foreign matter (e.g., airborne particulates, contaminants) throughout the room or space. As such, conventional HVAC systems may be unsuited or ill-equipped to facilitate cooling, heating, and/or ventilation of spaces in which turbulent air mixing is undesirable, such as rooms of a hospital environment or clean room, for example.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Moreover, typical HVAC systems may mix air flows received from different rooms, spaces, or other regions of the building during operation of the HVAC system, which may result in spread of foreign matter (e.g., airborne contaminants) between the different rooms, spaces, and/or regions of the building. For example, a typical air handling unit of the HVAC system (e.g., an economizer of the HVAC unit) may be configured to receive a first flow of return air from a first room or zone serviced by the HVAC system and to receive a second flow of return air from a second room or zone serviced by the HVAC system. The air handling unit may mix at least a portion of the first and second air flows with one another and with outdoor air received from an ambient environment (e.g., the atmosphere) to form a supply air flow. The air handling unit may subsequently direct portions of the supply air flow back to the first and second rooms or zones. As a result, conventional HVAC systems may facilitate undesirable spread of foreign matter from the first room to the second room, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is now recognized that it is desirable to facilitate conditioning (e.g., cooling, heating, ventilation, filtration) of spaces serviced by an HVAC system while also mitigating or substantially eliminating mixing (e.g., turbulent mixing) of air within each of the spaces, and while mitigating or substantially eliminating exchange of air between the spaces. Accordingly, embodiments of the present disclosure are directed toward an improved HVAC system that is configured to facilitate and enable displacement ventilation in the spaces serviced by the HVAC system to substantially reduce mixing (e.g., turbulent mixing) of air within the space, as compared to typical HVAC systems having overhead mixed air distribution systems. Moreover, the improved HVAC system disclosed herein is configured to mitigate or substantially eliminate exchange of air between individual rooms, zones, or other spaces serviced by the HVAC system to substantially inhibit transmission of foreign matter (e.g., airborne contaminants) between the individual spaces. These and other features will be described below with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Turning now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an embodiment of a building <b>10</b> that may be serviced by a heating, ventilation, and/or air conditioning (HVAC) system <b>100</b>. The HVAC system <b>100</b> may include a plurality of HVAC devices (e.g., heaters, chillers, air handling units, pumps, fans, thermal energy storage units, etc.) configured to provide heating, cooling, air conditioning, ventilation, and/or other services for the building <b>10</b>. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the HVAC system <b>100</b> is shown to include a waterside system <b>120</b> and an airside system <b>130</b>. The waterside system <b>120</b> may provide a heated fluid and/or a chilled fluid to an air handling unit of the airside system <b>130</b>. The airside system <b>130</b> may use the heated fluid and/or the chilled fluid to heat or cool an airflow provided to the building <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the illustrated embodiment, the HVAC system <b>100</b> includes a chiller <b>102</b>, a boiler <b>104</b>, and an air handling unit (AHU) <b>106</b> (e.g., a rooftop unit). The waterside system <b>120</b> may use the boiler <b>104</b> and the chiller <b>102</b> to heat or cool a working fluid (e.g., water, glycol, etc.) and may circulate the working fluid to the AHU <b>106</b>. In various embodiments, the HVAC devices of the waterside system <b>120</b> may be located in or around the building <b>10</b> or at an offsite location such as a central plant (e.g., a chiller plant, a steam plant, a heat plant, etc.) that serves one or more portions of the building <b>10</b>. The working fluid may be heated in the boiler <b>104</b> or cooled in the chiller <b>102</b>, depending on whether heating or cooling is desired in the building <b>10</b>. The boiler <b>104</b> may add heat to the circulated fluid, for example, by burning a combustible material (e.g., natural gas) or using an electric heating element. The chiller <b>102</b> may place the circulated fluid in a heat exchange relationship with another fluid (e.g., a refrigerant) in a heat exchanger (e.g., an evaporator) to absorb heat from the circulated fluid. The working fluid from the chiller <b>102</b> and/or the boiler <b>104</b> may be transported to the AHU <b>106</b> via piping <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The AHU <b>106</b> may place the working fluid in a heat exchange relationship with an air flow passing through the AHU <b>106</b> (e.g., via one or more stages of cooling coils and/or heating coils). The air flow may be, for example, outside air, return air from within the building <b>10</b>, or a combination of both. The AHU <b>106</b> may transfer heat between the air flow and the working fluid to provide heating or cooling for the air flow. For example, the AHU <b>106</b> can include one or more fans or blowers configured to pass the air flow over or through a heat exchanger containing the working fluid. The working fluid may then return to the chiller <b>102</b> and/or the boiler <b>104</b> via piping <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The airside system <b>130</b> may deliver the air flow supplied by the AHU <b>106</b> (i.e., the supply air flow) to the building <b>10</b> via air supply ducts <b>112</b> and may provide return air from the building <b>10</b> to the AHU <b>106</b> via air return ducts <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, the airside system <b>130</b> includes multiple variable air volume (VAV) units <b>116</b>. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the airside system <b>130</b> is shown to include a separate VAV unit <b>116</b> on each floor or zone of building <b>10</b>. The VAV units <b>116</b> may include dampers or other flow control elements that can be operated to control an amount of the supply air flow provided to individual zones of the building <b>10</b>.

In this way, the DV diffuser <b>454</b> may direct the supply air <b>450</b> along the floor <b>520</b> in a manner that mitigates air turbulence in the room <b>442</b>, as discussed in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The following discussion continues with concurrent reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. As discussed above, the HVAC system <b>400</b> is configured to facilitate conditioning of the room <b>442</b> while mitigating or substantially eliminating mixing (e.g., turbulent mixing) of air within the room <b>442</b> and while mitigating or substantially eliminating exchange of air between the room <b>442</b> and other rooms serviced by the HVAC system <b>400</b> (e.g., other rooms in the building <b>10</b>). The controller <b>500</b> may be configured to operate the HVAC system <b>400</b> to provide a desired amount of ventilation (e.g., air exchange) within the room <b>442</b> while also providing conditioning (e.g., cooling) to the room <b>442</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, to provide ventilation within the room <b>442</b>, the controller <b>500</b> may operate the first blower <b>420</b> to draw outdoor air <b>422</b> into the first enclosure <b>410</b> of the air handling unit <b>402</b>. In some embodiments, the controller <b>500</b> may receive feedback from the first sensor <b>482</b> indicative of temperature of the outdoor air <b>422</b> and/or of a humidity of the outdoor air <b>422</b>. In response to a determination that a humidity level of the outdoor air <b>422</b> is above a target humidity level associated with the room <b>442</b>, the controller <b>500</b> may instruct the air handling unit <b>402</b> to operate in a dehumidification mode to dehumidify the outdoor air <b>422</b>. In particular, the controller <b>500</b> may operate components of the air handling unit <b>402</b> to circulate working fluid through the first heat exchanger <b>414</b> at a temperature that is below a dew point temperature of the outdoor air <b>422</b>. As a result, water vapor (e.g., moisture) suspended in the outdoor air <b>422</b> may condense and be removed from the outdoor air <b>422</b>, such that the ventilation air <b>408</b> output by the air handling unit <b>402</b> has a humidity level that is less than a humidity level of the outdoor air <b>422</b> entering the air handling unit <b>402</b>. In some embodiments, the controller <b>500</b> may receive feedback indicative of the humidity level of the ventilation air <b>408</b> from the second sensor <b>484</b>. The controller <b>500</b> may be configured to utilize feedback from the first sensor <b>482</b>, the second sensor <b>484</b>, or both, to operate components of the air handling unit <b>402</b> to achieve a humidity level of the ventilation air <b>408</b> that is substantially similar to or below (e.g., within a threshold range of, within a threshold percentage of) the target humidity level for the room <b>442</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As discussed below, the terminal unit <b>404</b> may be configured to facilitate conditioning (e.g., cooling) of the room <b>442</b> in addition to any cooling capacity that may be provided via the first heat exchanger <b>414</b> of the air handling unit <b>402</b>. Accordingly, the air handling unit <b>402</b> may not be operated to satisfy an entire cooling demand of the room <b>442</b>. Thus, an overall size of the air handling unit <b>402</b> may be reduced, as compared to typical air handling units.

Indeed, the replenished air may include outdoor air <b>442</b> and air from the room <b>422</b> that is re-filtered (e.g., via the terminal unit <b>402</b>). For example, the air handling unit <b>402</b> may be operable to provide a volume of air to enable two air changes of the room <b>442</b> via the outdoor air <b>422</b> drawn into the HVAC system <b>400</b>. The terminal unit <b>404</b> may be operable to provide an additional volume of air to enable the remaining two air exchanges of the room <b>442</b> via the return air <b>440</b> that is filtered via the additional filter <b>470</b>.

For example, the controller <b>500</b> may be configured to instruct the dampers <b>550</b> to transition to an open configuration while the second heat exchanger <b>434</b> is inactive (e.g., not circulating chilled working fluid <b>496</b>), such that the second blower <b>432</b> may draw the return air <b>440</b> into the terminal unit <b>404</b> and mix the return air <b>440</b> with the ventilation air <b>408</b> without directing the return air <b>440</b> across the second heat exchanger <b>434</b>. Conversely, during operational periods in which the second heat exchanger <b>434</b> is active (e.g., circulating the chilled working fluid <b>496</b>), the controller <b>500</b> may instruct the dampers <b>550</b> to close such that the second blower <b>432</b> may draw the return air <b>440</b> across the second heat exchanger <b>434</b>. In some embodiments, the one or more dampers <b>550</b> may be configured to control a flow rate of the ventilation air <b>408</b> from the first ductwork <b>406</b> into the terminal unit <b>404</b> and/or control a flow rate of the supply air <b>450</b> discharged from the terminal unit <b>404</b> into the second ductwork <b>456</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The DV diffuser <b>454</b> may include the outlet <b>458</b> configured to discharge the supply air <b>450</b> along the floor <b>520</b> of the room <b>442</b>. A cross-sectional area of the outlet <b>458</b> may be relatively large, such that a discharge velocity of the supply air <b>450</b> from the DV diffuser <b>454</b> is relatively low. In this manner, the DV diffuser <b>454</b> may disperse the supply air <b>450</b> (e.g., cooled air) along the floor <b>520</b> without substantially generating turbulent airflow throughout other portions of the room <b>442</b>. That is, the DV diffuser <b>454</b> may facilitate supply of fresh supply air <b>450</b> (e.g., filtered air, conditioned outdoor air <b>422</b>) to the room <b>442</b> while avoiding turbulent interaction between the supply air <b>450</b> and stale or existing air in the room <b>442</b>. As the supply air <b>450</b> in the room <b>442</b> is gradually heated (e.g., via interaction with the floor <b>520</b>, with human occupants within the room <b>442</b>, with other heat sources), the supply air <b>450</b> may rise from the floor <b>520</b> toward a ceiling <b>552</b> of the room <b>442</b>. The exhaust duct <b>510</b> may be positioned near the ceiling <b>552</b> and be configured to discharge the heated supply air <b>450</b> from the room as exhaust air <b>512</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, the third enclosure <b>452</b> (e.g., housing) of the DV diffuser <b>454</b> may define a plenum of the DV diffuser <b>454</b>, which may be fluidly coupled to the second ductwork <b>456</b>. A grille <b>556</b> may be removably coupled to the third enclosure <b>452</b> and be configured to position or retain the filter <b>459</b> across the outlet <b>458</b> of the DV diffuser <b>454</b>. That is, the grille <b>556</b> may be configured to removably couple the filter <b>459</b> to the third enclosure <b>452</b>. In some embodiments, the grille <b>556</b> may be removeable by an occupant within the room <b>442</b> to provide the occupant with access to the filter <b>459</b>. Accordingly, the occupant may remove the filter <b>459</b> for cleaning and/or replacement with a new filter. In certain embodiments, the filter <b>459</b> may be sealed or otherwise secured to the third enclosure <b>452</b> via a continuous frame (e.g., knife edge frame) that may be formed on the third enclosure <b>452</b>. Further, a seal (e.g., a gelatinous solution) may be placed between the third enclosure <b>452</b> and the filter <b>459</b> to mitigate or substantially block air flow between the third enclosure <b>452</b> and the filter <b>459</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, the third enclosure <b>452</b> may include a first panel <b>560</b> or wall, a second panel <b>562</b> or wall, an upper panel <b>564</b> or wall, and a lower panel or wall that, together with the grille <b>556</b>, may bound an interior region of the third enclosure <b>452</b>. The first panel <b>560</b> and the second panel <b>562</b> may converge at a vertex <b>568</b> that may be configured to align with a corner <b>570</b> of the room <b>442</b> (e.g., an intersection of walls of the room <b>442</b>). As such, the DV diffuser <b>454</b> may be positioned within the corner <b>570</b> in a space efficient manner and be configured to output supply air <b>450</b> to the room <b>442</b> outwardly from the corner <b>570</b> and toward a central region of the room <b>442</b>. The grille <b>556</b> may be configured to extend across the outlet <b>458</b> from the first panel <b>560</b> to the second panel <b>562</b>. As such, the grille <b>556</b>, the first panel <b>560</b>, and the second panel <b>562</b> may bound an interior region (e.g., a plenum) of the third enclosure <b>452</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional side view of an embodiment of the DV diffuser <b>454</b>.

As discussed above, the third enclosure <b>452</b> and the grille <b>556</b> may collectively bound an interior region or plenum <b>571</b> of the DV diffuser <b>454</b>. The plenum <b>571</b> may be fluidly coupled to an inlet <b>572</b> of the third enclosure <b>452</b>, which may be configured to couple to the first ductwork <b>406</b> and receive the supply air <b>450</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, the grille <b>556</b> (e.g., a cover face) may be detachable (e.g., fully removeable) from the third enclosure <b>452</b> to enable user access to the filter <b>459</b> extending across the outlet <b>458</b> of the DV diffuser <b>454</b>. In certain embodiments, the grille <b>556</b> may be pivotably and/or angularly displaceable relative to the third enclosure <b>452</b> to enable user access to the filter <b>459</b>.
