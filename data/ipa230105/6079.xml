Because the electromotive forces of the solar cells are low, a plurality of solar cells are connected to each other to constitute a solar cell module (a photovoltaic module) having an appropriate electromotive force. A grid-connected solar system used for a generally used building mounted type includes a plurality of solar cell arrays that convert solar energy into electric energy, and an inverter that converts DC power corresponding to electric energy obtained through conversion in the solar cell arrays to AC power and supplies the AC power to a used place.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the solar system, installation of the solar cell arrays installed to obtain energy of the sunlight is the most important element in a configuration of the system, and the solar cell arrays are installed at a separately secured place or are installed on the roof of a building.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, a separate space has to be secured to install the solar system in a building, but a cooling tower that constitutes a cooling device is generally installed on the roof of the building, and thus a place for installing the solar cell arrays is narrow and limited whereby the installation of the solar cell arrays is restricted and the installation operation is difficult.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is a case, in which a solar system is applied to a window system installed for lighting and ventilation of a building to supplement the disadvantage.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">That is, Korean Patent No. 10-0765965 discloses a window using solar cells.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A conventional window using solar cells will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a conventional window.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a conventional window <b>10</b> includes a solar cell array <b>11</b> that converts solar energy into electric energy, and a frame <b>11</b><i>a </i>coupled to a periphery of the solar cell array <b>11</b> and mounted in an opening <b>13</b> of a wall body <b>12</b> of the building.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">That is, the conventional window <b>10</b> has a structure, in which the solar cell array <b>11</b> is fixed to an inner central portion of the frame <b>11</b><i>a </i>having a rectangular shape, and an outer glass window located on an outer side of the wall body <b>12</b> of the building and an inner glass window located on an inner side thereof are disposed on a front side and a rear side of the solar cell array <b>11</b> to be spaced apart from the solar cell array <b>11</b> by a specific distance and are fixed.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Meanwhile, a device such as a blind or a vertical may be separately installed for privacy when most of the windows are installed, and costs therefor are not low.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this way, conventionally, the windows and the blinds are separately provided and thus costs or spaces are not efficient.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In recent years, methods for directly installing the blinds to the glass of the building for installation have been suggested.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">That is, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, it is manufactured by disposing a plurality of solar cells <b>21</b> implemented of crystalline or multi-crystalline between reinforced glass boards <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and attaching them by using EVS films <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Generally, a front surface of the conventional solar cell module <b>20</b> manufactured in this way has a blue color or a black color as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, and a rear surface thereof mostly has a gray color as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the conventional solar cell module <b>20</b>, two electrode lines of a width of 3 mm to 5 mm are formed of silver paste Ag through screen printing to form the electrode line <b>23</b><i>b </i>on a rear surface of the solar cell <b>21</b> and are dried in a roll conveyor employing an infrared (IR) lamp.
