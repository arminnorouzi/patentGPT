No. 63/216,627 filed Jun. 30, 2021, titled METHOD OF MANUFACTURING METAL-INSULATOR-METAL (MIM) CAPACITORS WITH NOBLE METAL ELECTRODE LINERS, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to design and manufacture of capacitors for use in electronics including in memory devices such as DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory), SRAM (Static Random Access Memory), and the like, and, more particularly, to manufacture of liners for electronic devices and to manufacture of metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors (often labeled &#x201c;MIMCAPS&#x201d;) with enhanced leakage current characteristics for use in memory and other electronic or computer devices.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">DRAM and other memory devices utilize capacitors to store bits of information within an integrated circuit, and, in brief, a capacitor is formed by placing a dielectric material between two electrodes formed of conductive materials. With reductions in sizes, DRAM devices often use MIM capacitors in which the electrode materials are metals. These electrode materials generally have higher conductivities than other electrode materials such as semiconductors and also have various work functions, have improved stability, and exhibit reduced depletion effects.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The electrode materials are chosen to have high conductivity to ensure fast device speeds, and MIMs also typically utilize insulating materials having a dielectric constant or k-value much higher than that of SiO2, with such dielectric materials being classified as high-k materials. Unfortunately, increasing the k-value can decrease the conduction band offset with respect to the metal electrode, which can lead to unwanted leakage current for a MIM device especially at high temperatures.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There remains a demand for MIM capacitor designs for use in DRAM and other devices with reduced leakage current. To this end, the electrodes have a strong impact in the leakage conduction in MIM capacitors. For example, electrodes can influence leakage currents in the following ways: (a) by directly injecting electrons over the conduction band of the dielectric materials, if the energy difference between the conduction band of the dielectric and the work function of the metal is too small; and (b) by scavenging oxygen from the dielectric materials, which generates oxygen vacancies and, thus, increases the trap density.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form. These concepts are described in further detail in the detailed description of example embodiments of the disclosure below. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In brief, a new metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor (MIMCAP) is described herein along with its method of manufacture or fabrication. The MIM capacitor includes a liner formed of a thin layer or film of a noble metal, which is only a few nanometers (nm) thick (e.g., a thickness in the range of about 0.5 nm to about 5 nm or more). In a finished device (e.g., a MIM capacitor), the noble metal liner is sandwiched between a thicker electrode and the insulator (e.g., a layer or thin film of high or ultra high-k material) so as to provide an interface layer between the electrode(s) and dielectric to limit leakage currents in the device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Disclosed herein, according to various embodiments, is a method of fabricating a semiconductor stack for use in metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors. The method may include providing a substrate and forming an electrode layer by depositing a layer of a conductive material (e.g., a metal) on the substrate. The method may further include, after the forming of the electrode layer, depositing a layer of a noble metal over the electrode layer, and then, after the deposition of the layer of the noble metal, forming a dielectric layer on the layer of the noble metal, whereby a liner is formed that is sandwiched between the electrode layer and the dielectric layer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some exemplary embodiments, the layer of the noble metal has a thickness of less than or equal to 5 nanometers (nm), e.g., in the range of about 0.5 to about 5 nm. To form the stack, the noble metal may be iridium (Ir), ruthenium (Ru), or platinum (Pt). The dielectric layer may take the form of a layer of a high-k or ultra-high-k dielectric material, with some useful examples providing the layer of a high-k or ultra-high-k dielectric material so that it includes at least one of hafnium oxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>), doped HfO<sub>2</sub>, hafnium zirconium oxide (HfZrO), and doped HfZrO. In these or other embodiments of the method, the conductive material may be a conductive metal, a conductive metal oxide, a conductive metal silicide, a conductive metal nitrides, or a combination thereof, with one useful implementation utilizing a conductive material including titanium nitride.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">To perform the method, the depositing of the layer of the noble metal may be performed using a cyclical deposition process including a plurality of cycles. In this cyclical deposition process, each of the cycles may include a precursor pulse and a reactant pulse, and the precursor pulse may involve exposing the electrode layer to a precursor while the reactant pulse may involve exposing the electrode layer to a reactant. This cyclical processing may be performed using atomic layer deposition (ALD) in some cases. This method or processing may be used to form a liner for MIM or other electrodes or electrode layers, with or without performance of the other stack fabrication steps discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The semiconductor stack may be formed with additional layers in some embodiments. Hence, the method may further include forming a second liner by depositing a layer of a second noble metal on a surface of dielectric layer opposite the first liner. Then, the method may include the step of forming a second electrode layer by depositing a layer of a second conductive material (e.g., a metal) on a surface of the second liner opposite the dielectric layer. In some embodiments, the first noble metal differs from the second noble metal, while other embodiments may utilize matching noble metals for the two liners of the stack. In these or other embodiments, the first liner may have a first thickness and the second liner may have a second thickness differing from the first thickness or being equal (or substantially so) to the first thickness.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For the purpose of summarizing the disclosure and the advantages achieved over the prior art, certain objects and advantages of the disclosure have been described herein above.

Typically, during each cycle the precursor is chemisorbed to a deposition surface (e.g., a substrate surface or a previously deposited underlying surface such as material from a previous ALD cycle), forming a monolayer or sub-monolayer that does not readily react with additional precursor (i.e., a self-limiting reaction). Thereafter, if necessary, a reactant (e.g., another precursor or reaction gas) may subsequently be introduced into the process chamber for use in converting the chemisorbed precursor to the desired material on the deposition surface. Typically, this reactant is capable of further reaction with the precursor. Further, purging steps may also be utilized during each cycle to remove excess precursor from the process chamber and/or remove excess reactant and/or reaction byproducts from the process chamber after conversion of the chemisorbed precursor. Further, the term &#x201c;atomic layer deposition,&#x201d; as used herein, is also meant to include processes designated by related terms such as, &#x201c;chemical vapor atomic layer deposition&#x201d;, &#x201c;atomic layer epitaxy&#x201d; (ALE), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), gas source MBE, or organometallic MBE, and chemical beam epitaxy when performed with alternating pulses of precursor composition(s), reactive gas, and purge (e.g., inert carrier) gas.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used herein, the term &#x201c;chemical vapor deposition&#x201d; (CVD) may refer to any process wherein a substrate is exposed to one or more volatile precursors, which react and/or decompose on a substrate surface to produce a desired deposition.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, the term &#x201c;film&#x201d; and &#x201c;thin film&#x201d; may refer to any continuous or non-continuous structures and material deposited by the methods disclosed herein. For example, &#x201c;film&#x201d; and &#x201c;thin film&#x201d; could include 2D materials, nanorods, nanotubes, or nanoparticles or even partial or full molecular layers or partial or full atomic layers or clusters of atoms and/or molecules. &#x201c;Film&#x201d; and &#x201c;thin film&#x201d; may comprise material or a layer with pinholes, but still be at least partially continuous.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As described in greater detail below, various details and embodiments of the disclosure may be utilized in conjunction with a reaction chamber configured for a multitude of deposition processes, including but not limited to, ALD, CVD, metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), physical vapor deposition (PVD), plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and plasma etching. The embodiments of the disclosure may also be utilized in semiconductor processing systems configured for depositing (providing or forming) layers or thin films of a MIM capacitor, which are known by (or yet to be developed by) those skilled in the arts.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The inventors recognized that the electrodes of a MIM capacitor can have a strong impact on leakage conduction. Instead of replacing a whole MIM capacitor electrode with a noble metal to control leakage conduction, the inventors created a method of fabricating a MIM capacitor with a noble metal liner sandwiched between an electrode and the insulator or dielectric. The noble metal liner may be formed using PVD, ALD, or other deposition process and be formed of a material chosen due to have a high work function such as iridium (Ir), ruthenium (Ru), platinum (Pt), or other noble metal. The electrode may be formed of titanium nitride (TiN) or other metal useful in a MIM capacitor while the insulator is typically formed of a high-k or ultra-high-k dielectric (e.g., hafnium oxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>), doped HfO<sub>2</sub>, hafnium zirconium oxide (HfZrO), doped HfZrO, or the like).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As one useful example, the MIM capacitor may include a liner (or liners) formed of a thin film of iridium, between an electrode and the dielectric material layer. Iridium has a work function of 5.27 eV and has a low oxygen scavenging potential for a noble metal. The thin film liner may be provided at a thickness of less than or equal to 5 nm such as between about 0.5 nm and about 5 nm, which is adequate to cap the electrode material and, thus, form a scavenging barrier and alter the effective work function of the whole or capped electrode. The noble metal may be provided as a thin film over the electrode (top or bottom electrode or first and second electrode of a MIM capacitor) using any useful deposition process with PVD and ALD being desirable in some MIM capacitor fabrication applications.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The new MIM capacitors are unique, in part, due to the introduction or use of a noble metal liner instead of replacing the whole electrode with noble metal. This new design has a number of advantages. First, noble metals can be very expensive. By using a thin (e.g., 0.5 to 5 nm) liner, the cost of using a noble metal in the MIM capacitor is greatly reduced when compared to using noble metal for the bulk electrode that may have a thickness of 20 nm or more. Second, only small process modifications are required when using a liner, as opposed to larger process modifications downstream and upstream for the whole electrode replacement. For example, in the case of etching the electrodes, the electrode metal can be etched as usual, and the liner can act as an etch stop layer. Then, a short, and different in some cases, etch cycle can be used to punch through the liner. Third, the use of noble metal liners allows capacitors to be designed so as to provide work function tuning, with less leakage through direct injection of carriers. Fourth, the liners provide capacitors with less oxygen scavenging, resulting in less leakage through trap density reduction. Fifth, the use of a noble metal liner prevents the oxidation of the bottom electrode, which is a source of equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) increase.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> describes a method <b>100</b> for fabricating a MIM capacitor or a capacitor stack (e.g., a DRAM capacitor stack). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that each of the layers discussed herein and used in a MIM capacitor or capacitor stack may be formed using any common formation techniques such ALD (or ALD-like process or other cyclical deposition process), PVD, or CVD that are useful for deposition of thin films or layers of materials described herein. Hence, the method <b>100</b> is intended to include any useful process for depositing the layers or thin films of the MIM capacitor or capacitor stacks shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>. The initial step <b>110</b> involves providing a substrate, which may have already received several processing steps useful in the manufacture of a full DRAM or other electronic device and may take the form of a silicon wafer or other useful substrate material(s).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The method <b>100</b> then includes at step <b>120</b> forming a first or bottom electrode layer above or on an upper surface of the substrate from step <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, the electrode is formed by depositing a thin film of a metal (such as titanium nitride (TiN)) through one of the deposition processes described above. The metal layer or element providing the bottom or first electrode may be formed of other metals, conductive metal oxides, conductive metal silicides, conductive metal nitrides, and combinations thereof. The purpose of the first or bottom electrode in a MIM capacitor or another device is often to serve as a primary conductor.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The next step <b>130</b> of method <b>100</b> includes forming a thin layer or film that acts as a liner for the electrode formed in step <b>120</b> (e.g., forming an electrode liner). This may involve depositing, with PVD, ALD, or another useful deposition technology, a layer or film of a noble metal over the upper or exposed surface of the electrode from step <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some implementations of the method <b>100</b>, step <b>130</b> (and/or step <b>150</b>) of forming the liner are completed using a cyclical deposition process including a plurality of cycles (such as, for example, ALD, an ALD-like process, or the like). Each cycle may include a precursor pulse and a reactant pulse, with the precursor pulse including exposing a substrate (e.g., the electrode for step <b>130</b> or the insulator/dielectric layer for step <b>150</b>) to a precursor while the reactant pulse includes exposing the same substrate to a reactant. This may be performed using suitable high k ALD processes as such are known in the art. For example, suitable noble metal ALD processes are, as such, described in scholarly literature, e.g. Aaltonen, Titta, et al. &#x201c;Atomic layer deposition of noble metals: Exploration of the low limit of the deposition temperature.&#x201d; Journal of materials research 19.11 (2004): 3353-3358 and the like. A number of advantageous precursor&#x2014;reactant combinations may be utilized and may include one or more of: Ir(acac)<sub>3</sub>, Ir(RCp)(CHD), Pt(acac)<sub>2</sub>, Pt(RCp)R<sub>3</sub>, PtR<sub>2</sub>-hexadiene, Pt(DDAP), Rh(acac)<sub>3 </sub>combined with O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, O-containing plasma, and O and H-containing plasma. R can be a suitable organic radical such as hydrocarbyl, aryl, alkyl, or alkenyl. Note that Cp stands for cyclopentadienyl, CHD stands for cyclohexadiene, acac stands for acetylacetonate, and DDAP stands for dimethyl(N,N-dimethyl-3-butene--1-amine-N). Typically, subsequent pulses and subsequent cycles are separated by purges, which are common and optional. In this regard, steps <b>130</b> and <b>150</b> may be implemented using super cycle processes, in which a super cycle includes a first cycle and a second cycle and where the first and second cycles employ different precursors and/or reactants. For example, alloys, stacks, and nanolaminates (which may be formed to provide liners as these are defined herein) can be made using such super cycle processes to form alloys, stacks, nanolaminates, or combinations thereof including one or more noble metals.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The precursors utilized may be selected to suit the particular deposition process and/or step. For example, when ALD processes are used in step <b>130</b> (and/or step <b>150</b>), the metal precursor may include a noble metal such as Ir, Pd, Rh or Pt. In some embodiments the noble metal can be Ru. Suitable noble metal precursors may be selected by the skilled artisan. In general, metal compounds where the metal is bound or coordinated to oxygen, nitrogen, carbon or a combination thereof are preferred. More preferably metallocene compounds, beta-diketonate compounds and acetamidinato compounds are used. In some embodiments, a cyclopentadienyl precursor compound is used, preferably a bis(ethylcyclopentadienyl) compound. More preferably betadiketonate compounds are used. In some embodiments, X(acac)<sub>3 </sub>or X(thd)y compounds are used, where X is a noble metal, y is generally, but not necessarily between 2 and 3 and thd is 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato and acac is 3,5-pentanedionato. In some embodiments, the noble metal precursors are organometalic compounds.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">When depositing iridium thin films, preferred metal precursors may be selected from the group consisting of iridium betadiketonate compounds, iridium cyclopentadienyl compounds, iridium carbonyl compounds and combinations thereof. The iridium precursor may also comprise one or more halide ligands. In preferred embodiments, the precursor comprises Ir(thd)<sub>3</sub>, (methylcyclopentadienyl)iridium(1,3-cyclohexadiene) (MeCp)Ir(CHD) or tris(acetylacetonato)iridium(III) and derivates of those.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">When depositing palladium films, preferred metal precursors include bis(hexafluoroacetylacetonate)palladium(II), Pd(acac)<sub>2</sub>, and bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)palladium(II) and derivates of those. When depositing platinum films, preferred metal precursors include (trimethyl)methylcyclopentadienylplatinum(IV), platinum(II)acetylacetonato, bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)platinum(II) and their derivatives. When depositing rhodium films, preferred metal precursors include rhodium(III)acetylacetonato, cyclopentadienyl compounds of Rh and derivates of those.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">When depositing ruthenium thin films, preferred metal precursors may comprise a compound that is selected from the group consisting of bis(cyclopentadienyl)ruthenium, tris(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)ruthenium, 2,4-(dimethylpentadienyl) (ethylcyclopentadienyl)ruthenium (Ru[(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(EtCp)]) and tris(N, N&#x2032;-diisopropylacetamidinato)ruthenium(III) and their derivatives, such as bis(N,N&#x2032;-diisopropylacetamidinato)ruthenium(II) dicarbonyl, bis(ethylcyclopentadienyl)ruthenium, bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)ruthenium and bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato) (1,5-cyclooctadiene)ruthenium(II). In preferred embodiments, the precursor is bis(ethylcyclopentadienyl) ruthenium (Ru[EtCp]<sub>2</sub>). Examples of ruthenium precursors include, but are not limited to, bis(ethylcyclopentadienyl)ruthenium (Ru(EtCp)<sub>2</sub>), C<b>6</b>H<b>8</b>Ru(CO)<sub>3</sub>, ruthenium octanedionate (Ru(OD)<sub>3</sub>), bis(cyclopentadienyl)ruthenium (Ru(Cp)<sub>2</sub>), RuO<sub>4</sub>, and ruthenium tetramethylheptadionate (Ru(thd)<sub>3</sub>). In one embodiment, an organometallic Ru precursor, particularly C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>Ru(CO)<sub>3</sub>, may be used as a ruthenium precursor.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The film or layer is &#x201c;thin&#x201d; in that it has a thickness less than or equal to 5 nm with some embodiments of method <b>100</b> depositing a layer of noble metal in the range of 1 to 5 nm. A variety of noble metals may be deposited in step <b>130</b> to form the electrode liner, with iridium being desirable in some exemplary applications with its work function of 5.27 eV and its low oxygen scavenging potential among the noble metals working to provide a scavenging barrier and alter the effective work function of the electrode formed in step <b>120</b>. In other cases, a noble metal may be selected with a work function greater than about 5 eV. In some implementations of the method <b>100</b>, the metal deposited in step <b>130</b> (and/or step <b>150</b>) is iridium (Ir), ruthenium (Ru), platinum (Pt), or other noble metal.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The method <b>100</b> continues with step <b>140</b> with forming an insulator or dielectric layer on or over the exposed, upper surface of the liner formed in step <b>130</b>. Again, any useful and well-known deposition technology may be used for step <b>140</b>. Suitably, step <b>140</b> can include forming a metal oxide containing layer by means of an ALD processes. Suitable ALD processes include a sequence of exposing the substrate to a metal precursor, exposing the substrate to a purge gas, exposing the substrate to an oxygen reactant, and exposing the substrate to a purge gas. Suitable metal precursors include metalorganic precursors and halides, and are known as such in the art. Suitable oxygen reactants include oxygen-containing gasses such as O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The dielectric layer may be formed by a process that includes depositing a high-k or ultra-high k dielectric material such as hafnium oxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>), doped HfO<sub>2</sub>, hafnium zirconium oxide (HfZrO), doped HfZrO, or the like. In some cases, the dielectric layer comprises a high-k metal oxide material such as titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, aluminum oxide, barium-strontium-titanate, erbium oxide, hafnium silicate, lanthanum oxide, niobium oxide, lead-zirconium-titanate, strontium titanate, tantalum oxide, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, or other high-k or ultra-high-k metal oxide (e.g., with k-values greater than about 40).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Next, step <b>150</b> of method <b>100</b> includes forming a thin layer or film that acts as a liner for top or second electrode to be later formed in step <b>160</b> (e.g., forming another electrode liner). This may involve depositing, with PVD, ALD, or another useful deposition technology, a layer or film of a noble metal over the upper or exposed surface of the dielectric layer from step <b>140</b>. In some embodiments, ALD is utilized to make use of its advantages that include: (a) better conformality, i.e. even layer thickness everywhere, even on sidewalls; and (b) ALD is essential for 3D RAM structures in which the capacitors are stacked sideways on top of each other, whereas PVD, which is a line-of-sight deposition technique, is useless for making such structures. As with the film formed in step <b>130</b>, the film or layer is &#x201c;thin&#x201d; in that it has a thickness less than or equal to 5 nm with some embodiments of method <b>100</b> depositing a layer of noble metal in the range of 0.5 to 5 nm. The thickness of the second liner formed in step <b>150</b> may be equal to or differ from that of the liner formed instep <b>130</b> to achieve desired results in a particular application (e.g., a desired overall work function or scavenging barrier). A variety of noble metals may be deposited in step <b>150</b> to form the top or second electrode liner, and the same noble metal may be used for the two liners or the noble material may differ to suit a particular MIM capacitor design. In some cases, though, iridium is used for the top or second liner due to its work function of 5.27 eV and its low oxygen scavenging potential among the noble metals working to provide a scavenging barrier and alter the effective work function of the electrode formed in later step <b>160</b>. In other cases, a noble metal may be selected with a work function greater than about 5 eV. In some implementations of the method <b>100</b>, the metal deposited in step <b>150</b> is iridium (Ir), ruthenium (Ru), platinum (Pt), or other noble metal.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The method <b>100</b> then includes at step <b>160</b> forming a second or top electrode layer above or on an upper surface of the liner from step <b>150</b>. In one embodiment, the electrode is formed by depositing a thin film of a metal (such as titanium nitride (TiN)) through one of the deposition processes described above. The metal layer or element providing the top or second electrode may be formed of other metals, conductive metal oxides, conductive metal silicides, conductive metal nitrides, and combinations thereof. The metal deposited in step <b>160</b> to form the thin film providing the top or second electrode may be the same or differ from that deposited in step <b>120</b> to form the first or bottom electrode. The method <b>100</b> may include additional steps (not shown). For example, in the case of etching the electrodes, the electrode conductive material (e.g., a metal) can be etched as usual, i.e., using an etch chemistry adapted for etching the bulk electrode, and the liner can act as an etch stop layer. Then, a short, and different in some cases, etch cycle can be used to punch through the liner as part of the capacitor fabrication.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a simplified cross-sectional view of a portion of a MIM capacitor or capacitor stack <b>200</b> fabricated in accordance with some embodiments of the present description such as with the method <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

In the above description, certain terms may be used such as &#x201c;up,&#x201d; &#x201c;down,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;horizontal,&#x201d; &#x201c;vertical,&#x201d; &#x201c;left,&#x201d; &#x201c;right,&#x201d; and the like. These terms are used, where applicable, to provide some clarity of description when dealing with relative relationships. But, these terms are not intended to imply absolute relationships, positions, and/or orientations. For example, with respect to an object, an &#x201c;upper&#x201d; surface can become a &#x201c;lower&#x201d; surface simply by turning the object over. Nevertheless, it is still the same object.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Additionally, instances in this specification where one element is &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; to another element can include direct and indirect coupling. Direct coupling can be defined as one element coupled to and in some contact with another element. Indirect coupling can be defined as coupling between two elements not in direct contact with each other, but having one or more additional elements between the coupled elements. Further, as used herein, securing one element to another element can include direct securing and indirect securing. Additionally, as used herein, &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; does not necessarily denote contact. For example, one element can be adjacent another element without being in contact with that element.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Although exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure are set forth herein, it should be appreciated that the disclosure is not so limited.
