Taking tuna as an example, the fish fillets detached from the skeleton, and in particular from the backbone/central bone, show an inhomogeneous muscle structure. This means that there are different proportions of meat and muscle. In addition to the &#x201c;normal&#x201d; muscle meat, which is usually light-coloured, the fish fillets also have a region of dark muscle meat starting from the region of the (removed) central bone towards the skin side. The dark muscle meat, the so-called red meat, is of inferior quality in terms of taste such that it should be removed as completely as possible.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The region of the central bone divides the fish fillet into a notional dorsal-side partial fillet and a ventral-side partial fillet. In other words, the region of the fish fillet which extends upwards, starting from the central bone towards the dorsal fins, is referred to as the dorsal-side partial fillet, while the region of the fish fillet which extends downwards, starting from the central bone towards the abdominal cavity, is referred to as the ventral-side partial fillet. The term &#x201c;fish fillet&#x201d; refers not only to such products which no longer have any bones at all but also, in particular, to such products in which at least the central bone is removed so that the strip of red meat on the side directed away from the skin side is exposed. Accordingly, the fish fillets are processed with the skin side down.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The spread of the red meat, however, also referred to as dark meat, within the fish fillet makes it impossible to remove it with common cutting apparatuses in which, for example, two circular knives set in a V-shape to each other cut a V-shaped strip from the fish fillet. The spread of the red meat actually deviates from a classic V-shape and varies from fish fillet to fish fillet. Accordingly, a simple V-cut results either in red meat remaining in the fish fillet or light muscle meat being removed in addition to the red meat. In other words, the processing results when removing the red meat with common cutting apparatuses are not accepted due to the yield losses on the one hand and the error rates on the other hand, such that the processing of tuna or comparable species has previously been carried out manually when removing the red meat.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To make it easier for people to remove the red meat, the products to be processed are cooked before processing. Cooking brings about a colour change to the effect that the &#x201c;normal&#x201d; muscle meat becomes (even) light(er), while the dark red meat becomes even darker (almost black). The colour change enables the person to differentiate better between the structures and the meat contents, and in particular to identify the spread of the red meat better within the product. However, the manual removal of the red meat from the fish fillet has various disadvantages. On the one hand, manual removal is very time-consuming and therefore cost-intensive, especially as cooking necessitates an additional and time-intensive work step. On the other hand, manual removal leads to yield losses. In addition, the cutting result depends substantially on the experience and skill of the person who processes the product.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object of the invention is therefore to create an arrangement which ensures automatic removal of the strip of red meat from fish fillets reliably and with optimised yield. The object of the invention is also to create a corresponding method.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This object is achieved by an arrangement of the type referred to hereinbefore, in that it is characterised by a conveying unit for transporting the fish fillet to be processed from an inlet area of the fish fillet into the arrangement to an outlet area of the fish fillet out of the arrangement in transport direction T along a transport path and, starting from the inlet area in the direction of the outlet area successively along the transport path, a first means for detecting red meat in the fish fillet to be processed, a first cutting apparatus for removing a middle, central partial strip of red meat from the fish fillet, a means for opening up the fish fillet freed from the middle partial strip in such a manner that the cut surfaces of a ventral-side partial strip of red meat still attached to the fish fillet and of a dorsal-side partial strip of red meat still attached to the fish fillet, which are produced by the first cutting apparatus, point upwards away from the conveying unit, a cutting unit for removing the ventral-side and the dorsal-side partial strip of red meat from the fish fillet, the cutting unit comprising a second cutting apparatus for removing the ventral-side partial strip and a third cutting apparatus for removing the dorsal-side partial strip, as well as a control device, at least the means for detecting red meat and the three cutting apparatuses being connected to the control device in such a manner that all cuts can be made based on the data and/or information determined by the means for detecting red meat. Due to the arrangement according to the invention, it is possible to free fish fillet containing red meat, in particular tuna fillet, efficiently and precisely from red meat by machine. Due to the three cutting apparatuses arranged one behind the other in transport direction T, the strip of red meat to be removed can be cut out of the fish fillet step by step, in that a first incision goes into the depth, towards the skin side of the fish fillet which is lying flat with the skin side on the conveying unit and the second and third incisions go mainly into the ventral region or into the dorsal region respectively, as the means for opening up or unfolding the fish fillet brings the partial fillets, i.e. the ventral-side section and the dorsal-side section of the fish fillet, into a position which allows the second and third cutting apparatus to penetrate the fish fillets, virtually parallel to the skin side. This allows the strips of red meat to be removed individually for each fish fillet, independently of the particular spread of the red meat within the fish fillet. Furthermore, this can also be used in particular to process raw, i.e. uncooked fish.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a preferred development of the invention, in transport direction T a second means for detecting the remaining red meat in the fish fillet to be processed is arranged between the means for opening up the fish fillet and the cutting unit, wherein the second means for detecting red meat is also connected to the control device. This allows the second and third cutting apparatus to be controlled even more precisely with regard to their incision. After the first cut and the removal of a first partial strip of red meat, the second means for detecting the remaining red meat detects the exact spread of the remaining red meat in the ventral region and in the dorsal region so that complete and yield-optimised removal of the red meat is improved.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Advantageously, in transport direction T, a handling device for automatically aligning the fish fillet to be processed on the conveying unit is arranged between the first means for detecting red meat, which is arranged in the inlet area, and the second cutting apparatus for removing the middle, central partial strip, the handling device also being connected to the control device. Due to the handling device, each fish fillet to be processed can be optimally orientated in relation to the first cutting apparatus regarding alignment of the strip of red meat in order to optimise the cutting result of the first cutting apparatus.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A preferred embodiment is characterised in that the handling device comprises a robotic mechanism, e.g. a delta kinematics mechanism, with an alignment tool. With this embodiment, the fish fillets can be moved, and in particular also rotated, virtually freely in all directions which ensures individual and precise positioning of the fish fillet with a strip of red meat lying centrally on the conveying unit and aligned substantially parallel to transport direction T before the first cut, regardless of the starting location/starting position of the particular fish fillet on the conveying unit.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first cutting apparatus preferably comprises two circular knives set in a V-shape at a fixed angle to each other and drive means for the circular knives, the two circular knives being designed to be vertically and horizontally adjustable. This ensures simple but nevertheless precise and efficient removal of the middle, central partial strip of red meat.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Especially preferably, the first cutting apparatus is arranged on a robotic mechanism, e.g. a delta kinematics mechanism, by means of which the position of the first cutting apparatus relative to the conveying unit is adjustable at least vertically and horizontally, the robotic mechanism also being connected to the control device. Particularly in combination with the handling device, this ensures optimum alignment of the fish fillets with the circular knives and of the circular knives with the fish fillets for precise incision.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Expediently, the second and the third cutting apparatus each comprise two circular knives set in a V-shape to each other as well as drive means for the circular knives. With this embodiment, the ventral-side and the dorsal-side partial strips of red meat can be removed particularly efficiently and precisely.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A particularly advantageous embodiment is characterised in that the second and the third cutting apparatus each has a knife carrier to which two knife units are assigned, each knife unit comprising a circular knife and a drive means for rotationally driving the circular knife about a central axis of rotation M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, the two circular knives being set substantially in a V-shape to each other in a position enclosing an angle &#x3b1; and it being possible to set the size of the angle &#x3b1; by an adjustable arrangement of the knife units on the knife carrier, the offset of the two central axes of rotation M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2 </sub>to each other being equal to zero in transport direction T and the two knife units being designed and configured to be adjustable exclusively synchronously with each other. This means that each cutting apparatus can be adjusted and adapted to the individual spread of the red meat in the ventral-side and dorsal-side section to ensure yield-efficient removal of the partial strips and prevents incorrect incisions.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The second and the third cutting apparatus are preferably arranged one behind the other in transport direction T and each on a robotic mechanism, e.g. a delta kinematics mechanism, the robotic mechanisms also being connected to the control device. With the robotic mechanism, the cutting apparatuses can be optimally positioned in relation to the fish fillets to be processed before and during cutting for improved incision.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">An especially preferred development is characterised in that the conveying unit comprises a plurality of conveying elements, a first conveying element in the region of the first cutting apparatus being a rotationally driven double belt with a gap running centrally and parallel to the transport direction T, while a second conveying element in the region of the cutting unit is a rotationally driven segment chain which is triangular in cross-section. With this embodiment of the conveying unit, said conveying unit is adapted to the relevant cutting apparatuses in such a manner that the fish fillets are each placed in an optimum location/position in relation to the cutting apparatus.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Advantageously, the double belt and the segment chain form a continuous conveying unit along the transport path in transport direction T, the segment chain engaging in the double belt from below through the gap, at least in the transition region from the double belt to the segment chain, for transferring the fish fillets from the double belt. In the transition region, the fish fillet is thus in contact with the double belt on the one hand and the segment chain on the other hand. This ensures continuous conveying of the fish fillets through the entire arrangement.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Especially preferably, the segment chain forms the means for opening up the fish fillets. This eliminates the need for additional means for opening up or unfolding. The dual function of the segment chain as conveying means and means for opening up ensures simple but nevertheless reliable positioning of the fish fillets below the second and third cutting apparatus. The segment chain, which is at least partly triangular in cross-section, causes the partial fillets to fold so far to the side and downwards by the force of gravity alone on leaving the double belt that the cut surfaces formed by the first cut still point upwards or at least obliquely upwards so that the second and the third cutting apparatus can penetrate into the ventral region or the dorsal region respectively&#x2014;substantially parallel to the skin side&#x2014;i.e. into a region in which the first cutting apparatus cannot penetrate or cannot penetrate without loss of yield.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Advantageously, the segment chain has spike-like protrusions, on its upper side pointing in the direction of the cutting unit, for fastening the fish fillets on the segment chain. This ensures additional fastening of the fish fillets on the segment chain, as a result of which the fish fillets are secured against slipping on the segment chain and can be transported accurately positioned. Another effect of the spike-like protrusions is that they assist the partial fillets to bend on both sides of the segment chain, which is triangular or more accurately roof-shaped in cross-section, i.e. they help to open up the fish fillets.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a preferred development, devices for holding the fish down are assigned to the segment chain at least in the region of the cutting unit, in such a manner that the opened up fish fillets can be fastened on both sides of the segment chain, between device for holding the fish down and segment chain, at least when removing the ventral-side and dorsal-side partial strips. Due to transporting the fish fillets in transport direction T, the fish fillets or the partial fillets hanging down on both sides of the segment chain thread between the segment chain, which supports from below, and the device for holding the fish down, which holds from above, as a result of which the partial fillets are held securely and precisely during cutting. Together with the segment chain, the devices for holding the fish down thus ultimately form the means for opening up or they assist the segment chain at least during the opening up process, as they reliably hold the partial fillets in the spread position.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, fastening means are provided in the region of the double belt, in such a manner that the fish fillet can be fastened on the double belt at least when removing the middle, central partial strip. In other words, the fish fillet lying with the skin side flat on the double belt is optionally pressed against the double belt from above and/or sucked onto the double belt from below.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an especially preferred development, a second cutting unit, corresponding to the first cutting unit, is arranged downstream of said first cutting unit, which comprises the second and third cutting apparatus, in transport direction T, the second cutting unit also being connected to the control device. In other words, the cutting unit is duplicated so that two incisions for removing the ventral-side partial strip can be made successively in each case and two incisions for removing the dorsal-side partial strip can be made in each case. On the one hand, this allows the processing speed to be increased. On the other hand, the accuracy when removing the strip of red meat from a fish fillet is improved.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Expediently, a third means for detecting red meat is arranged downstream of the first cutting unit and upstream of the second cutting unit in transport direction T, the third means for detecting red meat also being connected to the control device. This embodiment also improves the cutting accuracy and thus the processing result.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A preferred embodiment is characterised in that suction means for extracting the removed partial strips are arranged in the region of each cutting apparatus. As a result of this development, the cutting region is always freed of partial strips or parts that have already been removed, which particularly improves the detection of (remaining) red meat by downstream means for detecting red meat.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The object is achieved by a method which is characterised by the following steps: automatically transporting the fish fillet to be processed along a transport path from an inlet area to an outlet area in transport direction T by means of a conveying unit, automatically detecting the red meat in the fish fillet to be processed using a means for detecting red meat, automatically cutting a middle, central partial strip of red meat from the fish fillet using a first cutting apparatus, automatically opening up the fish fillet freed from the middle, central partial strip using a means for opening up, in such a manner that the cut surfaces of a ventral-side partial strip of red meat still attached to the fish fillet and a dorsal-side partial strip of red meat still attached to the fish fillet, which are formed when removing the middle, central partial strip, point upwards away from the conveying unit, automatically cutting the ventral-side and dorsal-side partial strip from the fish fillet using a second and a third cutting apparatus, the cutting apparatuses being controlled using a control device based on the data and/or information determined by the means for detecting red meat.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferably, the strip of red meat is automatically cut from the fish fillet in at least three steps, first the middle, central partial strip being cut from the fish fillet and subsequently first the ventral-side partial strip and then the dorsal-side partial strip or first the dorsal-side partial strip and then the ventral-side partial strip of red meat being cut from the fish fillet. The order in which the cuts are made for removing the ventral-side partial strip and for removing the dorsal-side partial strip is arbitrary.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Advantageously, the cutting, first of the ventral-side partial strip and then the dorsal-side partial strip or vice versa, is repeated in a fourth and fifth step by additional cutting apparatuses along the transport path, the red meat in the fish fillet to be processed being automatically detected again before the fourth and fifth step using a means for detecting red meat. In other words, the second and the third cut are each repeated at least once, if necessary twice or several times, in order to improve the accuracy by repeating the process, each time with renewed and thus more precise detection of the red meat still located in the fish fillet.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, each fish fillet is fastened on the conveying unit during cutting of the partial strip.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Especially preferably, all cuts of all partial strips are made by circular knives set in a V-shape to each other.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Optionally, the partial strips removed by cutting are extracted by suction.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Especially preferably, the method is carried out using an arrangement as disclosed above.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further advantages arising from this have already been described in connection with the arrangement, which is why reference will be made to the relevant passages to avoid repetitions.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further expedient and/or advantageous features and developments of the arrangement and the method are disclosed herein.

The invention is described using the example of the tuna which has the dark meat to be removed. However, the invention is equally applicable to other fish species which have a strip of red meat (dark meat) in their fish fillet in addition to the &#x201c;normal&#x201d; muscle meat. These are in particular such fish species which have this special muscle structure due to their characteristic of covering long distances.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">To facilitate better understanding, the muscle structure of a tuna or a fish fillet <b>10</b> and of comparable species will first be explained based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a single fish fillet <b>10</b> of a tuna with two fillets. The single fish fillet <b>10</b> still has a central bone <b>11</b> in the illustration. Starting from the central bone <b>11</b>, the dorsal-side partial fillet <b>12</b> extends upwards towards a dorsal fin which is not shown. Starting from the central bone <b>11</b>, the ventral-side partial fillet <b>14</b> extends downwards towards an abdominal cavity <b>13</b> (only indicated). The skin side <b>15</b> of the fish fillet <b>10</b> is located on the side opposite the central bone <b>11</b>. The fish fillet <b>10</b> consists mainly of &#x201c;normal&#x201d; light muscle meat <b>16</b>. However, starting from the central bone <b>11</b>, a partially asymmetrical strip <b>17</b> of red meat extends towards the skin side <b>15</b>. This strip <b>17</b> has an individual spread within the muscle meat <b>16</b> for each fish fillet <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the fish fillet <b>10</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> without the central bone <b>11</b>, the fish fillet <b>10</b> lying on the skin side <b>15</b>. As a result, the strip <b>17</b> of red meat points upwards, the strip <b>17</b> being oriented substantially in transport direction T in the longitudinal direction of the fish fillet <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The arrangement <b>18</b> illustrated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> onwards is designed and configured for automatically removing a strip <b>17</b> consisting of red meat, the so-called dark meat, from a fish fillet <b>10</b>. This arrangement <b>18</b> is characterised according to the invention in that it is characterised by a conveying unit <b>19</b> for transporting the fish fillet <b>10</b> to be processed from an inlet area E of the fish fillet <b>10</b> into the arrangement <b>18</b> to an outlet area A of the fish fillet <b>10</b> out of the arrangement <b>18</b> in transport direction T along a transport path and, starting from the inlet area E in the direction of the outlet area A successively along the transport path, a first means <b>20</b> for detecting red meat in the fish fillet to be processed <b>10</b>, a first cutting apparatus <b>21</b> for removing a middle, central partial strip of red meat from the fish fillet <b>10</b>, a means <b>22</b> for opening up the fish fillet <b>10</b> freed from the middle partial strip in such a manner that the cut surfaces F<sub>1 </sub>and F<sub>2 </sub>of a ventral-side partial strip of red meat still attached to the fish fillet <b>10</b> and of a dorsal-side partial strip of red meat still attached to the fish fillet <b>10</b>, which are produced by the first cutting apparatus <b>21</b>, point upwards away from the conveying unit <b>19</b>, a cutting unit <b>23</b> for removing the ventral-side and the dorsal-side partial strip of red meat from the fish fillet <b>10</b>, the cutting unit <b>23</b> comprising a second cutting apparatus <b>24</b> for removing the ventral-side partial strip and a third cutting apparatus <b>25</b> for removing the dorsal-side partial strip, as well as a control device <b>26</b>, at least the means <b>20</b> for identifying red meat and the three cutting apparatuses <b>21</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> being connected to the control device <b>26</b>, in such a manner that all cuts can be made based on the data and/or information determined by the means <b>20</b> for detecting red meat.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">When taken on their own or in combination with each other, the features and developments described below illustrate preferred embodiments. It is expressly pointed out that features which are summarised in the claims and/or the description and/or the drawing or are described in a common embodiment can also further develop the arrangement <b>18</b> described above in a functionally independent manner.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The conveying unit <b>19</b> comprises drive means, not explicitly shown, for rotational and preferably continuous drive. The drive means are preferably also connected to the control device <b>26</b>. The first means <b>20</b> for detecting red meat may, for example, comprise a camera.

In other words, the second means <b>27</b> for detecting red meat is located between the first cutting apparatus <b>21</b> and the cutting unit <b>23</b>. The second means <b>27</b> for detecting red meat is designed and configured in line with the first means <b>20</b> for detecting red meat.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an enlarged view of the inlet area E of the fish fillet <b>10</b>. The conveying unit <b>19</b> comprises a plurality of conveying elements, a first conveying element <b>28</b> in the region of the first cutting apparatus <b>21</b> being a rotationally driven double belt <b>29</b> with a gap <b>30</b> running centrally and parallel to the transport direction T, while a second conveying element <b>31</b> in the region of the cutting unit <b>23</b> is a rotationally driven segment chain <b>32</b> which is triangular in cross-section. The double belt <b>29</b> may be made up of two completely separate belts with separate guiding and drive elements. In other embodiments, two partial belts may be arranged at a distance from each other on the same guiding and drive elements. The gap <b>30</b> may extend over a part of the length of the double belt <b>29</b> or over the entire length of the double belt <b>29</b>, the gap <b>30</b> oriented in the transport direction T being arranged centrally in all embodiments, in such a manner that the gap <b>30</b> divides the double belt <b>29</b> symmetrically. In particular, in the event that the gap <b>30</b> extends over the entire length of the double belt <b>29</b>, the gap <b>30</b> may be covered at least partially by a cover element <b>33</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The segment chain <b>32</b> is arranged overlapping the double belt <b>29</b>. This means that the segment chain <b>32</b> along the transport path already starts before the double belt <b>29</b> ends, so that each fish fillet <b>10</b> in the overlap region is both located on the double belt <b>29</b> and is also supported by the segment chain <b>32</b>. In the overlap region, the cover element <b>33</b> also has a gap <b>34</b> which allows the segment chain <b>32</b> to project, at least with its tips <b>35</b> of the individual segments <b>36</b> upwardly directed towards the cutting apparatus <b>21</b>, through the gap <b>30</b> of the double belt <b>29</b> and the gap <b>34</b> of the covering element <b>33</b> beyond the plane defined by the double belt <b>29</b> (in relation to the surface of the double belt <b>29</b>). In other embodiments, the segment chain <b>32</b> may itself lie with its tips <b>35</b> in or below the plane defined by the double belt <b>29</b>. The double belt <b>29</b> and the segment chain <b>32</b> are individually controllable by means of the control device <b>26</b>. Preferably, the double belt <b>29</b> and the segment chain <b>32</b> are synchronously controllable by means of the control device <b>26</b>, in such a manner that they are driven, for example, at the same drive speed.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In transport direction T, a handling device <b>37</b> for automatically aligning the fish fillet <b>10</b> to be processed on the conveying unit <b>19</b> is arranged between the first means <b>20</b> for detecting red meat, which is arranged in the inlet area E, and the second cutting apparatus <b>21</b> for removing the middle, central partial strip, said conveying unit being arranged in the example on the double belt <b>29</b>, and the handling device <b>37</b> also being connected to the control device <b>26</b>. The handling device <b>37</b> preferably comprises a robotic mechanism, e.g. a delta kinematics mechanism, with an alignment tool which is not explicitly shown. The alignment tool may comprise, for example, gripping and/or suction means, using which the fish fillet <b>10</b> can be offset on the double belt <b>29</b> in transport direction T and in particular transversely to transport direction T and, above all, can also be rotated about a vertical axis so that the strip <b>17</b> of red meat is located at least partially, but preferably completely, centrally in the region of the gap <b>30</b>. Especially preferably, the alignment tool may comprise, for example, a plunger or the like by means of which the fish fillet <b>10</b> can be moved and/or rotated while lying on the double belt <b>29</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The handling device <b>37</b> is particularly designed and configured to automatically align the fish fillets <b>10</b> on the double belt <b>29</b>, in such a manner that the fish fillets <b>10</b> are pre-positioned on the segment chain <b>32</b> with regard to their location/position.

It may be possible to adjust the circular knives <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> manually or automatically. Especially preferably, the first cutting apparatus <b>21</b> is arranged on a robotic mechanism <b>42</b>, e.g. a parallel kinematics mechanism, by means of which the position of the first cutting apparatus <b>21</b> relative to the conveying unit <b>19</b>, thus in the example relative to the double belt <b>29</b>, is adjustable at least vertically and horizontally, the robotic mechanism <b>42</b> also being connected to the control device <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Optionally, fastening means <b>43</b> are provided in the region of the double belt <b>29</b>, in such a manner that the fish fillet <b>10</b> can be fastened on the double belt <b>29</b> at least when removing the middle, central partial strip. In the embodiment illustrated, for example, a pressure roller <b>44</b> is provided which is arranged in transport direction T upstream of the cutting apparatus <b>21</b> above the double belt <b>29</b> and is aligned transversely to transport direction T and presses the fish fillet <b>10</b> onto the double belt <b>29</b> from above. A corresponding pressure roller <b>44</b> or another means for holding fish down may also be arranged alternatively or additionally in transport direction T downstream of the cutting apparatus <b>21</b>. Suction units may also be used as fastening means <b>43</b>, using which the fish fillet <b>10</b> is sucked onto the double belt <b>29</b> from below. The or each pressure roller <b>44</b> or the like may be actively driven. The corresponding drive means may be connected to the control device <b>26</b>. The or each pressure roller <b>44</b> is preferably driven synchronously with the double belt <b>29</b> with regard to the drive speed.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The double belt <b>29</b> and the segment chain <b>32</b> form a continuous conveying unit <b>19</b> along the transport path in transport direction T, the segment chain <b>32</b>&#x2014;as described above&#x2014;engaging in the double belt <b>29</b> from below through the gap <b>30</b>, at least in the transition region &#xdc; from the double belt <b>29</b> to the segment chain <b>32</b>, for transferring the fish fillets <b>10</b> from the double belt <b>29</b>. The segment chain <b>32</b> is made up of a plurality of segments <b>36</b>. Each segment <b>36</b> is triangular or roof-shaped in cross-section (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>8</b></figref>). On the upper side pointing in the direction of the cutting apparatuses <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, each segment <b>36</b> preferably has a spike-like protrusion <b>45</b>. In other embodiments, it is possible for only a few of segments <b>36</b> to have such a protrusion <b>45</b>, each protrusion <b>45</b> having possibly only a roughened surface or any other means for holding or penetrating the fish fillet <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Due to its shape and design, the segment chain <b>32</b> optionally forms the means <b>22</b> for opening up the fish fillets <b>10</b>. On the double belt <b>29</b>, the fish fillets <b>10</b> lie with their skin side <b>15</b> flat on the double belt <b>29</b>. As a result of the fish fillets <b>10</b> being transferred by the segment chain <b>32</b>, the partial fillets <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> drop&#x2014;assisted by removal of the middle, central partial strip of red meat&#x2014;to the side and downwards after leaving the double belt <b>29</b>, so that the partial fillets <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, which are still connected to each other, lie with their skin side <b>15</b> on the surfaces <b>46</b>, <b>47</b>, running obliquely downwards, of the segments <b>36</b>, as a result of which the cut surfaces F<sub>1 </sub>and F<sub>2 </sub>are brought from a position facing each other into a position in which the cut surfaces F<sub>1 </sub>and F<sub>2 </sub>are directed further upwards in the direction of the cutting apparatuses <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> (see in particular <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). Other means <b>22</b> for opening up the fish fillets <b>10</b> can also be used additionally and separately to the segment chain <b>32</b>.

Along the transport path, first of all a means <b>20</b> for detecting red meat automatically detects the red meat in the fish fillet <b>10</b> to be processed. Subsequently, a middle, central partial strip of red meat is automatically cut from the fish fillet <b>10</b> using a first cutting apparatus <b>21</b>. After the first cut, the fish fillet <b>10</b> freed from the middle, central partial strip using a means <b>22</b> for opening up is automatically opened up, in such a manner that the cut surfaces F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2 </sub>of a ventral-side partial strip of red meat still attached to the fish fillet <b>10</b> and a dorsal-side partial strip of red meat still attached to the fish fillet <b>10</b>, which are formed when removing the middle, central partial strip, point upwards away from the conveying unit <b>19</b>, In the opened position, the ventral-side and dorsal-side partial strips are automatically cut from the fish fillet <b>10</b> using a second and a third cutting apparatus <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>. To execute the automated cuts for removing all three partial strips from the fish fillet <b>10</b>, the cutting apparatuses <b>21</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> are controlled using a control device <b>26</b> based on the data and/or information determined by the means <b>20</b> for detecting red meat.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Preferably, the data and/or information from the drive means for the conveying unit <b>19</b> is also used when controlling the cutting apparatuses <b>21</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>. The multi-stage removal of the entire strip <b>17</b> of red meat is in the foreground of the method according to the invention. The strip <b>17</b> of red meat is automatically cut from the fish fillet <b>10</b> in at least three steps, first the middle, central partial strip being cut from the fish fillet <b>10</b> and subsequently first the ventral-side partial strip and then the dorsal-side partial strip or first the dorsal-side partial strip and then the ventral-side partial strip of red meat being cut from the fish fillet.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Optionally, before the first cut, a handling device <b>37</b> is used to automatically bring the fish fillet <b>10</b> into the optimum position in relation to the cutting apparatus <b>21</b>, in which position the strip <b>17</b> to be removed is located at least predominantly centrally in the region of a gap <b>30</b> of a double belt <b>29</b> and in its longitudinal extension is aligned substantially parallel to transport direction T. To do this, the handling device <b>37</b> is controlled by the control device <b>26</b>. In the first automatic cut, the fish fillet <b>10</b> is preferably held on the double belt <b>29</b> using a fastening means <b>43</b> or is pressed onto and/or sucked onto said double belt. After the first cut, the fish fillet <b>10</b> is transferred from the double belt <b>29</b> by a segment chain <b>32</b> of the conveying unit <b>19</b>, the fish fillet <b>10</b> automatically opening after leaving the double belt <b>29</b> on the segment chain <b>32</b>&#x2014;preferably by the force of gravity alone&#x2014;in that the two partial fillets <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> fold sideways and downwards. Optionally, however, the partial fillets <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may also be brought into an opened position actively.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">After the first cut by the cutting apparatus <b>21</b> and before the second cut by the cutting apparatus <b>24</b>, the residual/remaining red meat is preferably automatically detected again in the fish fillet <b>10</b> to be processed using a means <b>27</b> for detecting red meat. In the second and third automatic cut, the fish fillet <b>10</b> is preferably held on the segment chain <b>32</b> by means of devices <b>48</b>, <b>49</b> for holding the fish down. The cutting apparatuses <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>, just as the cutting apparatus <b>21</b>, may be directly controlled. Preferably, however, the cutting apparatuses <b>21</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> are controlled by the control device <b>26</b> via a robotic mechanism <b>42</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>69</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">All cuts are preferably made with circular knives <b>38</b>, <b>39</b>; <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>; <b>56</b>, <b>57</b> arranged in pairs, which are set in a V-shape at an angle to each other. The second and the third cut at least can also be made with a Whizard knife. Preferably, the cutting, first of the ventral-side partial strip and then the dorsal-side partial strip or vice versa, is repeated in a fourth and fifth cut by additional cutting apparatuses along the transport path, the red meat in the fish fillet <b>10</b> to be processed being automatically detected again before the fourth and fifth cut using a means <b>71</b> for detecting red meat. Preferably, the partial strips removed by automatic cutting are automatically extracted by suction.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Especially preferably, the method is carried out using an arrangement <b>18</b> according to one or more of claims <b>1</b> to <b>18</b>.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
