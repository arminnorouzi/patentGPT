More particularly, the present invention relates to a controller intended to control the release of energy from a combustion of biomass (ex. wood, etc.), as used in an evaporator, for example, and also relates to a production system provided with such a controller, as well as to a kit for assembling the same, and to corresponding methods of manufacturing, operating and/or use associated thereto.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Parameters affecting the release of energy by combustion of biomass (ex. wood, etc.), in a combustion chamber (ex. a fireplace, a hearth, etc.) are the nature of the biomass and the quantity of combustion air required to ensure the chemical reaction of the combustion.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">By controlling the quantity of combustion air allowed into the combustion chamber, it is possible to control the speed of the combustion of the biomass, which enables to directly control the release of the energy.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For any combustion, there exists an ideal ratio of the mixture of fuel (ex. biomass) and of the combustion air. If there is not enough combustion air, the combustion is incomplete which generates smoke, and toxic products, such as furans and carbon monoxide, etc. If there is too much combustion air, the temperature of the gases resulting from the combustion is lower, which affects the efficiency potential of recuperating the thermal energy contained in the gases for heating purposes, etc.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, when the combustion technology by gasification of the biomass is used, the combustion air is typically injected in two steps: &#x201c;primary&#x201d; air which ensures a portion of the combustion that is used to gasify the biomass, and &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; air, which ensures the combustion of the gases produced by the gasification.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Typically, in the case of a wood evaporator for purposes of maple syrup production, for example, the control of the release of the energy is done from the temperature of the surface of the syrup casserole (caramelization, cooking). Furthermore, the control of the release of energy of the biomass in a conventional evaporator is normally assured by a human person, either an operator (or &#x201c;boiler&#x201d;), that must typically, based on own experience and/or own preferences according to desired final product (ex. quality and features of the resulting syrup, etc.), attempts to control several parameters at the same time, and this, instinctively or qualitatively, namely: a) monitoring the temperature in the combustion zone of the biomass in order to ensure a constant production of gas; b) monitoring the temperature of the combustion gases once the complete combustion is done so as to ensure that the optimal temperature for the use of the combustion gases is maintained; c) monitoring the chemical composition of the combustion products, in order to validate that the combustion is complete; d) controlling the quantity of primary air allowed; and e) controlling the quantity of secondary allowed air allowed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One of the greatest challenges for an operator is that to try to maintain a temperature range as constant as possible, and for as long as possible, during the process of combustion, because the behaviour of the temperature is not linear, and is subject to different and various variations during the process, namely at certain different steps of the combustion process (ex. starting, reload, etc.), which could have adverse consequences, namely on the quality of the combustion, on the quality of the resulting product (ex. a syrup which is &#x201c;lighter&#x201d; versus a syrup that is &#x201c;darker&#x201d;, etc.), on the quality of emission pollutants being produced, on the quantity of biomass (ex. wood, etc.) being used, etc.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Consequently, it would be greatly advantageous to find a new way of controlling the release of energy of a combustion of biomass, as used in an evaporator, for example, and to be able to do so in a quicker, simpler, more precise, more efficient, more economical, more reliable, more adjustable, more versatile, more adaptable, more durable, more environmentally conscientious, more desirable, and/or improved manner, than what is possible with the actual way of doing things.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a controller (and/or system including such a controller, etc.) which by virtue of its design and its modulable and/or programmable components, would satisfy some of the above-mentioned needs, and which would thus be an improvement over other related controllers, systems and/or methods known in the prior art.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The above main object is achieved, as will be better understood, by a controller (and/or resulting evaporator system including such a controller, etc.), such a driving system) such as the one briefly described in the present description, and such as the one exemplified in the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">More particularly, and according to a possible embodiment of the present invention, an objective is to provided an evaporator system used for the production of maple syrup, the evaporator system comprising:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">at least one receptacle for receiving and processing maple water destined to be transformed into maple syrup;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">a combustion chamber being operatively disposed with respect to said at least one receptacle for feeding the same with heat destined to be used in the transformation of the maple water into maple syrup, the combustion chamber having an inlet for receiving and burning biomass inside of the combustion chamber, exhaust gases of the combustion chamber being evacuated via a chimney of the evaporator system;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">a detector of temperature being operatively connected to the combustion chamber for determining an operating temperature inside of the combustion chamber;

in the context of the present patent specification must be interpreted in a &#x201c;large&#x201d; sense in that the present system can be used for the production of various other types of syrups, as evident for a person skilled in the art). The evaporator system comprises at least one receptacle (ex. boiling casserole and/or at least one caramelization casserole) for receiving and processing maple water destined to be transformed into maple syrup. The evaporator system also comprises a combustion chamber being operatively disposed with respect to said at least one receptacle for feeding the same with heat destined to be used in the transformation of the maple water into maple syrup, the combustion chamber having an inlet for receiving and burning biomass inside of the combustion chamber, exhaust gases of the combustion chamber being evacuated via a chimney of the evaporator system. This inlet can be simply, for example, an access door being operable between an opened position for receiving the biomass and a closed position for burning the biomass inside of the combustion chamber. Alternatively, it is possible to use the present evaporator system for controlling a standardized combustion of biomass such as wood granules and/or wood chips, for example. In such a case, the feeding could be done in a continuous manner via a specific access, therefore there is no door to be opened in order to carry out an addition of fuel, the frequency of feeding would be then controlled by the system, as apparent by a person skilled in the art.
