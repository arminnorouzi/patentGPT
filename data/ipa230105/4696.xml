However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the description.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Throughout the application, ordinal numbers (e.g., first, second, third, etc.) may be used as an adjective for an element (i.e., any noun in the application). The use of ordinal numbers is not to imply or create any particular ordering of the elements nor to limit any element to being only a single element unless expressly disclosed, such as using the terms &#x201c;before&#x201d;, &#x201c;after&#x201d;, &#x201c;single&#x201d;, and other such terminology. Rather, the use of ordinal numbers is to distinguish between the elements. By way of an example, a first element is distinct from a second element, and the first element may encompass more than one element and succeed (or precede) the second element in an ordering of elements.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In general, embodiments of the disclosure include systems and methods for generating a flow model using acquired sensor data along with simulated flow data and simulated sensor data. In some embodiments, for example, an initial flow model may be determined using a physics-based analysis of various multiphase flows detected by sensors (e.g., gamma ray sensors, capacitance sensing electrodes, etc.). In particular, high frequency fractional and differential pressure measurements may be obtained through an acquisition of high frequency sensor data. This high frequency sensor data may thus provide a time-series profile of data specific to various multiphase flow regimes in a measurement volume that may be unobtainable from averaged sensor data.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Based on an analysis of high frequency time-series data, a simulator or other computer device may determine an approximate flow model that accounts for a particular phase distribution. For example, a bubble regime may correspond to dispersed gas bubbles and large gas entities in an intermittent flow. A difficult part of flow data interpretation may relate to the presence of the gas phase within a flow. Where many models are designed to work with homogeneous flows, a three-phase gas-liquid-oil flow may be present unique challenges and flow scenarios for accurate detection. For example, the size of a typical gas bubble may be significantly larger that the size of a water/oil droplet in a multiphase mixture. Thus, application of high frequency sensor data may provide improved sensing detection for generating an initial flow model in contrast to models based on averaged sensor data.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">After obtaining an initial flow model, some embodiments use various machine-learning techniques to update the flow model. In particular, artificial neural networks have been used to predict different types of data. Thus, a simulator may use one or more artificial neural networks to determine simulated flow data and/or simulated sensor data for updating a flow model. By accessing larger quantities of data for different flow scenarios among multiphase flows, a flow model may be updated to more accurately detect flow regime information and phase distributions in the field. Where simple laboratory measurements may be limited to flow conditions in laboratory settings, simulated data may allow a flow model to better capture actual field conditions. Thus, simulated data may be used in conjunction with acquired sensor data to improve performance of a particular flow model for use in a multiphase flow meter.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram in accordance with one or more embodiments.

In some embodiments, the measurements are recorded in real-time, and are available for review or use within seconds, minutes or hours of the condition being sensed (e.g., the measurements are available within 1 hour of the condition being sensed). In such an embodiment, the wellhead data (<b>140</b>) may be referred to as &#x201c;real-time&#x201d; wellhead data (<b>140</b>).

Water cut sensors may implement various water cut measuring techniques, such as those based on capacitance measurements, Coriolis effect, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, gamma ray spectroscopy, and microwave technology. Water cut data may be obtained during production operations to determine various fluid rates found in production from the well system (<b>106</b>).

The surface pressure sensor (<b>136</b>) may include, for example, a wellhead pressure sensor that senses a pressure of production (<b>121</b>) flowing through or otherwise located in the wellhead (<b>130</b>). In some embodiments, the surface sensing system (<b>134</b>) includes a surface temperature sensor (<b>138</b>) operable to sense the temperature of production (<b>121</b>) flowing through the well surface system (<b>124</b>), after it exits the wellbore (<b>120</b>). The surface temperature sensor (<b>138</b>) may include, for example, a wellhead temperature sensor that senses a temperature of production (<b>121</b>) flowing through or otherwise located in the wellhead (<b>130</b>), referred to as &#x201c;wellhead temperature&#x201d; (T). In some embodiments, the surface sensing system (<b>134</b>) includes a flow rate sensor (<b>139</b>) operable to sense one or more individual flow rates of a fluid (e.g., oil or gas in the production (<b>121</b>)) flowing through the well surface system (<b>124</b>), after it exits the wellbore (<b>120</b>).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the flow rate sensor (<b>139</b>) is a multiphase flow meter. For example, a multiphase flow meter may include hardware and/or software for determining individual flow rates of different components within a three-phase flow. More specifically, a multiphase flow meter may determine a mass flow rate of a gas component and a mass flow rate of a liquid component (e.g., a component of the three-phase flow that includes oil and water) of the three-phase flow. As such, a multiphase flow meter may be used to determine an amount of oil or a portion of oil within a multiphase flow that travels through a wellhead during a given period of time. A multiphase flow meter may also include hardware that uses various types of sensors based on different sensing technologies (e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance, electromagnetic sensors, acoustic sensors, etc.) and interpretation models. For example, a multiphase flow meter may use a sensor response of magnetic resonance information to determine the number of hydrogen atoms in a particular fluid flow. Since oil, gas, and water each contain hydrogen atoms, properties of a multiphase flow may be measured using magnetic resonance. The hydrogen atoms in a magnetized fluid may respond to radio frequency pulses and emit echoes that are subsequently recorded and analyzed by the multiphase flow meter. Thus, multiphase flow rate measurements may be used for production monitoring, well control, and/or reservoir optimization.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram in accordance with one or more embodiments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a multiphase flow metering system (e.g., multiphase flow metering system X (<b>200</b>)) may include a multiphase flow meter (e.g., multiphase flow meter Y (<b>205</b>)) and a host device (e.g., host device H (<b>280</b>)). In response to determining flow rate data regarding a multiphase flow, a multiphase flow meter may transmit flow rate data to a host device, such as a well control system or another type of computer system, over a network. The multiphase flow meter may be coupled to one or more flow tubes (e.g., flow tube C (<b>220</b>)) in order to determine the flow rate data, such as individual flow rates and/or oil, gas, and/or water fractions of a corresponding multiphase flow (e.g., multiphase flow M (<b>215</b>)). A flow tube may be a fluid conduit, such as pipe, that may provide a fluid sampling for analysis by the multiphase flow meter. Examples of flow tubes may include a bent flow tube, a straight flow tube, or another type of flow tube. Furthermore, a flow model may be stored within a multiphase flow meter as a portion of a database and/or as one or more flow regime maps that are associated with various sensor values. By analyzing sensor data in connection with one or more flow models, a flow meter may determine flow rate data that corresponds to acquired sensor data. Flow rate data may include corresponding fractional data (e.g., gas fraction of a multiphase flow) and/or velocity data (e.g., an individual flow rate of oil or water in the multiphase flow).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Furthermore, the multiphase flow meter may include a flow meter controller (e.g., flow meter controller A (<b>210</b>)) that controls sensing operations and/or the flow analysis operations. In some embodiments, a flow controller uses one or more flow models (e.g., flow model B (<b>230</b>)) to determine flow rate data (e.g., flow regime information B (<b>231</b>), phase distribution information B (<b>232</b>)) regarding a particular flow. Phase distribution information may describe the respective fractions of one or more phases (e.g., gas phase, oil phase, water phase), in a particular flow. Flow regime information may refer to a specific manner that two or three phases flow through a flow tube. For example, a flow regime may be expressed using various superficial velocities. One example of a flow regime may be a &#x201c;bubble regime,&#x201d; in which gas is entrained as bubbles within a liquid. Another example of a flow regime is a &#x201c;slug regime&#x201d; that may correspond to a series of liquid &#x201c;slugs&#x201d; or &#x201c;plugs&#x201d; separated by relatively large gas pockets. Accordingly, flow model may describes changes in a multiphase flow between transitions from high-liquid compositions to high-gas compositions and vice versa. Other flow regimes may include an annular flow regime, a dispersed flow regime, and a froth flow regime.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Keeping with flow controllers, a flow meter controller may include one or more drivers (e.g., driver circuitry B (<b>255</b>)) and one or more processors. A driver may include software and/or hardware, such as driver circuitry, for operating one or more sensors. In particular, a driver may include digital-to-analog converters and analog-to-digital converters, for example. With driver circuitry, a sensing signal may be transmitted to one or more sensing electrodes to obtain a resulting signal, e.g., that is detected at one or more receivers. Examples of processor may include a digital signal processor (DSP), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), an integrated circuit, such as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a computer processor, such as computer processor (<b>802</b>) described below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, etc.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">With respect to host devices, a host device may include a computer processor (e.g., computer processor H (<b>285</b>), a display device (e.g., display device H (<b>286</b>)), and/or a user interface (e.g., user interface H (<b>287</b>)) for communicating with a flow controller. A display device may output flow rate data regarding a particular fluid sample to a user, while a user interface may be used to modify one or more settings in a multiphase flow meter. More specifically, a host device may be a well control system (e.g., well control system (<b>126</b>)), or a computer system, such as computer system (<b>802</b>) described below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> and the accompanying description.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore, a multiphase flow meter may include various types of sensors (e.g., differential pressure sensors B (<b>242</b>), impedance sensors C (<b>243</b>), absolute pressure sensors D (<b>244</b>), temperature sensors D (<b>245</b>)) to determine various fluid properties, such as a volume fraction of liquid in the flow tube (i.e., to implement a liquid fraction sensor), and/or a void fraction value that corresponds to a percentage of a material in the flow tube that is in gaseous form (i.e. to implement a void fraction sensor). As such, various flow composition techniques may be used, such as based on gamma ray sensing or x-ray sensing. In gamma ray sensing, a liquid flow rate may be determined from a liquid film thickness and a pressure gradient (dp/dz) (e.g., using differential pressure sensors B (<b>242</b>)) along a straight tube section of a flow tube. The liquid film thickness may be determined using gamma ray densitometry, conductance sensor measurements, capacitance sensor measurements, acoustic sensor measurements, and/or fluorescent sensor measurements to determine the liquid film thickness, depending on the multiphase flow metering system. With respect to gamma ray sensing, a gamma ray sensor may include a gamma ray source (e.g., gamma ray source A (<b>241</b>) that produces high energy photons) and a gamma ray detector (e.g., gamma ray detector B (<b>246</b>)) for determining a fluid composition of a specific flow. The attenuation of photons along a narrow beam path between the gamma ray source and the gamma ray detector may be dependent on the energy of the photons, which may describe the atomic composition of the flow and other fluid properties, such as density. Thus, a multiphase flow meter may use one or more of the following sensors: motion sensors for measuring the fluid velocity within a flow tube, density sensors for acquiring density measurements of a material flowing through the flow tube, temperature sensors for measuring the temperature in the flow tube, and/or pressure sensors for sensing one or more pressures of a material flowing through the flow tube. In some embodiments, a multiphase flow meter may use pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) modeling in place of or in addition to gamma ray sensing to determine one or more fluid properties.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, for example, a multiphase flow meter includes a Venturi meter. For example, a Venturi meter is disposed downstream of an expansion contraction section. Using a Venturi meter, a differential pressure sensor may determine a pressure drop between an inlet and a throat of the Venturi, while two absolute pressure sensors may be used to measure inlet pressure and outlet pressure. Likewise, temperatures sensors may also acquire temperature sensor data regarding inlet temperature values and outlet temperature values. Thus, sensor data from various sensors in a Venturi meter may be used to determine inlet fluid properties and outlet fluid properties.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, a simulator generates simulated flow data and/or simulated sensor data using one or more machine-learning techniques to update one or more flow models. More specifically, a simulator may include hardware and/or software with functionality for using one or more machine-learning models to generate simulated data. Examples of machine-learning models include convolutional neural networks, deep neural networks, recurrent neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees, inductive learning models, deductive learning models, supervised learning models, unsupervised learning models, reinforcement learning models, etc. In some embodiments, two or more different types of machine-learning models are integrated into a single machine-learning architecture, e.g., a machine-learning model may include decision trees and neural networks. In some embodiments, the simulator may generate augmented or synthetic data to produce a large amount of interpreted data for training a particular model.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">With respect to artificial neural networks, for example, an artificial neural network may include one or more hidden layers, where a hidden layer includes one or more neurons. A neuron may be a modelling node or object that is loosely patterned on a neuron of the human brain. In particular, a neuron may combine data inputs with a set of coefficients, i.e., a set of network weights for adjusting the data inputs. These network weights may amplify or reduce the value of a particular data input, thereby assigning an amount of significance to various data inputs for a task being modeled. Through machine learning, an artificial neural network may determine which data inputs should receive greater priority in determining one or more specified outputs of the neural network. Likewise, these weighted data inputs may be summed such that this sum is communicated through a neuron's activation function to other hidden layers within the neural network. As such, the activation function may determine whether and to what extent an output of a neuron progresses to other neurons where the output may be weighted again for use as an input to the next hidden layer.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, simulated flow data and/or simulated sensor data are generated using one or more temporal convolution networks (TCNs). In particular, a TCN may be an artificial neural network architecture that includes functionality for obtaining a sequence of any length (such as a time-series of sensor data) and mapping the input sequence to an output sequence of the same length. Thus, a TCN may operate in a similar manner as a recurrent neural network (RNN). As such, a TCN may have the ability look far into the past of an input time-series to make a particular prediction using a combination of deep neural networks (e.g., an augmented network with residual layers) and dilated convolutions. In some embodiments, a TCN uses a one-dimensional fully-convolutional network (FCN) architecture, where each hidden layer is the same length as the input layer. Thus, unlike in RNNs where predictions for later timesteps may need to wait for predictions for earlier timesteps, convolutions may be done in parallel within a TCN. Therefore, in both training and evaluation, a long input sequence may be processed as a whole in a TCN instead of sequentially as in RNN.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> show various configurations of components, other configurations may be used without departing from the scope of the disclosure.

For example, a multiphase flow meter may be installed for acquiring sensor data, such as absolute pressure sensor data, temperature sensor data, differential pressure sensor data, and/or impedance measurements (e.g., capacitance or conductivity measurements from various sensing electrodes) regarding one or more multiphase flows. This acquired sensor data may be used to determine flow regime information as well as phase distribution information. Acquired sensor data may be collected from the sensors over a certain time period from laboratory flow loop experiments at one or more sampling frequencies.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Likewise, the multiphase flow meter may include various sensors to determine gas-oil ratio (GOR) data regarding a particular fluid flow. For example, a gamma ray sensor may be used to determine GOR data may be performed on a fluid sample. On the other hand, complex PVT modelling may be used to determine GOR data without gamma ray sensing. In some embodiments, the multiphase flow meter is a Venturi meter that acquires differential pressure data over a predetermined throat in the Venturi meter.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, sensor data is acquired at a high sampling frequency to capture various transient signals that describe a &#x201c;more liquid&#x201d; flow regime and/or a &#x201c;more gas&#x201d; flow regime within a particular flow. Rather than using averaged sensor data of multiple sensor measurements, continuous transient time-series data may be acquired from such sensors. This high frequency time-series data may provide a better indicator of one or more flow regimes, accordingly. In some embodiments, for example, the predetermined sampling frequency may be determined using the following equation:</p><p id="p-0041" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>f</mi>     <mo>&#x226b;</mo>     <mfrac>      <mi>u</mi>      <mi>L</mi>     </mfrac>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>Equation</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mtext>   </mtext>     <mn>1</mn>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0042" num="0000">where f is the predetermined sampling frequency, u is a particular flow velocity, and L is the size of sensing electrodes for admittance measurements or capacitance measurements. In some embodiments, for example, the predetermined sampling frequency is 100 Hz to 1000 Hz for capacitance sensors. Thus, sensor data may be acquired using a sampling frequency that corresponds to a frequency value greater than a ratio of a predetermined flow velocity to a size of a sensing electrode for an electromagnetic measurement of the one or more multiphase flows.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0040">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example of a mixture's permittivity of a continuous production stream that is sampled at a high sampling frequency. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, various transient signals in acquired sensor data illustrate different sensor peaks and sensor dips that are undetected in the averaged sensor data. Thus, a flow regime with &#x201c;more liquid&#x201d; is detected at one sensor peak, and another flow regime with &#x201c;more gas&#x201d; is detected at one sensor dip among the transient signals.

Based on acquired sensor data, one or more time-series analyses may be applied to determine a particular flow model. For example, fractional measurements (e.g., corresponding to impedance values of the multiphase flows) and velocity measurements (e.g., corresponding to measurements of differential pressure) may be determined using the high frequency sensor data. For an intermittent flow, impedance sensor data may indicate various time instants, where mostly liquid or mostly gas is present in a sample volume (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). Likewise, the degree of heterogeneity of a sensor signal may be a direct function of a gas's impact (e.g., a completely homogenous sample may identify a fully dispersed multiphase flow). Thus, by matching an impedance time series with differential pressure data, details on individual liquid and gas velocities may be obtained for the flow model. As such, instantaneous measurements may be used with supplementary information (e.g., absolute pressure data, temperature data, gas-oil ratio data, etc.) to generate and/or update a particular flow model. Thus, the flow model may describe flow regime information as well as various phase distributions in different multiphase flows.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0042">In some embodiments, the flow model is an approximate model of multiphase flow regime in a measurement volume. For example, the approximate model may be determined using sensor time-series data and operational data from laboratory flow loop experiments. In some embodiments, the approximate flow model may represent a multiphase flow using a predetermined number of intermittent sections that include the following components: large gas bubbles or a dispersed gas-liquid phase that includes oil, water and gas dispersed as small bubbles in liquid.

Where acquired sensor data may be produced under ideal conditions that perfectly match a multiphase flow, simulated flow data may account for various sources of uncertainty in actual flow conditions at a well. Thus, updating the flow model using simulated flow data may provide a correction to the flow model for these uncertain conditions. In some embodiments, simulated flow data is obtained using various computer simulations of multiphase flows, where the reference flow rates from acquired sensor data operate as boundary conditions for the computer simulations. By using simulated flow data, a computer system may determine whether corresponding flow regime information and phase distribution information is correct.
