In addition, the current expertise mapping models are exclusively based on academic qualifications and professional affiliations, which results in the exclusion of professionals with useful knowledge. Furthermore, in most of the conventional approaches the expertise are self-reported by the professionals and authentication of these expertise depend on endorsements received from people, who may often times be from different industries or may not even know the professionals whom they are endorsing, resulting in the exaggeration of the breadth of expertise, there by skewing the expertise map.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention specifically relates to a method for data-driven mapping and ranking of expertise. Expertise mapping comprises validation of expertise of each user and ranking their expertise in a selected domain or industry based on the generation of a numerical value termed &#x201c;Expertise Quotient&#x201d; through crowdsourcing, Bayesian statistics and Big data algorithms.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">By focusing on quantifying tacit knowledge and credibility through reliable crowdsourcing approaches, this methodology is a significant improvement on existing expertise-ranking models. Furthermore, in the methodology presented here, since the Expertise Quotient of the users are based on the review ratings crowdsourced from peers of similar expertise as well as the references gathered from peers as well as beneficiaries of expertise from the same domain, a highly accurate data-driven dynamic expertise map is generated.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram depicting the various functional modules of an expertise network system, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram depicting the link between entities and the validated expertise in an expertise network system, as per some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a data diagram depicting the identification of top experts in an area of expertise based on Expertise Quotient, as per some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a functional diagram illustrating the machine architecture as well as machine-readable medium, according to some embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to the drawings, the embodiments of the present invention are further described.

The topics may be chosen by experts or influencers in the relevant areas of expertise and the entity showcases his or her tacit knowledge on the topic by challenging or supporting the perspectives, opinions or insights of the specific expert or influencer. The showcased expertise is rated by peers of similar expertise, with a maximum deviation of +/&#x2212;10%, in a dynamic double-blind peer-review process. The ratings crowdsourced from the peers for the different attributes of expertise as well as credibility are averaged and multiplied with his/her current Expertise Quotient for that specific expertise, thereby making it further dynamic.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">The entity may invite peers from the same niche who know him or her professionally to provide references for an expertise. The resultant ratings, which can be over various attributes of expertise as well as credibility then are averaged and multiplied with the referee's current Expertise Quotient for that specific expertise, making it highly dynamic.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">In addition, the entity may also invite beneficiaries of expertise, such as clients, mentees and colleagues to provide references for an expertise. In this case, the ratings, termed as impact ratings are obtained by averaging the ratings from the beneficiary who has rated the entity for the specific expertise and multiplying it with a constant, the impact constant and the beneficiary's current Expertise Quotient for that specific expertise. The beneficiary's ratings are given additional importance here as these people have been directly impacted by the entity's expertise and as such their ratings should give a better understanding of the entity's expertise in that specific domain.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">If the referee/beneficiary has not validated his or her expertise for that specific expertise, they will not be able to provide ratings. In this case, they will have to showcase their expertise first in order to unlock the ability to provide rating.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">An expertise may be considered to be validated, only when: 1) the entity has successfully showcased his or her expertise on at least one of the topics under a specific expertise, 2) the showcased expertise has been successfully reviewed by his or her peers and <b>3</b>) the entity has received at least one reference for that expertise from his or her peers or beneficiaries of expertise.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">The different expertise that have been validated <b>201</b> by an entity <b>203</b> form the nodes with the Expertise Quotient generated <b>202</b> being the edge, as conceptualized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

Since Expertise Quotient focuses more on the implicit or tacit knowledge, which is based on the expertise that the entity has accumulated throughout his or her career through observations and experiences as well as professional credibility, it supersedes their resume.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Expertise Quotient Generation</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0030">In an example embodiment, a system for generating Expertise Quotient may be defined using crowdsourcing techniques. Once defined, the data collected using these techniques are provided to the Expertise Quotient generation module. A few examples of the data that may be collected using crowdsourcing techniques include: 1) The expertise showcased by an entity is rated by gathering reviews from peers of similar expertise on different expertise attributes in a dynamic double-blind peer-review process, 2) The entity's professional credibility is rated by gathering references from peers from the same niche who know the entity as well as from beneficiaries of their expertise.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">In order to increase user engagement, high-quality showcase for each expertise may be rewarded based on their Expertise Quotient. For example, the top 1 percentile of any expertise may be marked with a Gold badge to denote the high-quality as well as the high ratings received from the peers and referees.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">Based on the Expertise Quotient generated <b>304</b> for each of the expertise <b>302</b>, a percentile ranking <b>301</b> table <b>300</b> can be generated for all the entities who have validated the specific expertise. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, this enables businesses to identify top experts <b>303</b> in any area of expertise, which will further enable them to find innovative solutions to any critical problems they may be facing, identify growth strategies as well as find influencers who may potentially promote their products, solutions, technology or brands.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">In order to ensure the fidelity of the peer-review and reference processes, the concept of reliability rating <b>305</b>, trustworthiness rating <b>306</b> and Trust Index <b>307</b> have been introduced, wherein the variance of the ratings provided by each entity is compared against the average ratings provided so far. Reliability rating is defined as the variance of the average of the review ratings provided for a showcased expertise, while trust worthiness rating is the variance of the average of the reference ratings provided for an entity and Trust Index is the average of the reliability and trustworthiness ratings of a specific entity. The Trust Index indicates the dependability and thereby, the thought leadership of a specific entity.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example Uses for the Expertise Quotient</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0034">In one example embodiment, a verified organization can access the Expertise Quotient of its employees exclusively upon their consent, which enables it to identify prevalent expertise gaps and post related opportunities to identify the best candidates with the right expertise. In another example, few embodiments empower Human Resources (HR) Technology by: a) improving the expertise-based profiling, which results in the identification of suitable talent for opportunities within the organization and verification of their expertise as well as professional credibility prior to hiring and b) providing robust metrics, which helps in the identification of expertise gaps as well as potential unused expertise within the organization.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">In an example embodiment, businesses can seek verified professionals with validated expertise, to find solutions to problems, identify strategies for future growth and discern influencers who can evangelize or promote their products, solutions, technology or brands.
