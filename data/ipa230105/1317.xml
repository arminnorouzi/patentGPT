The momentum wheel toy <b>1</b> discloses a track <b>2</b> and the momentum wheel. <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The track is comprised of two track section <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>. Each section <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> has an outer wall <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, and an inner all <b>8</b>,<b>9</b>. In one embodiment, the outer wall <b>6</b> and the inner wall <b>8</b> in one section are parallel to each other in one track section <b>4</b>, and the outer wall <b>7</b> and the inner wall <b>9</b> are parallel to each other in the other section <b>5</b>. In another embodiment, both sections <b>4</b>,<b>5</b>, are parallel to each other. Both of the outer walls <b>6</b>,<b>7</b> and the inner walls <b>8</b>,<b>9</b> have identical hand opening <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> in them, forming one unitary hand opening <b>60</b>. In one embodiment, the hand opening <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> are parallel and each hand opening has exactly the same shape. In one embodiment, the hand opening <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> are oval shaped. In another embodiment, the hand opening <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> are round, or circular in shape. In yet another embodiment, the hand opening <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> are polygonal in shape. In another embodiment, the hand opening <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> are large enough such that a child or average sized man (or woman) is able to slip their hand(s) and or fingers through the hand opening <b>10</b> so as to have control of the device. Each of the hand opening <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> is centered on their respective outers or inner walls, and all of the hand opening are aligned. In one embodiment, all of the hand opening are parallel.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the inner and outer walls are made of plastic. In another embodiment, the inner <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> and outer walls <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> are made of wood. In yet another embodiment, the inner <b>8</b>,<b>9</b> and outer walls <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> are made of metal and in yet another embodiment, the inner and outer walls are made of a ferromagnetic metal.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment, each of the track sections <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> are oval or round. In another embodiment, each of the inner walls <b>8</b>,<b>9</b>, and outer walls <b>6</b>,<b>7</b> are oval, round, or polygonal with rounded corners or edges. The sides sections are identical to each other and the top and bottom sections of the track are identical to each other.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Each of the track sections <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> have an edge or perimeter <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>. This edge is measured or extended from the outer perimeter of the outer walls <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, Ito the outer perimeter of the inner wall <b>8</b>,<b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Each of the edges or perimeters <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> has positioned on top (of the edges) a ferromagnetic strip <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>. In another embodiment, the ferromagnetic strips <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> are integral with the edges or perimeters <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> of the track sections <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A spacer <b>18</b> is positioned between the first track section <b>4</b> and the second track section <b>5</b>. The spacer can be in parallel to and in contact with the inner walls <b>8</b>,<b>9</b>. In one embodiment, a perimeter of the outer edge <b>19</b> of the spacer <b>18</b> is similar but smaller than the perimeters <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> of the first track section <b>4</b> and the fifth track section <b>5</b>. In one embodiment there is a hand opening <b>40</b> in spacer <b>18</b> that is identical to the other described hand opening.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another embodiment, the spacer is just a block or a series of blocks of any shape. In yet another embodiment, the spacers are separating pipes <b>20</b> connecting the two track sections <b>4</b>,<b>5</b>. In one embodiment none of these spacers</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another embodiment, a momentum wheel <b>3</b> rides on the edges/perimeters of the first and second perimeters/edges <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> of the first track section <b>4</b> and the second track section <b>5</b>. More specifically, the momentum wheel <b>3</b> comprises a wheel <b>22</b>. In one embodiment, the wheel <b>22</b> is made out of plastic, but in other embodiments, the wheel <b>22</b> can be made out of wood or metal. The wheel <b>3</b> has a first circular side <b>23</b>, a second circular side <b>24</b>, and a circular rim <b>25</b> around the two sides at the perimeter of the wheel. In another embodiment, there is one axle <b>28</b> going through the center of the first and second sides, with the first axle end <b>26</b> exiting through the center of the first side <b>23</b> and second axle end <b>29</b> exiting through the center of the second side <b>24</b>. The axle is ferromagnetic and the axle and the ferromagnetic strips <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> are attracted to each other.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The first axle end <b>26</b> and the second axle end <b>29</b> are each long enough so as to be able magnetically reside on and glide along the ferromagnetic strips <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>. In another embodiment, the first axle side <b>26</b> and the second axle side <b>29</b> are of equal length.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be noted that the spacer, in any form, is positioned far enough below the perimeters <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> of track sections <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, so that the axle ends easily ride on the ferromagnetic strips <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>. More specifically, the spacer is positioned at least or greater than the distance between the outer surface of the axle end <b>23</b>, <b>29</b> and the rim <b>25</b> of the momentum wheel <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another embodiment of the disclosure, one side of the wheel is removable. In yet another embodiment of the disclosure, there are a plurality of light emitting diodes (LEDs) <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> of different colors connected to a circuit board <b>33</b>. There is at least one, and in another embodiment a plurality of batteries <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> provide the power and a motion activation switch <b>37</b> signals the lights to turn on. In one embodiment, the LEDs are blinking when they are on. The flickering nature of these LED's is because light output fluctuates. This fluctuation happens because your dimmable light-emitting diodes are designed to switch on and off at a designated speed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">To work the device, the user places the wheel above the spacer and between the two sections <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, with the two axle sides <b>26</b>, <b>29</b> reside on ferromagnetic strips <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, respectively. Either the axle of the wheel <b>28</b> or the ferromagnetic strips <b>16</b>,<b>17</b> are magnetic or both are magnetic. The user places his hand through the complete hand opening <b>50</b> of the momentum wheel toy <b>1</b> whereupon the grasp the far track section <b>5</b> with their fingers. The person then starts a consistent back and forth movement in a horizontal or vertical position to start up the momentum of the momentum wheel <b>21</b>. Either the axle of the wheel <b>28</b> or the ferromagnetic strips <b>16</b>,<b>17</b> are magnetic or both are magnetic. It becomes a challenge of magnetic force versus momentum to keep the momentum wheel <b>21</b> moving around the track at a consistent or faster speed without momentum forcing the wheel off of the track.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although the disclosure has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character&#x2014;it being understood that the embodiments shown and described have been selected as representative examples including presently preferred embodiments plus others indicative of the nature of changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention(s) being disclosed and within the scope of disclosures(s) as claimed in this and any other applications that incorporate relevant portions of the present disclosure for support of those claims.
