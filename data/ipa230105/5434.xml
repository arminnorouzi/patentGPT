In particular, the electroluminescent display device includes an organic or inorganic light emitting layer that autonomously emits light, and advantageously, has a high response speed, high luminous efficiency, high brightness, and a high viewing angle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A display device includes a panel driver for driving a display panel. The panel driver includes a source driver for driving data lines of the display panel, and a gate driver for driving gate lines of the display panel. The panel driver communicates with a timing controller and receives various pieces of information required for an operation. The source driver is connected to the timing controller through an intra-interface and receives information for driving a source from the timing controller. The gate driver receives information driving a gate from the timing controller through a separate gate transmission wiring separated from the intra-interface.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The source driver and the gate driver are connected to the timing controller through different transmission paths, and thus, the number of output pins of the timing controller is high, and the areas of a connection cable, a connector, and a source printed circuit board (SPCB) used as a transmission path are high. In addition, in accordance with recent trends, the number of information for driving a gate has increased due to various functions of a display device, and thus, a circuit for signal transmission has been complicated and an installation area thereof has increased.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To overcome the aforementioned problem of the related art, the present disclosure may provide a display device for simplifying a signal transmission path between a timing controller and a panel driver and reducing a circuit installation area for signal transmission.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the disclosure, as embodied and broadly described herein, a display device includes a display panel including pixels, and data lines and gate lines connected to the pixels, a timing controller configured to output source driving bit information and gate driving bit information through an intra-interface signal, a source driver configured to generate data driving signal based on the source driving bit information and to supply the data driving signal to the data
