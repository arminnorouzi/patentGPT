The base has a cross-sectional shape of major circular segment, which is more suitable for handling, that is, the shape of major circular segment can fit the shape of human palm, increasing the contact surface of the palm and the base, preventing from slipping. The tine <b>2</b> has a tip part <b>25</b>, a blade part <b>24</b>, and a connecting part <b>23</b>. The tip of the tip part <b>25</b> can insert into the soil more easily, increasing the efficiency of prying. The connecting part <b>23</b> of the tine is located on one end of the tine <b>2</b>, and the tip part <b>25</b> is located on another end of the tine <b>2</b>. The base has a plurality of slots, and the slots are evenly arranged along a lateral direction of the base, the spacing between the slots range from 20 mm to 30 mm. Accordingly, the tines are evenly arranged, when garden tool is used, the density of tines and rakes to loosen the soil is even, and it is not easy to cause soil leakage. The base further has a reinforcing rib fixing the base, which can enforce the strength of the base <b>1</b>, preventing the base from breaking due to the plurality of the slots. The base with the cross-sectional shape of major circular segment can be divided into an arc part <b>5</b> and a plane part <b>6</b>, and the slots are located on the arc part <b>5</b> of the base. The connecting part <b>3</b> has a mortise, and the tenon plate has a tenon for engaging with the mortise. The tenon includes a tongue <b>41</b> or a head <b>31</b>, and the mortise includes a groove <b>21</b> or a hole <b>22</b>. The groove <b>21</b> forms a mortise and tenon joint with the tongue <b>41</b>, and the hole <b>22</b> forms a mortise and tenon joint with the head <b>31</b>. The connecting part <b>23</b> can be inserted into the slots, and the base <b>1</b> has through holes corresponding to the mortise, the tenon and the mortise forms a mortise and tenon joint while the tenon extending through the through hole, and the mortise and tenon joint fixedly connects the tine <b>2</b> and the base <b>1</b>. The tines are corresponding to the slots on the base, such that each of the tines can be replaced separately. According to the embodiment, the tine is fixed to the base by the tenon plate, without using conventional connecting tools, such as screws, nails, or glues. Instead, the mortise-and-tenon joint are used, it is easy to disassemble, assemble and replace after damage. The tines or blades can be used separately or in multiples, and the user can pry or rip the soil by gently prying the soil. According to an outer edge shape of the tenon plate, the tenon plate can be a major circular segment tenon plate <b>3</b>, a circular plate <b>4</b>, or a rectangular tenon plate. The head <b>31</b> includes a cylinder head and the tongue <b>4</b> includes a cubic tongue.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The slot includes the edge slots <b>12</b>. The two edge slots <b>12</b> are located on both ends of the base <b>1</b>, respectively. Two lateral slots <b>15</b> are located on both ends of the base <b>1</b>, and a first through hole <b>17</b> is located on each of the the lateral slot <b>15</b>, and the first through hole <b>17</b> is in communication with the edge slot <b>12</b>. The connecting part <b>23</b> is inserted into the edge slot <b>12</b>, the first through hole <b>17</b> is corresponding to the hole <b>22</b> of the connecting part <b>23</b>, and the head <b>23</b> of the major circular segment tenon plate <b>3</b> inserts through the first through hole <b>17</b>, and the outer edge of the major circular segment tenon plate <b>3</b> clamps with the inner edge of the lateral slot <b>15</b>. The head <b>31</b> and the hole <b>22</b> form the fixed connected mortise and tenon joint with an interference fit. The major circular segment tenon plate <b>3</b> and the base <b>1</b> both have an identical cross section shape of major circular segment, and the shape of the lateral slot <b>15</b> is corresponding to the shape of the major circular segment tenon plate <b>3</b>. While the major circular segment tenon plate <b>3</b> is inserted into the lateral slot <b>15</b>, the major circular segment tenon plate <b>3</b> is slightly higher than the inner edge of the lateral slot <b>15</b>, such that the major circular segment tenon plate <b>3</b> can be plucked out from the lateral slot <b>15</b> if the tine is required to be replaced. Also, the major circular segment tenon plate <b>3</b> is installed in the lateral slot <b>15</b>, which is more fitted to the end of the base <b>1</b>, preventing the tenon plate from falling out easily.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The slot further includes a middle slot <b>13</b>, and a main slot <b>16</b> is located on the plane part <b>6</b> of the base <b>1</b>. The circular tenon plate <b>4</b> can be fitly inserted in the main slot <b>16</b> of the plane part <b>6</b> of the base, such that the tenon plate won't pick the user's hand while firmly hold. The shape of the main slot <b>16</b> is corresponding to the shape of the circular tenon plate <b>4</b>.
