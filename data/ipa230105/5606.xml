When patients do not receive the right kind of care, their health suffers, they wind up in an emergency room (ER) or are hospitalized, and insurance providers' costs skyrocket. In the United States of America (USA), 15% of its annual gross domestic product (GDP) is spent on healthcare. This equates to more than about $3 trillion per annum or over about $10,000 per person. Eighty percent of the country's expenditure is spent on behalf of 20% of its sickest population, that is, chronically ill and aging patients with complex medical conditions including, for example, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and respiratory diseases.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To stem rising healthcare costs as a percentage of its GDP, the United States (U.S.) Government shifted the burden of healthcare costs from individuals, prior to 1950, to third party payers, hereinafter referred to as payers, including the government through programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the military health care system, and the private sector, for example, through managed care systems. Typically, a private sector entity seeks a profit margin of 2% in Medicaid and 15% in Medicare and, in order to control its medical expenditures, must effectively manage the 20% of its members with complex, chronic conditions. Over the past several decades, payers have experimented with, and failed at, programs such as disease management, case management, avoidance of emergency rooms, and avoidance of preventable hospital admissions. Payers have struggled to provide quality care, universal access to care, and cost-effective care due to continually rising costs in the hospital and pharmacy sectors of the marketplace. Payers have attempted to extend the reach of cost-effective care to nurse hot-lines, walk-in clinics, urgent care centers, doctor house calls, and most recently, telehealth. However, none have proven to be the Holy Grail of cost-effective healthcare because they have been unable to make a significant impact on the 20% of patients with 80% of the costs, whose barriers to care include lack of finances, lack of access, lack of compliance, poor healthcare choices such as smoking and obesity, and inability to overcome psychosocial issues that impact health and longevity.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">$800 billion is spent each year in the U.S. on Medicare recipients. $250 billion of that cost is spent by Medicare Advantage plans with a total membership of 3.5 million patients. There are more than 3,500 Medicare Advantage plans operating in the U.S., although 80% of that market is controlled by eight of the largest national and regional health plans. There is an unmet need for care of the neediest population who live in subsidized housing throughout major cities in the U.S. Underserved communities house the fastest growing and costliest populations, that is, seniors, in the country. Seniors have twice the level of chronic illness than the general population with 60% greater behavioral comorbidities and corresponding gaps in care. There is a need for cost-effective, quality care among the neediest patient populations.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, ongoing and rapid growth has occurred in state government assist programs in the managed care market in the form of &#x201c;Managed Long Term Care&#x201d; (MLTC). Patients who require managed long term care are home-bound and require low-level personal care assistance with their daily activities. There has also been growth in the need for primary care in the &#x201c;Skilled Nursing Facility&#x201d; (SNF) market since skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) are a well-known nidus for repeated and frequent hospitalizations due to a paucity of care at those facilities. This has promulgated a growth in new companies providing primary care to nursing home patients but without resources to manage the entirety of this growing sector of the market. The growth in both MLTC and SNF healthcare needs have further demonstrated the need for a model of care which is entirely scalable to MLTC and SNF care.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The largest growth sector in the U.S. has been in the population over the age of 65. Driven by the aging of the &#x201c;baby boomers&#x201d; generation, this demographic sector grew by over a third during the past decade, and by about 3.2%, that is, about 1,688,924, from the year 2018 to the year 2019. In addition to the aging of the population, there has been an increasing trend of chronic illnesses such as obesity and diabetes in the U.S. For example, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes increased from 0.93% of the population in the year 1958 to 7.40% in the year 2015. The U.S. economy grew exponentially from 2017 through the beginning of 2020. Despite the negative impact on the economy as a result of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the U.S. economy is rebounding. Certain sectors of the economy continue to surge as a direct result of COVID-19. Additional forces driving upward growth in the health technology market has been the continuous downward pressure on Medicare and Medicaid premiums from both federal and state governments. Managed care plans in these sectors have seen continued erosion into their profit margins. Medicare Advantage plans have seen additional ceilings in their profitability as a result of a capping of their medical loss ratios, with no counter-balancing floor on their losses. As a result, entities in the healthcare space are searching for new and cost-effective ways to reduce the high costs of emergency room (ER) usage, hospital admissions, and pharmacy. The single largest driver of remote and at-home healthcare services has been the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of voluntary and mandatory confinements during the height of the pandemic, healthcare delivery had become even less accessible and patients were dying from other diseases due to a lack of treatment and psychosocial factors dramatically increasing the risk of death due to heart disease, cancer, and suicides. Federal and local governments mandated payments for telehealth. Managed care payers have tried to expand home health visits. As a result, the public has a growing introduction and greater experience with remote care and has turned to remote care as an alternative to a doctor or emergency room visit.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Due to high cost and lack of coordination of house calls, inadequate technology of telehealth, and general failures of disease management companies, telehealth solutions have been wanting. Spurred by the high cost of utilization and COVID-19, many entities have entered the remote, care-at-home, market. The growth of this market, due to COVID-19 becoming covered expenses, increases the need for care-at-home services as patients get exposed to the availability of such services. The general public has always embraced home healthcare. However, remote healthcare had greatly lagged and was either not well-accepted by patients and/or was not a covered expense by payers. Since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, acceptance of remote healthcare by the general public has increased dramatically. Use of telehealth, for example, is now commonplace and a covered benefit for Medicare and health plans and payment has been mandated by federal and local legislatures and executive orders.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As an example of the need for a medical solution, it is estimated that 25% of Medicare patients are chronically affected by diabetes and 10% of those patients have complex, comorbid conditions that are poorly controlled. In the Medicare Advantage sector alone, this represents an estimated target of 80,000 members in need of an appropriate medical solution in the New York (N.Y.) tri-state area for diabetes alone. This patient population generates the highest cost to insurance providers due to non-compliance with prescribed medical, social, and behavioral protocols which results in recurring emergency room (ER) visits and re-hospitalization.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Hence, there is a long-felt need in the healthcare industry for an at-home evaluation, management, and emergency room diversion system and method that optimizes home-visit appointments and related travel for delivering superior patient care as well as significant savings to health insurance providers.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, there is a long-felt need in the healthcare industry for a healthcare solution that bridges the divide between clinical primary care and managed care case management. Furthermore, there is a long-felt need for a healthcare model that provides real-time data on utilization, quality, and cost. Furthermore, there is a long-felt need for collection of medical and psychosocial data and to enhance machine learning (ML) algorithms that analyze and predict future population risks and cost-saving opportunities in any given geography.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, there is a long-felt need in the healthcare industry for a healthcare solution that improves patient compliance, satisfaction, and health outcomes, that removes barriers to healthcare and closes gaps in quality, that reduces emergency room visits and in-patient admissions and re-admissions, that increases patient, physician, and health insurance company satisfaction, and that achieves the elusive goal of cost-effective, quality care among patient populations that generate some of the highest costs incurred by healthcare companies.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further disclosed in the detailed description of the invention. This summary is not intended to determine the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The system and the computer-implemented method disclosed herein address the above-recited needs for an at-home evaluation, management, and emergency room diversion system and method that optimizes home-visit appointments and related travel for delivering superior patient care as well as significant savings to health insurance providers while capturing real-time data on utilization, quality, and cost. The system and the computer-implemented method provide a healthcare solution that improves patient compliance, satisfaction, and health outcomes, that removes barriers to healthcare and closes gaps in quality, that reduces emergency room visits and in-patient admissions and re-admissions, that increases patient, physician, and health insurance company satisfaction, and that achieves the elusive goal of cost-effective, quality care among patient populations that generate some of the highest costs incurred by healthcare companies. Moreover, the system and the computer-implemented method employ machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that analyze and predict future population risks and cost-saving opportunities in any given geography. The system and the computer-implemented method manage delivery of medical care through a comprehensive, continuous, coordinated, and technologically advanced system delivered to the most complex, costly, and chronically ill patients, extending the reach of an overburdened healthcare delivery system. The system and the computer-implemented method employ technology to bridge the gaps between patients, primary and specialty care, and third-party payers in the government and private sectors and focuses on healthcare value comprising access, care management/coordination, member compliance/adherence, and closing quality care gaps. The system and the computer-implemented method also employ technology to bridge the divide between clinical primary care and managed care case management. The system and the computer-implemented method manage patient care that focuses on continuity, coordination, and integration of care by blending medical, psychosocial, and behavioral care, bridging primary care with case management, and improving telemedicine. The system and the computer-implemented method employ leading edge technology to bring patient care into the home and areas remote from typical brick and mortar facilities.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The system and the computer-implemented method disclosed herein provide a remote examination experience that approximates a doctor-present exam by providing a telemedicine scenario in which physicians not only see and hear patients remotely, but also conduct in-depth screenings and exams using hospital-grade, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-registered diagnostic equipment deployed by trained onsite care coordinators (OCCs) acting as the &#x201c;physician's hands&#x201d; at a patient location. The remote examination experience integrates the behavioral, social, and medical components of healthcare. The system and the computer-implemented method collect data in real time, measure trends using a predictive model, initiate solutions to reverse negative trends using machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, and optimize capitation models for healthcare providers and insurance providers. In separate embodiments, the system and the computer-implemented method provide a remote, high-touch patient examination mode where doctors, who are part of the healthcare providers, view data from a patient's location in real time through a telehealth bridge from their offices to a telehealth kit at the patient's location; and a telehealth mode where real-time data is not necessary, for example, for follow-ups, prescription refills, and routine check-ins. For example, chronic care management (CCM) programs include a mix of the remote, high-touch patient examination mode and the telehealth mode that work together to utilize and optimize available resources based on a patient's needs. A patient-care solution that merely uses telehealth is not the same as the real physical data collected in real time during at-home or onsite visits, which is an integral part of the system and the computer-implemented method disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The system and the computer-implemented method disclosed herein provide a proprietary appointment scheduling system that maximizes provider capacity across locations using proprietary algorithms. In effect, this allows one doctor to make multiple home visits concurrently. The system and the computer-implemented method collect medical and psychosocial data configured to be used in machine learning algorithms for analyzing and predicting future population risks and cost-saving opportunities. Given the fixed costs of hospitalization and re-hospitalization of patients with chronic conditions, emergency room (ER) visits, and an overall 80% budget spent on the population that uses ERs as the primary care, in an embodiment, the system and the computer-implemented method compute return on investment (ROI) by comparing a cohort of patients using the system to a few slices of similar cohorts from the same or even different plans, and clustering by similar age, conditions, and other social determinants of health. Given the cohort of patients, the system and the computer-implemented method create a home-visit appointment schedule according to the risk, among other factors, and attempts to cover visits to the most critical patients first, reducing unnecessary burden on the health system.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The system and the computer-implemented method disclosed herein employ an appointment optimization and route planning system (AORPS) that defines computer program instructions executable by at least one processor for optimizing home-visit appointments and related travel for delivering patient care. The processor(s) is communicatively coupled to a non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium configured to store the computer program instructions and data defined and collected by the AORPS. Moreover, the system disclosed herein comprises one or more appointment scheduling modules, a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) module and a mapping module. The mapping module is configured to receive location input from the GNSS module. In an embodiment, the mapping module is a mapping module. The AORPS optimizes home-visit appointments and related travel for delivering patient care using algorithms comprising, for example, one or more of decision trees, machine learning models, and regression models.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The appointment optimization and route planning system (AORPS) receives registration data and patient data from patients. The AORPS also receives client input comprising, for example, information about healthcare providers and onsite care coordinators such as their hours of availability; health plan commitments; appointment types; and a success rate of operation, from a client. The client is, for example, an administrator of a healthcare company that coordinates with the healthcare providers and the onsite care coordinators for the home-visit appointments. The AORPS receives the registration data and the patient data from the patients and the client input from the client through the appointment scheduling modules via a network, for example, the internet. The AORPS provides a user interface, for example, a web interface or a mobile application (app) interface, on the appointment scheduling modules for the patients and the client to input data depending on an electronic device used by the patients and the client to communicate with the appointment scheduling modules via the network. The AORPS collates the received patient data to capture information, for example, about the patients' addresses, comorbidities, social and/or psychosocial determinants of health, religious beliefs, family status, gender, communities to which the patients belong, outstanding traits, insurance plans, insurance plan needs, and other relevant data in accordance with standard ontologies of health-related information for delivering relevant patient care, for clustering similar patients, and for matching appropriate healthcare providers and onsite care coordinators to each patient.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The appointment optimization and route planning system (AORPS) generates an input matrix based on the client input and the collated patient data, covering a preconfigured period of time, for example, thirty days. The input matrix comprises, for example, schedules of the healthcare providers and the onsite care coordinators, patient cohorts, expected minimum daily and maximum monthly volumes of appointments, and success rates of the appointments. The AORPS generates a predictive model for appointments, capitation, and return on investment for delivering patient care based on training data comprising, for example, appointment history, patient history, feedback, and healthcare data. The AORPS generates an appointment schedule with travel routes via the mapping module, which communicates with the global navigation satellite system module to map out the travel routes as determined by the AORPS. The AORPS generates the appointment schedule with the travel routes dynamically based on optimization factors derived from the received client input, the collated patient data, the generated input matrix, the healthcare data, and the generated predictive model, incorporating real-time changes in the patient data, the client input, the optimization factors, and appointments.

The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>generates the appointment schedule considering the physical locations of the patients obtained from the collated patient data as one of the factors among other optimization factors. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>uses the physical addresses of the patients corresponding to each appointment that involves onsite visits by the onsite care coordinators to have travel routes mapped out optimally by the mapping module <b>104</b>, ensuring greatest possible coverage of patients given the availability and locations of the onsite care coordinators.

The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>generates the appointment schedule with the travel routes dynamically based on optimization factors derived from the received client input, the collated patient data, the generated input matrix, the healthcare data, and the generated predictive model. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>generates the appointment schedule with the travel routes dynamically by incorporating real-time changes in the patient data, the client input, the optimization factors, and appointments. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>also optimizes the number of visits per month for each of the patients based on the optimization factors in the generation of the appointment schedule.

Patient care needs comprise, for example, comorbidities, specific chronic conditions that are gleaned from either electronic medical records (EMR) or patient intake forms that are part of the patient data, insurance plan requirements and guidelines, suggested cadence or visit pattern of appointments, equipment required in patient care for each patient, and knowledge of any healthcare programs in which a patient is enrolled, for example, urgent care on demand, continuum of care based on a primary care provider (PCP) mode, and/or continuum of care based on chronic care management (CCM) programs. The optimization factors further comprise, for example, addresses of the patients, social and/or psychosocial determinants of health of the patients for clustering patients with similar determinants, religious beliefs, family status, gender, community to which a patient belongs, and outstanding traits for matching appropriate healthcare providers and onsite care coordinators to each patient. Furthermore, the optimization factors comprise, for example, information on insurance plans and insurance plan needs for clustering patients similar in that regard, availability of the healthcare providers and the onsite care coordinators, driving distances to the locations of the patients to minimize driving, and acceptance and rejections of scheduled appointments by the patients for rescheduling appointments that are rejected by the patients. Furthermore, the optimization factors comprise, for example, an appointment cancellation probability for each patient based on historical data about visit cancellation or absence in the past and patient data such as age, gender, social status, etc. The algorithms, including machine learning algorithms, underlying the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>do not receive any information in the training data that cast patients into stereotypes or otherwise induce frivolous decisions when calculating the appointment cancellation probabilities. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>takes into account practical considerations, for example, medical issues with memory retention, prior history both with the system <b>100</b> and outside as gleaned from EMRs, and free-form self reports submitted by the patients themselves.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>makes the generated appointment schedule with the travel routes available to the appointment scheduling modules <b>102</b>.

Patient care comprising, for example, diagnostics, medical procedures, and prescriptions in the home-visit appointments are carried out by the onsite care coordinators and/or the healthcare providers based on a mode of appointment through prevailing telemedicine practices. Medical kits and diagnostic equipment that the onsite care coordinators use at the patient's location during a home-visit appointment and that are suited for use with the appointment optimization and route planning system (AORPS) <b>106</b> and with telemedicine in general find examples in the Applicant's non-provisional patent application titled &#x201c;Medical Diagnostic Kit&#x201d;, U.S. application Ser.

The mode of appointment is based on the patient care needs, which is one of the criteria in the optimization factors. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>assigns a remote high-touch patient examination mode to those home-visit appointments where vital signs need to be monitored and involved diagnostics and medical procedures need to be done with a healthcare provider in attendance. In home-visit appointments with a remote, high-touch patient examination mode, the feedback that the data reception module <b>106</b><i>a </i>receives comprises data transmitted in real time during the home-visit appointment that the data reception module <b>106</b><i>a </i>then passes to the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c</i>.

The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>uses this feedback along with medical records of the patients, appointment and patient history, and healthcare data as training data for model training to subsequently generate the predictive model. In the initial stages for a new patient, when no feedback or appointment history is available yet, the feedback portion of the training data will not be available and the model training is performed based on the patient history obtained from the collated patient data and based on the client input and the healthcare data. In an embodiment, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>also obtains the healthcare data from the database(s) <b>106</b><i>d </i>or from the trusted sources <b>120</b> through the data reception module <b>106</b><i>a</i>. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>generates the predictive model by analyzing the training data using algorithms comprising, for example, decision trees, machine learning, and regression models.

The historical data comprises, for example, feedback from the patients, the healthcare providers, the onsite care coordinators, and the client about fulfilled home-visit appointments, and data about acceptance or rejection of scheduled appointments, visit cancellation, absence for a scheduled home visit, changes in appointments or patient data by the patients, etc. Where such requisite prior data is not available, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>uses the collated patient data and the client input that the data reception module <b>106</b><i>a </i>receives and the healthcare information that the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>accesses from the database(s) <b>106</b><i>d </i>and/or directly from the trusted sources <b>120</b> via the network <b>118</b> to the extent that they serve as useful input.

Furthermore, the predictive model computes global savings from implementing healthcare programs, for example, urgent care, the primary care provider (PCP) program, the chronic care management (CCM) programs, etc. The predictive model also computes return on investment (ROI) for insurance plans and capitation projections for the insurance plans, the healthcare providers, and the onsite care coordinators. Furthermore, the predictive model predicts patient behaviors at various stages of the patient care process, including, for example, calculating appointment cancellation probabilities for the patients, and predicts potential outcomes and impacts of cohort analysis on capitation models. Therefore, the predictive model that the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>generates comprises, for example, predicted patient behaviors, suggested cadence of appointments for each of the patients, predicted equipment requirements, appointment cancellation probabilities for each of the patients, potential outcomes, expected costs, capitation projections for insurance plans, and ROI for the insurance plans. Furthermore, the predictive model forms clusters of patients based on the collated patient data, the client input, the feedback in the training data, social and psychosocial determinants of health of the patients, insurance plans of the patients, and insurance plan needs of the patients.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, in communication with the data reception module <b>106</b><i>a</i>, which provides a computer-aided web or mobile application interface to a patient while receiving patient data to match the data with standard ontologies in healthcare, the predictive model predicts related and possible health issues a patient may have based on the inputs of the patient in the patient data and the corresponding matches with standard ontologies that the data reception module <b>106</b><i>a </i>makes. Based on the patient data and the corresponding matches with the standard ontologies, the predictive model also predicts patient needs in terms of appointment type comfortable with and equipment required for the patient during a home-visit, for example, blood pressure measurement tools, electrocardiogram (ECG) tools, etc.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In an embodiment, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>computes a visit priority for each patient considering factors comprising, for example, patient needs and an appointment acceptance probability for each patient. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>calculates visit priorities based on a risk of an acute episode for a given patient. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>gauges the chances of an acute risk using information about a patient such as chronic conditions, current state of health, lab test results including how old the lab results are, prescribed drugs and how the patient follows prescriptions, and time of the last doctor visit. In the case of absence of time data, the worst case is assumed, for example, that a doctor was last seen more than a year ago, lab tests have expired, etc. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>uses the predictive model, trained on open-source and custom collected data, for a risk prediction. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>predicts risk in the form of a function describing acute episode probability that varies with time. Along with an appointment acceptance probability for each patient, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>also computes a rejection probability for each patient using historical data about visit cancellation and/or absence in the past.

An exemplary sequence of steps is as follows. At first, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>populates a list of constraints that constitute requirements of the appointment schedule as exemplarily disclosed below:</p><p id="p-0061" num="0000">(a) One requirement is that the appointment schedule should match a visit pattern of the patient. This pattern depends on patient conditions and history. For example, after a cardiovascular attack, a patient should be checked every week and, after a while, every month. Another example is that of an initial health check that is performed right after the patient registers with the system <b>100</b>.<br/>(b) Another requirement is that a home visit to a patient with a high appointment cancellation probability should be planned with some delay to give the patient time to respond and prepare for the home visit. This rule does not work for patients with high acute state risk and/or for the first visit after registration of a patient.<br/>(c) Another requirement is that an appointment type and a list of equipment should match recommendations for a particular patient.<br/>(d) Another requirement is that a home visit to a patient with a high acute state risk should be scheduled as early as possible.<br/>(e) Another requirement is that the time of a home visit should match availability preferences of the patient, the onsite care coordinators, and/or the healthcare provider involved in the home visit.<br/>(f) Yet another requirement is that time to perform all home visits for a single day by a particular onsite care coordinator and/or healthcare provider, including traveling time to the first home visit and back from the last home visit, should not exceed a working day.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">After building the list of constraints, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>manifests optimization goals through a function to optimize. These goals are, for example, home visits with higher priority should happen earlier; and total time to perform all home visits should be as small as possible. To obtain an optimal solution matching described constraints, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>builds a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>uses a set of variables to indicate paths of travel of onsite care coordinators, presence of healthcare providers, and other parameters. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>manifests constraints through linear equalities and inequalities. The function for optimization is then a sum of home visit times weighted by visit priorities. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>solves the MIP problem built above using both standard and custom algorithms comprising, for example, branch-and-cut, genetic, heuristic, and other algorithms. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>calculates an optimal home-visit plan through a month starting from the current date. To ensure periodic schedule recalculation to match changes, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>recalculates the home-visit plan every day to follow changes in patient needs and healthcare provider and onsite care coordinator availability.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">After solving the appointment scheduling problem, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c</i>, in communication with the appointment scheduling modules <b>102</b> and the data reception module <b>106</b><i>a</i>, uses algorithms to coordinate and respond to interactions among the system <b>100</b>, the patients, the client, the healthcare coordinators, and the onsite care coordinators. An exemplary sequence of steps is as follows:</p><p id="p-0064" num="0000">(a) To inform the patients, the healthcare providers, and the onsite care coordinators about a recommended home-visit schedule, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c</i>, via the appointment scheduling modules <b>102</b>, sends the generated appointment schedule to the healthcare providers and the onsite care coordinators. At the same time, the appointment scheduling modules <b>102</b> send invitations for home-visit appointments to the patients.<br/>(b) The healthcare providers and the onsite care coordinators view bookings as soon as the appointment scheduling modules <b>102</b> publish the appointment schedule via a web or a mobile application interface that the data reception module <b>106</b><i>a </i>provides on the appointment scheduling modules <b>102</b>. The appointment scheduling modules <b>102</b> allow the healthcare providers and the onsite care coordinators to accept any home-visit that is suggested in the appointment schedule and confirmed by the corresponding patient. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>is configured to invalidate a booking if the corresponding patient does not accept the booking, for example, at least two hours in advance of the start of the appointment. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>reschedules unaccepted appointments in the next computation cycle.<br/>(c) To dynamically update the appointment schedule according to feedback from the patients, the healthcare providers, and the onsite care coordinators, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>updates the appointment schedule with patient responses to invitations. If a particular patient confirms his or her appointment, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>fixes the appointment during all appointment schedule updates. If a patient rejects an invitation, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>removes the corresponding appointment for the home visit from further updates to the appointment schedule.<br/>(d) If the data reception module <b>106</b><i>a</i>, via the appointment scheduling modules <b>102</b>, does not receive a response to an invitation from the corresponding patient, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c</i>, via the appointment scheduling modules <b>102</b>, resends the invitation periodically. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>decreases the corresponding visit priority for the home-visit appointment each time the patient does not respond to the invitation. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>repeats this cycle until a predetermined threshold time before a home visit. The predetermined threshold time depends on, for example, the appointment type, number of participants, and other factors. If the data reception module <b>106</b><i>a </i>does not receive a response from the patient before the threshold time, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>cancels the home-visit appointment. In an embodiment, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>sends details of the cancelled home-visit appointment to the client's resources to schedule the home visit manually.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>computes return on investment (ROI) by comparing the cohort of patients using the appointment optimization and route planning system (AORPS) <b>106</b> with a few slices of similar cohorts with both similar and different health plans, and clustering patients, for example, by similar age, conditions, and other social determinants of health. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>generates the appointment schedule according to risk in an attempt to cover home-visits to the most critical patients first, reducing unnecessary burden on the health system.

illustration, daily scheduling of appointments for onsite care coordinators and travel for the day performed by an embodiment of the appointment optimization and route planning system (AORPS) <b>106</b> follows the following steps. At the beginning of each working day, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>generates an appointment schedule for the onsite care coordinators for all home-visit appointments for the day. To generate the appointment schedule, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>considers all appointments including those requested by patients and those planned by the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>for the day and confirmed by corresponding patients. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>then optimizes the appointments based on optimization factors to generate the appointment schedule. At first, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>adds two fake appointments with zero duration and with location as the office of the client availing the services of the AORPS <b>106</b> to represent the beginning, that is, the source of the working day, and the end, that is, the target of the working day. Next, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>creates an appointment graph according to a rule, for example: two appointments are adjacent to each other if the end time of the first appointment plus time to drive to the second appointment is less than the start time of the second appointment AND no more appointments could be served between these two appointments. Then, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>replaces all nodes of the appointment graph except the source node and the target node by a pair of nodes with a single edge between them. Next, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>defines a parameter, demand, and assigns the source node demand a number equal to (&#x2212;1) times the number of onsite care coordinators (OCCs) and a target node demand a number equal to the number of onsite care coordinators. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>assigns capacity and weight parameters to the edges in the appointment graph. All edges get capacity 1 and weight &#x2212;1. The output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>then executes a min-cost-max-flow algorithm to produce a flow between the source and the target. Every thread in this flow represents a route for a single onsite care coordinator. Unit-capacity edges, with a capacity 1, between split nodes guarantee that every node is visited once. A weight of &#x2212;1 for all edges forces the algorithm to visit as many appointments as possible. During a day, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>executes the algorithm every time the list of appointments is changed. In this case, appointments already visited and completed are excluded. Furthermore, the algorithm takes into account any additional information by removing some edges. For example, if an onsite care coordinator reports a breakdown of a vehicle and a requirement of three hours to repair the vehicle, the algorithm removes all edges from the onsite care coordinator's current location to appointments before three hours from the present. Every hour, the output generation module <b>106</b><i>c </i>performs appointment bookings for appointments starting, for example, two to three hours from the present.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0064">Along with hardware, computer applications and programs are used for operating the appointment optimization and route planning system (AORPS) <b>106</b> disclosed herein.

At least one processor <b>107</b> communicatively coupled to the non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium, for example, the memory unit <b>105</b> exemplarily illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, executes the computer program instructions of the AORPS <b>106</b> for performing the method for optimizing home-visit appointments and related travel for delivering patient care. Moreover, the AORPS <b>106</b> communicates with one or more appointment scheduling modules <b>102</b>, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) module <b>103</b>, and the mapping module <b>104</b> exemplarily illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The AORPS <b>106</b> communicates with a client, for example, an administrator in a healthcare company availing the services of the AORPS <b>106</b>, patients using the AORPS <b>106</b> via the client, and healthcare providers and onsite care coordinators involved in delivering patient care to the patients through the appointment scheduling modules <b>102</b>. The client coordinates with the healthcare providers and the onsite care coordinators for the home-visit appointments. The AORPS <b>106</b> provides a web interface or a mobile application (app) interface on the appointment scheduling modules <b>102</b> for the patients and the client to input data depending on the electronic devices used by the patients and the client to communicate with the appointment scheduling modules <b>102</b> via the network <b>118</b> exemplarily illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The AORPS <b>106</b> also communicates with the client via the client device <b>119</b> provided to the client for communicating with the appointment scheduling modules <b>102</b>. The client device <b>119</b> is dedicated for use in healthcare and comprises a preinstalled, graphical user interface (GUI) or another interactive user interface provided by the AORPS <b>106</b>. The AORPS <b>106</b> optimizes travel to locations of the patients for onsite appointments utilizing maps and live locational information, traffic conditions, weather conditions, etc., through the mapping module <b>104</b>. The mapping module <b>104</b> is in operable communication with the GNSS module <b>103</b>, for example, a global positioning system (GPS) unit.

The registration data comprises information required of a patient to create an account on the AORPS <b>106</b>. The patient subsequently communicates with the AORPS <b>106</b> through the account, thereby allowing the AORPS <b>106</b> to associate all communication and data exchanged with the patient with his or her account. The registration data comprises identification details, for example, an email address and/or a phone number of the patient or a representative of the patient. Moreover, the registration data comprises, for example, an alphanumeric password chosen by the patient or the representative of the patient that meets acceptable standards of security that the AORPS <b>106</b> conveys to the patient while receiving the registration data. In an embodiment, the AORPS <b>106</b> also accepts a passkey, two-factor authentication information using a software authenticator application or a hardware key, phone authentication through messaging or phone calls with one-time-passcodes, etc., instead of a password. The patient data comprises, for example, age, gender, profession, location, lists of chronic health conditions, medical history, healthcare programs enrolled by the patients, for example, urgent care on demand, a primary care provider (PCP) program, and/or a chronic care management (CCM) program, free-form self-reports about current health, reasons for requiring medical attention, clinical notes and other medical history, emergency contact information of trusted contacts, preferred time bounds to interact with healthcare providers and onsite care coordinators involved in patient care during home-visit appointments, and payment information. The AORPS <b>106</b> matches input from the patients, while receiving the patient data in real time, with standard ontologies of health-related information to provide input suggestions to the patients while receiving the patient data.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0070">The appointment optimization and route planning system (AORPS) <b>106</b> receives <b>202</b> client input from the client to schedule home-visit appointments with healthcare providers and onsite care coordinators for the patients under its care. The client input comprises, for example, information about hours of availability of healthcare providers and onsite care coordinators, appointment types, health plan commitments, and a success rate of operation. The appointment types comprise, for example, four scenarios of appointments: appointments with only the healthcare providers remotely available, appointments with only the onsite care coordinators remotely available, appointments with only the onsite care coordinators visiting onsite, and appointments with the healthcare providers remotely available and with the onsite care coordinators visiting onsite. As part of the health plan commitments, the client input comprises a list of patients from healthcare plans of the client and patients referred by primary care providers (PCP) attached to the healthcare plans. The success rate of operation is the rate of successful fulfillment of appointments scheduled for home visits. The AORPS <b>106</b> collates <b>203</b> the received patient data to capture information about patients' addresses, comorbidities, chronic conditions, current state of health of each patient, lab test results with dates, prescribed medication and adherence of each patient to their prescriptions, and time of last visit to a doctor by each patient. In an embodiment, in collating the patient data, the AORPS <b>106</b> captures and organizes social and/or psychosocial determinants of health, religious beliefs, family status, gender, community to which each patient belongs, outstanding traits, insurance plans, insurance plan needs, and other relevant data for clustering similar patients and for matching appropriate healthcare providers and onsite care coordinators to each patient.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0071">The appointment optimization and route planning system (AORPS) <b>106</b> generates <b>204</b> an input matrix based on the received client input and the collated patient data, covering a preconfigured period of time, for example, thirty days. The input matrix comprises schedules of the healthcare providers and the onsite care coordinators, patient cohorts, expected minimum daily and maximum monthly volumes of appointments, and success rates of the appointments. The AORPS <b>106</b> generates <b>205</b> a predictive model for appointments, capitation, and return on investment (ROI) for delivering patient care based on training data comprising appointment history, patient history, feedback, and healthcare data. The AORPS <b>106</b> receives feedback from the patients, the client, the healthcare providers, and the onsite care coordinators after home-visit appointments. This feedback is used as part of the training data for generating and updating the predictive model. For the first appointments where feedback is not yet available, the AORPS <b>106</b> trains the predictive model using patient history obtained from the collated patient data, the client input, and the healthcare data. The healthcare data comprises, for example, healthcare information of cohorts similar to the patients in terms of demographics and comorbidities, costs of healthcare implementations in a country, and insurance information that the AORPS <b>106</b> obtains from trusted sources <b>120</b> exemplarily illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and verified sources and that is maintained to be current with prevailing circumstances.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0072">The appointment optimization and route planning system (AORPS) <b>106</b> generates <b>206</b> an appointment schedule with travel routes dynamically based on optimization factors derived from the received client input, the collated patient data, the generated input matrix, the healthcare data, and the generated predictive model. The optimization factors comprise, for example, patient care needs comprising comorbidities of the patients, specific chronic conditions derived from either electronic medical records (EMRs) or patient intake forms, insurance plan requirements and guidelines, suggested cadence, this is, visit pattern, of appointments, equipment required for each appointment, appointment cancellation probability of each patient based on historical data about visit cancellation or absence in the past, patient data such as age, gender, social status, etc., addresses of the patients, social and/or psychosocial determinants of health of the patients for clustering similar patients, religious beliefs, family status, gender, community to which each patient belongs, and outstanding traits for matching healthcare providers and onsite care coordinators to each patient, insurance plans and insurance plan needs for clustering similar patients, availability of the healthcare providers and the onsite care coordinators, minimization of driving for the home-visit appointments, and acceptance and rejections of scheduled appointments by the patients for rescheduling of the appointments in cases of rejection of the scheduled appointments.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0073">In an embodiment, the appointment optimization and route planning system (AORPS) <b>106</b> assigns a mode of appointment to each appointment in the generated appointment schedule based on the patient care needs that are a part of the optimization factors. For home-visit appointments where live monitoring and transfer of real-time data is essential for healthcare providers to provide patient care with onsite care coordinators at the patients' locations, the AORPS <b>106</b> assigns a remote, high-touch patient examination mode. In a home-visit appointment with the remote, high-touch patient examination mode, healthcare providers, situated at their offices, remotely view data from a patient's location in real time through a telehealth bridge to a telehealth kit that onsite care coordinators use at the patient's location. For home-visit appointments where real-time data transmission is not essential, for example, for follow-ups, prescription refills, and routine check-ins, the AORPS <b>106</b> assigns a telehealth mode. Chronic care management (CCM) programs, for example, include a mix of the remote, high-touch patient examination mode and the telehealth mode that work together to utilize and optimize available resources based on a patients' needs.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0074">The appointment optimization and route planning system (AORPS) <b>106</b> sends the generated appointment schedule with the travel routes to the client and relevant appointment information from the appointment schedule to corresponding patients.
