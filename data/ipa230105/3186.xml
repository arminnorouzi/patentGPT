However, no solution is disclosed for satisfying both of enhancing preciseness of erosion-resistant overcoat of a wind turbine blade and suppression of damage to be caused by collision of a spray material to a base material.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0012">According to Patent Documents 2 and 3, not being specified as a technology for a wind turbine blade, surface characteristics such as wear-resistance are improved by forming a spray film on a fiber-reinforced plastic surface as a top coat. However, no countermeasure is disclosed as a technology to form a spray film precisely required for a top coat. Further, the intermediate layer is limited to be burnt by being formed in an electric furnace.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0013">In this regard, it is an object of at least one embodiment of the present invention to improve erosion-resistant performance of a wind turbine blade without impairing functions of a base material.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">(1) A wind turbine blade according to at least one embodiment of the present invention includes a base member formed of FRP and having a blade shape; an intermediate layer arranged on the base member and formed of metal, cermet, ceramic, or a mixture of at least one thereof and resin as a major constituent; and an erosion-resistant overcoat arranged on the intermediate layer and formed of a spray film having a porosity of 5% or lower.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0015">Here, &#x201c;porosity&#x201d; is an index indicating a ratio of pore portions to an entire spray film including solid portions and the pore portions. The lower the porosity is, the higher the preciseness of the spray film is. &#x201c;Porosity&#x201d; may be obtained by analyzing an image taken by observing a section of a spray film, for example, with an optical microscope, SEM, or the like and calculating a value from an area ratio of pore portions with respect to the entire image.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0016">Here, in the intermediate layer, the content rate of metal, cermet, ceramic, or the mixture is higher than that of the other constituents.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0017">According to the configuration described above as (1), the erosion-resistant overcoat formed of a spray film having a porosity of 5% or lower is arranged on the base member of the wind turbine blade via the intermediate layer. Thus, since the precise spray film capable of exerting an excellent erosion-resistant performance is arranged on the surface of the FRP-made base member via the intermediate layer, erosion-resistant performance of the wind turbine blade can be extremely improved.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0018">When a spray film is formed on the base member that is relatively large as for the wind turbine blade, the operation efficiency can be improved if the operation can be performed in the atmosphere. When forming of a spray film is performed in the air, a reaction time with oxygen is to be shortened to the extent possible, for example, by spraying particles of a spray material onto a base member at high velocity to suppress generation of an oxide film due to reaction between oxygen in the air and the spray material. According to the above, it is possible to form a precise spray film having a low porosity and high adhesion to the base member. However, if such a precise spray film is formed directly on the base member, the surface of the base member may be damaged. In this regard, with the method described above as (1), since the intermediate layer is interposed between the base member and the erosion-resistant overcoat, it is possible to suppress damage occurring on the surface of the base member by spraying for forming the erosion-resistant overcoat. Accordingly, erosion-resistant performance of the wind turbine blade can be extremely improved without deteriorating functions of the base member.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0019">(2) In some embodiments, in the configuration described above as (1), the spray film forming the erosion-resistant overcoat is formed of cobalt alloy or cermet including at least one of alumina, tungsten carbide, silicon nitride, silicon carbide, zirconia, or chrome carbide.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0020">According to the configuration described above as (2), the erosion-resistant overcoat can be formed of a material having high hardness and high abrasion resistance such as cobalt alloy or cermet including a ceramic material.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0021">(3) In some embodiments, in the configuration described above as (1) or (2), the intermediate layer includes an intermediate spray film having a higher porosity than that of the spray film forming the erosion-resistant overcoat.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0022">According to the configuration described above as (3), the intermediate layer that includes the intermediate spray film having a higher porosity than that of the spray film forming the erosion-resistant overcoat is arranged between the base member and the erosion-resistant overcoat. That is, the precise erosion-resistant overcoat having a low porosity is arranged at the outermost circumference and the intermediate spray film having a relatively high porosity is arranged between the erosion-resistant overcoat and the base member. Accordingly, since the intermediate spray film can be formed at spray velocity lower than spray velocity at which the erosion-resistant overcoat, for example, having a porosity of 5% or lower is formed, it is possible to efficiently suppress occurrence of damage on the surface of the base member by spraying for forming the intermediate layer (intermediate spray film).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0023">(4) In some embodiments, in the configuration described above as (3), a ratio of the porosity of the intermediate spray film to the porosity of the spray film forming the erosion-resistant overcoat is 3 or higher.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0024">According to the configuration described above as (4), the intermediate layer is formed of the intermediate spray film having a porosity more than three times higher than a porosity of the spray film forming the erosion-resistant overcoat. That is, since the erosion-resistant overcoat is formed to have a porosity being one third or lower than that of the intermediate layer, the precise erosion-resistant overcoat can be formed at the outermost circumference in arrangement that porosities are lowered in stages from the surface of the base member, as described above as (3).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0025">(5) In some embodiments, in the configuration described above as (3) or (4), the porosity of the spray film forming the erosion-resistant overcoat is 3% or lower, and the porosity of the intermediate spray film is 6% or higher.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0026">According to the configuration described above as (5), the intermediate layer is formed of the intermediate spray film having a porosity of 6% or higher, and the erosion-resistant overcoat is formed of the spray film having a porosity of 3% or lower. Thus, as described as (3) or (4), according to the configuration described above as (5) as well, the precise erosion-resistant overcoat can be formed at the outermost circumference in arrangement that porosities are lowered in stages from the surface of the base member.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0027">(6) In some embodiments, in the configuration described above as any one of (3) to (5), the intermediate spray film is formed of cermet including at least one of alumina, tungsten carbide, silicon nitride, silicon carbide, zirconia, or chrome carbide or metal including at least one of cobalt alloy, stainless steel, steel, titanium, copper, or aluminum.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0028">According to the configuration described above as (6), the intermediate layer can be formed of a material having high abrasion resistance such as cermet including a ceramic material and metal including cobalt alloy and the like.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0029">(7) In some embodiments, in the configuration described above as (1) or (2), the intermediate layer includes a metal tape.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0030">According to the configuration described above as (7), the metal tape can be adopted as the intermediate layer arranged between the base member and the erosion-resistant overcoat. That is, the intermediate layer can be easily formed with a simple method to fix the metal tape onto the base member.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0031">Here, the metal tape may be fixed to the base member using an adhesive layer previously formed at the metal tape or using separately prepared adhesive.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0032">(8) In some embodiments, in the configuration described above as any one of (1) to (7), the base member has a larger surface roughness Ra at a region which is covered with the intermediate layer and the erosion-resistant overcoat than that at a region which is not covered with the intermediate layer and the erosion-resistant overcoat.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0033">According to the configuration described above as (8), owing to that the surface roughness Ra of the base member at the region covered with the intermediate layer and the erosion-resistant overcoat is set relatively large, adhesion of the intermediate layer onto the surface of the base member can be improved.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0034">Here, as a method to set the surface roughness Ra of the base member at the region to be covered with the intermediate layer and the erosion-resistant overcoat at an appropriate value, a blast finishing may be performed on the surface of the base member at the region.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0035">Here, specific numerical range of the surface roughness Ra of the base member at the region covered with the intermediate layer and the erosion-resistant overcoat is not specifically limited and, for example, a relation of &#x201c;0.2 &#x3bc;m&#x2264;Ra&#x2264;20 &#x3bc;m&#x201d; may be satisfied.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0036">(9) In some embodiments, in the configuration described above as any one of (1) to (8), a level difference between a surface of a forming region of the erosion-resistant overcoat of the wind turbine blade and a surface of the wind turbine blade adjacent to the erosion-resistant overcoat outside the forming region is smaller than a total thickness of the erosion-resistant overcoat and the intermediate layer.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0037">According to the configuration described above as (9), the level difference between the surface of the forming region of the erosion-resistant overcoat and the surface of the wind turbine blade adjacent to the erosion-resistant overcoat outside the forming region is lessened, so that aerodynamic characteristic deterioration of the wind turbine blade caused by arranging the erosion-resistant overcoat can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0038">Here, the total thickness of the erosion-resistant overcoat and the intermediate layer may be 0.4 mm or smaller, and may be, for example, between 0.2 mm and 0.3 mm inclusive. When the total thickness of the erosion-resistant overcoat and the intermediate layer is 0.4 mm or smaller, aerodynamic characteristic deterioration can be suppressed by setting the level difference to 0.3 mm or smaller.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0039">(10) In some embodiments, in the configuration described above as any one of (1) to (9), a surface of the base member in a forming region of the erosion-resistant overcoat of the wind turbine blade is lowered with respect to a surface of the base member outside the forming region.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0040">According to the configuration described above as (10), owing to that the surface of the base member in the forming region of the erosion-resistant overcoat is lowered, the level difference at the boundary of the forming region of the erosion-resistant overcoat is lessened, so that aerodynamic characteristic deterioration of the wind turbine blade caused by arranging the erosion-resistant overcoat can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0041">(11) In some embodiments, in the configuration described above as any one of (1) to (10), the wind turbine blade further includes a slope member arranged on the base member as being adjacent to the erosion-resistant overcoat, the slope member having thickness decreasing as being apart from a boundary with a forming region of the erosion-resistant overcoat, and the level difference is lessened by the slope member.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0042">According to the configuration described above as (11), owing to that the slope member is arranged adjacent to the erosion-resistant overcoat, the level difference at the boundary of the forming region of the erosion-resistant overcoat is lessened, so that aerodynamic characteristic deterioration of the wind turbine blade caused by arranging the erosion-resistant overcoat can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0043">Here, it is also possible to lessen the level difference at the boundary of the forming region of the erosion-resistant overcoat by combining the configuration described above as (10) and the configuration described above as (11).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0044">(12) In some embodiments, in the configuration described above as any one of (1) to (11), the intermediate layer and the erosion-resistant overcoat are formed on a surface of the base member having the blade shape at least at a region on a blade distal end side and/or a region on a leading edge side of the wind turbine blade.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0045">According to the configuration described above as (12), it is possible to arrange the intermediate layer including metal, cermet, ceramic, or a mixture of at least one thereof and resin as a major constituent and the erosion-resistant overcoat formed of a spray film at a region of the wind turbine blade on the blade distal end side and/or the leading edge side being most easily influenced by deterioration or damage due to erosion.

Since well-known technologies can be applied as the method for forming the base member <b>30</b> using FRP and configuration of the base member <b>30</b>, detailed description thereof is omitted.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0077">The intermediate layer <b>42</b> is formed of metal, cermet, ceramic, or a mixture of at least one thereof and resin as a major constituent.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0078">The intermediate layer <b>42</b> forms the first layer of the wind turbine blade protector <b>40</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>) formed on a surface of the base member <b>30</b> and serves as a protecting layer (base layer) formed on the base member <b>30</b> before forming the erosion-resistant overcoat <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0079">The intermediate layer <b>42</b> is excellent in hardness, abrasion resistance, heat resistance, and the like when ceramic is used as a major constituent, and in toughness when metal is used as a major constituent. When cermet in which metal binder is added to ceramic is used as a major constituent, it is possible to form the intermediate layer <b>42</b> having higher hardness than metal and higher toughness and chip-proof properties than ceramic.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0080">The intermediate layer <b>42</b> may contain various additives other than the major constituent being one of metal, cermet, ceramic, and the mixture.

For example, when the intermediate layer <b>42</b> includes metal, cermet, or ceramic as a major constituent, the intermediate layer <b>42</b> is formed with electric spraying such as arc spraying and plasma spraying.

Thus, since the precise spray film capable of exerting an excellent erosion-resistant performance is arranged on the surface of the FRP-made base member <b>30</b> via the intermediate layer <b>42</b>, erosion-resistant performance of the wind turbine blade <b>2</b> can be extremely improved.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0085">When a spray film is formed on the base member <b>30</b> that is relatively large as for the wind turbine blade <b>2</b>, the operation efficiency can be improved if the operation can be performed in the atmosphere. When forming of a spray film is performed in the air, a reaction time with oxygen is to be shortened to the extent possible, for example, by spraying particles of a spray material onto a base member at high velocity to suppress generation of an oxide film due to reaction between oxygen in the air and the spray material. According to the above, it is possible to form a precise spray film having a low porosity and high adhesion to the base member <b>30</b>. However, if such a precise spray film is formed directly on the base member <b>30</b>, the surface of the base member <b>30</b> may be damaged. In this regard, with the abovementioned method, since the intermediate layer <b>42</b> is interposed between the base member <b>30</b> and the erosion-resistant overcoat <b>50</b>, it is possible to suppress damage occurring on the surface of the base member <b>30</b>. Accordingly, erosion-resistant performance of the wind turbine blade <b>2</b> can be extremely improved without deteriorating functions of the base member <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0086">In some embodiments, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the intermediate layer <b>42</b> and the erosion-resistant overcoat <b>50</b> may be arranged at least at a region, being on the blade distal end portion <b>22</b> side and the leading edge <b>24</b> side of the wind turbine blade <b>2</b>, of the surface of the blade-shaped base member <b>30</b>.

Here, for forming the intermediate layer <b>42</b>, without adhering to porosity lowness thereof, the intermediate spray film can be formed at spray velocity in degree not to cause damage on a surface of FRP forming the base member <b>30</b>. That is, since the intermediate spray film can be formed at spray velocity lower than spray velocity at which the erosion-resistant overcoat <b>50</b>, for example, having a porosity of 5% or lower is formed, it is possible to efficiently suppress occurrence of damage on the surface of the base member <b>30</b> by spraying for forming the intermediate layer <b>42</b> (intermediate spray film).

Accordingly, since spray velocity for forming a spray film of the intermediate layer <b>42</b> on the surface of the base member <b>30</b> can be lowered by adopting the intermediate spray film having a relatively large porosity as the intermediate layer <b>42</b>, the surface of the base member <b>30</b> can be protected more effectively.
