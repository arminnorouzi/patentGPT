Constraint service <b>116</b> includes instructions for activating a constraint based on a rule-based restriction upon operation of autonomous vehicle <b>102</b>.

The present disclosure contemplates that in some instances, utilizing a streaming deficit round robin arbiter without having to determine a packet size prior to providing access for a transfer.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Currently, autonomous vehicle systems receive a large amount of data from various vehicle electronic control units (ECUs) and sensors distributed throughout the autonomous vehicle. All of the data received from the ECUs and sensors provide necessary information relating to certain aspects of the autonomous vehicle such as speed, cabin conditions, and pedestrian detection. In some instances, there may be scenarios where certain types of information (e.g., data) is more important than others. For example, data relating to pedestrian detection may be more valuable than the current temperature of the interior cabin of the autonomous vehicle. In such instances, it would be more beneficial to prioritize the pedestrian detection data ahead of the autonomous vehicle cabin data. However, current streaming algorithms are unable to prioritize sensor data because all data (e.g., ECU/sensor data) are treated equally, which means that the pedestrian detection data will have to wait its turn in a queue (e.g., that include packet data size requirements) before a corresponding pedestrian detection system can provide the data to an internal computing system of the autonomous vehicle system for processing. Moreover, data from all of the various ECUs and sensors bottleneck prior to be received by the internal computing system of the autonomous vehicle system, which further restricts how and when data is received from the ECUs and sensors.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Aspects of the disclosed technology address the foregoing limitations of conventional use of a streaming algorithm by implementing a streaming deficit round robin arbiter that can provide fair utilization of a single link across multiple competing network traffic flows without determining a packet size prior to granting access.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As discussed in further detail below, methods and systems are provided for implementing a streaming deficit round robin arbiter to provide fair utilization of a single link. In some aspects, methods and systems are provided and can include specifying a quantum size indicating how much of a link of a stream is available for use, adding the quantum size to a deficit counter indicating available bandwidth, determining whether to provide a first data packet to an autonomous vehicle system based on the deficit counter and without determining a data packet size of the first data packet, and providing the first data packet to the autonomous vehicle system based on the determining of whether to provide the first data packet to the autonomous vehicle system.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example system environment that can be used to facilitate autonomous vehicle navigation and routing operations with a streaming deficit round robin arbiter, according to some aspects of the disclosed technology <b>200</b>. In some implementations, the autonomous vehicle system <b>200</b> can include an autonomous vehicle <b>102</b>, an internal computing system <b>110</b>, a streaming deficit round robin arbiter <b>202</b> (e.g., a server), and vehicle electronic control units (ECUs) <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>. In some examples, the internal computing system <b>110</b> can be communicatively coupled to the streaming deficit round robin arbiter <b>202</b> with a 1 Gbps line <b>208</b> (e.g., an Ethernet connection), and the streaming deficit round robin arbiter <b>202</b> can be communicatively coupled to the vehicle ECUs <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> with a 1 Gbps line <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, respectively.

The vehicle ECUs <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> can further include other systems that are suitable for the intended purpose and understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, the above-mentioned systems <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> can include respective sensors that can provide sensor data, of their respective systems <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>, <b>138</b>, to the internal computing system <b>110</b>, and in some examples, via the streaming deficit round robin arbiter <b>202</b> along line connections <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> (e.g., Ethernet connections).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some implementations, the autonomous vehicle system <b>200</b> can circumvent requirements such as requiring that the packet size be known before a packet queue is serviced (e.g., completed).

Instead of buffering a data packet and comparing its size to a queue's deficit counter (DC) before data transmission (which takes time and resources to facilitate), a queue can be serviced (e.g., allowed to provide at least one packet) if its DC&#x3e;=0. Data packets can be serviced from the queue until either its DC&#x3c;0 or the queue is empty.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, the streaming deficit round robin arbiter <b>202</b> can provide an implementation of a Deficit Round Robin (DRR) algorithm for AXI4-Stream interfaces. DRR algorithms can provide fairness for traffic flows (e.g., queues) by including variable packet sizes. The streaming deficit round robin arbiter <b>202</b> can also perform cut-through switching of packets and arbitrate TLAST (e.g., designating the last pixel of each line, i.e., end of line) with no interleaving of transfers from different packets.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some implementations, the data packet size is not known before transferring the data packet to an output interface (e.g., the internal computing system <b>110</b>).
