The clamp body is frequently formed from two fastening parts that can be connected with one another by way of screws, which parts form a feed-through for holding the line in the assembled state.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Currently, the most varied embodiments of clamps of the aforementioned type are used for laying and fastening cables and lines in the tower of a wind turbine. A disadvantage of these clamps is that they bring with them a great number of components, thereby making assembly more difficult.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This is where the invention seeks to provide a remedy. The invention is based on the task of making available an apparatus for fastening lines, in particular power cables, pipes or hoses, which have a small number of components, and which are suitable, in particular, also for efficient fixation of lines within the tower of a wind turbine. According to the invention, this task is accomplished by means of an apparatus having the characteristics of the characterizing part of claim <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the invention, an apparatus for fastening lines, in particular power cables, pipes or hoses, is made available, which has a lower number of components and which allows efficient installation of lines, in particular also within the tower of a wind turbine. For this purpose, the fastening parts comprise two clamp parts that are connected with one another in an articulated manner, by way of at least one hinge, which parts each hold at least one clamping block, which has a groove on its outer mantle surface, in which groove a section of a clamp part is positioned, and which block has a channel in the form of a cylinder mantle section that runs axially at a right angle to the groove, on its inner side that lies opposite the groove, for holding a line. A clamping closure is arranged on the end of a clamp part that lies opposite the articulated connection, the clamping hook of which closure can be brought into engagement with a counter-hook that is arranged on the end of the other clamp part that lies opposite the articulated connection. By way of the clamping closure, the clamping blocks can easily be braced with their groove against the line held by the latter. Because of the full-area contact of the groove on the line, damage to the line is prevented. It is made possible to easily change the positioning of the line within the apparatus by temporarily loosening the clamping closure. Preferably the clamping blocks are configured to be identical. In this way, both production and installation are simplified. In the present case, the term &#x201c;clamping block&#x201d; should be understood to be a solid component that is preferably configured in the manner of a prism having a trapezoid base area.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a further development of the invention, the clamping hook is configured in the form of an eye on the end side, configured to be straight in its section that faces the counter-hook. In this way, a uniform transfer of force between clamping hook and counter-hook is made possible, wherein at the same time the clamping hook is prevented from sliding out of the counter-hook.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an embodiment of the invention, the clamping hook is connected with the clamping bracket of the clamping closure by way of a threaded spindle. In this way, simple adjustment of the clamping hook to set the clamping force of the clamping closure is made possible. Preferably the threaded spindle is pre-stressed against the clamping bracket by way of spring elements, which particularly preferably comprise plate springs and/or helical springs. In this way, equalization of elasticity losses due to hardening of the clamping blocks, particularly if these are produced from an elastomer material, is achieved, and thereby the required holding force of the apparatus is guaranteed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a further embodiment of the invention, each of the two clamp parts comprises a planar end face, on which two side wings are formed, lying opposite one another and at an angle to the end face. In this way, lateral fixation of the clamping blocks in the clamp parts is achieved. Preferably the side wings are set at the same angle relative to the end face.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further embodiment of the invention, the inside contour of the section of the corresponding clamp part essentially corresponds to the outside contour of the groove bottom of the groove of the clamping block against which it lies. In this way, good fixation of the corresponding clamping block on the corresponding clamp part is achieved. Axially, the clamping blocks are held by way of the side walls of the groove in which they are arranged.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a further development of the invention, at least one clamp part and at least one clamping block held by it have corresponding engagement means for a shape-fit, releasable connection with one another. In this way, easy fixation of the clamping blocks on the clamp parts is achieved.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment of the invention, at least one clamping block has at least one engagement pin that can be introduced into an engagement bore of the clamp part that holds the pin. In this regard, a material weakening is preferably present in the clamping block, ahead of the engagement pin, which weakening is formed, for example, by means of a recess in certain regions. This material weakening allows limited backward movement of the engagement pin during introduction of the clamping block into a clamp part, until the engagement pin slides into the engagement bore.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a further embodiment of the invention, a clamp part has at least one bore for passing a fastening screw through. In this way, easy fastening of the apparatus within the tower of a wind turbine is made possible.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further development of the invention, at least one holding space for holding at least one nut is arranged in a clamp part or between two clamp parts arranged adjacent to one another, the inside thread bore of which nut aligns with the bore for passing a fastening screw through. In this regard, the nut is preferably configured as a weld nut that is attached to the clamp part. In order to prevent point-type force impact on a clamping block by a screw that is screwed through the nut, the holding space for the nut must be dimensioned to be sufficiently deep.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment of the invention, a longitudinal groove that runs at a right angle to the groove is introduced into the bottom of the groove in a clamp part, at least in certain regions, forming the holding space for the at least one nut.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a further development of the invention, a second side wing set at an angle is formed on the first side wing, set at an angle, of the first clamp part, in each instance, wherein two clamping blocks are arranged, each lying against a first side wing between a second side wing and the end face of the clamp part. In this regard, a first side wing, in each instance, preferably encloses an angle of 120&#xb0; with the second side wing formed on it. In this way, a uniform arrangement of three clamping blocks, angled relative to one another within the apparatus, is achieved, the grooves of which blocks serve for contact with one cable, in each instance. In this regard, it is not only possible for three cables to be held in the apparatus configured in this manner, in such a manner that they are braced relative to one another. It is also possible to provide a middle piece that is essentially configured in star shape, against which the three cables can be braced by way of the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment of the invention, each clamp part holds precisely one clamping block, wherein the side wings formed on the end face of each clamp part are set onto the end face at an angle of 90&#xb0;, in each instance. In this embodiment, the two clamping blocks have an essentially cuboid-shaped form, the blocks being enclosed by the clamp parts that are configured essentially in C shape, and the grooves of the blocks serving to hold a line passed through between them, against which the clamping blocks can be braced. In this embodiment, the clamp parts and the clamping blocks are preferably configured to be identical.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a further embodiment of the invention, the clamp parts are made of metal, preferably of sheet steel, and the clamping blocks are made of plastic, preferably elastomer. In this way, reliable bracing of the clamping blocks by the clamp parts is guaranteed. The elastic clamping blocks form a uniformly prestressed contact surface on the cables held by them.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Other further developments and embodiments of the invention are indicated in the remaining dependent claims.
