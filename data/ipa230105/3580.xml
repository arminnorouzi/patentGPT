On the other hand, in the case of a spatially inhomogeneous sample, it is desirable to carry out spectrometry measurements in the form of an image constructed point by point with a spatial resolution adapted according to the structure or the microstructures of the sample.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various spectrometric imaging techniques are known, based on the point-by-point acquisition of spectra and on the reconstruction of a spatially resolved spectrometric image. These systems require a displacement of the sample relative to the measuring instrument and an excitation beam focused at a point, or scanning of the excitation beam relative to the sample, or a combination of a scan of the beam and a displacement of the sample.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a Raman micro-spectrometry imaging system based on sample displacement, the sample is placed on a motorized stage or equipped with piezoelectric actuators, to move the sample in two transverse directions (XY). The laser excitation beam is focused on the sample, on an area approximately <b>1</b> micrometer in diameter. The displacement of the sample generally follows a periodic grid having a constant pitch in X and in Y. A spectrum is acquired at each new position of the sample. Processing software reconstructs a hyperspectral image from this set of measurements.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Whatever the type of displacement chosen, the duration of acquisition of a point-by-point image is determined by the duration of acquisition of each point and by the number of points of the image. The acquisition time of each point is related to the luminosity and the spectral resolution of each point. The number of points in the image depends on the displacement step of the sample relative to the excitation beam or of this beam relative to the sample, which determines the spatial resolution of the image.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Acquiring a single Raman spectrum typically takes between 0.1 msec to 1 minute, and on average 1 second. To obtain an image of high spatial and spectral resolution, the acquisition time of a Raman micro-spectrometry image can reach several hours or even several tens of hours. These times are unsuitable for the analysis of many samples.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The main options for reducing spectrometry image acquisition time are reducing the acquisition time of each point and reducing the number of points in an image.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, these options generally lead to a loss of quality of the reconstructed image, a reduction in the signal to noise ratio of each point and/or a reduction in the spatial resolution of the reconstructed image.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some applications, it is desirable to reduce the acquisition time of a micro-spectrometry image or a hyperspectral image without loss of luminosity, signal-to-noise ratio, spectral resolution or spatial resolution on the image reconstructed point by point.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In other applications, it is desirable to increase the spatial resolution of a hyperspectral image or of a micro-spectrometry image without increasing the acquisition time of this image.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this context, the present invention proposes a method of acquiring and forming a spectrometric image of a sample comprising the following steps:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">e1) acquisition of an initial image of an area of the sample, the initial image being composed of pixels, and definition of a maximum set of N, 2&#x2264;N, spectrometry measurement positions, each measurement position comprising at least one coordinate, representative of the measurement position with respect to the area of the sample, and at least one intensity, determined on the basis of at least one pixel of the initial image located in a neighborhood of the measurement position;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">e2) assignment of a classification value to each of the N measurement positions on the basis of deviations between the measurement positions, a deviation between two measurement positions being calculated on the basis of a difference in intensity and a difference in coordinates;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">e3) determination of a group of P, <b>1</b>PN, measurement positions among the set of N measurement positions as a function of the classification values assigned in step e2); e4) successively, for each measurement position of the group determined in step e3), positioning of an excitation beam at said measurement position on the area of the sample, acquisition of a spectrometry measurement and construction of the spectrometry image based on the acquired spectrometry measurement(s).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Here, a measurement position represents a particular positioning of the excitation beam relative to the sample for the purpose of carrying out a spectrometry measurement.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Thus, thanks to the method of forming and acquiring a spectrometry image, classification values are assigned to the measurement positions. The classification value of a measurement position makes it possible to quantify the contribution of the measurement position for the formation of the spectrometry image. The contribution of a measurement position is an estimate of the weight, that is to say the importance, of the spectrometry measurement acquired at this measurement position, in the formation of the spectrometry image.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The contribution of a measurement position is determined based on the initial image. The contribution of a measurement position is determined with respect to the location of the measurement position on the sample. For example, measurement positions located in an area of the sample with strong intensity variations are considered to contribute more than measurement positions located in an area of the sample with constant intensity. In other words, an area of the sample of uniform intensity can be estimated precisely by a spectrometric measurement whereas an area exhibiting strong spatial variations in intensity must be estimated by several spectrometric measurements.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">This method therefore makes it possible to organize or order the measurement positions, for example from the most contributing to the least contributing, by assigning them classification values.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Once the measurement positions have been organized, it is possible to acquire spectrometry measurements starting with the most contributing measurement positions. The spectrometry image can then be constructed progressively and updated with each new acquisition of a spectrometry measurement.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Consequently, during the acquisition and formation of the spectrometry image, the areas of the sample presenting strong spatial variations in intensity obtain in priority a higher spatial resolution (on the spectrometry image) than the areas of the sample of spatially constant intensity. The quality of the spectrometry image is therefore quickly satisfactory even after a few acquisitions</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thus, acquiring spectrometry measurements in priority at the most contributing measurement positions makes it possible to obtain high quality for a given acceleration factor or for a given acquisition time. For example, for a given acceleration factor, the method makes it possible to obtain a spectrometry image having a better quality than with a distribution over a predetermined regular grid of the measurement positions to be acquired.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The acquisition of new spectrometry measurements can also be stopped when the quality of the image is deemed satisfactory by a user.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The acquisition of new spectrometry measurements can also be stopped once a determined acceleration factor is reached. The acceleration factor, which is sometimes called compression ratio, is defined as the ratio between the maximum number of measurement positions according to the spatial resolution of the spectrometry device and the number of spectrometry measurements acquired. A given acceleration factor is therefore inversely proportional to a given number of measurements acquired.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Other non-limiting and advantageous characteristics of the

Such a microscope with scan includes a displacement stage system to displace sample <b>1</b> relative to the excitation beam <b>2</b> which remains fixed. This mode of relative movement of the excitation beam <b>2</b> with respect to the sample allows precise positioning of the excitation beam <b>2</b>. Other microscopes include a scanning device (usually a scanner) to vary the angle of incidence of the excitation beam relative to the sample which remains fixed while the excitation beam is scanned. Finally, some microscopes combine scanning of the excitation beam and movement of the sample in order to cover an analysis surface having a greater spatial extent.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In general, a point-to-point spectrometry imaging microscope is configured to perform relative displacement of an excitation beam <b>2</b> with respect to the sample <b>1</b>, so as to direct the excitation beam <b>2</b> sequentially to different sample <b>1</b> points to be analyzed. These different points of the sample <b>1</b> to be analyzed and where the excitation beam <b>2</b> can be placed, correspond here to the measurement positions, denoted PM. More precisely, the measurement positions form a maximum set of measurement positions. As detailed below, the method of the present disclosure makes it possible to select, among these N measurement positions, the most contributing measurement positions at which the spectrometry measurements are acquired as a priority and to determine the order in which these measurements are acquired. The method aims in fact at acquiring an effective number of spectrometry measurements lower than the maximum number N, to reduce the total duration of acquisition, while producing a spectrometry image of good quality, that is to say of high resolution in the most contributing areas of the sample.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The analysis instrument also comprises a spectrometry device, which makes it possible to acquire a spectrometry signal at each measurement position PM. The spectrometry signal at a point of sample <b>1</b> is called the spectrometry measurement.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The analysis instrument finally comprises a calculator and processing software for forming, thanks to the spectrometry measurements, a hyperspectral spectrometry image or even one or more images of the sample <b>1</b> in different spectral bands or at different wave lengths. Each point of the hyperspectral image therefore represents a spectrometry measurement, for example a Raman scattering spectrum, a fluorescence spectrum, a photoluminescence spectrum or a cathodoluminescence spectrum.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a classic example of a grid of measurement positions PM at which the excitation beam <b>2</b> shall be positioned. The measurement positions PM are represented by measurement discs or spot <b>6</b> in a plane (XY) of an orthonormal reference frame on the surface of a sample. The grid is generally regular, rectangular or square, with a pitch DX along the X axis and a pitch DY along the Y axis. The pitch DX is generally chosen equal to the pitch DY.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">A classic way of forming a spectrometry image is to place the incident beam <b>2</b> in a measurement position PM(<b>1</b>,<b>1</b>) and to acquire a first spectrometry measurement, then to move the excitation beam to a measurement position PM(<b>1</b>,<b>2</b>) to acquire a second spectrometry measurement. It is then possible to repeat the operations of relative displacement of the excitation beam <b>2</b> with respect to the sample <b>1</b> and of acquisition of a spectrometry measurement until a spectrometry measurement is obtained for each measurement position PM of the scanned surface <b>4</b> on sample <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The spatial resolution of the image thus obtained depends on the size of the excitation beam <b>2</b> on the sample <b>1</b> and on the chosen displacement pitch DX, DY.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The microscope can be an optical microscope comprising a microscope objective <b>3</b> to focus a laser beam <b>2</b> on a sample <b>1</b> to be analyzed. The optical microscope is combined with a Raman spectrometer or, respectively optical fluorescence or photoluminescence, configured to measure a Raman scattering spectrum or, respectively, an optical fluorescence or photoluminescence spectrum in the UV-visible range.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Alternatively, the microscope may be an X-ray fluorescence microscope, comprising an X-ray beam focusing and scanning system. The X-ray fluorescence microscope is then combined with a spectrometer configured to measure an X-ray spectrum (XRF).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Alternatively, the microscope may be a scanning electron microscope (SEM for Scanning Electron Microscope), comprising an electron beam focusing and scanning system. The scanning electron microscope is then combined with a spectrometer configured to measure an X-ray spectrum (EDX), or respectively a cathodoluminescence spectrum.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">These analysis instruments make it possible to acquire point by point spectrometric measurements of a sample <b>1</b> on a scanned surface <b>4</b> with a spatial resolution determined in particular by the size of the incident excitation beam on the sample.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Point-to-point spectrometry imaging techniques provide a spatially and spectrally resolved image of a sample. For example, the application of Raman micro-spectrometry makes it possible to analyze the spatial distribution of a chemical composition in a zone of a pharmaceutical tablet, with a spatial resolution of the order of X, where X represents the wavelength of the excitation beam.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Conventionally, the spatial resolution of a spectral or hyperspectral image obtained by scanning microscopy is spatially uniform over the entire scanned and analyzed surface. The acquisition time of a scanning micro-spectrometry image increases as a function of the number of points in the spectrometry image thus formed. In practice, the acquisition time is approximately equal to the product of the number of spectrometry measurements by the acquisition time of a spectrometry measurement.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The analysis instrument of the invention may also advantageously comprise another imaging device making it possible to acquire an initial image, with high spatial resolution, of the area of the sample to be studied. This initial structural image can be a video image acquired by means of a CCD camera combined with the scanning microscope. In a SEM, a secondary electron detector can quickly provide an initial high spatial resolution image. However, certain structural details detected on a high-resolution video image, such as for example local variations in luminosity, can be indicative of variations in measurements obtained by spectrometry, although the video image cannot generally provide information of spectrometric type.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Method</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a method of acquiring and forming a spectrometry image IS of Sample <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Step e1)</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the method comprises a step e1 of acquiring an initial image II of an area of sample <b>1</b>, the initial image II being composed of pixels, and of defining a maximum set of N, 2&#x2264;N, spectrometry measurement positions PM, each measurement position PM comprising at least one coordinate, representative of the measurement position PM with respect to the area of the sample, and at least one intensity, determined on the basis of at least one pixel of the initial image II located in a neighborhood of the measurement position PM.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">By initial image II acquisition, it is meant here the detection of an image of sample <b>1</b> on an image sensor, for example of the CCD type or even the recovery of an image file of sample <b>1</b> obtained on another metrology instrument or from a database comprising an image of sample <b>1</b>. Preferably, an initial digital image II is used. If the initial image II detected or collected is analog, it is digitized, so as to obtain a digital initial image II of the sample <b>1</b>. If necessary, the initial image II is resized according to the area that shall be analyzed by scanning excitation beam <b>2</b> and/or by moving sample <b>1</b> relative to excitation beam <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In practice, the initial image II can be acquired according to one of the following imaging methods:</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">spectroscopic acquisition at one or more predetermined spectral bands;</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">optical acquisition in reflection or in transmission;</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">hyperspectral acquisition;</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">acquisition with an atomic force microscope;</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">acquisition with a scanning electron microscope.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The initial image II can be acquired using the spectrometry device of the analysis instrument itself, for example in the case where the initial image II is a spectroscopic image with a single spectral band. Other modalities require an additional imaging device.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">For example, here, the initial image II is a video image obtained by means of a CCD sensor and by illuminating the sample with white light. Lighting and detection system settings are adjusted to increase image contrast and bring out structural details. Advantageously, the intensity, the polarization and/or the illumination and/or detection wavelength are adjusted so as to obtain a highly contrasted initial structural image.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">An example of such an initial image II is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, sample <b>1</b> symbolizes the dark letters J, O, B, I and N on a light background.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Here, the initial image II is an RGB image where the intensity of each pixel comprises three components, a component for red, a component for green and a component for blue, all coded on 256 bits.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Whatever the mode of acquisition of the initial image II, the initial image II is composed of pixels possessing one or more intensities, here three intensities. Here, the pixels are conventionally distributed in rows and columns.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Preferably, the duration of acquisition of the initial image II is short compared to the duration of acquisition of the spectrometry image IS. The initial image II is for example acquired in a few fractions of a second while the spectrometry image IS is acquired in several minutes.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In step e1, a maximum set of N, 2&#x2264;N, spectrometry measurement positions PM is defined. Here, the maximum number of measurement positions PM depends on the pitch DX along the X axis and on the pitch DY along the Y axis. The pitches DX, DY are chosen according to the resolution of the analysis instrument. The pitches DX, DY can for example be determined by the diameter of the measurement spot <b>6</b> and by the precision of the analysis instrument in the relative displacement of the excitation beam <b>2</b> with respect to the sample <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Here, the measurement positions PM therefore define a grid, with pitches DX and DY, the dimensions of which correspond to the area of sample <b>1</b> to be analyzed.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Each measurement position PM is identified with respect to sample <b>1</b> by at least one coordinate. Here, a measurement position is identified by two coordinates, a CX coordinate along the X axis and a CY coordinate along the Y axis.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The initial image II is preferably a high-resolution image. In practice, the resolution of the initial image II is at least as high as the pitch of the grid of the measurement positions PM. The coordinates of a measurement position PM can then correspond to a pixel of the initial image II. In the case where the resolution of the initial image II is higher than the pitch of the grid of the measurement positions PM, the coordinates of a measurement position PM can then correspond to several pixels.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the measurement positions PM, represented by &#x201c;+&#x201d; signs, are displayed superimposed on the initial image II. To avoid overloading the figure, only part of the measurement positions PM are represented. In practice, the grid of measurement positions PM can be at least 4 or 5 times denser than in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">For example, in a given direction, two measurement positions PM can be approximately <b>4</b> pixels apart. The resolution of the initial image II is then about <b>16</b> times greater than the maximum spatial resolution of the spectrometry image IS.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Each measurement position PM also comprises at least one intensity I. The intensity of a measurement position PM is calculated on the basis of the intensity of the pixels of the initial image II located in a neighborhood of the measurement point.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">A pixel is for example in the neighborhood of the measurement position PM closest to it. The number of pixels in the neighborhood of a measurement position PM can be estimated by the ratio between the number of pixels of the initial image II and the maximum number N of measurement positions PM. Still as an example, the neighborhood can depend on the dimensions of the measurement spot <b>6</b>. The neighborhood of a measurement position PM can thus be defined by all pixels included in a circle centered on the measurement position PM and having dimensions substantially similar to the ones of measuring spot <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Here, the intensity of a measurement position PM is calculated by carrying out an interpolation, for example an average or a bicubic interpolation, of the intensities of the pixels PI located in its neighborhood V. In other words, the initial image II is sub-sampled so that the number of pixels after sub-sampling is equal to the maximum number N of measurement positions PM. Once the sub-sampling has been performed, the intensity of a measurement position PM then corresponds in a one-to-one manner to the intensity of a pixel of the initial image.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The intensity of a measurement position PM is therefore of the same nature as the intensity of a pixel of the initial image II. The intensity of a measurement position PM can then have the same number of components as the intensity of a pixel. Here, for example, the intensity of a measurement position PM comprises three components, a red component IR, a green component IG and a blue component IB.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In one embodiment, the intensity of a measurement position PM has additional components such as a component representative of the average intensity of the pixels of the neighborhood, a component representative of the maximum intensity of the pixels of the neighborhood or even a component representative of the minimum intensity of the pixels of the neighborhood. Here such additional components can be defined for each color: red, green and blue.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Step e2)</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Once the coordinate(s) and the intensity of each measurement position PM are determined, the method makes it possible to assign a classification value to each measurement position PM.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">For this, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the method comprises a step e2 of assigning a classification value to each of the N measurement positions PM on the basis of deviations between the measurement positions PM, a deviation between two measurement positions PM being calculated based on an intensity difference and a coordinate difference.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Step e2 makes it possible to order or classify all measurement positions PM from the most contributing to the least contributing (or vice versa) thanks to the classification values. As explained in the introduction, the classification value of a measurement position PM makes it possible to quantify the contribution of the measurement position PM in the formation of the spectrometry image IS.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The contribution of a measurement position PM represents the importance or the interest of acquiring a spectrometry measurement at this measurement position to improve the quality of the spectrometry image IS. Spectrometry measurements are then acquired based on the classification values, usually starting with the most contributing measurement positions. The spectrometry image is reconstructed and updated in real time on the basis of the spectrometry measurements actually acquired.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">For example, at a given time when j, 1&#x2264;j&#x2264;N, spectrometry measurements have been acquired, the j+1<sup>th </sup>most contributing Measurement position PM is the one at which the acquisition of the j+1<sup>th </sup>measurement of spectrometry will increase the quality of the spectrometry image IS the most. As described further down, the quality of the spectrometry image IS at j+1 spectrometry measurements can be estimated on the basis of the initial image II. The quality of the spectrometry image IS with j measurements may correspond to a difference with the spectrometry image IS with N spectrometry measurements, that is to say with the spectrometry image IS which would be acquired for an acceleration factor of 1.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">This classification is made on the basis of the coordinate(s) and the intensity of the measurement position PM. The classification is therefore carried out on the basis of the initial image II.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The deviation between two measurement positions is calculated on the basis of an intensity difference and a coordinate difference. The deviation is therefore representative of the similarity, both spatial and in intensity, between two measurement positions PM. The smaller the deviation, the more similar the measurement positions PM are.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">In practice, if the deviation between two measurement positions PM is small, acquiring a spectrometry measurement only at one of the two measurement positions PM is sufficient to construct a spectrometry image. The missing spectrometry measurement can be estimated based on the acquired spectrometry measurement. One of the two measurement positions PM can then be considered as contributing little since it is not a priority to acquire a spectrometry measurement there.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">To calculate a deviation between two measurement positions PM, the calculator here performs a weighted sum of the square of the intensity difference between the two measurement positions and of the square of the coordinate difference between the two measurement positions.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">For example, here, with a first measurement position PM located at coordinates CX<b>1</b>, CY<b>1</b> and whose intensity components are IR<b>1</b>, IG<b>1</b>, IB<b>1</b> and with a second measurement position PM located at coordinates CX<b>2</b>, CY<b>2</b> and whose intensity components are IR<b>2</b>, IG<b>2</b>, IB<b>2</b>, the deviation E can be given by the formula:</p><p id="p-0135" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>E</i>=(<i>IR</i>1&#x2212;IR2)<sup>2</sup>+(<i>IG</i>1&#x2212;<i>IG</i>2)<sup>2</sup>+(<i>IB</i>1&#x2212;<i>IB</i>2)<sup>2</sup><i>+R</i>*((<i>CX</i>1&#x2212;<i>CX</i>2)<sup>2</sup>+(<i>CY</i>1&#x2212;<i>CY</i>2)<sup>2</sup>).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0136" num="0134">Here, the intensity components IR<b>1</b>, IG<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>B<b>1</b>, IR<b>2</b>, IG<b>2</b>, IB<b>2</b> are 8-bit coded values between 0 and 255. The coordinates CX<b>1</b>, CY<b>1</b>, CX<b>2</b>, CY<b>2</b> are the values of the indices defining the location of the measurement position on the grid as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The coordinates CX<b>1</b>, CY<b>1</b>, CX<b>2</b>, CY<b>2</b> are whole numbers here, for example between 1 and square root of N for a square grid.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0135">Alternatively, a deviation can be calculated as a weighted sum of the intensity difference between the two measurement positions and the square of the coordinate difference between the two measurement positions. Still as a variant, a deviation can be calculated as a weighted sum of the average of the intensities of the two measurement positions and of the average of the coordinates between the two measurement positions.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0136">Here, the weighting coefficient R makes it possible to weight the difference in coordinates with respect to the difference in intensity. The weighting coefficient R can be adjusted manually by a user or automatically on the basis of the contrast variations present on the initial image II. In practice, the weighting coefficient R can take a value between 30 and 100 for an initial image comprising differences in intensity between pixels of light areas and pixels of dark areas greater than <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0137">The weighting coefficient R used for the calculation of the deviations remains constant during step e2, that is to say for the classification of all measurement positions PM.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0138">Advantageously, the weighting coefficient R makes it possible to adapt the calculation of the deviations to the sample <b>1</b>. For example, the more the initial image II has high spatial frequencies, the lower the weighting coefficient R. The similarity between two measurement positions PM is then mainly based on the intensity. Still as an example, if the initial image II has small variations in contrast over relatively large portions of the initial image II, the weighting coefficient can be high. The similarity between two measurement positions PM is then mainly based on the coordinates.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0139">The value of the weighting coefficient R can also be proportional to an overall contrast of the initial image II to maintain a balance between the difference in coordinates and the difference in intensity. This makes it possible, for example, to assign a significant weighting to the difference in coordinates even in the case of very strong differences in intensity.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">In the embodiment where the intensity of a measurement position has the additional components, the calculation of the deviation takes these additional components into account.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">Advantageously, during step e2, the calculator constructs a list S comprising the measurement positions PM whose classification value remains to be assigned, that is to say the measurement positions which remain to be ordered. The calculator also constructs a list U comprising the measurement positions PM whose classification value is assigned, that is to say the measurement positions PM already ordered.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142">For example, after the definition of the N measurement positions PM, all measurement positions PM remain to be ordered. List S then contains N measurement positions PM and list U no measurement positions PM. As another example, if the calculator has assigned a classification value to j measurement positions, the list S contains N&#x2212;j measurement positions PM and the list U contains j measurement positions PM.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0143">In a first embodiment, represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, to assign a classification value to each measurement position PM of list S, the calculator iterates steps e21 and 22:</p><p id="p-0146" num="0144">e21) for each measurement position PM of list S, determining a total error;</p><p id="p-0147" num="0145">e22) selecting a measurement position PM from the list S based on each total error determined in step e21), assigning a classification value to the selected measurement position PM and moving the measurement position PM selected from list S to list U.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0146">At the end of step e21, each measurement position PM of list S is associated with a total error.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0147">For example, if steps e21 and e22 have already been performed j&#x2212;1 times, which means that the calculator has assigned a classification value to j&#x2212;1 measurement positions PM, at iteration j of step e21, the calculator determines j total errors. The determination of the total error will be described further down. Then, at iteration j of step e22, the calculator selects a measurement position PM, from among the j measurement positions PM of the list S, as a function of the total errors, and assigns a classification value to the selected measurement position PM.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0148">More specifically, during an iteration of step e22, the calculator selects the measurement position PM associated with the lowest total error.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0149">As described below, the total error here represents the contribution of all already classified measurement positions PM, that is those to which a classification value has been assigned. During an iteration of step e22, the contribution of a selected measurement position PM can for example be estimated by the difference between a total error before classification, that is to say before moving this measurement position in list U, and a total error after classification, that is after moving this measurement position in list U.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0150">Here, before the iteration of steps e21 and e22, a classification value is initialized at a predetermined value and at each iteration of step e22, a classification value strictly lower, respectively higher, than the lowest, respectively the highest, classification value is assigned to the measurement position PM associated with the lowest total error. Two examples of assigning rank values are detailed below.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0151">The calculator then assigns a classification value to the selected measurement position. The calculator assigns for example only classification values strictly higher than the preceding ones or only classification values strictly lower than the preceding ones. The previous classification values are the classification values already assigned to previous iterations or equal to a predetermined initialization value.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0152">If the calculator assigns classification values strictly greater than the previous ones, the measurement positions PM are ordered, at the end of step e2, from the least contributing to the most contributing according to the increasing classification values.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0153">In practice, to do this, a rank value can be initialized to zero. Then, each selected measurement position PM is assigned a rank value incremented by +1 from the previous one. Thus, the least contributing measurement position PM has a classification value of 1 and the most contributing a classification value of N.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0154">If the calculator assigns classification values that are strictly lower than the previous ones, the measurement positions PM are ordered, at the end of step e2, from the most contributing to the least contributing according to the increasing classification values.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0155">In practice, to do this, a classification value can be initialized to N+1. Then, each selected measurement position PM is assigned a rank value incremented by &#x2212;1 from the previous one. Thus, the least contributing measurement position PM has a classification value of N and the most contributing a classification value of 1.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0156">Once the calculator has assigned a classification value to a selected measurement position PM, this selected measurement position PM is moved from list S to list U. After j iterations of steps e21 and e22, list S contains N&#x2212;j measurement positions PM and list U contains j measurement positions PM.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0157">To assign a classification value to each measurement position PM in list S, the calculator iterates steps e21 and 22 until there are no more measurement positions PM in list S.

For example, here, the first calculated deviations are those between the measurement position PM of list U and the measurement positions PM of list S located the closest spatially, i.e. those with which the difference in coordinates, hereinafter called distance, is the lowest. The deviations are then calculated in ascending order of coordinate difference. Depending on the deviations already calculated, it is possible to stop the calculations if the contribution of the difference in coordinates is greater than the smallest deviation already calculated. The minimum deviation is then necessarily part of the deviations already calculated.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0169">Here, the total error is equal to the sum of each minimum deviation determined in step e2121. For example, during iteration j of step e21, after having calculated (N&#x2212;j)&#xd7;j deviations and determined j minimum deviations, the calculator calculates the total error associated with a measurement position PM by performing the sum of the j minimum deviations for this measurement position PM.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0170">Once the total error associated with the considered measurement position PM is determined, the calculator moves, in step e213, the considered measurement position PM from the list U to the list S.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0171">By iterating steps s e211, e212 and 213, the calculator therefore associates a total error with each measurement position PM of the list S. As described previously, this then makes it possible to assign a classification value to the associated measurement position PM at the smallest total error. For example, during iteration j of step e21, this makes it possible to assign a classification value to the measurement position PM associated with the lowest total error among the j measurement positions of the list S.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0172">In a second embodiment (not shown), in step e21, the calculator determines a change in total error associated with each measurement position PM. The change in total error is here a difference between two total errors, for two measurement positions PM, for example calculated in accordance with steps e2121 and e2122. The change in total error can also be a difference between a first total error, called initial total error, calculated before the measurement position PM under consideration is moved from list S to list U, and a second total error calculated after the considered measurement position PM is moved from list S to list U.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0173">During a given iteration of step e21, the measurement position of the list S which is considered to contribute the least is the one which is associated with the smallest change in total error. This means that at step e22, the measurement position selected is that which is associated with the smallest change in total error.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0174">Calculating total error changes, rather than total errors, allows to study a variation of total error from one considered measurement position PM to another considered measurement position PM, rather than calculating a total error for each considered measurement position.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0175">Indeed, for example, it is not necessary to completely calculate the total error associated with a considered measurement position PM. For this, provision is made to calculate a local error, on the basis only of the deviations in a neighborhood of the considered measurement position PM. This neighborhood is for example defined for each considered measurement position PM on the basis of the minimum deviation. The measurement positions PM which, due to the difference in coordinates, necessarily lie spatially too far away to correspond to the minimum deviation are excluded from the neighborhood. This neighborhood can also be defined by a predetermined threshold value on the coordinate difference.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0176">The local error makes it possible to estimate the change in total error since the considered measurement position only has an influence in its neighborhood.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0177">Moreover, at each new iteration of step e21, it is possible to estimate the new initial total error without having to calculate deviations. For this, the change in total error associated with the measurement position selected at the previous iteration can be subtracted from the initial error of the previous iteration. This makes it possible not to recalculate the initial total error and thus to reduce the number of calculations.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0178"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> represents an example of classification of measurement positions PM on the basis of a simulated initial image.

The measurement positions PM(<b>3</b>), PM(<b>4</b>), PM(<b>5</b>), PM(<b>6</b>) are the next most contributory because these measurement positions PM(<b>3</b>), PM(<b>4</b>), PM(<b>5</b>), PM(<b>6</b>) improve the resolution at the edge of the dark area.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0180">Once all measurement positions have been ordered, it is possible to estimate the spectrometry image IS acquired with a determined spectrometry measurement number less than the maximum number N.

In this case, the P measurement positions PM of the group are determined according to a decreasing order of the classification values, from the highest to the lowest.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0187">Still as an example, in the case where in step e2, the calculator increments by &#x2212;1 the classification values from the least contributing to the most contributing measurement position PM, the P measurement positions of the group are those to which the P lowest classification values are attributed. In this case, the P measurement positions PM of the group are determined according to an increasing order of the classification values, from the lowest to the highest.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0188">The number P of measurement positions PM can for example be determined so as to reach a given acceleration factor. For example, to reach an acceleration factor of 10, the number P of measurement positions PM of the group is equal to N/10. This represents, at step e4, acquisitions of spectrometry measurements at only 10% of the measurement positions PM.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0189">The number P of measurement positions PM can for example be predetermined by a user.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0190">The number P of measurement positions PM can for example be determined so as to reach a given acquisition duration or a distance traveled by the excitation beam <b>2</b> with respect to the sample <b>1</b> which has been given during step e4. In these cases, the number P of measurement positions PM in the group depends on the location of the measurement positions PM with respect to sample <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0191">The number P of measurement positions PM can also be determined by defining a threshold value on the total errors. After classification in step e2), the total error associated with each measurement position PM can be stored in memory. The number P can then be determined so that the sum of the total errors associated with the measurement positions which are not selected in the group is less than the threshold value.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0192">An additional criterion can be used when determining the number P of measurement positions PM. The number P of measurement positions PM can be determined so that the greatest distance between two measurement positions PM is less than a threshold value. The threshold value can for example be equal to 15 times the pitch DY or DY.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0193">Step e4</p><p id="p-0196" num="0194">Once the group containing the P most contributing measurement positions PM has been determined, spectrometry measurements can be acquired at the P measurement positions PM of the group.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0195">Thus, at step e4, successively, for each measurement position of the group determined in step e3, the excitation beam <b>2</b> is positioned at the measurement position PM on the area of the sample <b>1</b>, a spectrometry measurement is acquired, and the spectrometry image IS is constructed based on the acquired spectrometry measurement(s).</p><p id="p-0198" num="0196">Here, the spectrometry image IS is updated after each new acquisition of a spectrometry measurement. The spectrometry image IS is therefore constructed progressively and dynamically during step e4, that is to say at the same time as the acquisitions of the spectrometry measurements. This makes it possible to continuously improve the quality of the spectrometry image IS during the acquisition of each new spectrometry measurement.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0197">The order of acquisition of the spectrometry measurements can for example be made as a function of the classification values assigned to the P measurement positions PM of the group, for example so as to acquire spectrometry measurements from the most contributing measurement position PM to the least contributing.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0198">According to a particular and advantageous variant, when the group comprises at least 3 measurement positions PM, a trajectory for carrying out the successive positionings of the excitation beam can be predetermined.

This optimization can also, for example, consist in minimizing the number of changes of direction of a displacement stage of the sample holder. This optimization can also consist in minimizing the time required to successively position the excitation beam <b>2</b> in all P measurement positions PM of the group.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0200">Step e4 includes the construction of the spectrometry image IS. The maximum spatial resolution of the spectrometry image IS particularly depends on the maximum set N of measurement position PM. Here, the spatial resolution depends for example on the chosen displacement pitches DX, DY. The spatial resolution of the spectrometry image IS also depends on the spectrometry measurements that have been acquired.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0201">In general, with the method of acquiring and forming the spectrometry image IS, the spatial resolution is not homogeneous over the entire spectrometry image IS. Indeed, since the areas of sample <b>1</b> with strong spatial variations in intensity correspond to the most contributing measurement positions PM, more spectrometry measurements are acquired in these areas, and the spectrometry image IS then has a superior spatial resolution in these areas.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0202">The spatial resolution of the spectrometry image therefore increases locally with each acquisition of a spectrometry measurement at a measurement position PM.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0203">Here, the spectrometry image IS is composed of spectrometry pixels. The spectrometry image IS is here composed of as many spectrometry pixels as there are measurement positions in the maximum set N.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0204">Here, since the measurement positions PM are arranged in a grid, that is in rows and columns, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b> or <b>6</b></figref>, the spectrometry image IS is composed of spectrometry pixels as arranged in rows in columns. Each spectrometry pixel here comprises a spectrometry value representative of the spectrometry measurement. A spectrometry value can, for example, represent a spectrum, a portion of a spectrum, the intensity of a narrow spectral band, the intensity of a single wavelength or information from a multivariate analysis or a specific analysis.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0205">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in a preferred embodiment, the construction of the spectrometry image IS comprises sub-steps e41 and e42:</p><p id="p-0208" num="0206">e41) for each measurement position PM for which a spectrometry measurement has been acquired, determining a spectrometry value based on the spectrometry measurement;</p><p id="p-0209" num="0207">e42) for each remaining measurement position, determining a spectrometry value on the basis of at least one selected spectrometry measurement, which is selected as a function of the difference in coordinates between the remaining measurement position and the position of extent at which said at least one selected spectrometry measurement was acquired.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0208">The remaining measurement positions PM are the measurement positions PM for which no spectrometry measurement has been acquired.

The spectrometry value of an acquired measurement position can for example be equal to the spectrometry measurement or equal to a factor, that is to say equal to the spectrometry measurement at a wavelength or in a narrow wavelength band.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0211">If k, 1&#x2264;k&#x2264;N, spectrometry measurements have been acquired, the k spectrometry values of the k acquired measurement positions are determined based on their respective spectrometry measurement.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0212">At step e42, the calculator determines the spectrometry value of each remaining measurement position, that is to say the measurement positions PM which are not acquired measurement positions. Subsequently, the term &#x201c;considered&#x201d; remaining measurement position is that for which the spectrometric value is determined at a given instant.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0213">To determine the spectrometry value of the considered remaining measurement position, the calculator takes into account at least one spectrometry measurement acquired at an acquired measurement position. The acquired measurement position or positions are selected as a function of their coordinate difference with the considered remaining measurement position. The difference in coordinates between two measurement positions PM is called distance.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0214">Here, in step e42, the selected spectrometry measurements are the spectrometry measurements acquired at acquired measurement positions having a distance with the considered remaining measurement position that is less than a minimum distance threshold value. This means that all acquired measurement positions whose distance with the remaining measurement position considered is less than the minimum distance threshold value are selected. The spectrometry value can then for example be determined on the basis of an average of all selected spectrometry measurements.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0215">In addition, regardless of the selected spectrometry measurement(s), the spectrometry value is here determined based on each selected spectrometry measurement weighted by the deviation between the acquired measurement position at which the selected spectrometry measurement was acquired and the considered remaining measurement position.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0216">Here, the calculation of the deviation between two measurement positions PM is identical to that described previously, that is a weighted sum of the square of the difference in intensity between the two measurement positions and the square of the coordinate difference between the two measurement positions. Here, the weighting coefficient R is identical at step e2 and at step e4. As a variant, provision may be made for the weighting coefficient R to be different at steps e2 and e4.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0217">Here, the weighting is inversely proportional to the deviation. The farther the acquired measurement position is away from the considered remaining measurement position, that is to say the greater the deviation, the lower the weight of its spectrometry measurement.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0218">For example, the spectrometry value is determined on the basis of two spectrometry measurements and a first acquired measurement position has a deviation twice as large as the second one with the considered remaining measurement position. Then, when determining the spectrometry value, the acquired spectrometry measurement at the second acquired measurement position can have a weighting twice that of the acquired spectrometry measurement at the first acquired measurement position.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0219">In other words, the spectrometry value of a remaining measurement position is determined based on one or more spectrometry measurements acquired at one or more nearby acquired measurement positions, the proximity between the measurement positions PM being quantified by the deviations between these measurement positions PM.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0220">In some cases, it is planned to assign no spectrometry value to some remaining measurement positions. The spectrometry image is then incomplete. Not assigning a spectrometry value to a remaining measurement position can for example be based on a minimum distance threshold value. If no acquired measurement position has a distance to the remaining measurement position that is less than the minimum distance threshold value, no spectrometry value is assigned to the remaining measurement position. This means that if no acquired measurement position is spatially close enough to the remaining measurement position, no spectrometry value is assigned to the remaining measurement position.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0221"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B, <b>7</b>C, <b>7</b>B, <b>7</b>E and <b>7</b>F</figref> show the spectrometry image IS of sample <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> at several acceleration factors.

In other words, for each iteration of step e3, the measurement positions PM for which a spectrometry measurement has been acquired are not taken into account when determining the group. At each new iteration of step e3, thanks to the classification carried out in step e2, the group is therefore determined by selecting the most contributing remaining measurement positions.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0231">For example, during a first iteration of steps e3 and e4, N/100 spectrometry measurements are acquired at the N/100 most contributing measurement positions PM.

The coordinates of the measurement positions PM make it possible to determine which are located in the region of interest.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0262">The area of the region of interest is smaller than the area of sample <b>1</b>. Therefore, only a part of all N measurement positions PM falls within the region of interest. During step e3, the measurement positions PM of the group are then selected only from those belonging to the region of interest.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0263">At step e4, the spectrometry measurements are therefore acquired only at measurement positions PM belonging to the region of interest.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0264">Determining a region of interest therefore makes it possible to acquire spectrometry measurements only at a particular location of the sample <b>1</b>. Therefore, the spatial resolution and the quality of the spectrometry image IS increase only in this particular location. To increase the quality of the spectrometry image IS in the region of interest, steps e3 and e4 can be iterated by considering only the measurement positions PM in the region of interest.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0265">Determining a region of interest makes it possible to refine the spectrometry image IS, that is to say increase its spatial resolution, only in a particular place of the sample <b>1</b>. The user can for example define a region of interest where sample <b>1</b> exhibits strong contrasts and high spatial frequencies.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0266">The region of interest can also be defined on the basis of the spectrometry image IS to refine a region of the spectrometry image IS which does not have strong contrasts on the initial image II, that is to say a region where the measurement positions PM are not necessarily considered very contributory. The user can for example define the region of interest where he senses strong contrasts on the spectrometry image IS. The region of interest can also be defined automatically. For example, an area of sample <b>1</b> which shows variations in spectrometry values on the spectrometry image IS but which does not show any particular intensity variations on the initial image II, can define a region of interest.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0267">New spectrometry measurements can be acquired outside the region of interest, for example once all measurement positions of the region of interest have been acquired or after a determined period of time or once the part of the spectrometry image IS corresponding to the region of interest reaches a determined acceleration factor.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0268">Remarkably, provision can be made to spatially integrate a spectrometry measurement on a sector of sample <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0269">The spatial integration of a measurement can be carried out by moving the excitation beam <b>2</b> relative to the sample <b>1</b> during the measurement acquisition time. The spatial integration of a measurement can also be carried out by widening the transverse dimensions of the excitation beam <b>2</b> during the acquisition of the measurement.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0270">This is particularly useful when a spectrometry measurement is used to estimate the spectrometry values of several neighboring remaining measurement positions. Spatially integrating the measurement makes it possible to obtain an average spectrometry value for this neighborhood. Such a mean value may be more representative of sample <b>1</b> than a point spectrometry measurement applied to neighboring spectrometry values. The estimated images can make it possible to estimate whether or not a spectrometry measurement is likely to be used for determining spectrometry values of remaining measurement positions PMR.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
