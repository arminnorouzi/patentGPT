In an embodiment, the audio sound generators can be selected from internet of thing devices, can comprise mobile devices, and other purpose built distributed speaker systems. The control mechanism is shared among a set of devices via mesh (or central) distribution to facilitate acoustic amplification and cancellation with user-defined spatial limitations. These goals are achieved with the following core contributions: (1) opportunistic harnessing of proximal devices to jointly amplify, suppress, and create true <b>3</b>D audio; (2) XR visualization and interaction for simple control of audio zones and signals, XR includes augmented reality, virtual reality and other enhanced reality visualization systems; and (3) prediction and guidance for possible/optimal audio experience.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment, the audio generation system can enable the distributed collaboration of unlike devices to achieve purpose and action and amplify and dampen various audio sources opportunistically using proximal devices. The audio generation system can also enable privacy controls for audio&#x2014;amplification and monitoring to avoid abuse of invention and amplification technology for undesired monitoring and supervision. The audio generation system can also enable organic XR visualization by providing visualization cues for direction, focus, range, that communicates human desire to machine logic and vice versa. The XR visualization can also provide a prediction of what is possible. In other embodiments, the XR visualization can enable error correction and experience improvement guidance to allow direction or profiling as to where physically one would need to travel to in order to attain the acoustic environment that is desired.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, illustrated is an example schematic diagram <b>100</b> of an audio generation system <b>102</b> that can link with speaker devices in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The audio generation system <b>102</b> can be a cloud based system that uses a Software as a Service model or similar distributed system.
