The so-called &#x201c;visual&#x201d; refers to replacing time with colored color films. In the process of timing, the color films will gradually decrease. When the set time is reached, the timer will remind people that the time is up through alarming, flash screen or vibration. The visual timer is deeply loved by children and students because of its intuitive visual effect and simple operation.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">At present, the visual timer disclosed in the market mainly has the following defects:</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Visual timers with mechanical movement and quartz movement, which are driven by a traditional mechanical gear structure, inevitably have some core defects, such as loud working noise, inaccurate timing, high failure rate, and no pause in the timing process.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. The color screen visual timer with backlight has the defects of high power consumption and high cost.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">3. due to the facts that not enough numbers lead to the need for close-range viewing, and the viewing angle limitation of the liquid crystal display requires viewing the displayed numbers at angles in a fixed range, it is inconvenient and intuitive to provide information and check information in real time during the running process of the timer. If the indoor light is dim or the distance is far away, the numbers cannot be clearly seen and the running status of the timer cannot be checked at any time for the existing household timers.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">4. At present, the timing range of the visual timer on the market is 60 minutes. For junior high school, senior high school and postgraduate students, its time range is too small, because their examination time is 90 or 120 minutes.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The purpose of the present invention is to provide a visual timer to solve the problems mentioned in the above background.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve the above purpose, the present invention provides the following technical solution: visual timer, including a back shell (<b>1</b>), a PCB (<b>2</b>), an encoder (<b>3</b>), a color display screen (<b>4</b>), an adjusting knob (<b>301</b>), a knob sleeve (<b>302</b>) and a lens (<b>5</b>), characterized in that the PCB (<b>2</b>) is arranged on the front of the back shell (<b>1</b>), the encoder (<b>3</b>) is arranged at the bottom of the front of the PCB (<b>2</b>), and the color display screen (<b>4</b>) is arranged on the front of the PCB (<b>2</b>), wherein the color display screen (<b>4</b>) comprises an upper glass substrate (<b>41</b>) and a lower glass substrate (<b>42</b>);

According to the visual timer, the bottom of the encoder is attached to the PCB board by the cooperation of the encoder, the PCB board and the adjusting knob, and communication with the CPU is realized by a wiring. The adjusting knob penetrates through the face shell and the lens, and the encoder is driven to rotate by rotating the adjusting knob. There is a rotating disc inside the encoder with several transparent and opaque windows. A photoelectric receiver collects the intermittent light beams, so that the light pulses are converted into electric pulses. Then the signals are transmitted to the CPU by an electronic output circuit, and the CPU processes and outputs the signals. Time is increased in case of clockwise rotation and while time is reduced in case of counterclockwise rotation, which makes the adjustment mode simpler.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">2. According to the visual timer, through the cooperation of the start pause button, the visual region and the digital region, the start pause button is pressed to start timing. In the counting up process, the color block of the visual region gradually increases from 0. The digital region synchronizes from 00:00, and an alarm is given when it reaches the maximum range. During the counting down process, the color block in the visual region gradually disappears from the set time, and the digital regions decrease synchronously from the set time. When the timer is finished, an alarm will be given. After the alarm is suspended, the time initially set by the user will be displayed by default.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">3. The timer adopts a color display screen, which is an optimization and upgrade of the manufacturing process of the traditional monochrome LCD screen, so it can completely inherit the mature manufacturing process of the monochrome LCD screen, can be quickly produced in a large scale, and inherit the advantages of low cost and wide viewing angle of the monochrome LCD screen. Because the timer uses natural light as the light source, it also has the advantage of low power consumption.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a front view of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a structural diagram of the color display screen of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a silk screen printing diagram of the color film of the color display screen of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a structural diagram of a visual timer according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic diagram when the timer shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> counts 45 minutes.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram when the timer shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> counts 30 minutes.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic diagram when the timer shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> counts 15 minutes.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the timer shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> when counting is completed.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the drawings: <b>1</b>.

The bottom of the lower glass substrate <b>42</b> is provided with a lower polarizer <b>43</b>, and the bottom of the lower polarizer <b>43</b> is provided with a color film <b>44</b>. The bottom of the color film <b>44</b> is provided with a film <b>45</b>, and the top of the lower glass substrate <b>42</b> is provided with a lower alignment layer <b>6</b>. The color film <b>44</b> is silk-screened with but not limited to a silk screen printing region <b>441</b> on a surface region thereof by silk screening. The top of the upper glass substrate <b>41</b> is provided with an upper polarizer <b>7</b>, and the bottom of the upper glass substrate <b>41</b> is provided with an upper alignment layer <b>8</b>. A liquid crystal layer <b>9</b> is arranged between the upper alignment layer <b>8</b> and the lower alignment layer <b>6</b>, and the film <b>45</b> is a reflective film.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Working principle: the designated color is attached to the region to be displayed on the lower polarizer <b>43</b>, that is, the silk screen printing region (<b>441</b>) silk-printed on the color film <b>44</b>. After the display screen is powered on, the voltage applied to the liquid crystal molecules is adjusted to control the arrangement of the liquid crystal molecules. Herein, the way of controlling the arrangement of the liquid crystal molecules is also used in the prior art, that is, the upper glass substrate and the lower glass substrate, which are special conductive materials. In the LCD, it is mainly used to etch the required display pattern. When two ITO conductive layers are energized, the overlapping part will form an electric field, but the part without ITO conductive layer will not form an electric field. Under the action of the electric field, the liquid crystal will change, so that the light can directly pass through to control the light transmission. When the natural light penetrates through the upper polarizer <b>7</b> and the lower polarizer <b>43</b>, the upper glass substrate <b>1</b>, the liquid crystal layer <b>9</b> and the lower glass substrate <b>42</b>, the light will be reflected by the film <b>45</b>. The reflected light directly passes through the color film <b>44</b>, then the display content of the screen display region corresponding to the silk screen printing color region on the color film <b>44</b> will be consistent with the specified color attached. When different colors are attached to different regions of the color film, the display content of the screen will become different color combinations, thus achieving a color screen effect.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, a volume icon <b>401</b> is arranged at the upper left of the front of the color display screen <b>4</b>, and a low-power reminder icon <b>402</b> is arranged at the upper right of the front of the color display screen <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this embodiment, the volume icon <b>401</b> can display the current volume situation, and when the power is low, the low-power reminder icon <b>402</b> flashes to remind consumers that the power is too low.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The center of the front of the color display screen <b>4</b> is provided with a digital scale <b>403</b>, the center of the digital scale <b>403</b> is provided with a digital region <b>404</b>, and the centers of the digital region <b>404</b> and the digital scale <b>403</b> are provided with a visual region <b>405</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this embodiment, the visual region <b>405</b> is composed of several equal color blocks with eye-catching colors, and the color blocks will increase or decrease continuously with the timing process.

The visual timer in this embodiment includes a back shell <b>1</b>, the middle of which is provided with a color display screen <b>4</b>. The middle of the color display screen <b>4</b> is provided with a time display region <b>13</b>, which includes a minute display <b>14</b> and a second display <b>15</b>. The outer ring of the time display region <b>13</b> is provided with a color timer lamp <b>16</b>, and the periphery of the color timer lamp <b>16</b> is provided with a countdown pointer and a numerical value <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Wherein, the upper part of the minute display <b>14</b> is provided with an M mark, that is, minute counting; the upper part of the second display <b>15</b> is provided with an S mark, that is, second counting; the numerical countdown pointer and the numerical value <b>17</b> are provided with a number every five values; an indicator lamp <b>19</b> is arranged below the time display region <b>13</b>, and the indicator lamp <b>19</b> is a triangular display lamp. It can be understood that the timing range of the visual timer in this embodiment can be set to 120 minutes as well as 60 minutes selectively, and the specific timing range can be selected according to the actual needs.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this embodiment, before the timer is used, it is first necessary to set a target timing time by rotation, and then click &#x201c;START&#x201d; to start the countdown. When the countdown is completed, there are sound alarms and backlight flashing alarms. Its use effect is the same as that of the existing digital timer, except that the color display screen <b>4</b> converts the timer's numbers into bright patterns, and replaces digital display with intuitive and clear visual effects. It overcomes the defect that the existing liquid crystal display timer cannot be clearly seen in dim light in use environment. The timing numerical values of the color display <b>4</b> and the time display region <b>13</b> are larger than the previous numerical values, which overcomes the defect that the existing liquid crystal display digital timer cannot be clearly viewed from a long distance because of its small screen. According to the visual timer, the timing progress can be visually seen due to the bright color timer lamp <b>16</b>, which solves the defect that the existing liquid crystal display timer cannot allow viewing at a 180-degree angle.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Specifically, before the timer is used, it is first necessary to set a target timing time by rotation, and then click &#x201c;START&#x201d; to start the countdown. The screen has bright patterns, and the numbers of the timer are synchronized to start the countdown. The color display screen <b>4</b> converts the numbers of the timer into bright patterns, thus achieving a visual effect. The digital display is replaced with an intuitive and clear visual effect, thus solving the defect that the existing liquid crystal display timer cannot be clearly seen in the dim environment. Moreover, the timing numerical values of the color display screen <b>4</b> and the time display region <b>13</b> are larger than the previous numerical values, therefore the defect that the current digital timer with a liquid crystal display cannot be clearly viewed from a long distance due to the small screen is overcome. The timing progress can be intuitively seen in the visual timer due to the bright color timing lamp <b>16</b>. During the process of counting up, the indicator lamp <b>19</b> at this time is an upward-pointing triangular arrow, the color timer lamp <b>16</b> rotates clockwise and gradually increases. When the countdown is needed, the indicator lamp <b>19</b> is converted into a downward-pointing triangular display lamp, and then the timing is carried out again. For the display of the color blocks, they gradually disappear counterclockwise, which overcomes the defect that the existing liquid crystal display timer cannot allow viewing at an angle of 180 degrees.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The working principle of the visual timer disclosed by the invention is as follows: the bottom of the encoder <b>3</b> is attached to the PCB board <b>2</b>, and d communication with the CPU is realized by a wiring. The adjusting knob <b>301</b> penetrates through the face shell and the lens <b>5</b>; the knob sleeve <b>302</b> is sleeved on the adjusting knob <b>301</b> of the encoder <b>3</b>, and the encoder <b>3</b> is driven to rotate by rotating the adjusting knob <b>301</b>. The encoder <b>3</b> is a sensor that converts a mechanical displacement into an electrical signal by measuring physical quantities such as speed, position, speed or angle. It can be divided into two types: incremental type and absolute type. An incremental encoder <b>3</b> generates pulse signals, and the speed, length or position can be measured by the number of pulses. For an absolute encoder <b>3</b>, each position corresponds to a digital value of a displacement. There is a rotating disk inside the encoder <b>3</b> with several transparent and opaque windows. A photoelectric receiver collects the intermittent light beams, so that the light pulses are converted into electric pulses. Then the signals are transmitted to the CPU by a electronic output circuit, which processes and outputs the signals. The time is increased for clockwise rotation and the time is decreased for counterclockwise rotation. The numbers of the middle digital region <b>404</b> (corresponding to the time display region <b>13</b> in embodiment <b>2</b>) and the color blocks of the visual region <b>405</b> will increase or decrease synchronously. The start pause button <b>6</b> is pressed to start timing. During the timing process, the color blocks in the visual region <b>405</b> gradually increase from 0, and the digital region <b>404</b> synchronizes from 00:00. An alarm is given when it reaches the maximum range. During the countdown process, the color blocks in the visual region <b>405</b> gradually disappear from the set time, and the digital region <b>404</b> decreases synchronously from the set time. When the timer is finished, an alarm will be given. After the alarm is suspended, the time initially set by the user will be displayed by default. A color coating is attached to the back of the color display screen <b>4</b>, and a reflective film is attached to the bottom of the color coating. When natural light irradiates into the color display screen <b>4</b>, the light is reflected by the reflective film at the bottom and passes through the color coating on the back of the color display screen <b>4</b>, so that the display region of the color display screen <b>4</b> displays the same color as the color coating, thereby achieving the principle of color display. The volume icon <b>401</b> can display the current volume situation, and when the power is low, the low-power reminder icon <b>402</b> will flash to remind consumers that the power is low. The visual region <b>405</b> is composed of several equal color blocks with eye-catching colors, and the color blocks will increase or decrease continuously with the timing process. The area of the displayed color blocks can visually identify the remaining time proportion, and its periphery is corresponding to a digital scale <b>403</b>, which determines the maximum timing range. There is a digital region <b>404</b> in the color block, which counts synchronously with the visual region <b>405</b> to achieve a visual effect. When the counting time is 120 minutes, the number region <b>404</b> will display the number &#x201c;120&#x201d;; when the counting time is 90 minutes, the number region <b>404</b> will display the number &#x201c;90&#x201d; minutes. When the timer is off, the digital region <b>404</b> will be automatically converted into a clock. In the process of timing, the start pause button <b>6</b> can be pressed to start or pause the timing. The volume adjustment button <b>7</b> can adjust the volume. When the low-power reminder icon <b>402</b> flashes, the timer can be charged through the charging port <b>9</b>, or a battery can be inserted into the battery running device <b>8</b> for use.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although the embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that many changes, modifications, substitutions and variations can be made to these embodiments without departing from the principle and spirit of the present invention, and the scope of the present invention shall be defined by the appended claims and the equivalents thereof</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
