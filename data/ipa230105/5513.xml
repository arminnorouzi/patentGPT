There are many different types of memory including, for example, random-access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM), resistive random access memory (RRAM), double data rate memory (DDR), low power double data rate memory (LPDDR), phase change memory (PCM), and Flash memory.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electronic systems, such as memory systems, often include one or more types of memory, and that memory is typically coupled to one or more communications channels within a memory system. Time varying signals in such systems are utilized to transfer information (e.g., data) over one or more conductors often referred to as signal lines. These signal lines are often bundled together to form a communications bus, such as an address or data bus.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Memory systems often operate in portable devices with limited power supplied by batteries or other energy storage devices. In these low-power systems, and in general for most memory systems, there is a persistent demand for higher operating performance and at lower power. As a result, designers continue to strive for increasing operating speeds and ways to reduce power within memory systems and on memory devices.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Power consumption in many semiconductor devices is generally related to signal load and signal frequency in a relationship where power for digital signals can be considered proportional to CV<sup>2</sup>F; where C is a capacitive load on a signal, V is a voltage range the signal switches through, and F is an average frequency at which the signal switches. There is a continuing need to reduce power consumed by memory devices by addressing various design elements of a memory device, which may include circuit design, logic design, and layout considerations.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a layout diagram of a memory device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a layout diagram showing details of a centralized command and address (CA) interface region.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a layout diagram showing details of the CA interface region according to another embodiment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a layout diagram showing details of the CA interface region and a clock signal.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a detailed layout diagram illustrating a configuration of the CA interface region.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a simplified layout diagram illustrating an alternate configuration of CA input circuits for the CA interface region.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates stacking of two memory devices with one of the memory devices rotated 180 degrees.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a simplified circuit diagram for CA swapping.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a simplified circuit diagram for CA swapping from bond pads.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a layout diagram showing details of the CA interface region and swapped CA signals.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a simplified block diagram of a memory module implemented according to one or more embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a simplified block diagram of a system implemented according to one or more embodiments described herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which are shown, by way of illustration, specific example embodiments in which the present disclosure may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to practice the present disclosure. However, other embodiments may be utilized, and structural, material, and process changes may be made without departing from the scope of the disclosure. The illustrations presented herein are not meant to be actual views of any particular method, system, device, or structure, but are merely idealized representations that are employed to describe the embodiments of the present disclosure. The drawings presented herein are not necessarily drawn to scale. Similar structures or components in the various drawings may retain the same or similar numbering for the convenience of the reader; however, the similarity in numbering does not mean that the structures or components are necessarily identical in size, composition, configuration, or any other property.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Reference throughout this specification to &#x201c;one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an embodiment,&#x201d; or similar language means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the indicated embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present disclosure. Thus, the phrases &#x201c;in one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;in an embodiment,&#x201d; and similar language throughout this specification may, but do not necessarily, all refer to the same embodiment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As used herein, spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;bottom,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;top,&#x201d; &#x201c;front,&#x201d; &#x201c;rear,&#x201d; &#x201c;left,&#x201d; &#x201c;right,&#x201d; and the like, may be used for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. Unless otherwise specified, the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if a device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; or &#x201c;under&#x201d; or &#x201c;on bottom of&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;on top of&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below, depending on the context in which the term is used, which will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly. In addition, reference to an element as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; another element means and includes the element being directly on top of, adjacent to, underneath, or in direct contact with the other element. It also includes the element being indirectly on top of, adjacent to, underneath, or near the other element, with other elements present therebetween. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; another element, there are no intervening elements present.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Some drawings may illustrate signals as a single signal for clarity of presentation and description. It will be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art that the signal may represent a bus of signals, wherein the bus may have a variety of bit widths and the present invention may be implemented on any number of data signals including a single data signal.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. In addition, it should be understood that any reference to an element herein using a designation such as &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; and so forth does not limit the quantity or order of those elements, unless such limitation is explicitly stated. Rather, these designations may be used herein as a convenient method of distinguishing between two or more elements or instances of an element. Thus, a reference to first and second elements does not mean that only two elements may be employed there or that the first element must precede the second element in some manner. Also, unless stated otherwise a set of elements may comprise one or more elements.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used herein, &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations in the inclusive and alternate forms of one or more of the associated listed items.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; in reference to a given parameter, property, or condition means and includes to a degree that one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the given parameter, property, or condition is met with a degree of variance, such as within acceptable manufacturing tolerances. By way of example, depending on the particular parameter, property, or condition that is substantially met, the parameter, property, or condition may be at least 90.0% met, at least 95.0% met, at least 99.0% met, or even at least 99.9% met.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Elements described herein may include multiple instances of the same element. These elements may be generically indicated by a numerical designator (e.g., 110) and specifically indicated by the numerical indicator followed by an alphabetic designator (e.g., 110A) or a numeric indicator preceded by a &#x201c;dash&#x201d; (e.g., 110-1). For ease of following the description, for the most part element number indicators begin with the number of the drawing on which the elements are introduced or most fully discussed. Thus, for example, element identifiers on a <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> will be mostly in the numerical format 1xx and elements on a <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> will be mostly in the numerical format 4xx.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Headings may be included herein to aid in locating certain sections of detailed description. These headings should not be considered to limit the scope of the concepts described under any specific heading. Furthermore, concepts described in any specific heading are generally applicable in other sections throughout the entire specification.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although various embodiments discussed herein use examples relating to a single-bit memory storage concept for ease in understanding, the inventive subject matter can be applied to numerous multiple-bit schemes as well. For example, each of the memory cells can be programmed to a different one of at least two data states to represent, for example, a value of a fractional bit, the value of a single bit or the value of multiple bits such as two, three, four, or more numbers of bits. For example, memory cells can be programmed to one of two data states to represent a binary value of &#x201c;0&#x201d; or &#x201c;1&#x201d; in a single bit. Such a cell is sometimes called a single-level cell (SLC). A cell that can be programmed to one of more than two data states is sometimes referred to as a multi-level cell (MLC).</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Centralized Placement</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used herein the terms &#x201c;centralized&#x201d; and &#x201c;centralized region&#x201d; mean that elements and/or circuits are configured to be gathered together such that the elements are neighboring in a relatively compact region. For example, command and address (CA) input circuits for embodiments of the present disclosure are gathered together such that the elements are neighboring in a relatively compact region. This centralized arrangement is as opposed to a localized arrangement where elements and circuits are distributed such that they are placed local to elements they are associated with. For example, in conventional memory device arrangements the CA input circuits may be generally localized so they are placed near the bonding pad they are associated with, which causes the CA input circuits to be distributed across a large region of a memory device. Unless specifically stated herein, &#x201c;centralized&#x201d; and &#x201c;centralized region&#x201d; does not mean a specific location on a memory device. For example, a centralized region does not mean the region is placed in a center location of a memory device or place in a central location relative to an edge of the memory device.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Embodiments of the present disclosure reduce power of a memory device by placing CA input circuits in a centralized CA interface region. This centralized placement keeps the CA input circuits in a relatively compact region, which enables compact routing of clock signals, as well as other signals. The compact routing reduces capacitance associated with routing and thus reduces power consumption because a large element of power consumption for digital signals can be considered proportional to CV<sup>2</sup>F; where C is a capacitive load on a signal, V is a voltage range the signal switches through, and F is an average frequency at which the signal switches.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In conventional memory devices, the CA input circuits may be localized near their associated bonding pads. As a result, clock signals for the CA input circuits have to travel a relatively long distance, increasing the capacitive load on the clock signals, which increases power consumption for the clock signals. In addition, with the CA input circuits distributed, buffer sizes for the input buffers need to be larger, and consume more power to drive the longer distance and thus more capacitance, for the signals to arrive at their destination elsewhere on the memory device.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a layout diagram of a memory device <b>100</b>.
