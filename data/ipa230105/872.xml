The IUPAC name for the compound of Formula Ib is (S)-2-ethylbutyl 2-(((R)-(((2R,3S,4R,5R)-5-(4-aminopyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-5-cyano-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methoxy)(phenoxy) phosphoryl)amino)propanoate.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0025">The compounds of the disclosure, exemplified by Formula I, Formula Ia and Formula Ib have chiral centers, e.g., chiral carbon or phosphorus atoms. The compounds of the disclosure thus include racemic mixtures of all stereoisomers, including enantiomers, diastereomers, and atropisomers. In addition, the compounds of the invention include enriched or resolved optical isomers at any or all asymmetric, chiral atoms. In other words, the chiral centers apparent from the depictions are provided as the chiral isomers or racemic mixtures. Both racemic and diastereomeric mixtures, as well as the individual optical isomers isolated or synthesized, substantially free of their enantiomeric or diastereomeric partners, are all within the scope of the invention. The racemic mixtures are separated into their individual, substantially optically pure isomers through appropriate techniques such as, for example, the separation of diastereomeric salts formed with optically active adjuncts, e.g., acids or bases followed by conversion back to the optically active substances. In most instances, the desired optical isomer is synthesized by means of stereospecific reactions, beginning with the appropriate stereoisomer of the desired starting material.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0026">Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds (1994) John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc., New York. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1, D and L, or (+) and (&#x2212;) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with S, (&#x2212;), or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory while a compound prefixed with R, (+), or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms &#x201c;racemic mixture&#x201d; and &#x201c;racemate&#x201d; refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0027">The compounds of the invention may also exist as tautomeric isomers in certain cases. Although only one delocalized resonance structure may be depicted, all such forms are contemplated within the scope of the invention. For example, ene-amine tautomers can exist for purine, pyrimidine, imidazole, guanidine, amidine, and tetrazole systems and all their possible tautomeric forms are within the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0028">Any formula or structure given herein, including compounds of Formula I, Formula Ia, or Formula Ib, is also intended to represent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds have structures depicted by the formulas given herein except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the disclosure include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as, but not limited to 2H (deuterium, D), 3H (tritium), 11C, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18F, 31P, 32P, 35S, 36Cl and 125I. Various isotopically labeled compounds of the present disclosure, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H, 13C and 14C are incorporated. Such isotopically labelled compounds may be useful in metabolic studies, reaction kinetic studies, detection or imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays or in radioactive treatment of patients.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0029">The disclosure also includes compounds of Formula I, Formula Ia, and Formula Ib in which from 1 to n hydrogens attached to a carbon atom is/are replaced by deuterium, in which n is the number of hydrogens in the molecule. Such compounds exhibit increased resistance to metabolism and are thus useful for increasing the half-life of any compound of Formula I, Formula Ia, and Formula Ib when administered to a mammal, particularly a human. See, for example, Foster, &#x201c;Deuterium Isotope Effects in Studies of Drug Metabolism&#x201d;, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 5(12):524-527 (1984). In view of the present disclosure, such compounds are synthesized by means known in the art, for example by employing starting materials in which one or more hydrogens have been replaced by deuterium.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0030">Deuterium labeled or substituted therapeutic compounds of the disclosure may have improved DMPK (drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics) properties, relating to distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME). Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life, reduced dosage requirements and/or an improvement in therapeutic index. An 18F labeled compound may be useful for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically labeled compounds of this disclosure and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. It is understood that deuterium in this context is regarded as a substituent in the compound of Formula I, Formula Ia, and Formula Ib.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0031">The concentration of such a heavier isotope, specifically deuterium, may be defined by an isotopic enrichment factor. In the compounds of this disclosure any atom not specifically designated as a particular isotope is meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom. Unless otherwise stated, when a position is designated specifically as &#x201c;H&#x201d; or &#x201c;hydrogen&#x201d;, the position is understood to have hydrogen at its natural abundance isotopic composition. Accordingly, in the compounds of this disclosure any atom specifically designated as a deuterium (D) is meant to represent deuterium.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0032">&#x201c;Treatment&#x201d; or &#x201c;treating&#x201d; is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including clinical results.

Allergy Clin. Immunol., 75 (1 Pt) 1-13, 1985). Unfortunately, oral glucocorticoid therapies are associated with profound undesirable side effects such as truncal obesity, hypertension, glaucoma, glucose intolerance, acceleration of cataract formation, bone mineral loss, and psychological effects, all of which limit their use as long-term therapeutic agents (Goodman and Gilman, 10th edition, 2001).

Stability Studies</heading><p id="p-0213" num="0208">Aqueous liposome suspensions are often difficult to store over long periods time due to potential liposome aggregation and fusion, as well as hydrolysis of lipid components. Lyophilization allows the formulation to achieve maximum shelf-life stability. The presence of sucrose as an excipient in the liposomal remdesivir formulation serves to stabilize the integrity of the physical structure of the liposome during lyophilization. Thus, the formulations can be lyophilized under appropriate conditions, and the lyophilized cake can be reconstituted with sterile water.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0209">Studies were performed in order to evaluate the effect of lyophilization in the stability of the liposome formulation. The stability of two formulations, one liquid and one lyophilized, were monitored under an accelerated stability condition (40&#xb0; C., t=4 weeks) by analyzing the known and unknown degradant levels and the remdesivir concentrations (target %).
