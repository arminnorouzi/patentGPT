In existing mobile terminal design, some mobile terminals have a fingerprint recognition function. Fingerprint recognition means performing recognition by comparing detailed features of different fingerprints. Because persons have different fingerprints, a fingerprint can be used for identity authentication. A fingerprint is pre-stored in a mobile terminal. When an operator operates the mobile terminal, a fingerprint of the operator is collected using a fingerprint collector, and is compared with the pre-stored fingerprint. If the two fingerprints match, the operator is allowed to operate the mobile terminal. In other approaches, a fingerprint recognition technology is mainly used to recognize an identity of a user, that is, perform identity authentication using the fingerprint. When the user performs a subsequent operation on the mobile terminal after the identity authentication succeeds, multiple times of interaction between the user and the mobile terminal are still required, causing a complex operation process.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide an operation method with fingerprint recognition, an apparatus, and a mobile terminal in order to resolve the following technical problem.

All other embodiments obtained by persons of ordinary skill in the art without creative efforts shall fall within the protection scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In specific description in the following embodiments, concepts such as &#x201c;screen-locked,&#x201d; &#x201c;screen-off,&#x201d; and &#x201c;screen-on&#x201d; may be used. Based on content known by persons of ordinary skill in the art, this application gives a further explanation and description. It should be noted that, the following description is only intended for further description, and constitutes no limitation on an explanation of a common concept term in the technical field.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Screen-locked may be understood as a state in which a screen of a mobile terminal, or a terminal for short, is locked because a user wants to protect privacy, prevent a misoperation, and so on. A screen-locked interface may be considered as a display interface that is presented on a display screen of the terminal and that is locked in a password-protected state, or a display interface locked in a gesture-protected state. On the screen-locked interface, the terminal may present different display interfaces. For example, the terminal may present a specific screen-locked picture, present a specific screen-locked magazine, or present a specific screen-locked text. When the terminal receives a password or gesture authentication instruction that meets a preset condition, the terminal may terminate a locked state, and present a system interface or an application interface of an application program.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In addition to a fault-based black screen of a terminal due to a hardware fault or a software conflict, &#x201c;screen-off&#x201d; may be understood as a state in which a screen of the terminal is not powered on or is not illuminated because a user wants to save power, or the like. From a perspective of the user, direct representation of &#x201c;screen-off&#x201d; is that the screen of the terminal currently presents the same as the terminal does when the terminal is powered off or switched off. In a screen-off state, a physical button of the terminal may be triggered or biological feature information may be entered such that the terminal powers on the screen or illuminates the screen according to input information. In use of a technical term in the art, &#x201c;screen-off&#x201d; may also mean that the screen is turned off.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">&#x201c;Screen-on&#x201d; may be understood as a state in which a terminal illuminates a screen and presents a display interface. In a screen-on state, the terminal may present an operation interface that is needed by a user. For example, the terminal may present an operation interface of an application, or present a desktop container such that the user can select an icon. Alternatively, the terminal may present an interface that is temporarily not needed by a user but is necessary for implementing a function of the terminal. For example, the first step of starting the terminal is illuminating the screen, and in this case, it may be understood as the screen-on state.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">An application program may also be referred to as an application, and is a computer program for completing one or more specific types of work. The application program is run in a user mode, may interact with a user, and has a visible user interface. Generally, the application program includes two parts a graphical user interface (GUI) and an engine.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">A shortcut is a command line used for quickly starting a task, for example, a link that is provided by a system and is for quickly starting a program, opening a file, or unfolding a folder, and is usually in a form of an icon. The shortcut is a common expression of multiple possible operation entrances. The shortcut may be but is not limited to an application program, a specific function, a contact, a setting option, a notification bar, or a shortcut operation bar. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the shortcut may be a link for starting an application program, for example, a link for starting one of the following application programs WECHAT, Google Search, a camera, or the like, or may be a link for starting an element in an application program, for example, a link for starting a contact in a contact application, a link for starting a short message service message in a short message service message application, or a link for enabling a function setting in a settings application. Herein, starting an element in a program may be understood as viewing the element in the program, or triggering the element in the program.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">An event may be understood as an object that is sent by a system to an application program when a finger of a user taps a screen and moves on the screen. In a technical implementation, the user may touch not only the screen, but also various sensors, various physical buttons, and the like. The system transfers, according to a specific path, the event to an object that can process the event. For example, in IOS, one UITouch object represents one touch, and one UIEvent object represents one event. An event object includes all touch objects corresponding to a current multi-touch sequence, and may further provide a touch object associated with a specific view or window. A touch event includes a time aspect and a space aspect. Information about the time aspect is referred to as a phase that represents whether a touch just began, whether the touch is moving or is in a still state, and when the touch ends (for example, when a finger raises from the screen). Touch information further includes information about a current position in a view or a window, and information about a previous position. When a finger touches the screen, the touch is associated with a window or a view. This association is maintained in an entire life cycle of the event.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">A biological feature is a human physiological feature or a behavioral feature in a general sense. A terminal may perform identity authentication or the like using a biological recognition technology according to the human biological feature. For example, the biological feature recognition technology is closely combined with technical means such as optics, acoustics, a biosensor, and a biostatistical principle using a computer, and personal identity authentication is performed using the inherent human physiological feature and the behavioral feature. The physiological features include hand shape, fingerprint, face shape, iris, retina, pulse, pinna, and the like. The behavioral features include signature, voice, typing force, and the like.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">A commonly used biological feature is a fingerprint. The fingerprint is formed by epidermal ridges of a human finger. A fingerprint of a person is affected by both a gene and an environment. Although all persons have fingerprints, the fingerprints are different. Because a fingerprint sensor technology is gradually mature, a fingerprint sensor is used in a growing quantity of terminals in order to enhance device security, and improve operation experience of a user. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, fingerprint application may include but is not limited to the following cases</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In a first case, the fingerprint is applied to unlocking and payment, is used as a movement cursor on an operation panel, and is used to enable an operation, content protection, and the like. Enabling an operation is usually defining an application program for each finger, and a corresponding application program may be started by entering a corresponding fingerprint. For example, a fingerprint sensor can record ten fingerprints, and may associate each fingerprint with an application program. For example, a fingerprint of an index finger corresponds to opening a camera, and a fingerprint of a middle finger corresponds to turning on BLUETOOTH. When a user enters a specific fingerprint, a specific application is entered.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In a second case, different application programs are started using fingerprint gestures such as a tap gesture, a double tap gesture, and a touch and hold gesture. For example, tapping using an index finger corresponds to opening a camera, and double tapping the fingerprint sensor using the index finger corresponds to turning on BLUETOOTH.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In a third case, multiple shortcuts are displayed on a screen by entering a fingerprint, and a corresponding application is entered by tapping a shortcut. Fingerprint recognition used in the embodiments may be capacitive fingerprint recognition, and a fingerprint sensor is a capacitive sensor, or may be ultrasonic fingerprint recognition, and there is no need to directly come into contact with a finger. An ultrasonic sensor mainly depends on intensity of a reflected wave in order to form a fingerprint ridge image. When reaching a finger surface via a surface of the sensor, an ultrasonic wave emitted from an ultrasonic wave source is reflected. A receiving device obtains a reflected signal of the ultrasonic wave, measures a range of the reflected signal, obtains a depth of a ridge, and forms a fingerprint image. The image is a real reflection of an actual ridge terrain (roughness). For a capacitive fingerprint recognition technology, refer to CN104748770, which is incorporated in this specification by reference in its entirety. For an ultrasonic wave fingerprint recognition technology, refer to CN104881629, which is incorporated in this specification by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">When fingerprint feature recognition is not used, if a user uses a terminal, for example, needs to open a specific application in order to use a service, the user usually needs to search a system interface for an icon corresponding to the application, and tap the icon of the application after finding the icon, to display an operation interface of the application, and use a service corresponding to the application. When the terminal is still in a screen-locked state and a screen-off state, the user needs to operate more procedures, and an operation is more complex. For example, the terminal may be in the screen-off state, and in this case, the user needs to perform a corresponding operation to illuminate a screen. After the screen of the terminal is illuminated, the screen may be not locked, and in this case, the user may directly search the system interface for a corresponding application icon. Alternatively, after the screen is illuminated, the terminal may be in the screen-locked state, and in this case, the user needs to perform an unlocking operation. The terminal presents the system interface only when unlocking information entered by the user is determined to be correct by means of authentication. In this case, the user further needs to search the system interface for a corresponding application icon, and perform an operation of triggering the application icon. If an operation of the user can be simplified, efficiency of operating the mobile terminal by the user can be improved.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a mobile terminal according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

Optionally, the touch-sensitive surface may include two parts a touch detection apparatus and a touch controller. The touch detection apparatus detects a touch operation of the user, converts the detected touch operation into an electrical signal, and transfers the electrical signal to the touch controller.

For example, the fingerprint sensor is integrated with a touchscreen, and a fixed position is designated on the screen in advance in order to facilitate fingerprint authentication on a fingerprint entered in the fixed region. Alternatively, a function of fingerprint input and/or recognition is extended to the entire screen or any position on the screen, and authentication is performed on a single fingerprint or is simultaneously performed on multiple fingerprints. In a technical implementation in which the screen is the fingerprint sensor, an extra fingerprint sensor layer may be added to a display screen.

A gesture may be understood as a manner in which a finger of the user touches an operation component (such as the screen or the fingerprint sensor), for example, a tap gesture, a double tap gesture, a multi-touch (pinch and spread) gesture, or a sliding gesture. The fingerprint gesture may be understood as an operation in which the user triggers the fingerprint sensor using a specific or non-specific fingerprint, for example, at least one of a tap operation, a double tap operation, a touch and hold operation, or a sliding operation that is performed using one or several fingerprints, for example, a tap operation performed using an index finger, a double tap operation performed using a thumb, a touch and hold operation performed using a middle finger, or a sliding operation performed using an index finger.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Optionally, the fingerprint gesture may be a combination of a fingerprint operation and a non-fingerprint operation, that is, a combination of an operation instruction generated by triggering the fingerprint sensor by the user using a specific fingerprint and an operation instruction generated by triggering another operation component by the user, for example, a combination of the operation of triggering the fingerprint sensor using a fingerprint and an operation of another sensor. For example, this type of fingerprint gesture may include a combination of an instruction for triggering the fingerprint sensor and an instruction for triggering an acceleration sensor. For example, a device is shaken when a touch and hold operation is performed on the fingerprint sensor. Alternatively, this type of fingerprint gesture may include a combination of an instruction for triggering the fingerprint sensor and an instruction for triggering a pressure sensor. For example, the fingerprint sensor is pressed for more than 5 seconds with specific force.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Step S<b>302</b>: Present a shortcut when the fingerprint event that is entered by the user matches a preset fingerprint event.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">When the fingerprint event that is entered by the user is a fingerprint image, that the fingerprint event that is entered by the user matches a preset fingerprint event includes a fingerprint image that is entered by the user is the same as one fingerprint image of multiple pre-stored fingerprint images, or a similarity is greater than or equal to a preset threshold.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">When the fingerprint event that is entered by the user is a fingerprint gesture of touching the fingerprint sensor by the user, that is, at least one of a tap operation, a double tap operation, a touch and hold operation, or a sliding operation that is performed by the user on the fingerprint sensor using a specific fingerprint, that the fingerprint event that is entered by the user matches a preset fingerprint event includes a fingerprint for touching the fingerprint sensor by the user is the same as a preset fingerprint of a fingerprint gesture, and operations performed on the fingerprint sensor are the same, or a fingerprint for touching the fingerprint sensor by the user is the same as a preset fingerprint of a fingerprint gesture, and operations performed on the fingerprint sensor are similar. For example, a deviation between sliding tracks or sliding directions falls within a preset deviation range.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">When the fingerprint event that is entered by the user is a fingerprint gesture, that is, a combination of an operation instruction generated by triggering the fingerprint sensor by the user using a specific fingerprint and an operation instruction generated by triggering another operation component by the user, that the fingerprint event that is entered by the user matches a preset fingerprint event includes a fingerprint for touching the fingerprint sensor by the user is the same as a preset fingerprint of a fingerprint gesture, other operation components touched by the user are the same, and operations for touching the other components by the user are the same or a deviation falls within a preset range.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">For example, a presentation manner may include at least one of the following manners.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Optionally, the screen currently presents a first interface, such as a system interface, and the shortcut is presented in a region on the first interface according to a preset arrangement rule.

A vector in physics is a physical quantity that has a direction. The operation vector may be understood as an operation direction of the user on the operation component. The touchscreen is used as an example. The user performs a sliding operation on the touchscreen, and a sliding track is generated. The sliding track is a track formed by action points of the sliding operation on the touchscreen. An operation vector of the sliding operation may be determined according to the sliding track. Similarly, if the operation component is the fingerprint sensor, and the user performs a sliding operation on the fingerprint sensor, the sliding track is a track formed by actions point of the sliding operation on the fingerprint sensor. An operation vector of the sliding operation may be determined according to the sliding track such as a sliding start point and a sliding end point. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the fingerprint sensor is disposed at the lower part of the display screen, and the terminal obtains the sliding operation on the fingerprint sensor, and determines the sliding direction. Further, the sliding start point obtained by the fingerprint sensor may be mapped to a center point for shortcut arrangement. After the sliding direction of the sliding operation of the user is obtained, the center point may be used as a center, and a shortcut corresponding to the sliding direction on the fingerprint sensor is determined. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, when the user slides rightward, a shortcut on a right side of the center point on the display screen is determined.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The operation vector may be further understood as a movement direction of the mobile terminal that is detected by a sensor. For example, displacement of the mobile terminal in X, Y, and Z three directions in three-dimensional space is detected by an acceleration sensor, a direction sensor, an electronic compass sensor, a gyro sensor, or the like in order to detect a movement displacement direction of the terminal. The direction sensor is used as an example (principles of the gyro sensor are the same). The direction sensor detects displacement of the terminal in the X, Y, and Z three directions in the three-dimensional space in order to detect movement displacement of the terminal. The X and Y directions are used to determine a direction on a horizontal plane, and the Z direction is used to determine a direction perpendicular to the horizontal plane. Displacement data obtained by the sensor by means of detection may be used as basic analysis data for a position information change of the terminal, and further provides data support about whether the terminal needs to perform signal measurement. For example, the direction sensor may obtain displacement in at least one direction of the X, Y, or Z direction, and when the terminal determines, using the sensor, that a continuous position change in the any direction meets a preset time threshold, an operation vector generated by operating the mobile terminal by the user is determined. For example, the mobile terminal may detect, using a gyroscope, an instruction of shaking a mobile phone by the user, and obtain a direction in which the user shakes the mobile phone. After a shortcut is presented according to a preset arrangement rule, a shortcut is determined according to information about the direction.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Step S<b>304</b>: Run a first shortcut in at least one shortcut according to the operation vector, and present a running result.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">After obtaining the operation vector generated by operating the at least one operation component of the mobile terminal by the user, the terminal may determine the first shortcut according to the operation vector, and after determining the first shortcut, run the first shortcut, and present the running result of the first shortcut.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In an optional implementation, the operation vector is the operation direction of the user on the operation component, for example, a sliding direction of the user on the touchscreen or the fingerprint sensor. The terminal may perform operation mapping between an operation event on the touchscreen or the fingerprint sensor and an operation event on a coordinate point on the touchscreen. The operation event that is performed by the user on the fingerprint sensor or the touchscreen and that is detected by the terminal may be considered as a corresponding operation event performed by the user on the coordinate point. For example, the coordinate point may be a center point for presenting multiple shortcuts. For example, when it is detected that the user slides in a direction on the fingerprint sensor, a sliding operation that uses a corresponding coordinate point on the screen as a start point is performed, and sliding tracks may be the same or corresponding to each other. That the sliding tracks are the same or corresponding to each other includes sliding directions are the same or a deviation falls within a preset range, lengths of the sliding tracks are the same or similar according to a proportion, positions of coordinate points passed through by the sliding tracks are in a mapping relationship, or the like. For example, when it is detected that the user performs a double tap operation on the fingerprint sensor, a double tap operation that uses a corresponding coordinate point on the screen as a touch position is performed.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In an optional implementation, the operation vector is the movement direction of the mobile terminal that is detected by a sensor, for example, a movement direction detected by a gyroscope. The terminal may perform operation mapping between a displacement event of the terminal that is detected by the sensor and an operation event on a coordinate point on the touchscreen. The displacement event (which includes a displacement direction, a displacement acceleration, displacement duration, or the like) detected by the terminal may be considered as a corresponding operation event performed by the user on the coordinate point. For example, when it is detected that the terminal is moving forwards in a direction of a 90-degree angle on a Y axis, a shortcut right above a center point for shortcut arrangement on the screen is executed.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Running a first shortcut includes but is not limited to the following cases. When the first shortcut is an interface element (such as a contact profile picture) pointing to a contact, running a first shortcut is dialing a phone number of the contact, when the first shortcut is a task, running a first shortcut is executing the task, for example, enabling or disabling a process in a task manager, when the first shortcut is an entrance of an application program, for example, an icon of GOOGLE Maps, running a first shortcut is running GOOGLE Maps, when the first shortcut is a link of a file, for example, a word file, running a first shortcut is opening the word file, when the first shortcut is a link of a folder, running a first shortcut is unfolding the folder, or when the first shortcut is a link of an element in an application program, running a first shortcut is viewing the element in the program, for example, viewing a contact Zhang San or Li Si in a contact application, or is triggering the element in the program, for example, setting the terminal to a silent mode, or setting screen brightness of the terminal.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">When the operation vector is an operation vector of the user on the fingerprint sensor, the terminal may map, to an operation event obtained by the terminal on the touchscreen, an operation event triggered by the user on the fingerprint sensor. For example, the user performs a sliding operation on the fingerprint sensor using an index finger, and a sliding operation event triggered by the sliding operation performed using the index finger may be mapped to a sliding operation performed on the touchscreen using the index finger. For example, the user performs a touch and hold operation on the fingerprint sensor using a thumb, and a touch and hold operation event triggered by the touch and hold operation performed using the thumb may be mapped to a touch and hold operation event performed on a coordinate point on the touchscreen using the thumb. For example, the user performs a double tap operation on the fingerprint sensor using a thumb, and a double tap operation event triggered by the double tap operation performed using the thumb may be mapped to a double tap operation event performed on a coordinate point on the touchscreen using the thumb.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In this embodiment of the present disclosure, a shortcut is presented by performing matching between fingerprint events, a to-be-run shortcut is determined according to an operation vector generated by operating a mobile terminal by a user, the shortcut is run, and a running result is presented such that the user can conveniently and quickly run the shortcut, thereby reducing operation duration, and improving operation efficiency. For example, in both a screen-off state and a screen-locked state, the user needs only to place a finger on a fingerprint sensor, and the mobile terminal performs fingerprint recognition, illuminates a screen, performs an unlocking operation, and presents a shortcut. After the user views the presented shortcut, the finger moves slightly at a position at which the finger originally stays, and a desired shortcut may be run. For the user, one action performed almost at one position enables the mobile terminal to perform fingerprint recognition, illuminate the screen, perform the unlocking operation, present multiple shortcuts, and run a shortcut selected by the user. That is, a fingerprint event is obtained at a first position on the mobile terminal, and similarly, an operation vector generated by operating an operation component by the user starting from the first position is obtained at the first position.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of operating a mobile terminal according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

In this process, the mobile terminal continuously detects pressure from the index finger of the user, and a coordinate position pressed by the index finger of the user keeps unchanged. After the multiple icons are presented, the mobile terminal obtains a sliding track that is entered by the user and that is obtained by sliding in an upward vertical direction using a point pressed by the index finger as a start point, determines, according to the sliding track, that a current operation vector is the upward vertical direction, for example, determines, by means of calculation using a coordinate point on the touchscreen, that the current operation vector is the upward vertical direction, determines a shortcut in the upward vertical direction, for example, the WECHAT icon, runs the WECHAT icon, and presents an interface on which a WECHAT application is run.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of operating a mobile terminal according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

The touchscreen of the terminal obtains a touch of an index finger of the user, and determines that a fingerprint of the index finger matches a preset fingerprint event. A specific interface is presented. Multiple application icons are presented on the specific interface, for example, a microblog icon A, a WECHAT icon B, an ALIPAY icon C, and a QQ icon D. The four icons may be arranged in a ring shape using a preset center position b as a center. In this process, the mobile terminal does not detect pressure from the index finger of the user, that is, after entering the fingerprint of the index finger, the user removes the finger from the touchscreen. After the multiple icons are presented, the terminal obtains a sliding track that is entered by the user and that is obtained by sliding in an upward vertical direction using any point a on the touchscreen as a start position. The mobile terminal maps the start position of the sliding track to the center position, determines, according to the sliding track, that a current operation vector is the upward vertical direction, determines a shortcut in the upward vertical direction, for example, the WECHAT icon, runs the WECHAT icon, and presents an interface on which a WECHAT application is run.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of operating a mobile terminal according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. In this embodiment of the present disclosure, a fingerprint sensor of the mobile terminal is disposed at a lower part of a touchscreen. The mobile terminal may be currently in a screen-off state, or in a screen-on state, or in a screen-locked state. The fingerprint sensor obtains a touch of an index finger of a user, and determines that a fingerprint of the index finger matches a preset fingerprint event. A specific interface is presented. Multiple application icons are presented on the specific interface, for example, a microblog icon A, a WECHAT icon B, an ALIPAY icon C, and a QQ icon D. The four icons may be arranged in a ring shape using a preset center position b as a center. In this process, the fingerprint sensor continuously detects pressure from the index finger of the user. After the multiple icons are presented, the fingerprint sensor continuously collects a fingerprint image of the index finger of the user, and determines, according to multiple images in an index finger fingerprint model that are stored in the mobile terminal, that the index finger of the user moves. A processor determines a sliding direction of the index finger on the fingerprint sensor according to the multiple stored fingerprint images of the index finger and multiple fingerprint images continuously collected by the fingerprint sensor. For example, the index finger slides in an upward vertical direction. The terminal maps, to the center position, a start position at which the index finger slides on the fingerprint sensor, determines a shortcut in the upward vertical direction of the center position according to the sliding direction, for example, the WECHAT icon, runs the WECHAT icon, and presents an interface on which a WECHAT application is run.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of operating a mobile terminal according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. In this embodiment of the present disclosure, a fingerprint sensor of the terminal is disposed at a lower part of a touchscreen.

The fingerprint sensor obtains a touch of an index finger of a user, and determines that a fingerprint of the index finger matches a preset fingerprint event. A specific interface is presented.

The four icons may be arranged in a ring shape using a preset center position b as a center. In this process, the fingerprint sensor does not detect continuous pressure from the index finger of the user, that is, after entering the fingerprint of the index finger on the fingerprint sensor, the user removes the fingerprint of the index finger from the fingerprint sensor. After the multiple icons are presented, the terminal obtains a sliding track that is entered by the user and that is obtained by sliding in an upward vertical direction using any point on the touchscreen as a start point. The mobile terminal maps a start position a of the sliding track to the center position, determines, according to the sliding track, that a current operation vector is the upward vertical direction, determines a shortcut in the upward vertical direction, for example, the WECHAT icon, runs the WECHAT icon, and presents an interface on which a WECHAT application is run.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the fingerprint sensor of the mobile terminal is a touchscreen. In a screen-off state, the touchscreen obtains a touch operation of an index finger of a user, or obtains a fingerprint of an index finger of a user. The touchscreen is powered on, a screen is illuminated, and a screen-locked interface is presented. A touch position of the index finger of the user keeps unchanged, and a current position on the touchscreen is continuously pressed. The touchscreen obtains the fingerprint of the index finger, performs identity authentication, and performs an unlocking operation. After the mobile terminal presents an interface that is after the unlocking, the touch position of the index finger of the user still keeps unchanged, and the current position on the touchscreen is continuously pressed. The touchscreen obtains the fingerprint of the index finger, compares the fingerprint with a pre-stored fingerprint event, and presents several shortcuts on the interface that is after the unlocking, for example, a microblog icon A and a WECHAT icon B, or for another example, a phone number of a contact A and a phone number of a contact B. The terminal obtains a sliding operation of the index finger on the touchscreen, obtains a sliding direction, determines a shortcut according to the sliding direction, and runs the shortcut, for example, opens a microblog application or a WECHAT application, or for another example, calls the contact A or calls the contact B.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">In an optional embodiment, different fingerprints may be corresponding to different shortcuts. Further, the terminal may pre-store a correspondence between different fingerprints and different shortcuts. One type of fingerprint corresponds to one type of shortcut, for example, an index finger of a user corresponds to a shortcut of a communication-type application, and a middle finger corresponds to a shortcut of a game-type application. The type herein may be obtained by classification by the user, or may be original category information carried when the user downloads an ANDROID package kit (APK) of an application. Alternatively, one type of fingerprint may be corresponding to a shortcut obtained by means of screening according to a screening rule. For example, an index finger of a user corresponds to shortcuts of a specific quantity of applications frequently tapped by the user within a time period, for example, shortcuts of five applications frequently run by the user within the last week. A middle finger corresponds to shortcuts of a specific quantity of applications that are possibly used in a current environment by performing determining according to current environment parameter information. For example, if it is determined, according to the current environment parameter information, that the user is outdoors, applications such as a weather-type application and a traffic-type application may be used. Different fingerprints are corresponding to different shortcuts such that a user can perform different settings according to a use habit of the user in order to diversify shortcut selection, and facilitate a user operation.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In an optional embodiment, different fingerprints may be corresponding to different shortcut arrangement. Further, the terminal may pre-store a correspondence between different fingerprints and different shortcut arrangement rules. The arrangement rule may include at least one of a shortcut quantity rule, a shortcut arrangement pattern rule, a shortcut arrangement position rule, a shortcut arrangement spacing rule, or the like. The shortcut quantity rule is a quantity of shortcuts. For example, the quantity of shortcuts may be a quantity of shortcuts of all applications whose use frequencies within a time period exceed a specific value, for example, a quantity of shortcuts of applications that are used more than ten times within one day, may be a quantity of shortcuts of applications presented according to a specific proportion, for example, a quantity of shortcuts of the first five applications that are most frequently used, or may be a fixed value such as five times. The fixed value may be preset by a system, or may be defined by a user. The shortcut arrangement pattern rule is a shortcut arrangement form. For example, a coordinate point on a touchscreen is used as a center. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, shortcuts are arranged around the coordinate point in a cellular shape, arranged in a rectangle shape, or arranged in a pattern defined by the user. The shortcut arrangement position rule defines a position at which a shortcut is presented on a screen. For example, shortcuts are arranged using a position of a center point on the screen as a center. Whether the user holds the terminal using a left hand or a right hand may be further determined according to a handheld status of the user, and when the user holds the terminal using the left hand, the terminal may intelligently adjust a shortcut arrangement position. Determining whether the terminal is held using the left hand or the right hand belongs to the other approaches in the field, and details are not further described herein. The shortcut arrangement spacing rule means a mutual spacing between multiple shortcuts. For example, eight shortcuts are presented by default by the system. The shortcuts are arranged in a circle whose radius is 0.5 centimeter, or arranged in a circle whose radius is 1 centimeter. The specific rules may be combined with each other for application, and the rules may be set by the user, or may be preset by the system. Different fingerprints are corresponding to different shortcut arrangement rules such that a user can set, according to a use habit of the user, an arrangement form that the user is fond of, thereby implementing customization, and improving user experience.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In a possible implementation, after obtaining a fingerprint gesture or a fingerprint, the fingerprint sensor of the terminal determines whether the fingerprint gesture matches a preset fingerprint gesture, or determines whether the fingerprint matches a preset fingerprint. When the fingerprint gesture matches the preset fingerprint gesture, or the fingerprint matches the preset fingerprint, any coordinate point on a screen of the terminal is obtained, the coordinate point is used as a center, and corresponding shortcuts are presented around the coordinate point in a preset arrangement manner. A sliding operation of a user at any point on a touchscreen is obtained, and the sliding operation of the user at the any point on the touchscreen is mapped to a sliding operation that uses the coordinate point as a start point. After obtaining the sliding operation that uses the coordinate point as the start point, the terminal obtains a sliding direction of the sliding operation, and runs a shortcut corresponding to the sliding direction. In this way, after a terminal authenticates a fingerprint, and presents a shortcut, a user no longer needs to tap a shortcut at a specific position to run the shortcut, thereby improving convenience of a user operation.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In a possible implementation, when the fingerprint gesture matches the preset fingerprint gesture, or the fingerprint matches the preset fingerprint, the terminal may further determine, using a sensor, whether the user holds the terminal using a left hand or a right hand in order to determine whether the user currently operates the terminal using the left hand or the right hand. Further, a shortcut arrangement rule such as an arrangement position or an arrangement pattern is determined according to whether the user operates the terminal using the left hand or the right hand. For example, when the user operates the terminal using the right hand, shortcuts may be presented in a sector shape in a lower right corner on the display screen of the terminal such that the user can quickly and conveniently select a shortcut, thereby improving use convenience of the user.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In a possible implementation, after obtaining a fingerprint gesture or a fingerprint, the fingerprint sensor of the terminal determines whether the fingerprint gesture matches a preset fingerprint gesture, or determines whether the fingerprint matches a preset fingerprint. When the fingerprint gesture matches the preset fingerprint gesture, or the fingerprint matches the preset fingerprint, any coordinate point on a screen of the terminal is obtained, the coordinate point is used as a center, and corresponding shortcuts are presented around the coordinate point in a preset arrangement manner. A sliding operation of a user on the fingerprint sensor is obtained, and the sliding operation of the user on the fingerprint sensor is mapped to a sliding operation that uses the coordinate point as a start point. After obtaining the sliding operation that uses the coordinate point as the start point, the terminal obtains a sliding direction of the sliding operation, and runs a shortcut corresponding to the sliding direction. In this way, a user can select and run a shortcut only by operating a fingerprint sensor, and the user does not need to tap a touchscreen for selection after determining the shortcut, thereby greatly improving touch efficiency.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">During actual product implementation, the following scenario may occur. The fingerprint sensor of the terminal has a relatively small touch area, and a sliding direction cannot be accurately detected. In a possible implementation, after fingerprint gesture recognition or fingerprint recognition is performed, and a shortcut is presented on a display screen, a touchscreen or any other touch component of the terminal may be further used to determine a direction of an operation vector of an operation performed by a user on a screen or the operation component in order to determine a shortcut. For example, after a fingerprint component on the back of Mate <b>7</b> recognizes a fingerprint gesture of an index finger or a middle finger, a shortcut is displayed. When a thumb slides in a direction on the screen, a shortcut in the corresponding direction is selected and executed. The thumb may operate at any position on the screen, and the terminal needs only to determine direction information of an operation vector, and determines a shortcut according to the direction information.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">During product implementation, a scenario in which the terminal is in a screen-locked state may further occur. In a possible implementation, when a fingerprint gesture or a fingerprint is used to present a shortcut, the fingerprint gesture or the fingerprint may be further used for unlocking. That is, when the terminal is in the screen-locked state, that is, when the terminal currently presents a screen-locked interface, the terminal obtains a fingerprint event that is entered by a user using the fingerprint sensor. When the fingerprint event matches a preset fingerprint event, the terminal performs an unlocking operation, and presents a corresponding shortcut on an interface presented on a display screen after the unlocking. In a possible implementation, if a fingerprint gesture or a fingerprint cannot be used for unlocking, in the screen-locked state, the terminal obtains an unlocking instruction that is entered by the user, and terminates the screen-locked state according to the unlocking instruction. The terminal obtains a fingerprint gesture or a fingerprint that is entered by the user, attempts to authenticate the fingerprint gesture or the fingerprint, and presents a corresponding shortcut when the authentication succeeds. Alternatively, in a possible implementation, when a fingerprint gesture or a fingerprint is used to present a shortcut, the fingerprint gesture or the fingerprint is not used for unlocking. Instead, after an operation vector generated by triggering an operation component by the user is obtained, unlocking is performed such that the terminal can run, on a screen that is after the unlocking, a shortcut corresponding to the operation vector, and can further present a running result. Alternatively, in a possible implementation, an unlocked state may be entered only when a running result of a shortcut corresponding to an operation vector is finally presented. That is, the terminal is still in the screen-locked state when the shortcut is run, and when the running result of the shortcut is presented, the terminal is in the unlocked state. Certainly, in a possible implementation, a running result of a shortcut corresponding to an operation vector may be presented on a screen-locked interface. This is not limited. A screen-locked interface of a terminal is considered such that the terminal learns of a requirement of a user in a timely manner, thereby improving convenience of operating the terminal in different states, and improving user experience.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">During product implementation, a scenario in which the terminal is in a screen-off state may further occur. In a possible implementation, the terminal is in a state in which a screen is off and the screen is not locked. In the screen-off state, the terminal obtains a fingerprint gesture or a fingerprint that is entered by a user, illuminates a screen, attempts to determine, by means of authentication, whether the fingerprint gesture or the fingerprint matches a preset fingerprint event, and when an authentication result is that the fingerprint gesture or the fingerprint matches the preset fingerprint event, presents a corresponding shortcut on a current interface. In a possible implementation, the terminal is in both a screen-off state and a screen-locked state. In this case, a fingerprint gesture or a fingerprint may be used to invoke a shortcut, and may be further used for unlocking. That is, in the screen-off state, the terminal obtains a fingerprint gesture or a fingerprint that is entered by a user. The terminal illuminates a screen, and attempts to determine, by means of authentication, whether the fingerprint gesture or the fingerprint matches a preset fingerprint event. When an authentication result is that the fingerprint gesture or the fingerprint matches the preset fingerprint event, the terminal performs an unlocking operation, and presents a corresponding shortcut on an interface presented on a display screen after the unlocking. It should be noted that, operations of illuminating the screen and performing authentication by the terminal may be simultaneously performed, or may be performed in a sequence according to a requirement. From a perspective of user perception, after a fingerprint event is entered, the terminal may first illuminate the screen, present a screen-locked interface, then display the interface that is after the unlocking, and further present a corresponding shortcut on the interface that is after the unlocking.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, in the method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the method further includes presenting a screen-locked interface when the fingerprint event that is entered by the user does not match the preset fingerprint event, where at least one shortcut is presented on the screen-locked interface, obtaining a sliding direction of the user on the fingerprint sensor, determining, according to the sliding direction of the user on the fingerprint sensor, a second shortcut in the at least one shortcut presented on the screen-locked interface, and running the second shortcut, and presenting a running result. An example that the second shortcut is an icon of a camera application is used. If the preset fingerprint event is a fingerprint of an index finger, and the fingerprint that is entered by the user is a fingerprint of a thumb, in this case, the terminal determines, by means of authentication, that the preset fingerprint event and the fingerprint event that is entered by the user do not match, and presents the screen-locked interface. A shortcut of the camera application is presented on the screen-locked interface. For example, the camera application is presented in a lower right corner on the current display screen of the terminal. A sliding operation of the user on the fingerprint sensor is obtained. The sliding operation may be performed using any finger, or may be performed using only a preset fingerprint. When the sliding operation of the user on the fingerprint sensor is an upward sliding operation, the camera application is run, and a viewfinder is presented. In this embodiment, a shortcut is presented on a screen-locked interface such that a user can open a corresponding shortcut by performing a sliding operation on a fingerprint sensor, and the user can quickly and conveniently run the shortcut without moving a finger to a touchscreen to perform an operation, thereby reducing operation duration, and improving operation efficiency.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, this embodiment of the present disclosure further provides a mobile terminal.
