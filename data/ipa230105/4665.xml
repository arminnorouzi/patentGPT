No. 63/202,954, entitled SURVEILLANCE DATA FILTRATION TECHNIQUES, filed Jul. 1, 2021 (Attorney Docket #AA610), which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates generally to electronic search or surveillance. More specifically, this disclosure pertains to identifying the locations of subjects of interest to law enforcement agencies and filtering collected data associated therewith.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Autonomous vehicles associated with law enforcement can, for example, determine if an automobile has violated traffic laws, follow the vehicle, and electronically issue a ticket or warning to the violator. Autonomous vehicles can be trained to find good hiding spots to catch traffic violators, aim their cameras to accurately monitor traffic, identify vehicles, analyze incoming data against a database of traffic laws, and communicate with a central computing system and surveillance cameras. Such an autonomous vehicle can record the collected data and transmit the record to government agencies. Autonomous vehicles can also assess environments and the people therein to reduce the risk to law enforcement personnel. For example, drones can observe and interact with a suspect, capture images of the suspect and of associated documents of interest, perform image comparison, perform text extraction and classification, correlate text with image identification, and communicate data to a base station.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Images transmitted can be encrypted, for example, to address privacy concerns. Privacy issues with image dataset collection, for example for surveillance data or medical data, may be addressed with learnable encryption algorithms. And it is possible to photograph and record to investigate incidents such as crime and terrorism while protecting the privacy of people at a high level. For example, cameras can be installed in private vehicles, and the images from such cameras may then be stored for a short period of time, e.g., one to two weeks, in case they are needed by law enforcement.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Common to many of such systems is providing data to law enforcement agencies such that all data collected concerns suspects about whom law enforcement has a right to collect data. However, some of such systems, for example at least autonomous traffic monitoring and environment assessment, may involve collecting a range of data that is not related to anyone or anything about whom law enforcement has the right to collect data. Systems that can identify the locations of subjects and items of interest may not be able to do so while also protecting the privacy of subjects and items that are not of interest.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The above-described background is merely intended to provide a contextual overview of some current issues, and is not intended to be exhaustive.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Non-limiting and non-exhaustive aspects of the subject disclosure are described with reference to the following figures, wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the various views unless otherwise specified.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flow chart depicting flow and steps in accordance with various aspects of the subject disclosure;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow chart depicting flow and actions in accordance with various aspects of the subject disclosure;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram of a system in accordance with various aspects of the subject disclosure;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a message flow diagram depicting message flow in accordance with various aspects of the subject disclosure;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram of an exemplary system of the present teachings;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow chart depicting flow and steps in accordance with various aspects of the subject disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flow chart depicting flow and steps in accordance with various aspects of the subject disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of various aspects and arrangements.

RAM can also include a high-speed RAM such as static RAM for caching data.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As used herein, a computer can operate in a networked environment using logical connections via wired and/or wireless communications to one or more remote computers. The remote computer(s) can be a workstation, server, router, personal computer, portable computer, microprocessor-based entertainment appliance, peer device, or other common network node.

Such LAN and WAN networking environments are commonplace in offices and companies, and facilitate enterprise-wide computer networks, such as intranets, any of which can connect to a global communications network, e.g., the Internet.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">When used in a LAN networking environment, a computer can be connected to the LAN through a wired and/or wireless communication network interface or adapter. The adapter can facilitate wired or wireless communication to the LAN, which can also include a wireless access point (AP) disposed thereon for communicating with the adapter in a wireless mode.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">When used in a WAN networking environment, a computer can include a modem or can be connected to a communications server on the WAN via other means for establishing communications over the WAN, such as by way of the Internet.

In a networked environment, program modules depicted herein relative to a computer or portions thereof can be stored in a remote memory/storage device.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">When used in either a LAN or WAN networking environment, a computer can access cloud storage systems or other network-based storage systems in addition to, or in place of, external storage devices. Generally, a connection between a computer and a cloud storage system can be established over a LAN or a WAN, e.g., via an adapter or a modem, respectively.

For simplicity of explanation, the methods (or algorithms) are depicted and described as a series of steps or actions. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various arrangements are not limited by the actions illustrated and/or by the order of actions. For example, actions can occur in various orders and/or concurrently, and with other actions not presented or described herein. Furthermore, not all illustrated actions may be required to implement the methods. In addition, the methods could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states via a state diagram or events. Additionally, the methods described hereafter are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture (e.g., a machine-readable storage medium) to facilitate transporting and transferring such methodologies to computers.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In accordance with an aspect, the system of the present teachings collects data, for example, but not limited to, sensor data, identifies data such as, for example, but not limited to, images of interest, and deletes data that are not of interest. In an aspect, the system encrypts incoming data. In an aspect, the encryption happens in place. In an aspect, all the incoming data are encrypted. The system includes, but is not limited to including, data filtering. In an aspect, the data are filtered to reduce the amount of data required to be transmitted from a collection device to a processing device. In an aspect, the collection devices and the processing devices are operably coupled by electronic communications means. In an aspect, the collection devices and the processing devices are not physically co-located. In an aspect, the collection devices and processing devices are co-located. In an aspect, the collection devices and processing devices share a processor or multiple processors. In an aspect, the data filtering includes a plurality of passes. In an aspect, there are a first pass data filter and a second pass data filter. The present teachings contemplate further filter passes or a single filter pass. In an aspect, the system includes a ruleset processor that can process a filter ruleset. In an aspect, the ruleset processor processes a filter ruleset after at least one criterion is met. For example, but not limited to, the filter ruleset is processed after it is ascertained that the sender of the filter ruleset is an authorized entity. In an aspect, the system deletes data that do not meet selection criteria. The selection criteria can include, but are not limited to including, dynamically-determined criteria, default criteria, and/or criteria established by a user. In an aspect, the system operates in a plurality of modes. In an aspect, the system automatically chooses a mode based upon, for example, the data collected by the collection devices. In an aspect, a user chooses a mode. In an aspect, a default mode is chosen based upon a desired application. In some configurations, the system includes a general mode, a subject mode, and a scene mode. Other modes are contemplated and can be accommodated by the present teachings.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an aspect, general mode can be likened to the surveillance camera in a store in which the sensor data can be recalled when it is determined that something of interest might have taken place during a specific timeframe. In general mode, the system collects all sensor data that is indicated by, for example, a ruleset, a default set of sensors, or a user-supplied set of sensors. For example, a user may choose to collect LIDAR data, camera data, audio data, and chemical data because a particular application might require point cloud and image data to be collected in a certain geography and in a certain timeframe along with audio and chemical data. Additionally or in the alternative, general mode may indicate by default that all available sensors are activated, and all available sensor data is collected. In one aspect, in general mode the system pre-processes incoming data by filtering the data according to pre-selected criteria such as, for example, but not limited to, blurriness, signal-to-noise ratio, data quality, temporal filtering, or detection of specified objects. In some arrangements further filtering is done according to a pre-selected processing recipe for general data, or according to specific rules that can be provided to the system. In general mode, in an aspect, data remaining after filtering is provided, after being encrypted and, optionally, encoded, to a user to review. In some aspects, for example when a person of interest is being sought, in general mode the user, or system owner, may be a private sector user, and any remaining data are made accessible to the system owner, and are made available for further subject-level filtering and analysis should such be desired. In some aspects, in general mode the user may be a public sector user, and any remaining data is made available for further subject-level filtering and analysis as authorized and configured, but is not made available for public use.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some aspects, general mode may is used to perform background subtraction. Such background subtraction is used for scenarios in which geographic areas are designated with what subjects are permitted or expected to be present, and the system detects anomalies in such an area and notifies a user that an anomaly has occurred. Such notification may include providing image data and/or other data representing the anomaly. For example, the system may be configured to designate an area that has restrictions or requirements, and provide an alert when needed, e.g., when a car is parked where it should not be parked.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an aspect, subject mode enables a user to apply image recognition to collected data. For example, if it is necessary to locate a particular person, a type of machine learning model that is used for this purpose is trained to sort through collected data looking for the person in the image. As one of skill would understand, one of many examples of suitable models for face recognition is a neural network model called Deep Face. An example face recognition process follows four steps: (1) face detection, in which one or more faces in an image or video is located and marked with a bounding box; (2) face alignment, in which the detected face (and its location, size, and pose) is normalized to be consistent with the database, as to, e.g., geometry and photometrics; (3) feature extraction, in which features are extracted from the aligned face that can be used for recognition; and (4) feature matching of a feature vector representing the face against one or more known faces in a prepared database (e.g., a database of enrolled users). In an aspect, the system has a separate module or program for each of the four steps, or combines some or all of the steps into a single process. Likewise, if it is necessary to locate an object such as a license plate, a type of machine learning model that is used for this purpose is trained to sort through collected data looking for the specific license plate. As one of skill would understand, one of many examples of suitable models for license plate detection and identification is distributed by Plate Recognizer. In an examplary license plate detection and identification process, a first object detection model is used to recognize an image of a car or other vehicle in multiple images and/or video. In an aspect, a detection model is used to identify license plates in images of cars or other vehicles. The detection model(s) need not be machine learning models. If machine learning models are used, neural networks such as, e.g., YOLO or SSD (both defined below), may be trained to detect license plates. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) may be performed for detected license plates to convert images to text. In an aspect, in subject mode, if data collection and data processing are accomplished in geographically remote (as to each other) processors, at the data collection location, the data are subjected to a first pass filtering process. The first pass filtering process sorts through the data to identify, for example, bounding boxes for objects, sorting the subject from the rest of the data, which are omitted. The data within the bounding boxes are transmitted from a data collection module to a processing module that subjects the data to further filtering. In an aspect, the processing module selects a machine learning model that would be appropriate for the selected subject type such that, when the collected data arrives at the processing module, a subject-specific machine learning model is applied to the data. Possible matches are located, and non-matches are deleted. The possible matches are provided to, for example, a handheld device, tablet, or laptop user interface, a log file, and/or a local or remote system operator desktop user interface. In various configurations, multiple filtering passes execute in the same processor. Additionally or in the alternative, multiple filtering passes execute at a data collection location. Additionally or in the alternative, multiple filtering passes execute remotely from the data collection location. Additionally or in the alternative, multiple filtering passes execute at various processors, local and remote from the data collection location.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Various machine learning models are known to those of skill and may include, as non-limiting and non-exhaustive examples, clustering, dimensionality reduction, ensemble methods, neural nets (e.g., convolutional neural network models) and deep learning, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and word embeddings. Many suitable techniques for object detection and recognition would be readily appreciated by one of skill in the art, including, by way of non-limiting example, Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN), Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Single Shot Detector (SSD), Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP-net), and You Only Look Once (YOLO).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one example, in subject mode, a system in accordance with the subject disclosure receives an electronic warrant from an authorized entity that can be used to create and/or augment a filter ruleset. The new filter ruleset can effectively authorize an autonomous vehicle to be on the lookout for a vehicle of interest, for example, a Black Hummer H<b>1</b> with a particular license plate, by passing the filter ruleset to a collection device. A collection device may be incorporated within the autonomous vehicle of the present teachings. Additionally or in the alternative, the collection device may be located remote from, or at least in part remote from, the autonomous vehicle and communicatively coupled thereto. As the autonomous vehicle collects data, the data are compared against the filter ruleset, for example, a list of vehicles included in all active warrants. In an aspect, data associated with vehicles that match a vehicle listed in an active warrant are stored and passed to a processing module, and possibly made available to law enforcement, based on further processing conducted by the processing module. When the vehicle of interest is detected, a law enforcement agent listed on the warrant is notified that the vehicle has been detected and provided the date/time of such detection. In an aspect, the law enforcement agent can securely view and possibly download an image of the vehicle of interest.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some configurations, a system in accordance with the subject disclosure may operate in a scene mode. The scene mode enables a user to apply scene of interest rules to collected data. In an aspect similar to that for operation in subject mode, a particular scene of interest (like a particular subject of interest) may appear in view of the data collector at any time. Criteria for recognizing a scene of interest may not be specific to a particular location, but may instead provide general characteristics of what such a scene might be. For example, if a machine learning model is trained with the general characteristics of an arson scene, the data collector recognizes possible arson scenes. In scene mode, a trained machine learning model is used in either the data collector or, in an arrangement wherein two data processing passes are available, e.g., one at the data collector and another in a processing system, in the data collector and also in the processing system. Scenes that are identified by the machine learning model are provided to a user, a computer, a log file, and/or various types of display, and the remaining data are deleted.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an aspect, the system of the present teachings includes a collection processor configured to receive sensor data and encrypt the received sensor data. In various aspects, a collection processor and one or more sensors are mounted upon, for example, an autonomous vehicle, a utility pole, and/or a drone, and/or the collection processor and sensor(s) are carried by a human or animal. In an aspect, the collection processor is configured to execute coded instructions stored in its memory, or in a memory coupled to the collection processor, to filter the sensor data. In an aspect, data that are filtered out are deleted. In an aspect, sensor data are retained for which the filter indicates a likely match, for example, a probability of a match at or above a predefined threshold probability. To perform filtering, a collection processor in some configurations locates features in received sensor data and match those features, if possible, to any of the items in a list of possible features that are of interest, e.g., a trigger list, provided in accordance with a filter ruleset. In an aspect, the trigger list is created from rules that are established by, for example, but not limited to, law enforcement and/or municipal officials. In an aspect, the trigger list includes a subset of an entire set of rules so that processing requirements for the collection processor can be reduced or minimized in order to reduce power consumption. In an example, a trigger list includes facial data of suspect individuals or missing people, and the collection processor looks for matches between the facial data in the trigger list and received sensor data and/or filtered sensor data. Those skilled in the art would readily appreciate that many types of sensor data may be collected, and the trigger list may include triggers for many kinds of data. For example, if the trigger is an object, object detection may be performed using a technique according to various methods known to one of skill, including, but not limited to R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, R-FCN, HOG, SSD, SPP-net, and YOLO. Other types of sensor signals and/or other types of data may be detected and collected such as, by way of non-limiting examples, LIDAR signals, radar signals, ultrasonic waves, optical camera data, audio data (such as, e.g., voice or music data), chemical data, infrared signals, magnetic or near field waveforms, electromagnetic or radio frequency waveforms, point cloud data, bitmaps, alphanumeric data (such as, e.g., automobile license plate numbers), video data, detected faces, and other types of detected objects.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an aspect, a collection processor is configured to ensure that collected data are maintained in a secure state whether the data are stored locally or are being transmitted to a remote location such as, e.g., a processing station. For example, the collection processor is configured to encrypt all data as the data are received. In an aspect, the collection processor is configured to re-encrypt decrypted data, in the transmit chain, certain elements of the data that have been selected for transmission to the processing station. Various known encryption techniques may be used, such as, by way of non-limiting example, Advanced Encryption System (AES) 256-bit encryption, as would be understood by those of skill. Additionally or in the alternative, the collection module authenticates the data, for example, by ensuring that the data are digitally signed before the data are transmitted to enable a receiver to prove the identity of the sender upon receipt of the data. Additionally or in the alternative, the collection module associates metadata, for example time and/or location data, with the transmitted data. Additionally or in the alternative, the data to be transmitted to the processing station are compressed in order to save bandwidth. Compression may be accomplished using any of various known, standardized methods such as, by way of non-limiting examples, vocoding for voice data, ITU-T H.264, HEVC, or VVC for video data, Huffman coding, lossless compression, or lossy compression, as those of skill would understand. Additionally or in the alternative, a checksum is appended to the data to be transmitted to the processing station in order to enable a receiver at the processing station to detect any errors caused by the transmission medium. Additionally or in the alternative, the data to be transmitted to the processing station are encoded such that a receiver can decode the data to correct for errors caused by the transmission medium. As one of skill in the art would understand, error-correction encoding may be accomplished using various known techniques including, as non-limiting examples, block coding, e.g., Reed-Solomon coding, convolution encoding, turbo encoding, low-density parity check (LDPC) encoding, or polar encoding. Those skilled in the art would also appreciate that the error-correction encoding format employed could depend on the communication protocol being used for transmission. In some aspects, when compression, encryption, and error-correction encoding are performed on data prior to transmission of the data, the data may first be compressed, then the compressed data may be encrypted, and then the encrypted compressed data may be error-correction encoded.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some arrangements, a collection processor uses one or more of various known machine learning models to perform feature extraction and matching in which computations are performed on the autonomous vehicle (e.g., at an edge node rather than in the cloud). In an aspect, such feature matching targets set of features, which are predefined in a ruleset. The collection module applies tracking, including, e.g., temporal filtering of objects during object detection. Such filtering includes a first type of filtering and a second type of filtering that may be performed by a remote processor at a processing station (e.g., in the cloud). In an aspect, the first type of filtering includes coarse-grained filtering relative to the second type of filtering. In an aspect, the collection module utilizes a two-dimensional (2D)-bounding box tracking mechanism such as, e.g., Generalized Intersection Over Union (GIOU) tracking, to track objects and their bounding boxes from each collected image frame to the subsequent collected image frame. In other arrangements, the collection module tracks objects using a Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter (JDAF) algorithm, a linear velocity prediction technique, and/or a combination of the two. The collection module, in some aspects, crops one or more, or all, sections of an image within the bounding boxes of the object of interest, as defined by a ruleset. The collection module transmits data to a remotely located processing station, or to a collocated processing station, at least one such cropped image pertaining to a detected and tracked object of interest. In an aspect, the collection module compresses, encrypts, and/or encodes the cropped image before transmitting the cropped image.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A system in accordance with some aspects of the subject disclosure includes a processing module (for example a processing station, or at a processing station) that is configured to receive and process filters or triggers that are used to sort collected data. In an aspect, the processing module receives inputs such as, for example, but not limited to, a trigger and an accompanying authorization to search for the trigger. The trigger includes, for example, but not limited to, objects, images, odors, sounds, scenes, and/or other sensory data. In addition or in the alternative, the processing module receives such identifying information as, for example, but not limited to, location(s) of one or more scenes of interest, duration(s) of one or more sounds of interest, and/or one or more notifications such as, e.g., communications from a collection device or from a human, or automated messages, including notifications of matches or probable matches between collected image data and scenes or subjects of interest. In some examples, a processing module is configured to receive and execute instructions provided via inputs received from an end user application. The end user application, in an aspect, is used to request a ruleset to be applied by the processing module. In various embodiments, the processing module itself includes a manager program. The manager program, in some embodiments, is a cloud-based manager. The manager program is designed to, among other things, maintain one or more of data privacy, data security, chain-of-custody control, and/or audit trail (such as, for example, time or data stamping). In an aspect, the manager program is ruleset agnostic, i.e., the manager program is not limited to processing rulesets encoded in any one specific format. In some configurations, the manager program includes instructions that enable provision of an applications programming interface (API) for privacy, chain of custody, and/or auditing rules to be set by users, such as, by way of non-limiting example, police, government authorities, national security agencies, or commercial customers with special privacy needs.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In various configurations, a processing module and a collection module (for example, a collection processor) communicate with each other through, for example, a gateway. In an aspect, the gateway establishes a web service between the collection module and the gateway, and establishes communications between the collection module and the gateway using the web service, as would be understood by one of skill in art. In some configurations, the gateway is a web server of the web service, and the collection module is a web client of the web service. In an aspect, data are communicated between the collection module and the gateway using the web service.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A processing module in accordance with various arrangements is configured to use encryption keys associated with encrypted data received from a collection module to decrypt the data received from the collection module. Additionally, the processing module is configured to, optionally, re-encrypt data received from a collection module that has been decrypted. In some aspects, the processing module verifies and tracks chain of custody and/or digital signatures associated with incoming data, and/or enables digital signing of some or all outgoing data that the processing module transmits. In various arrangements, the processing module receives rulesets and, based at least in part thereon, prepares and transmits to a collection module a subset (for example, a trigger list) of one or more rulesets for the collection processor to use. In various aspects, the processing module applies a fine-grain filter to coarsely filtered data received from a collection module, and applies a ruleset to the filtered data. A filtered outcome including at least matched data and a match notification are transmitted to, for example, an authorized individual, a log file, a cloud-based system, a laptop, a handheld device, a desktop, and/or a tablet.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A processing module in accordance with various aspects uses any of various machine learning models to subject data received from a collection module to a finer, e.g., more detailed, version of feature matching than a relatively coarse feature matching computation that was performed by the collection module. For example, the processing module determines data that meet trigger requirements described in a ruleset for the filter. In some aspects, a processing module includes at least an extraction algorithm and a recognition algorithm. In an aspect, the extraction algorithm is used to decrypt and/or to decode sensor data that had been collected and filtered previously by a collection module. In an aspect, the extraction algorithm includes at least a neural network algorithm configured to receive decoded, filtered sensor data and generate bounding boxes containing the desired sensor data. In some aspects, the extraction algorithm processes detected sensor data provided by the neural network algorithm. In some aspects, the recognition algorithm subjects detected sensor data to further processing such as, for example, but not limited to, optical character recognition algorithms. Additionally or in the alternative, the recognition algorithm filters the resulting data, such as, for example, text matching between text generated from the data and a trigger value such as a license plate number described in the filter ruleset to classify the text as a match/no-match. In an aspect, the processing module stores the result from the further processing. In an aspect, the storage is secure. In an aspect, the processing module encrypts the storage area so that the data are accessible only by authorized users based on received trigger data. In an aspect, the processing module sends notification(s) when a match is found between the data and a trigger database by, as a non-limiting example, sending a text to the authorized user. In an aspect, the processing module allows an authenticated user to view and download matched data and the location(s) of collection of the matched data. In an aspect, the viewing is secure. In an aspect, data that do not provide a match in accordance with a trigger list are not made available to the authorized individual, or to anyone else, in order to protect the privacy of people who are not of interest. Such data may be deleted, or such data may be encrypted and stored. It would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a system in accordance with the subject disclosure need not be limited to detecting and/or recognizing only facial features. One of skill would understand that machine learning models can be trained to recognize many types of objects, including but not limited to, e.g., license plates, automobiles, animals, and consumer goods.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A system in accordance with the subject disclosure may be used in various different ways, each invoking privacy and security concerns that are addressed by the architecture of the system. For example, if the system is being used to locate a person for whom a search warrant is outstanding, and the system is executed by an autonomous vehicle, for example, the system collects a substantial number of images of non-suspect individuals. An example system prevents locations and/or activities of non-suspect individuals from being made available to law enforcement. Filtering and encryption by collection modules and processing modules may enable images that are substantially similar in appearance to the suspect to be provided to law enforcement. On the other hand, a system in accordance with the subject disclosure may be used to scan the environment in general without searching for any particular individual or item of interest. In the act of scanning the environment, the system may detect evidence that a crime was committed, or may detect a crime being committed. An example system ensures that images that are captured are not disqualified as evidence, and/or that captured images provided to authorities do not include data that may implicate innocent people. A system according to the subject disclosure accomplishes the foregoing by, for example, but not limited to, assessing incoming data based on rules set by authorities.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As would be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art, AES-256 encryption may be used in a collection module and/or in a processing module in accordance with the subject disclosure when symmetric key encryption is required, such as, e.g., for data-at-rest encryption for datastores such as, e.g., object, relational, directory, and/or search datastores. The AES-256 encryption algorithm may also be used to encrypt message blocks exchanged between the collection module and the processing module over a network. Such messages may also or in the alternative be encrypted with TLS 1.2 encryption used for computer network channels.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As would also be appreciated by one of skill, messages containing data exchanged between a collection module and a processing module in accordance with the subject disclosure may be digitally signed, and a cryptographic hash may be generated for each such message. A recipient of the message may decrypt the message using a public key certificate of the sender. A cryptographic hash may again be generated, at the recipient. Both cryptographic hashes may be compared to verify message authenticity. If the two cryptographic hashes match, then the message may be deemed valid. RS-2048 encryption may be used for digital signatures.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some aspects, access to data requires user authentication and authorization. Multi-factor authentication using at least two strong authenticators may be desirable in situations involving law enforcement authorities, for example. A user who has been authenticated may be authorized to view specific data as defined using role-based access controls that limit access based on, e.g., subject, time frame, geography, and/or various other parameters.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some configurations, a system may perform first pass processing, assuming that first and second pass processors will be transferring data between each other, in accordance with the method depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In some aspects, second pass processing may be performed in accordance with the method depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in action <b>1851</b>, if it is not time to transmit data, e.g., if a desired amount of data has not been collected, or a time limit for collecting data has not expired, or some other known criterion for ceasing data collection has not been met, flow control proceeds to action <b>1852</b>. In action <b>1852</b>, if there are no more data to process, the first pass processing ends. If in action <b>1852</b> there are more data to process, control flow proceeds to action <b>1857</b>.

The mode may be established by a system user, be a default mode, be determined by a choice of application made by a user, be determined by a suite of one or more sensors, or be selected in any of various other appropriate ways. While the mode may be set by a system user, the mode could, in the alternative, be determined dynamically by a data collection system.

In action <b>1861</b>, if the mode is general mode, control flow proceeds to action <b>1863</b>. In action <b>1863</b>, the system accumulates sensor data received from activated sensors. In some configurations, the system supports dynamic adjustment of a set of activated sensors based at least on, e.g., occurrence of a sensor failure, or if at least some of the collected sensor data indicates that other sensors should be activated.

Control flow then proceeds to action <b>1869</b>, in which the system may, in some configurations, select a trained machine learning model, the selection being based at least in part on the type of subject. Control flow then proceeds to action <b>1871</b>, wherein the system applies a selected, trained machine learning model to the sensor data. In some aspects, in a first pass of processing, the selected machine learning model is trained to identify sensor data that meet the characteristics of the subject generally, but may not meet the characteristics of the subject more specifically (e.g., more detailed, fine, or granular characteristics). In some aspects, first pass processing and second pass processing are combined to enable the system to identify a specific subject in a single pass. Moreover, as those of skill would understand, it is possible to tune the first pass processing relative to the second pass processing (or vice versa) to achieve optimum results based on the type of subject. In other words, the relative coarseness of first pass filtering and the relative fineness of second pass filtering may be adjusted, or tuned, with respect to each other as desired. An example of first pass processing when a subject is human is to identify all sensor data that meet the criteria of humanness according to the trained machine learning model, and delete the rest of the data.

In an aspect, fixed sensors are mounted at immobile locations, for example, but not limited to, roadways, beacons, traffic lights, traffic signs, buildings, and/or monuments.

For initial processing <b>303</b> to be performed, ruleset(s) <b>305</b> are made available from trigger list <b>307</b> that is used for matching, for example, faces and license plates. Data processing includes, in some aspects, compression, encryption, and encoding, followed by feature detection, feature matching (with a ruleset), and a first type of filtering, for example, but not limited to, coarse-grain filtering. Data are encrypted at rest and digitally signed before transmission to enable the receiver to prove the identity of the sender upon receipt. The data include metadata, for example a timestamp and GPS location. The processed data are transferred to be used elsewhere and/or stored. With respect to data transfer, only human readable data are sent upon match. Otherwise, encrypted in transit, signed, and encoded (raw) data are sent. The processed data are received by, for example, cloud processor <b>311</b> where the data are decrypted with a private key, tracked using a chain of custody strategy, digital signatures, and the metadata.

Cloud processor <b>311</b> and/or initial processor <b>303</b> store the data. During data storage, data are stored at rest in a legal location, for example, U.S. data cannot be stored on servers outside of the US. The data used by sensors <b>301</b> remain in RAM until they need to be transmitted, at which time they are encrypted. Each authorized data source has its own private key that is used to encrypt date from that source.

The method in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is written from the point of view of a processing device that is associated with a collection device that is collecting sensor data, and with a user or another processor that is providing search information. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, method <b>600</b> for determining desired information when receiving rule(s) from an authorized actor includes, but is not limited to including, securely receiving <b>602</b> at least one rule from the authorized actor. In an aspect, the authorized actor is a law enforcement officer, and the rule is, for example, a warrant that involves locating a vehicle, the warrant including a description by make, model, and license plate number of the desired vehicle. Method <b>600</b> includes updating <b>604</b> at least one rule database with the at least one rule. In an aspect, the rule database includes information for detecting, for example, vehicles in general, specific makes/models/types of vehicles, license plates in general, and specific license plates. The rule provided by the law enforcement officer provides specific information about a particular vehicle. When the rule is added to the rule database, the database is expanded such that a search for the particular vehicle is possible. Method <b>600</b> includes securely transmitting <b>606</b> the rule database to the collection device. Although the processing device and the collection device could be co-located, security measures such as resting encryption can ensure that privacy concerns about rule and search data are not compromised. When the processing device and the collection device are communicating through a network, securely transmitting messages that include, for example, legal warrants, includes features such as encryption and man-in-the-middle thwarting, for example. Method <b>600</b> includes securely receiving <b>608</b> the sensor data from the collection device. The collection device can encrypt in place and encrypt its transmission of the collected data, for example, images of vehicles. In an aspect, the collection device uses the rule database and in particular the rule(s) provided by the law enforcement officer to perform a &#x201c;coarse&#x201d; filtering of the collected data. This step, among other things, reduces the amount of data encrypted and transmitted by the collection device to the processing device. The coarse filter can eliminate data that, for example, are not vehicles. In an aspect, eliminating data is defined as deleting all data that do not meet the filter criteria. This step, although optional, protects the privacy of vehicle owners who are not associated with the warrant, and protects the law enforcement agency from privacy violation claims. The coarse filter can be tuned to eliminate data that are not vehicles of the desired make/model/type, and/or vehicles that do not have license plates. The filter can be tuned according to the processing power of the collection device and, if applicable, the transmission rate of the communication link between the collection device and the processing device. Method <b>600</b> includes securely storing <b>610</b> the received coarsely filtered data. In an aspect, storage is not required. However, if the data are stored, resting encryption protects the data from unauthorized access and therefore protects the privacy of, for example, the owner of the vehicle. Method <b>600</b> includes applying <b>612</b> a fine filter to the securely-stored, coarsely-filtered data. For example, if the data include the vehicles of the desired make/model/type, the fine filter can examine the data further for a match for the desired license plate. Method <b>600</b> includes securely transmitting <b>614</b> the desired information to the authorized actor. In the example herein, the law enforcement officer is provided the location of the desired vehicle through, for example, an encrypted transmission. In an aspect, other data that are not the desired information are deleted permanently from the processing device's storage area(s).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, method <b>700</b> for searching for and providing desired information is executing in the collection device.

The system may actively patrol, and to the extent a law enforcement agency has the authority, the law enforcement agency may tell the system to look for specific things, such as, e.g., particular faces, sounds, car models, license plates, etc. The system may also be told to include items such as, e.g., location and/or time of day. The system may also be configured to note the absence in a detected scene of items that should ordinarily be present. As a non-limiting example, the system may detect the absence of a truck in a lot at which five trucks are supposed to be parked and only four trucks are parked. A collection device of the system may in some configurations be collocated with, or housed within or on, or executed by, an autonomous vehicle. A non-limiting example of a suitable autonomous vehicle is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/435,007, filed on Jun. 7, 2019, entitled System and Method for Distributed Utility Service Execution (Atty. Dkt. #AA001), fully incorporated herein by reference. The collection module may perform a relatively coarse grain filter on collected data, and may transmit only desired data such that no data that is not desired is transmitted. The collection module may be configured to downsample data in real time as the data are being collected, such that, e.g., in a set of collected images that depict the same item (and add little to no useful information with respect to each other such that, for example, each differs from its most proximate neighbor by less than a threshold percentage or absolute delta), only one or a subset of such collected images is transmitted. In addition, the collection module may be configured to compress data to be transmitted in order to save bandwidth. The collection module may be configured, upon detecting a matching image to a desired subject or item, to send a window of images around the matched image starting with an image that was detected at a time before the matching image was detected, and ending at an image that was detected at a time after the matching image was detected. The collection module may be configured to encrypt all data to be transmitted. A fine grain filter may be performed at a processing module to which the collection module has transmitted data. As a non-limiting example, the processing module may be located in the cloud. The relative coarseness and relative fineness of the filter processing may be adjusted, for example, relative to each other, as needed for system optimization. Additionally or in the alternative, the relative coarseness of the filtering performed at the collection module may be adjusted based at least in part on the type of object desired and/or on privacy expectations associated with the desired object. For example, some types of objects, e.g., particular faces, may be more difficult to reliably detect than other types of objects, e.g., license plates. For example, some types of objects, e.g., particular faces, may be associated with heightened privacy expectations as compared to other types of objects, e.g., license plates.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In at least one arrangement, a processing module may create a ruleset. An authorized agent may authenticate to a web-based application that enables the authorized agent to create a new ruleset. Additionally or in the alternative, a trusted external system may create a new ruleset via a Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). In at least one arrangement, a ruleset may include at least the following rule information: (i) a Subject/Rule Identifier that associates the rule and any result with the agent, or with the agent's system of record (e.g., a warrant number, a case number, etc.); (ii) a Subject Type (e.g., person, vehicle license plate, etc.); (iii) a Compared Subject (e.g., person image, license plate number); (iv) a Search Effective date/time; (v) a Search Expiration date/time; and (vi) a Search Location(s). A web-based application may verify the information provided and create a filter object based on the subject type and compared subject inputs. In some aspects, a person filter object may not contain images of the subject. A collection module may detect any/all persons rather than a specific person, so a facial recognition module may reside in the cloud such that the subject image need not be sent to the collection module. In some aspects, a license plate filter object may contain an alphanumeric string. In some aspects, information in the ruleset about Subject Type may be in the form of a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In at least one arrangement a processing module may assign one or more rulesets to one or autonomous devices, e.g., robots, or bots for short. The bots may incorporate data collection modules. A web-based application may select a list of active bot(s) that are located within a search location specified in a database of current bot locations. In some aspects, the system may encrypt a filter package using the AES encryption algorithm at 256-bit strength. Additionally, or in the alternative, the web-based application may transmit the filter package to selected bots using Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In at least one arrangement, a collection module may collect images of objects detected that match the ruleset Subject Type (e.g., person, license plate number). In some aspects, the system may coarsely filter objects based on the ruleset. For example, if a ruleset defines that the object of interest has license number plate x, the system may filter only vehicles (cars, trucks, bikes, etc.) within all detected objects. In some aspects, the system may provide a two dimensional (2D)-bounding box tracking mechanism such as, e.g., Generalized Intersection Over Union (GIOU) tracking, to track persons or vehicles and their respective bounding boxes from one image frame to the next. In some aspects, the system may crop some or all sections of an image, by way of non-limiting example, within a person's bounding box(es). The system may send to a processing module at least one such cropped image pertaining to each detected and tracked object of the type Person or License Plate number. In some aspects, the system may encode and/or encrypt the cropped image data before sending the cropped image data to a processing module.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In at least one arrangement, a processing module may receive and process cropped images of subjects detected and tracked within a location and time specified by a ruleset. In some aspects, the system may decrypt and/or decode the cropped images generated by a collection module and provided to a processing module. Processing may continue in the event that data is valid, i.e., that data can be decrypted and decoded. Invalid data, i.e., data that cannot be decrypted or decoded, may be deleted. In some aspects, the system may verify that a timestamp and/or a GPS location of a cropped image is or are within boundaries indicated by a search warrant, delete invalid data, and store valid data for further processing.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In at least one arrangement, a processing module may receive and process cropped images of license plates detected and tracked within a location and time specified by a ruleset. In some aspects, the system may decrypt and/or decode the cropped images generated by a collection module and provided to a processing module. The system may provide at least one decoded, cropped image as input(s) to a neural network algorithm that may generate at least one bounding box containing at least one license plate as output(s). In some aspects, the system may further crop detected license plates from each input to the neural network algorithm for further processing. Cropped images containing license plates may, in some aspects, be subjected to optical character recognition algorithms to output as text an alphanumeric on a license plate. In some aspects, the system may perform text matching between generated text and a license plate number described in a filter ruleset to classify the text as a match or as a non-match.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In at least one arrangement, a processing module may receive and process cropped images of subjects detected and tracked within a location and time specified by a ruleset. In some aspects, the system may decrypt and/or decode the cropped images generated by a collection module and provided to a processing module. The system may provide at least one decoded, cropped image as input(s) to a neural network algorithm that may generate at least one bounding box containing at least one facial image as output(s). In some aspects, the system may further crop detected facial images from each input to the neural network algorithm for further processing.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In at least one arrangement the system may encrypt and store each cropped image that contains matched text or matched images.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In at least one arrangement, an authorized agent may view information for a matched subject or a match event. A processing module may notify the authorized agent of a matched subject. In some aspects, the processing module may create and store an encrypted package that contains GPS coordinates and/or timestamps and/or images and/or text associated with a matched subject. The system may notify the authorized agent by sending an SMS message, and/or an /email message, the message containing a URL link to a web-based application. Additionally or in the alternative, the system may notify the authorization by sending a notification to a trusted third party web service via a message queue.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In at least one arrangement, an authorized agent may view and/or download and/or ingest matched subject data. The agent may authenticate to a web-based application and view and/or download matched subject data thereby. Additionally or in the alternative, a processing module may send an access token to a trusted third party to use to retrieve an encrypted package.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In at least one arrangement, facial recognition and/or text recognition modules may be trained periodically in order to maintain a threshold prediction accuracy rate over time. In some aspects, the prediction confidence threshold may be initially set to a relatively low level, generating more false positives, and be raised over time as the models become more accurate, generating fewer overall matches.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In at least one arrangement, a confidence level threshold for filtering data, for example, for determining whether to validate and retain or invalidate and discard data, may be set at 85%. In some aspects, any data that cannot be decrypted or decoded may be discarded. In some aspects, any data for which the source, by way of non-limiting example, a bot, cannot be authenticated, may be discarded. In some aspects, any data that is outside the scope of, e.g., a warrant, may be discarded.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In at least one arrangement, security measures may be maintained between a bot with a collection module and a remote controller operator of the bot. By way of non-limiting example, a remote control operator may be required to authenticate with a username and password to access a remote control console. In some aspects, the remote control console may include a web browser that may transmit a connection request, the request may be encrypted using the AES encryption algorithm at 256 bit strength, and the request may be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2. In some aspects, the remote control console and bot identities may be authenticated by a connection broker prior to the creation of a peer-to-peer connection. As a non-limiting example, a web browser of the remote control console may establish a secure, peer-to-peer connection with a bot over WebRTC. In some aspects, video from the remote control console display may be streamed to a browser over WebRTC, and may not be stored in the web browser or on the remote console or a remote console host machine.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Those of skill would understand that the methods described in the subject disclosure may be applied to computer systems configured to accomplish such methods, and/or to computer-readable media containing programs to accomplish such methods, and/or to software and/or firmware and/or hardware (e.g., integrated circuits) designed to accomplish such methods.
