id="p-0026" num="0025">In the drawings, some components are not drawn to scale, and some components and/or operations can be separated into different blocks or combined into a single block for discussion of some of the implementations of the present technology. Moreover, while the technology is amenable to various modifications and alternative forms, specific implementations have been shown by way of example in the drawings and are described in detail below. The intention, however, is not to limit the technology to the particular implementations described. On the contrary, the technology is intended to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope of the technology as defined by the appended claims.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Overview</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Conventional approaches to space layout often rely on the labors of human architects, with various disadvantages. For example, architects competent for this task are a scarce human resource, which means that often a significant period of time passes before an architect becomes available to begin a particular project. Further, once a project begins, the project can take days, weeks, or even months to complete. Additionally, the scarcity of architects permits them to charge a substantial rate for their work on such projects. However, aspects of space layout projects can begin and complete more quickly, and at lower cost, when automated.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A software and/or hardware system for automatically performing space layout (&#x201c;the system&#x201d; or the &#x201c;space layout system&#x201d;) is described. As described herein, the space layout system performs as well, or better than, systems employing manual techniques when laying out a space. For example, a comparison of the system against 13,000 actual offices designed by human architects led to the system performing as well as an architect on 77% of offices and achieved a higher capacity in an additional 6% of comparisons, all while following a set of space standards. Additionally, when the system used the space standards the same way as an architect (e.g., a more relaxed interpretation of space standards), the automated layout technique achieved a 97% match rate, meaning that the automated layout technique completed this design task as well as a designer and in a shorter time.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Automation of space layout tasks offers increased cost savings, reliability, and productivity by systematizing repetitive tasks. At the same time, it allows humans to focus on more high-value and complex tasks. Even partial automation allows a greater parallelization of designer tasks. Instead of focusing on one project for a full week, an architect assisted by the space layout system might tackle two or more projects in the same week, thus scaling output without necessarily increasing workload.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The space layout system can also improve the quality of design decisions according to specific metrics, such as the efficiency of desk layouts or other furniture configurations. As discussed herein, automation of layout tasks can also augment human decision-making during design processes. Accordingly, the space layout system makes designers faster and more efficient, enables more cycles of iteration, and improves the overall efficiency of desks per square foot in layouts, among other benefits.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Space planning, such as the layout of desks within offices, is a task that encompasses all of the above complex decision-making activities with varying layers of difficulty. Functional and experiential considerations, building code requirements, and client expectations are all factors that architects weigh as they design the spaces of a building. The space layout system described herein at least partially automates office layout by automatically placing desks in private offices as well or better than human designers.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">To do so, in some embodiments, the space layout system performs desk layouts in private offices using various different automated layout techniques, in order to augment the architect's decision-making process and enable a parallelization of tasks. As described herein, the system's ability to layout desks was benchmarked against existing office layouts created by human architects. In various implementations, the system performs space layout of office walls and fixtures, as well as other building typologies beyond offices.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Examples of a Suitable Environment</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an overview of an environment <b>100</b> in which some implementations of the disclosed technology can operate.

Designers want to maximize the number of desks in a space while adhering to a set of space standards that include minimum space requirements per desk, in order to provide a space that is comfortable and safe. Here, a measure of a layout's performance can be referred to as its &#x201c;efficiency,&#x201d; which in some embodiments refers to the ratio between desk count and area of the office.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Desk layouts are performed manually by architects, using tacit knowledge of what makes a space efficient. For example, designers typically orient desks along the principal axis of a room to maximize circulation space, but they also intuitively recognize when the room's shape or doorways inhibit such a layout strategy. This process can be time-consuming and tedious as it involves the planning of similar, but not quite identical, offices that follow a consistent design logic.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, each office has its own set of unique constraints such as room shape, door location, and columns; a cookie-cutter strategy tends not work to in this situation. The space layout system performs techniques to model such design logic. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts digital floorplans <b>200</b> outfitted with similar, but not quite identical offices.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As depicted, each of the floorplans <b>200</b> have different shapes or geometries, as well as different sizes. Thus, a boundary <b>210</b> of one floorplan is rectangular, while another is a polygon with various different sized walls meeting at different and irregular angles. Each of the floorplans <b>200</b> also depict desks <b>220</b> positioned within the boundaries <b>210</b>. The space layout system, as described herein, performs automatic layout techniques for positioning desks <b>220</b> (or other furniture elements, such as chairs, tables, and so on) within the boundaries <b>210</b> of the floorplans <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Thus, in some embodiments, the space layout system employs various automatic layout techniques when determining a suitable layout of desks for a workspace, office space, or other similar space. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a method <b>300</b> for determining a space layout for a space. The method <b>300</b> may be performed by the space layout system and, accordingly, is described herein merely by way of reference thereto. It will be appreciated that the method <b>300</b> may be performed on any suitable hardware.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In operation <b>310</b>, the space layout system accesses a floorplan identifying boundaries of an office space. For example, the space layout system can access floorplan information from building information modeling (BIM) data or files, which include information associated with digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of places, such as layout information. The BIM data can be part of a Revit BIM package associated with a space, or other. Computer Aided Design (CAD) packages capable of facilitating 3D and/or parametric object-based design of space, such as office spaces.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In operation <b>320</b>, the space layout system automatically positions multiple furniture elements within a space using a selected layout technique. For example, the space layout system can select one of many different automatic layout techniques based on various characteristics of the office space (e.g., size, shape, geometry, type of space, and so on), various characteristics of the furniture elements (e.g., size, shape, function, and so on). Thus, the system can select a first technique when configured to position rectangular desks in a symmetrical office space, but select a second, different, technique, when the office space has an irregular shape. Further details regarding the automatic layout techniques are described herein.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In operation <b>330</b>, the space layout system causes a display of a version of the floorplan that depicts the automatically-positioned furniture elements within the office space. For example, the space layout system renders a version of the floorplan that presents desks or other furniture elements positioned within the floor plan (e.g., within the boundaries) of the office space. The space layout system can present the version of the floorplan via a user interface (UI) via which an architect or designer models or configures the office space.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described herein, the space layout system utilizes various different layout techniques when automatically placing furniture elements (or other objects) within a floorplan or other representation of a space. In some embodiments, the system uses an n-stage constructive procedure approach. In some embodiments, the system can use metaheuristics derived from detailed historical data on office layouts. For example, using past patterns and sets of &#x201c;rules of thumb&#x201d; for making intelligent decisions at each stage of the layout, the system can in some respects model the thought processes of human designers.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For example, given a boundary polygon of an office, the position of the door(s), and a list of any internal obstacles (such as columns and Americans with Disabilities Act entryway maneuvering clearance zones), some of the automatic layout techniques used by the system lay out desks in a way that maximizes their number while adhering to a design standard.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the space layout system determines automatic layouts for irregularly shaped offices, difficult edge conditions, and accounts for columns and other obstacles within the space. In some cases, an architect manually begins laying out an office by placing desks along the perimeter of the office facing the walls. Some of the automatic layout techniques used by the system enhance that behavior.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the space layout system executes several simple, related, and computationally inexpensive layout techniques. Then, when the layout density is below a threshold, the system runs a more complex and computationally expensive brute force approach. The exact layout density threshold is configurable and can be set at a point at which an office is no longer profitable, which can vary based on the company to whose space the system is being applied.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, the brute force approach is roughly two orders of magnitude slower than the other techniques but can still calculate a 20 desk layout in less than a second when running on a consumer laptop, which is a task that would typically take a human designer around 2 minutes. These techniques are also generally parallelizable, so a number of rooms can be solved in parallel and distributed across multiple cores on a machine or on a cluster of instances.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some cases, the space layout system utilizes a rotational layout technique. Using this technique, the system traverses the edges of an office's perimeter. If the edge is shorter than the width of a desk, the edge is ignored&#x2014;a constraint relaxed in some other layout techniques used by the system. On the other hand, if the edge is sufficiently long enough to place a desk, the system starts from one end of the edge and lay down as many desks as possible along that edge.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> depicts the system's use of a rotational layout technique to perform layout in a sample space. The system generates a layout for three people. In some embodiments, the system performs the rotational layout technique three times, with the only difference being the order in which the edges are traversed, as follows:</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">(a) clockwise: start from the edge left of the main door and run clockwise along the perimeter;</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">(b) counterclockwise: start from the edge right of the main door and run counter-clockwise along the perimeter; and</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">(c) sort by length: sort the edges by length and process them from longest to shortest.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">For example, in step <b>410</b>, the system determines which edges to traverse, and in which order. Next, in step <b>420</b>, the system, starting from the &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; of the first edge, starts adding desks (e.g., Desk <b>1</b> and Desk <b>2</b>). Then, in step <b>430</b>, the system repeats the steps for all other edges. As shown, the top edge fails, because the desk cannot be positioned and satisfy the desk clearance rule. In step <b>440</b>, the final desk is positioned within the space.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Thus, as the technique attempts to place desks along the edges, it seeks to satisfy a number of constraints based on a design standard, including:</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">(a) a minimum distance from the desk to the door;</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">(b) sufficient space around the chair for a person to get in and out of their chair comfortably, modeled as a desk clearance zone extending from the desk (see zone <b>450</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>);</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">(c) a minimum distance from end of desk to other desks (excepting desks in the same bank of desks), in order to ensure sufficient circulation between groups of desks;</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">(d) a desk and its clearance zone should not overlap any obstacles; and so on.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">When a desk placement fails any of these constraints, the system slides the desk 1 inch (2.5 cm) along the edge and applies the same logic and constraints again.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some cases, the space layout system utilizes a left right layout technique. The left right layout technique is similar to the rotation technique, with a few distinguishing steps. First, the left right technique traverses all the sufficiently long edges to the left of the door edge first, and then the edges to the right of the door, where left and right are determined by taking a line perpendicular to the door edge, running through its center, as depicted via a line <b>510</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Also, when laying down desks, the left right technique works from the bottom up so that the resulting layout is more symmetrical, which is often closer to how architects tend to lay out desks.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the system performs the left right layout technique twice. The first time, the system enforces a constraint that desks should be completely touching the wall and cannot hang off a short wall, such as a mullion. Here, the system ignores any wall that is less than desk width long (as described above). However, many offices have indentations, columns, and other awkward edge conditions resulting in walls less than desk width length.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Consequently, the system performs the left right technique a second time when it seeks to lay down desks on all edges, irrespective of their length, and thus desks are permitted to overhang an edge. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts a resulting layout <b>600</b> of desks when the system ignores these constraints and relaxing alignment rules as part of the left right layout technique.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, rather than starting at the bottom of the edge with the desk completely touching the wall, the system starts with just 1.5 feet (46 cm) of desk touching the wall and the system lays down and slides up desks until there is 1.5 feet overlapping. Unlike the standard layout, in which desks may not overhang corners, the layout follows relaxed rules in which desks are positioned at overhang corners <b>610</b> by up to 1.5 feet, resulting in greater office capacity&#x2014;eight desks rather than five desks, as shown in the Figure.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, after the space layout performs each of the layout techniques, it determines the highest capacity found. If the density corresponding to that capacity is below a configurable threshold, the system performs a brute force automatic approach to the layout of the desks. The brute force layout approach or technique is, in some cases, roughly two orders of magnitude more computationally expensive, and so in some embodiments is only run when the above perimeter-based techniques do not sufficiently fill the space.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">This brute force approach assumes that for each edge, desks are either placed in a line facing the wall (FW) or they exist as a set of back-to-back (B2B) banks of desks extending into the space, as shown in the groupings of desks <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. As shown, a first set of layout configurations <b>710</b> depicts combinations where one edge includes back-to-back desks, and other edges include facing wall desks. A second set of layout configurations <b>720</b> depicts combinations where two edges includes back-to-back desks, and other edges (one or more) include facing wall desks. A final layout configuration <b>730</b> depicts all edges having B2B desks.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The space layout system takes a brute force approach to determining which edges should be set as back-to-back within the space. In the absence of obvious heuristics, the system tries all possible combinations with one, two, or three edges designated as back to back, and the remaining edges wall-facing, when performing the brute force approach.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the system also tries a variant in which, for each edge that is longer than desk width, it considers three options: no desks, face wall, and back to back. The &#x201c;no desks&#x201d; option can be useful to allow a bank of desks on other walls to fit within the space. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the lack of desks on the right and lower walls <b>805</b> within a space <b>800</b> allows room for a 5-desk bank <b>810</b> extending from the top wall, leading to a higher capacity of desks than having desks on the right wall.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some cases, it follows that having three options per wall can lead to a combinatorial explosion in which the number of combinations of desks to process grows very quickly with the number of walls. Thus, in some cases, the system may employ the brute force approach only when the number of walls longer than the desk width is 4 or less (because while 34=81 is manageable, 35=243 may prove to be inefficient).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Thus, the space layout system can determine whether to run the three-option variant. If so, the system runs that set of layouts both clockwise and anti-clockwise; if not, the system runs the standard two-option variant, both clockwise and counterclockwise.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some cases, for each of these combinations in the brute force approach, the rotation layout technique is used, either clockwise or counterclockwise, to lay out perimeter desks either facing the wall or setting out back-to-back desks. The system then takes each set of back-to-back desks and attempts to grow them toward the center of the space one layer at a time, following applied layout constraints. In some cases, the system follows additional constraints, such as the number of desks banks (e.g., no more than 5 deep). Also, when a bank of desks cannot be grown any more by desks perpendicular to the edge, the system can attempt to lay down an additional end cap desk, or rotate any existing single end desks to be an end cap, such as desk <b>815</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Example Space Layouts</heading><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As described herein, the space layout system was performed with respect to a sample of 13,211 offices having manually determined layouts. The smallest offices in the sample had space for one person (a single desk), and the largest offices had space for 20 people. All of these offices had been laid out by human designers, and the space layout system was applied to re-layout the offices. The system measured the percentage of offices for which the system was able to match or improve on the efficiency of the design laid out by their human designers.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a graph <b>900</b> of the initial performance of the system across the sample (when following design standards).

Overall, the graph <b>1000</b> indicates that the system increases the performance by +12%, with the system only breaking the rules 17% of the time, which is less than the rate at which designers broke the rules. Overall, the system achieved a match rate of 97%, with significant improvements across larger offices.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, the space layout system uses six different layout techniques to layout desks in an office. In order to understand which techniques performed the best across the sample, the system identified the components that had the best efficiency at each run.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The graph <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows the frequency at which each technique had the highest desk count.

For example, a user employing the space layout system can insert or add a partition to the floorplan in order to change the floorplan by adding a room, office, wall, and so on. In some cases, the addition of the partition splits the digital floorplan into two separate areas, such as dividing one room into two rooms.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In operation <b>1330</b>, the space layout system automatically reconfigures or generates a layout of desks within each of the two areas of the digital floorplan using a selected automatic layout technique.

A goal is to augment the ability of human architects to quickly test ideas, make decisions, and arrive at design solutions that comply with standards and satisfy programmatic targets. The system can emphasize minimizing interruption to existing, non-linear workflows, and reinforcing designers' own conceptual models of the process.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>B through <b>17</b>C</figref> depict screenshots of a layout selection interface of the system, showing an example of a user interface (UI) displaying user-defined polygonal regions into which offices may be inserted. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref> is a screenshot <b>1450</b> of a user interface of a floor of an office, where different offices or areas can be inserted. As described herein, the designer can interact with the user interface to provide user input, and the system can perform various techniques described herein to present layouts of desks and other furniture elements with the space.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a screenshot <b>1500</b> depicting an example of highlight previewing a location of a partition <b>1510</b> to be inserted, where the partition automatically snaps to perpendicular from a nearest wall upon insertion.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a screenshot <b>1600</b> depicting an example of a zone being subdivided into areas based on inserted partitions <b>1610</b>, with door locations <b>1615</b> being automatically added and desk layouts <b>1620</b> being presented within each office region smaller than a certain size.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref> is a screenshot <b>1700</b> depicting an example of existing offices that may be further subdivided before insertion of a new partition. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref> is a screenshot <b>1720</b> of the UI of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, showing an example of existing offices further subdivided after insertion of a new partition, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>C</figref> is a screenshot <b>1740</b> where a user can hover over any populated office (here, a newly created office after subdivision) and toggle between multiple potential layout options, with live or real-time feedback displaying the desk count of each option.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0114">A workflow can be as follows: a designer represents an office's zones as polygonal regions in Revit. From this point the space layout system launches a custom interface, and the designer's task is to insert partitions into the previously-defined zones, splitting the zone into individual offices, though in another embodiment discussed below, the system can automatically add or suggest partitions. Moving the cursor shows a preview of the partition's location (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>), which snaps automatically to a perpendicular from the nearest wall, as well as aligning to any columns or structure, and a single click finalizes the insertion. The system then automatically inserts a door along the boundary, which can be repositioned if necessary. As soon as the partition is inserted, the system generates a number of potential desk layouts within the office polygon, and the most efficient layout is rendered into the plan.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0115">If the desks don't fit as expected, the designer has the ability to go back and drag the walls of the room, with the new layout automatically computing, or to cycle through alternate layouts generated by the algorithm. In this manner, the designer can jump between scales and doesn't have to fix the walls in place before positioning the desks.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0116">In effect, the architect and present system work alongside one another, the architect working at a high level of abstraction, establishing the zoning and partitioning of the office through iterative exploration while the automation algorithm handles the lower-level task of laying out desks in each office, using the techniques described herein.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0117">In other cases, the space layout system can begin to refine zones, provided by an input plan, into individual rooms and spaces, guided by a detailed space program. Special attention is paid to a &#x2018;unit mix&#x2019; or breakdown of specific office sizes required; these targets can be tied to business metrics, as different office sizes may sell better or prove more profitable in different regions. Beginning at one end of a zone designated as office, the system can start to place desks in efficient and standards-compliant configurations, and then insert walls or partitions to subdivide the zone into individual private offices.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0118">Depending on how the rooms fit together, the system can iteratively jump back up to adjust the overall zoning or jump down to tweak how individual desks are positioned. In this manner, the system need not follow a linear path but rather cycle between scales until providing a layout that satisfies the constraints.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">CONCLUSION</heading><p id="p-0106" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a block diagram showing some of the components typically incorporated in at least some of the computer systems and other devices on which the system operates.
