The described embodiments are only a part of embodiments of the present application but not all embodiments. Based upon embodiments of the present application, all of other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a communication system such as Long Term Evolution (LTE), when all downlink beams configured for the PDCCH fail, it is considered that a radio link fails, and a radio link reconstruction process is started. This method may not only increase the time delay, but also cause waste of resources, because changing a sending beam and/or receiving beam may enable receiving quality of a downlink control signal to meet requirements. In order to avoid such resource waste and delay, a fast and reliable beam failure detection and recovery process is standardized in the New Radio (NR) standard, and the network side can quickly recover the transmission process from beam failure. The beam failure recovery process of the primary cell (Pcell) is specified in the Release 15 (Rel-15) phase of the NR standard, and the beam failure recovery process of the secondary cell (SCell) is specified in the Release 16 (Rel-16) phase of the NR standard.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A UE may be configured with one or more SCells after initial access. An SCell may be configured to have only downlink (DL) or include both DL and uplink (UL).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Each SCell may be configured with a Beam Failure Recovery (BFR) process. The beam failure recovery process is as follows.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The UE monitors beam failure, and if the UE detects beam failure of the SCell DL, the UE sends a Beam Failure Recovery reQuest (BFRQ) to a base station. The beam failure recovery request sent by the UE at least includes report of a beam failure event and report of an identifier (or index/indices) of a Component Carrier (CC) in which the beam failure occurs. If the UE detects a new beam that meets a quality condition, the UE may also report an identifier (or index/indices) of the new beam to the base station.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">After the base station receives the report of the beam failure event from the UE, the base station may reconfigure a downlink beam for the SCell in which the beam failure occurs.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In order to perform the BFR, the UE measures downlink beam quality of a PDCCH (or considered to measure channel quality of a Control Resource SET (CORESET)). The UE performs beam failure detection of the SCell by detecting quality of a downlink reference signal for Beam Failure Detection (BFD) of the SCell. The downlink reference signal for the BFD of the SCell may be explicitly configured through Radio Resource Control (RRC) or implicitly configured through Transmission Configuration Indicator (TCI) state. Each SCell may be configured with at most 8 downlink beams, for example, at most 8 TCI states or at most 8 downlink reference signals for BFD. The beams of the downlink control channel are a subset of active TCI states.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The process regarding the Beam Failure Recovery reQuest (BFRQ) of the UE for the SCell includes two following steps.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Step 1: the UE reports a beam failure event.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Step 2: the UE reports an index/indices of a CC in which beam failure occurs and new beam information (if there is a new beam).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Here, the information in Step 1 may be sent through a SR-like (Schedule Request-like) PUCCH resource specially configured for the BFR. The SR-like PUCCH refers to a PUCCH with a similar sending method as sending of the Schedule Request (SR). The information in Step 2 is sent through a Media Access Control Control Element (MAC-CE) in a Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH). It should be noted that reporting the beam failure event through the SR-like PUCCH specially configured for the BFR is not necessarily the only way to report the beam failure event.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The MAC-CE for carrying the index/indices of the CC in which the beam failure occurs and/or the BFR new beam information may be carried on the PUSCH corresponding to the PUCCH sending the beam failure event (the PUSCH scheduled based on the schedule request of the PUCCH), or may be multiplexed on an existing PUSCH resource, for example, multiplexed on a configured grant PUSCH.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">If the MAC-CE of Step 2 indicates a new beam and is detected by the UE, the UE uses the new beam indicated by the MAC-CE of Step 2 for downlink reception of the PDCCH on the SCell in which the beam failure occurs after K symbols (K is a positive integer) after the UE receives a response to the MAC-CE of Step 2. This applies to all CORESETs of the SCell in which the beam failure occurs.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">However, after the UE detects beam failure and receives a BFR response, there is currently no solution for what kind of receiving beam the UE uses to receive channel signals other than PDCCH and what kind of sending beam the UE uses to send uplink signals.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Therefore, embodiments of the present application provide a signal communication method and apparatus to provide relevant solutions, and the UE can use a better uplink sending beam to send the PUCCH, and the UE and the network side have the same consensus on the sending beam of the uplink signal, and the base station can use the optimal reception beam to receive the uplink signal, ensuring the system performance.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Here, the method and apparatus are based on the same application concept. Since the principle of solving the problem in the method is similar to that in the apparatus, implementations of the apparatus and method can refer to each other, and the repeated description thereof will be omitted.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Embodiments of the present application may be applicable to various systems, especially 5G systems.
