For example, at such a location, driver fatigue can particularly effectively be counteracted at the beginning of a shift without road safety being impaired by wearing active light glasses.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one embodiment, the light glasses are activated when the position data are indicative of a current position of the driver outside the motor vehicle, and the light glasses are deactivated when the position data are indicative of a current position of the driver inside the motor vehicle. In other words, when the position data are indicative of a current position of the driver inside the motor vehicle, it is concluded from this that the driver is moving the motor vehicle. It is ensured through the deactivation of the light glasses that the road safety is not impaired by wearing active light glasses. Conversely, when the driver is located outside the motor vehicle, it is assumed that the driver is not moving the motor vehicle. The tiredness of the driver can now be counteracted by activating the light glasses without impairing road safety.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a further embodiment, an ambient lighting of the motor vehicle is activated if the position data are indicative of a current position of the driver inside the motor vehicle. In other words, if the driver is located in the motor vehicle, the ambient lighting of the motor vehicle is used instead of the light glasses to counteract the driver fatigue. The tiredness of the driver can thus be counteracted even while driving without activating the light glasses. In this way, for example, operating energy stores of the light glasses such as batteries can be conserved, and the operating time of the light glasses thereby increased.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a further embodiment, the further steps of acquiring a value indicative of a daylight intensity, and deactivating the light glasses worn by the driver if the value indicative of a daylight intensity exceeds a predefined threshold value are carried out. It is, in other words, assumed that the tiredness of the driver reduces with increasing daylight, and that therefore there is no longer a need to counteract the tiredness of the driver. Unnecessary operation of, in particular, the light glasses is thus avoided. This also preserves the operating energy store of the light glasses, and thereby again increases the operating time of the light glasses.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a further embodiment, the further steps of acquiring position data indicative of the position of the motor vehicle, and activating and/or deactivating the light glasses worn by the driver depending on an evaluation of the acquired position data indicative of the position of the motor vehicle are carried out.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">On the basis of the position data indicative of the position of the motor vehicle, it is possible to detect that the motor vehicle is currently located at a delivery location for a delivery, and that the driver therefore will leave the motor vehicle in order to perform the delivery of the goods. In other words, the position data indicative of the position of the motor vehicle are evaluated in order to prepare a prediction as to when an activation of the light glasses is useful.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a further embodiment, the further steps of acquiring operating and/or state data of the motor vehicle, and activating and/or deactivating the light glasses worn by the driver depending on an evaluation of the acquired operating and/or state data of the motor vehicle are carried out.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The operating and/or state data of the motor vehicle can, for example, be indicative of an occupied driver's seat, an opened or closed driver's door, or the motor being stationary during an intermediate halt. A prediction of when an activation of the light glasses will be useful can thus also be prepared without position data, in particular if these are not present or not available.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A computer program product designed to carry out such a method, a system for fatigue prevention of a driver of a motor vehicle, and a motor vehicle with a system of this type, also belong to the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The invention will now be explained with reference to a drawing, In the figures:</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic illustration of components of a system for preventing fatigue of a driver of a motor vehicle.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic illustration of a method flow for operation of the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Reference is first made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Components of a system <b>2</b> for preventing fatigue of a driver of a motor vehicle <b>4</b> are illustrated.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition to the motor vehicle <b>4</b>, the components of the system <b>2</b> are a mobile device <b>6</b> and light glasses <b>10</b> of the driver.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the present exemplary embodiment, the motor vehicle <b>4</b> is designed as a delivery vehicle of a delivery service for the delivery of goods shipments.

In at least one second partial step, the position data PDM indicative of a current position of the driver and/or the position data PDK indicative of the position of the motor vehicle <b>4</b>, and/or the acquired operating and/or state data BZD of the motor vehicle <b>4</b> are evaluated to determine whether the motor vehicle <b>4</b> is currently located at a delivery location for a delivery, and that the driver therefore will leave the motor vehicle <b>4</b> in order to perform the delivery of the goods.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">If the evaluation shows that the driver is located outside the motor vehicle <b>4</b> and not in the cargo compartment, the method is continued with a further step S<b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the further step S<b>500</b>, the light glasses <b>10</b> are then activated by the control signal AS.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">If, on the other hand, the evaluation shows that the driver is either not located outside the motor vehicle <b>4</b> or is in the cargo compartment, the method is continued with a further step S<b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the further step S<b>600</b>, the ambient lighting of the motor vehicle <b>4</b> is then activated by the further control signal AS&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Other than in the present exemplary embodiment, the sequence of the steps or partial steps can also be different. Multiple steps or partial steps can, furthermore, also be carried out at the same time or simultaneously. It is also furthermore possible for individual steps or partial steps to be omitted or skipped.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The tiredness of a driver is thus, for example, only counteracted by activating the light glasses <b>10</b> when the driver is at specific positions such as, for example, a distribution center of a delivery service where, at the beginning of his delivery round, the driver loads the goods that are to be delivered into his motor vehicle <b>4</b> configured as a delivery vehicle. For example, at such a location, driver fatigue can particularly effectively be counteracted at the beginning of a shift without road safety being impaired by wearing active light glasses <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The systems, methods, and processes described herein may be implemented by one or more computers in communication with one another.
