The laser welding is a welding method that irradiates the part of a workpiece to be welded with a laser light and melts this part by the energy of the laser light. A pool of molten metal material called a molten pool is formed at the part irradiated with the laser light, and then the molten pool becomes solidified, by which welding is performed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, there is a case where the profile of a laser light is shaped when the laser light is used to irradiate a workpiece, depending on the purpose. For example, a technique is known in which the profile of a laser light is shaped when the laser light is used to cut a workpiece (see Japanese National Publication of International Patent Application No. 2010-508149, for example).</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is known that, during welding, scattered substances called spatters are generated from this molten pool. These spatters come from a scattered molten metal, and it is important to reduce the generation of the spatters in order to prevent working defects. Further, since the splatters are a scattered molten metal, when the splatters are generated, the metallic material at the weld portion comes to be reduced. In other words, as the generation of the spatters is larger, the metallic material at the weld portion becomes insufficient and could cause poor strength or the like. In addition, the generated spatters adhere to the portions around the weld portion. When some of these spatters peel off later and attach to an electric circuit, an abnormality could be caused in the electric circuit. Therefore, it is sometimes difficult to perform welding onto parts for electric circuits.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, in the welding of this type, when the workpiece is smaller or thinner, it is necessary to make the area of the weld zone smaller, that is, to make the diameter of the beam smaller.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is a need for a welding method and welding apparatus that are able to make the area of the weld zone smaller, that is, the diameter of the beam smaller, while suppressing the spatters.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a welding method including: irradiating a surface of a workpiece with a laser light that moves relatively to the workpiece in a sweep direction; and performing welding by melting a part of the workpiece irradiated with the laser light, wherein the laser light includes a plurality of beams, the plurality of beams include at least one main beam and at least one sub beam smaller in power than the main beam, a main power region including the at least one main beam and a sub power region including the at least one sub beam are formed on the surface, and a minimum distance between centers of adjacent ones of the plurality of beams on the surface is 75 &#x3bc;m or less.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a welding apparatus including: a laser oscillator; and an optical head configured to irradiate a surface of a workpiece with a laser light including a plurality of beams obtained by shaping light emitted from the laser oscillator, and perform welding by melting a part of the workpiece irradiated with the laser light, wherein the welding apparatus is configured to: perform relative displacement between the workpiece and at least part of the optical head to move the laser light relatively to the workpiece in a sweep direction; cause the plurality of beams to include at least one main beam and at least one sub beam smaller in power than the main beam; form a main power region including the at least one main beam and a sub power region including the at least one sub beam on the surface; and set a minimum distance between centers of adjacent ones of the plurality of beams on the surface to be 75 &#x3bc;m or less.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

The constituent elements of each of the embodiments described below and the functions and results (effects) obtained by the constituent elements are mere examples. The present disclosure may be embodied by constituent elements other than those disclosed in the embodiments described below. Further, according to the present disclosure, it is possible to obtain at least one of various effects (including derivative effects) obtained by the constituent elements.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The embodiments illustrated below include similar constituent elements. Therefore, according to the constituent elements of each embodiment, the same functions and effects based on the similar constituent elements may be obtained. Further, in the following description, the same reference numerals are given to those similar constituent elements, and repetitive explanations thereof may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further, in each of the drawings, the X-direction is represented by an arrow X, the Y-direction is represented by an arrow Y, and the Z-direction is represented by an arrow Z. The X-direction, the Y-direction, and the Z-direction intersect with each other and are orthogonal to each other. The Z-direction is the normal direction to the surface Wa (target surface) of the workpiece W.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a schematic configuration of a laser welding apparatus <b>100</b> according to a first embodiment. The laser welding apparatus <b>100</b> includes a laser device <b>110</b>, an optical head <b>120</b>, and an optical fiber <b>130</b> connecting the laser device <b>110</b> and the optical head <b>120</b> to each other. The laser welding apparatus <b>100</b> is an example of a welding apparatus.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, a workpiece W to be worked in the laser welding apparatus <b>100</b> may be made of an iron-based metallic material, aluminum-based metallic material, copper-based metallic material, or the like. Further, the workpiece W has a plate-like shape, for example, and the thickness of the workpiece W is 1 [mm] or more and 10 [mm] or less, for example, though this is not limiting. Further, the workpiece W is formed of a plurality of members superposed on each other. The number of members and the thickness of each member may be changed in various ways.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The laser device <b>110</b> includes a laser oscillator, and is configured, for example, to output a laser light of a single mode with a power of several kW. Here, the laser device <b>110</b> may be provided, for example, with a plurality of semiconductor laser devices included therein to output a multi-mode laser light with a power of several kW as the total output of the plurality of semiconductor laser devices. Further, the laser device <b>110</b> may include various laser light sources, such as a fiber laser, YAG laser, and disk laser.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The optical fiber <b>130</b> guides the laser light output from the laser device <b>110</b> to the optical head <b>120</b>. When the laser device <b>110</b> outputs a single mode laser light, the optical fiber <b>130</b> is configured to propagate the single mode laser light. In this case, the M<sup>2 </sup>beam quality of the single mode laser light is set to 1.3 or less. The M<sup>2 </sup>beam quality may also be referred to as M2 factor.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The optical head <b>120</b> is an optical device for radiating a laser light input from the laser device <b>110</b>, toward the workpiece W. The optical head <b>120</b> includes a collimator lens <b>121</b>, a condenser lens <b>122</b>, and a DOE (diffractive optical element) <b>123</b>. Each of the collimator lens <b>121</b>, the condenser lens <b>122</b>, and the DOE <b>123</b> may also be referred to as optical component.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The optical head <b>12</b> is configured to change its relative position to the workpiece W, in order to sweep the laser light L while irradiating the workpiece W with a laser light L. The relative displacement between the optical head <b>120</b> and the workpiece W may be achieved by moving the optical head <b>120</b>, moving the workpiece W, or moving both the optical head <b>120</b> and the workpiece W.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The collimator lens <b>121</b> collimates the input laser light. The laser light thus collimated becomes collimated light. Further, the condenser lens <b>122</b> condenses the laser light that is the collimated light, and radiates the light onto the workpiece W as the laser light L (output light).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The DOE <b>123</b> is arranged between the collimator lens <b>121</b> and the condenser lens <b>122</b> to perform shaping of the beam shape of the laser light (which will be referred to as beam shape, hereinafter). As illustrated conceptually in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the DOE <b>123</b> has, for example, a configuration in which a plurality of diffractive gratings <b>123</b><i>a </i>different in period are superposed. The DOE <b>123</b> may perform shaping of the beam shape by bending or superimposing the collimated light in the direction affected by each of the diffractive gratings <b>123</b><i>a. </i>The DOE <b>123</b> may also be referred to as beam shaper.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The DOE <b>123</b> divides the laser light input from the collimator lens <b>121</b> into a plurality of beams. Each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of the beams (spots) of the laser light L formed on the surface Wa of the workpiece W. Here, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, for the sake of simplicity, a main beam or main beams B<b>1</b> are illustrated by a solid line and sub beams B<b>2</b> are illustrated by a broken line. The arrow SD in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> indicates the sweep direction of the beams on the surface Wa of the workpiece W. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the optical head <b>120</b> may output a laser light including a plurality of beams of various arrangements by exchanging the DOE <b>123</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The DOE <b>123</b> divides the laser light into a plurality of beams. The plurality of beams includes at least one main beam B<b>1</b> and at least one sub beam B<b>2</b>. The sub beam B<b>2</b> is a beam smaller in power than the main beam B<b>1</b>. For example, the ratio between the power of the main beam B<b>1</b> and the power of the sub beam B<b>2</b> is set to 2:1, but this is not limiting.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, the DOE <b>123</b> divides the laser light such that the spot of at least one main beam B<b>1</b> and the spot of at least one sub beam B<b>2</b> are formed on the surface Wa.
