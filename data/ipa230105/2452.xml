Specifically, the present invention relates to a gene editing system derived from <i>Flavobacterium </i>and uses thereof.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Genome editing technology is a genetic engineering technology based on the targeted modification of the genome by artificial nucleases, and is playing an increasingly powerful role in agricultural and medical research. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR associated (CRISPR) systems are currently the most widely used genome editing tools. Proteins can target any location in the genome, resulting in a double-strand break (DSB) at the targeted sequence, activating intracellular Non-homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or homologous repair (Homology Directly Repair, HDR) pathways to introduce mutations. The most commonly used Cas protein is the Cas9 protein derived from <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>, which belongs to the Type II-A subtype in the Class II CRISPR system. Cong et al. (Multiplex Genome Engineering Using CRISPR/Cas Systems, Science, 2013) and Mali et al. (RNA-guided human genome engineering via Cas9, Science, 2013) successfully applied the CRISPR/Cas9 system in human cell lines.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Both the CRISPR/Cas12a system and the CRISPR/Cas9 system belong to the Class II CRISPR system. Zetsche et al. applied the Cas12a protein (formerly Cpf1) derived from <i>Streptococcus </i>aminoacids and <i>Lachnospira </i>for the first time to gene editing of animal cells (Cpf1 is a Single RNA-Guided Endonuclease of a Class 2 CRISPR-Cas System, Cell, 2015). The difference is that the CRISPR/Cas12a system belongs to the Type V type, which has a shorter crRNA sequence and higher specificity. The advantages further expand the gene editing toolbox of the CRISPR system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">So far, gene editing tools based on CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/Cas12 have been successfully used in animal cell lines, animal individuals, plant cells, plant individuals and microorganisms. The tools have caused a revolution in the field of gene editing. However, the working efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas12a system varies greatly at different target sites, and the working efficiency is lower at some sites in the plant genome, which may be due to the fact that the existing Cas12a systems are mainly derived from pathogenic bacteria of human or animal and the optimal working temperature is higher than that in plants. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and develop a CRISPR/Cas12a system that can work stably at suitable plant temperatures.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The inventors found the unreported FbCas12a protein in plant symbiotic bacteria through homologous similarity comparison, and artificially predicted the mature form of its own crRNA, and compared its own crRNA with the crRNA of LbCas12a in vivo efficiency. It was found that FbCas12a can work in plant cells and has higher editing efficiency when using the crRNA of LbCas12a.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

Definitions</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the present invention, unless indicated otherwise, the scientific and technological terminologies used herein refer to meanings commonly understood by a person skilled in the art. Also, the terminologies and experimental procedures used herein relating to protein and nucleotide chemistry, molecular biology, cell and tissue cultivation, microbiology, immunology, all belong to terminologies and conventional methods generally used in the art. For example, the standard DNA recombination and molecular cloning technology used herein are well known to a person skilled in the art, and are described in details in the following references: Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F. and Maniatis, T., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press: Cold Spring Harbor, 1989. In the meantime, in order to better understand the present invention, definitions and explanations for the relevant terminologies are provided below.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; encompasses all combinations of items connected by the term, and each combination should be regarded as individually listed herein. For example, &#x201c;A and/or B&#x201d; covers &#x201c;A&#x201d;, &#x201c;A and B&#x201d;, and &#x201c;B&#x201d;. For example, &#x201c;A, B, and/or C&#x201d; covers &#x201c;A&#x201d;, &#x201c;B&#x201d;, &#x201c;C&#x201d;, &#x201c;A and B&#x201d;, &#x201c;A and C&#x201d;, &#x201c;B and C&#x201d;, and &#x201c;A and B and C&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">When the term &#x201c;comprise&#x201d; is used herein to describe the sequence of a protein or nucleic acid, the protein or nucleic acid may consist of the sequence, or may have additional amino acids or nucleotide at one or both ends of the protein or nucleic acid, but still have the activity described in this invention. In addition, those skilled in the art know that the methionine encoded by the start codon at the N-terminus of the polypeptide will be retained under certain practical conditions (for example, when expressed in a specific expression system), but does not substantially affect the function of the polypeptide. Therefore, when describing the amino acid sequence of specific polypeptide in the specification and claims of the present application, although it may not include the methionine encoded by the start codon at the N-terminus, the sequence containing the methionine is also encompassed, correspondingly, its coding nucleotide sequence may also contain a start codon; vice versa.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">&#x201c;Genome&#x201d; as used herein encompasses not only chromosomal DNA present in the nucleus, but also organelle DNA present in the subcellular components (e.g., mitochondria, plastids) of the cell.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, &#x201c;organism&#x201d; includes any organism that is suitable for genome editing, eukaryotes are preferred. Examples of organisms include, but are not limited to, mammals such as humans, mice, rats, monkeys, dogs, pigs, sheep, cattle, cats; poultry such as chickens, ducks, geese; plants including monocots and dicots such as rice, corn, wheat, sorghum, barley, soybean, peanut, <i>Arabidopsis </i>and the like.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A &#x201c;genetically modified organism&#x201d; or &#x201c;genetically modified cell&#x201d; includes the organism or the cell which comprises within its genome an exogenous polynucleotide or a modified gene or expression regulatory sequence. For example, the exogenous polynucleotide is stably integrated within the genome of the organism or the cell such that the polynucleotide is passed on to successive generations. The exogenous polynucleotide may be integrated into the genome alone or as part of a recombinant DNA construct. The modified gene or expression regulatory sequence means that, in the organism genome or the cell genome, said sequence comprises one or more nucleotide substitution, deletion, or addition.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term &#x201c;exogenous&#x201d; with respect to sequence means a sequence that originates from a foreign species, or, if from the same species, is substantially modified from its native form in composition and/or genomic locus by deliberate human intervention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">&#x201c;Polynucleotide&#x201d;, &#x201c;nucleic acid sequence&#x201d;, &#x201c;nucleotide sequence&#x201d;, or &#x201c;nucleic acid fragment&#x201d; are used interchangeably to refer to a polymer of RNA or DNA that is single- or double-stranded, optionally containing synthetic, non-natural or altered nucleotide bases. Nucleotides (usually found in their 5&#x2032;-monophosphate form) are referred to by their single letter designation as follows: &#x201c;A&#x201d; for adenylate or deoxyadenylate (for RNA or DNA, respectively), &#x201c;C&#x201d; for cytidylate or deoxycytidylate, &#x201c;G&#x201d; for guanylate or deoxyguanylate, &#x201c;U&#x201d; for uridylate, &#x201c;T&#x201d; for deoxythymidylate, &#x201c;R&#x201d; for purines (A or G), &#x201c;Y&#x201d; for pyrimidines (C or T), &#x201c;K&#x201d; for G or T, &#x201c;H&#x201d; for A or C or T, &#x201c;I&#x201d; for inosine, and &#x201c;N&#x201d; for any nucleotide.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">&#x201c;Polypeptide&#x201d;, &#x201c;peptide&#x201d;, &#x201c;amino acid sequence&#x201d; and &#x201c;protein&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical analogue of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers. The terms &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d;, &#x201c;peptide&#x201d;, &#x201c;amino acid sequence&#x201d;, and &#x201c;protein&#x201d; are also inclusive of modifications including, but not limited to, glycosylation, lipid attachment, sulfation, gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, hydroxylation and ADP-ribosylation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Sequence &#x201c;identity&#x201d; has recognized meaning in the art, and the percentage of sequence identity between two nucleic acids or polypeptide molecules or regions can be calculated using the disclosed techniques. Sequence identity can be measured along the entire length of a polynucleotide or polypeptide or along a region of the molecule. (See, for example, Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, A. M., ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 1988; Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, D. W., ed., Academic Press, New York, 1993; Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part I, Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H.

Although there are many methods for measuring the identity between two polynucleotides or polypeptides, the term &#x201c;identity&#x201d; is well known to the skilled person (Carrillo, H. &#x26; Lipman, D., SIAM J Applied Math 48: 1073 (1988)).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Suitable conserved amino acid replacements in peptides or proteins are known to those skilled in the art and can generally be carried out without altering the biological activity of the resulting molecule. In general, one skilled in the art recognizes that a single amino acid replacement in a non-essential region of a polypeptide does not substantially alter biological activity (See, for example, Watson et al., Molecular Biology of the Gene, 4th Edition, 1987, The Benjamin/Cummings Pub. co., p. 224).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein, an &#x201c;expression construct&#x201d; refers to a vector suitable for expression of a nucleotide sequence of interest in an organism, such as a recombinant vector. &#x201c;Expression&#x201d; refers to the production of a functional product.

Regulatory sequences may include, but are not limited to, promoters, translation leader sequences, introns, and polyadenylation recognition sequences.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">&#x201c;Promoter&#x201d; refers to a nucleic acid fragment capable of controlling the transcription of another nucleic acid fragment. In some embodiments of the present invention, the promoter is a promoter capable of controlling the transcription of a gene in a cell, whether or not it is derived from the cell. The promoter may be a constitutive promoter or a tissue-specific promoter or a developmentally-regulated promoter or an inducible promoter.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">&#x201c;Constitutive promoter&#x201d; refers to a promoter that may cause expression of a gene in most circumstances in most cell types. &#x201c;Tissue-specific promoter&#x201d; and &#x201c;tissue-preferred promoter&#x201d; are used interchangeably, and refer to a promoter that is expressed predominantly but not necessarily exclusively in one tissue or organ, but that may also be expressed in one specific cell or cell type. &#x201c;Developmentally regulated promoter&#x201d; refers to a promoter whose activity is determined by developmental events. &#x201c;Inducible promoter&#x201d; selectively expresses a DNA sequence operably linked to it in response to an endogenous or exogenous stimulus (environment, hormones, or chemical signals, and so on).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used herein, the term &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; means that a regulatory element (for example but not limited to, a promoter sequence, a transcription termination sequence, and so on) is associated to a nucleic acid sequence (such as a coding sequence or an open reading frame), such that the transcription of the nucleotide sequence is controlled and regulated by the transcriptional regulatory element. Techniques for operably linking a regulatory element region to a nucleic acid molecule are known in the art.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">&#x201c;Introduction&#x201d; of a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., plasmid, linear nucleic acid fragment, RNA, etc.) or protein into an organism means that the nucleic acid or protein is used to transform a cell of the organism such that the nucleic acid or protein functions in the cell. As used in the present invention, &#x201c;transformation&#x201d; includes both stable and transient transformations.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">&#x201c;Stable transformation&#x201d; refers to the introduction of an exogenous nucleotide sequence into the genome, resulting in the stable inheritance of foreign genes. Once stably transformed, the exogenous nucleic acid sequence is stably integrated into the genome of the organism and any of its successive generations.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">&#x201c;Transient transformation&#x201d; refers to the introduction of a nucleic acid molecule or protein into a cell, performing its function without the stable inheritance of an exogenous gene.

The Cas12a protein of the present invention is derived from plant symbiotic bacteria and, therefore, is particularly suitable for genome editing in plants.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments of various aspects herein, the Cas12a protein is derived from a species from <i>Flavobacterium</i>. In some embodiments, the Cas12a protein is derived from <i>Flavobacterium branchiophilum</i>. Those skilled in the art will understand that Cas12a proteins in different strains of a same bacterial species may have certain differences in amino acid sequence, but can achieve substantially the same function.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments of various aspects of the invention, the Cas12a protein is recombinantly produced. In some embodiments of various aspects of the invention, the Cas12a protein further contains a fusion tag, e.g., a tag used for Cas12a protein isolation/or purification. Methods for recombinant production of proteins are known in the art. A variety of tags that can be used to isolate and/or purify proteins are known in the art, including but not limited to His tags, GST tags, and the like. Generally, these tags do not alter the activity of the protein of interest. In some embodiments, the Cas12a protein is also fused with other functional proteins, such as deaminase, transcriptional activator/repressor protein, etc., so as to realize base editing or transcriptional regulation functions.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments of various aspects of the invention, the Cas12a proteins of the invention further comprise a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), e.g., is linked to a nuclear localization sequence through a linker. The a &#x201c;linker&#x201d; may be a non-functional amino acid sequence which is 1-50 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or 20-25 or 25-50) or more amino acids in length and is free of secondary or higher structures. For example, the linker can be a flexible linker such as SGGS (SEQ ID NO:3). In general, one or more NLSs in the Cas12a protein should be of sufficient strength to drive the accumulation of the Cas12a protein in the nucleus in an amount that enables its genome editing function. In general, the strength of nuclear localization activity is determined by the number, location of NLSs in the Cas12a protein, one or more specific NLSs used, or a combination of these factors. Exemplary nuclear localization sequences include, but are not limited to, the SV40 nuclear localization signal sequence (e.g., set forth in SEQ ID NO:4), the nucleoplasmin nuclear localization signal sequence (e.g., set forth in SEQ ID NO:5). In addition, according to the DNA position to be edited, the Cas12a protein of the present invention may also include other localization sequences, such as cytoplasmic localization sequences, chloroplast localization sequences, mitochondrial localization sequences, and the like. In some embodiments, the plurality of localization sequences can be linked by linkers.

In some embodiments, the sequence Nx (spacer sequence) is capable of specifically hybridizing to the complement of the target sequence.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In general, a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) is needed at the 5&#x2032; of the target sequence to be targeted by the genome editing system of the present invention. The PAM may be, for example, 5&#x2032;-TTTN, where N represents A, G, C or T. However, different PAM sequences can also be used. Based on the presence of PAMs, those skilled in the art can readily determine target sequences in the genome that can be used for targeting and optionally editing and design suitable guide RNAs accordingly. For example, if there is a PAM sequence 5&#x2032;-TTTG-3&#x2032; in the genome, about 18 to about 35, preferably 20, 21, 22 or 23 consecutive nucleotides immediately adjacent to its 3&#x2032; can be used as the target sequence.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the at least one guide RNA is encoded by different expression constructs.

Different species exhibit specific preferences for certain codons of specific amino acids. Codon preference (difference in codon usage between organisms) is often related to the translation efficiency of messenger RNA (mRNA), which is considered as depending on the nature of the codon being translated and the availability of the specific transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule. The advantages of the selected tRNA in the cell generally reflect the codons most frequently used for peptide synthesis. Therefore, genes may be tailored to the optimal gene expression in a given organism based on codons optimization.
