Carrier aggregation can provide higher data rates and/or more reliability over the communication link. However, in order to provide an efficient usage of carrier aggregation, it should be possible to easily adapt the carrier aggregation configuration to different characteristics and requirements of different NR services, such as eMBB and URLLC.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An objective of one or more embodiments of the instant disclosure is to provide a solution which mitigates or solves one or more of the drawbacks and problems of other approaches.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect of some embodiments, one or more of the above mentioned and other objectives are achieved with a client device for a communication system, the client device being configured to transmit a first control message to a network access node, wherein the first control message indicates a set of control channel, CCH, monitoring capabilities supported by the client device, wherein each CCH monitoring capability in the set of CCH monitoring capabilities indicates a first CCH monitoring capability for a first CCH monitoring mode and a second CCH monitoring capability for a second CCH monitoring mode.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Monitoring capability may be further denoted monitoring capability information which implies information content about the supported monitoring CCH capability of the client device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is to be understood that the client device may transmit one or more first control messages to the network access node and hence not limited to a single first control message. The one or more first control messages may be transmitted in a single transmission or in plurality of transmissions to the network access node.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An advantage of the client device according to the first aspect of some embodiments is that it can support diverse communication scenarios with widely different characteristics and requirements. Especially, in carrier aggregation efficient usage and adaption of capabilities is crucial. Such a mechanism is herein provided. For example, the client device can be designed to support a set of CCH monitoring capability pairs, and by sending the control message to the network access node the client device indicates/informs the network about this supported set. Based on this information the network can select the CCH monitoring capability pair from the indicated set that is most suitable for a given use case, and if the use case changes, the network can select another CCH monitoring capability pair from the supported set. By doing so it will be ensured that the network access node and the client device can adapt to the requirements of a given communication service, such as eMBB and URLLC.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an implementation form of a client device according to the first aspect of some embodiments, the first CCH monitoring capability is associated with a first number of serving cells and the second CCH monitoring capability is associated with a second number of serving cells.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Serving cells can also be understood to be cells, activated cells, component carriers, carriers, bandwidth parts, active bandwidth parts, etc.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">An advantage with this implementation form in accordance with some embodiments is that mixed services can be supported efficiently by the client device.

For example, in feature group 6-5, the UE reports the number of supported downlink carriers, which can be up to 16. In feature group 6-5a, the UE is reporting its capability of supported cells for physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) monitoring in case of CA. Because PDCCH monitoring is a very complex operation which is requiring a lot of resources, the UE can be configured with more cells in total than it has PDCCH monitoring capability. This is not an error case. In such a situation, the UE can still operate on all configured cells, but it will, according to pre-defined formulas defined in TS 38.213, scale the PDCCH monitoring.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In release 15 (Rel-15) of the 3GPP standard, there is only one type of PDCCH monitoring (called Rel-15 monitoring in this disclosure). A Rel-15 UE can report how many Rel-15 cells it can support for PDCCH monitoring. The minimum requirement is 4 cells. In release 16 (Rel-16), enhanced PDCCH monitoring is introduced (called Rel-16 monitoring in this disclosure). Rel-16 monitoring is different from Rel-15 monitoring. In Rel-15, the UE has to support a maximum number of non-overlapped control channel elements (CCEs) and maximum number of monitored PDCCH candidates per slot. In Rel-16, the UE has to support a maximum number of non-overlapped control channel elements (CCEs) and monitored PDCCH candidates (or blind decodes) per monitoring span, and there can be several monitoring spans within a slot.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In this discourse the term &#x201c;blind decodes&#x201d; can be used interchangeably with &#x201c;maximum number of PDCCH candidates&#x201d; and the term &#x201c;CCEs&#x201d; can be used interchangeably with &#x201c;maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The UE can be configured with Rel-15 CCH monitoring in some cells and with Rel-16 CCH monitoring in other cells. The UE can report its Rel-15/Rel-16 monitoring capability independently from each other.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">One drawback with one or more other approaches is that the UE only reports one Rel-15 monitoring and one Rel-16 monitoring capability. Rel-15 monitoring is not necessarily worse than Rel-16 monitoring but targeting for different use cases. Rel-15 monitoring could be more suitable for eMBB applications while Rel-16 monitoring could be more applicable for URLLC applications.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Another drawback with the other approaches is that for each sub-carrier spacing and each monitoring span pattern only one value for the maximum number of non-overlapping CCEs, i.e., parameter C_max, and only one value for the maximum number of PDCCH candidates is given, i.e., parameter M_max. However, for different combinations of Rel-15/Rel-16 PDCCH monitoring capability, different values could apply. It is noted that mentioned parameters C_max and M_max are a generic wording for the sub-carrier spacing and span pattern specific parameters C<sub>PDCCH</sub><sup>max,slot,&#x3bc;</sup>, C<sub>PDCCH</sub><sup>max,(X,Y),&#x3bc;</sup>, M<sub>PDCCH</sub><sup>max,slot,&#x3bc;</sup> and M<sub>PDCCH</sub><sup>max,(X,Y),&#x3bc;</sup> which are used in the 3 GPP specifications.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Therefore, it is herein presented a solution with enhanced support and procedures for the exchange of CCH monitoring capability information between a client device and a network access node and further for determining which CCH monitoring capability to use. Thereby, a flexible CCH monitoring mechanism which can be adapted to different service requirements and traffic situations is provided.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a client device <b>100</b> according to at least one embodiment.

Assume that the client device <b>100</b> can support the following CCH monitoring capabilities {(0+4), (1+3), (2+2), (3+1), (4+0)}. Then, the CCH monitoring capabilities supporting combinations of the first CCH monitoring capability and the second CCH monitoring capability are (1+3), (2+2), and (3+1). In case both cells with the first monitoring mode M<b>1</b> and cells with the second monitoring mode M<b>2</b> are configured, there are hence three possible CCH monitoring capability that could be selected, i.e., (3+1), (2+2), or (1+3). A selection rule to define which of the CCH monitoring capabilities to select in this case is needed.

The CCH monitoring capability containing the largest number of the second CCH monitoring capability that does not exceed the number of configured cells with the second monitoring mode M<b>2</b> may, e.g., be selected. For example, assume that 5 cells are configured with the second monitoring mode M<b>2</b>. Then, in the example above, the CCH monitoring capability (1+3) has the most cells with the second CCH monitoring capability and should be selected. If only 2 cells are configured with the second monitoring mode M<b>2</b>, the CCH monitoring capability (2+2) should be selected.

Other selection rules may be defined without deviating from the scope of the instant disclosure.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0118">In NR the maximum number of monitored PDCCH candidates per cell and per monitoring span is dependent on applied Rel-15/Rel-16 capability combination. If, e.g., the applied combination is {0 Rel-15, 2 Rel-16} then M_max for Rel-16 CCH monitoring is equal to N<b>1</b>; and if the applied combination is {3 Rel-15, 1 Rel-16}, then M_max is equal to N<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0119">Consider the following example for CCE monitoring when different CCH monitoring capabilities are applied. This example is for illustrative purposes only and not limited to CCEs. A similar example can also be given for monitoring the maximum number of PDCCH candidates. It is further to be noted that 3GPP terminology and system design is used for providing deeper understanding of the examples but are not limited thereto. Therefore, the client device can be considered as a UE in this context.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0120">Assume that the UE can support the following two capability combinations of Rel-15/Rel-16 monitoring: {(1 Rel-15, 3 Rel-16), (3 Rel-15, 1 Rel-16)}. Further, assume that the UE is configured with 3 cells in Rel-15 monitoring mode and with 3 cells in Rel-16 monitoring mode. For the cells with Rel-15 monitoring, sub-carrier spacing 60 kHz (i.e., &#x3bc;=2) is used. For the cells with Rel-16 monitoring, sub-carrier spacing 15 kHz (i.e., &#x3bc;=0) and the span pattern (7, 3) are used. The configuration can be performed, e.g., according to TS 38.213 Section 10.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0121">If the PDCCH monitoring capability (1+3) for PDCCH monitoring shall be followed, then for Rel-16 monitoring, the UE is configured according to its capability. In this case it is expected to monitor a maximum number of 56 non-overlapping CCEs in each monitoring span of each cell. In total, the UE is expected to be able to monitor 3*56=168 non-overlapping CCEs per span over all 3 Rel-16 cells. For the Rel-15 monitoring, the UE is configured with 3 cells but only has PDCCH monitoring capability for one cell. This is not an error case, but the UE has to scale the total number of non-overlapping CCEs that are monitored according to Rel-15. From TS 38.213, Section 10, it can then be concluded that the UE is required to be able to monitor in total C<sub>PDCCH</sub><sup>total,slot,2</sup>=48 non-overlapping CCEs per slot across all Rel-15 cells.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0122">If, on the other hand, capability (3+1) shall be followed, the UE only has a capability of one cell for Rel-16 monitoring but is configured with 3 Rel-16 cells. Thus, the UE is configured above its capability for Rel-16 monitoring. The UE has to perform scaling of the maximum number of non-overlapping CCEs. According to TS 38.213, the value C<sub>PDCCH</sub><sup>total,(7,3),0</sup>=56 can then be calculated. It represents the total maximum number of non-overlapping CCEs per span that the UE has to be able to monitor across all configured Rel-16 cells. For the Rel-15 based monitoring, the UE is configured according to its capability and is expected to monitor a maximum number of C<sub>PDCCH</sub><sup>max,slot,2</sup>=48 non-overlapping CCEs per slot and per cell and in total 3*C<sub>PDCCH</sub><sup>max,slot,2</sup>=144 non-overlapping CCEs per slot across all cells.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0123">These calculations are summarized in Table 1 below. They show that for the same carrier aggregation configuration (3 cells according to Rel-15 and 3 cells according to Rel-16), the PDCCH monitoring is very different depending on the applied capability. It is therefore beneficial to adapt the PDCCH monitoring capability to the requirements of a given use case and it is crucial that the network and UE have the same understanding which capability that shall be applied.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Maximum number of required CCEs to be</entry></row><row><entry>monitored across the configured cells.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>N-cap. 16 3 cells</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>SCS</entry><entry>(X, Y)</entry><entry>#cells</entry><entry>C_max/span</entry><entry>C_total/span (TS 38.213)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>15 kHz</entry><entry>(7, 3)</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>56</entry><entry>(3 * 56 * 3)/3 = 168</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>N-cap, 15 1 cells</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>SCS</entry><entry>(X, Y)</entry><entry>#cells</entry><entry>C_max/span</entry><entry>C_total/slot (TS 38.213)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>60 kHz</entry><entry>n.a.</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>48</entry><entry>(1 * 48 * 3)/3 = 48</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>N-cap. 16 1</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>SCS</entry><entry>(X, Y)</entry><entry>#cells</entry><entry>C_max/span</entry><entry>C_total/span (TS 38.213)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>15 kHz</entry><entry>(7, 3)</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>56</entry><entry>(1 * 56 * 3)/3 = 56</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>N-cap, 15 3</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>SCS</entry><entry>(&#x3c7;, Y)</entry><entry>#cells</entry><entry>C_max/span</entry><entry>C_total/slot (TS 38.213)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>60 kHz</entry><entry>n.a.</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>48</entry><entry>(3 * 48 * 3)/3 = 144</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0123" num="0124">In some embodiments, the client device <b>100</b> in some cases does not signal or transmit the first control message <b>502</b> to the network access node <b>300</b>, hence refrain from transmitting the first control message <b>502</b>.
