The entire disclosure of the above-referenced application is incorporated herein by this reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to power-efficient eye tracking. In particular, the present invention concerns a method for conserving energy in an eye tracking system that has at least two cameras configured to register eye images of at least one eye of a subject, a control unit configured to implement such a method, and a head-mounted display including the control unit. The invention also relates to a computer program product and a non-volatile data carrier.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To attain high quality and certainty, today's eye trackers usually employ more than one camera to record images of a subject's eyes. Further, each eye is typically illuminated by a plurality of light sources. Of course, this requires a comparatively large amount of energy. Especially in portable devices it is therefore important that the energy resources are not wasted.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">US 2015/0199003 describes a solution for eye gaze detection based upon multiple cameras and/or light sources. The cameras and/or light sources are configured to provide eye gaze detection for a device display at different orientations, at different tilt angles, at different user positions, at different user distances, and so on. The document also shows a controller that selectively controls light source power and camera on/off state to provide images of the eye having sufficient quality for eye gaze detection and/or to conserve power.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, a solution is known, where cameras and light sources are controlled in such a manner that the eye tracker's overall energy consumption is rendered relatively low. However, there is room for improvements of the efficiency.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present invention to offer an improved solution for controlling an eye tracking system in an energy-efficient manner.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one aspect of the invention, this object is achieved by a method for conserving energy in an eye tracking system containing at least two cameras configured to register eye images of at least one eye of a subject. The method is performed in at least one processor and involves obtaining eye images from at least one camera in a subset of the at least two cameras. A first pupil parameter is determined based on a first eye image of the eye images, and a second pupil parameter is determined based on a second eye image of the eye images. The first and second pupil parameters are compared to one another to obtain a test parameter. The test parameter is checked against at least one operation criterion; and in response thereto, a respective operation state is assigned to at least one camera in the subset of the at least two cameras. The operation state involves operating the camera at a high frame rate, operating the camera at a reduced frame rate being lower than the high frame rate, the camera being in a standby mode, or the camera being powered off.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This method is advantageous because it allows using only the best suited camera(s) at each point in time. Moreover, the cameras may be controlled to exclusively operate at the particular power level needed to attain a specified quality of the eye tracking.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the subset of cameras contains a first camera, and the method involves: obtaining the first eye image captured by the first camera during a first time period; and obtaining the second eye image captured by the first camera during a second time period after the first time period. The test parameter includes a measure expressing a difference between the first and second eye images. Thus, it is straightforward to determine whether a quality of the image data registered by the first camera increases, decreases or remains essentially stable.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the subset of cameras contains first and second cameras, and the method involves: obtaining the first eye image captured by the first camera during a first time period; and obtaining the second eye image captured by the second camera during the first time period. Here, the test parameter includes a measure expressing a difference between the first and second eye images. Thereby, it is straightforward to determine which camera that produces the best image data, or if both cameras provide essentially the same quality.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the first and second cameras are configured to register the eye images of the same eye, however from different angles. Consequently, at least one of the cameras may produce high image data quality irrespective of the direction in which the subject aims his/her gaze.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to yet another embodiment of this aspect of the invention, each of the first and second pupil parameters expresses a respective characteristics of the subject's pupil in terms of a pupil size and/or a pupil position. Namely, these are key characteristics to accomplish reliable eye tracking.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to still another embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the pupil size is interpreted to designate a distance from a reference point in the first or second eye image, at which reference point a main optic axis of the camera and a normal of the pupil are parallel to one another, an indication of the pupil being partially occluded, or both. Thus, the pupil size, as such, is an important factor when establishing the image data quality.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the method involves assigning the operation state to:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">operating the camera at the high frame rate, if the test parameter indicates that the eye image from the camera fulfills a first operation criterion;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0016">operating the camera at the reduced frame rate, if the test parameter indicates that the eye image from the camera fulfills a second operation criterion, however not the first operation criterion;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0017">the standby mode, if the test parameter indicates that the eye image from the camera fulfills a third operation criterion, however neither the first nor the second operation criterion; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0018">be powered off, if the test parameter indicates that the eye image from the camera does not fulfil any of the first, second or third operation criteria.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">Thus, an adequate operation state may be assigned dynamically depending on which image data quality is provided by a particular camera at a particular point in time.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">According to still another embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the first and second pupil parameters specify a respective number of glints detected in the first and second eye images respectively. The method further involves assigning the operation state to the at least one camera in the subset of the at least two cameras based on a number of glints detected in the first and second eye images respectively. Namely, in general, detecting more glints is better than detecting fewer glints, especially in the cornea. However, a shape of a pattern formed by the glints, and/or the shapes of the glints themselves may also be used as quality indicators.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">According to a further embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the eye tracking system includes at least two light sources each of which is configured to project light towards the at least one eye of the subject such that corneal reflection data is generated in the eye images when the projected light is reflected by the eye. Here, the method involves selectively controlling the at least two light sources to be on or off based on the checking of the test parameter relative to the at least one operation criterion. As a result, exclusively those light sources may be activated that cause glints in an eye, which is currently being imaged. Naturally, this is beneficial from an energy-saving point-of-view.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">According to another aspect of the invention, the object is achieved by a computer program product loadable into a non-volatile data carrier communicatively connected to at least one processor in an eye tracking system comprising at least two cameras configured to register eye images of at least one eye of a subject.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">The computer program product contains software configured to, when the computer program product is run on the at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to: obtain eye images from at least one camera in a subset of the at least two cameras; determine a first pupil parameter based on a first eye image of the eye images; determine a second pupil parameter based on a second eye image of said eye images; compare the first and second pupil parameters to one another to obtain a test parameter; check the test parameter against at least one operation criterion; and in response thereto assign a respective operation state to at least one camera in the subset of the at least two cameras, which operation state involves: operating the camera at a high frame rate, operating the camera at a reduced frame rate being lower than the high frame rate, the camera being in a standby mode, or the camera being powered off. The advantages of this computer program product and non-volatile data carrier are apparent from the discussion above with reference to the proposed method.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">According to yet another aspect of the invention, the above object is achieved by a control unit for conserving energy in an eye tracking system containing at least two cameras configured to register eye images of at least one eye of a subject. The control unit contains input and output interfaces and a processor. The input interface is configured to obtain eye images from at least one camera in a subset of the at least two cameras. The processor is configured to determine a first pupil parameter based on the first eye image of the eye images; and determine a second pupil parameter based on the second eye image of the eye images. The processor is further configured to compare the first and second pupil parameters to one another to obtain a test parameter; and check the test parameter against at least one operation criterion.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">In response to the check, the processor is configured to assign a respective operation state to at least one camera in the subset of the at least two cameras, and forward the respective assigned operation state via the output interface to said at least one camera. The operation state involves operating the camera at a high frame rate, operating the camera at a reduced frame rate being lower than the high frame rate, the camera being in a standby mode, or the camera being powered off. The advantages of this control unit are apparent from the discussion above with reference to the proposed method.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">Further advantages, beneficial features and applications of the present invention will be apparent from the following description and the dependent claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0027">The invention is now to be explained more closely by means of preferred embodiments, which are disclosed as examples, and with reference to the attached drawings.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an arrangement of cameras and light sources that are controllable according to one embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a block diagram of a control unit according to one embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>show examples of eye images of a subject according to one embodiment of the invention; and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates, by means of a flow diagram, the general method according to the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an arrangement of cameras and light sources that are controllable according to one embodiment of the invention.

The processor <b>220</b> is further configured to compare the first and second pupil parameters PP<b>1</b> and PP<b>2</b> to one another to obtain a test parameter PT. According to one embodiment of the invention, the test parameter PT contains a measure expressing a difference between the first and second eye images D<sub>A1 </sub>(T<b>1</b>) (or DB<b>1</b> (T<b>1</b>)) and DA<b>1</b> (T<b>2</b>) (or DB<b>2</b> (T<b>1</b>)) respectively.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0041">Moreover, the processor <b>220</b> is configured to check the test parameter PT against at least one operation criterion. For example, if the eye tracking system is performing pupil tracking, the first and second pupil parameters PP<b>1</b> and PP<b>2</b> may describe respective pupil sizes, respective pupil motions and/or respective directions in which the pupil moves. In this disclosure, the term &#x201c;pupil size&#x201d; is understood to designate a total area covered by the pupil in an eye image, e.g. DA<b>1</b> (T<b>1</b>), or DB<b>1</b> (T<b>1</b>), D<sub>A1 </sub>(T<b>2</b>) or DB<b>2</b> (T<b>1</b>). Hence, for example, the &#x201c;pupil size&#x201d; is not equivalent to a pupil diameter, or a pupil radius.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0042">The at least one operation criterion may here be as follows. As long as the subject's eye pupil is fully visible in a field of view of the first camera CA<b>1</b>, the second camera CA<b>2</b> shall be powered off, or at least be placed in a standby mode.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0043">However, if the processor <b>220</b> determines, for example based on a visibility and movement direction of the subject's eye pupil, that the pupil moves toward a field of view of the second camera CA<b>2</b>, the processor <b>220</b> assigns such operation states to the first and second cameras CA<b>1</b> and CA<b>2</b> that the first camera CA<b>1</b> is powered off, or at least be placed in the standby mode, and the second camera CA<b>2</b> is activated. Preferably, during a transition phase, when the pupil might be fully visible in both the first and second cameras CA<b>1</b> and CA<b>2</b>, both cameras are active and produce gaze signals, and/or other eye-tracking related signals.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0044">Generally, according to the invention, the processor <b>220</b> is configured to compare the first and second pupil parameters PP<b>1</b> and PP<b>2</b> to one another to obtain a test parameter, and check the test parameter against an operation criterion. In response thereto, in turn, the control unit <b>220</b> is configured to assign a respective operation state to at least one camera in a subset of at least two cameras of the eye tracking system. The respective operation state OP<b>1</b>, OP<b>2</b>, OP<b>3</b> or OP<b>4</b> may involve: operating the camera at a high frame rate, operating the camera at a reduced frame rate being lower than the high frame rate, the camera being in a stand by mode, or the camera being powered off.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0045">The output interface <b>210</b> is configured to forward the respective assigned operation state to each camera whose operation state is to be altered, i.e. CA<b>1</b>, CA<b>2</b>, CB<b>1</b> and/or CB<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0046">According to one embodiment of the invention as illustrated by the examples of eye images in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>, the control unit <b>220</b> obtains a first eye image D<sub>A1 </sub>(T<b>1</b>), for example of the subject's right eye, captured by the first camera CA<b>1</b> during a first time period T<b>1</b>; and obtains a second eye image D<sub>A1 </sub>(T<b>2</b>) captured by the first Camera CA<b>1</b> during a second time period T<b>2</b> after the first time period T<b>1</b>. Here, the test parameter PT contains a measure expressing a difference between the first and second eye images D<sub>A1 </sub>(T<b>1</b>) and D<sub>A1 </sub>(T<b>2</b>). For example, the difference may relate to a difference in pupil information between the two images, such as a difference in pupil shape, e.g. the pupil P<b>1</b> being more circular in the first eye image D<sub>A1 </sub>(T<b>1</b>) and the pupil P<b>2</b> being more oval in the second eye image D<sub>A1 </sub>(T<b>2</b>), and/or the pupil P<b>1</b> being at a first position relatively close to being in line with a main optic axis of the first camera CA<b>1</b> in the first eye image D<sub>A1 </sub>(T<b>1</b>) and the pupil P<b>2</b> being at a second position further off from the main optic axis of the first camera CA<b>1</b> in the second eye image D<sub>A1 </sub>(T<b>2</b>).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0047">Alternatively, the first eye image DB<b>1</b> (T<b>1</b>) may depict the subject's left eye and be captured by the third camera CB<b>1</b> during the first time period T<b>1</b>; and the second eye image DB<b>1</b> (T<b>2</b>) may depict the subject's left eye and be captured by the third camera CB<b>1</b> during the second time period T<b>2</b> after the first time period T<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0048">This means that the first and second pupil parameters PP<b>1</b> and PP<b>2</b> may express a respective characteristics of the subject's pupil in terms of a pupil size and/or a pupil position in the eye image. Here, the test criterion is such that a larger pupil P<b>1</b> is favored over a smaller pupil P<b>2</b> because the former is interpreted to have been registered by a camera having a more favorable angular relationship to the normal of the pupil P<b>1</b> .</p><p id="p-0046" num="0049">The control unit <b>220</b> may be configured to interpret the pupil size to designate a distance from a reference point in the eye image where a main optic axis of the camera and a normal of the pupil are parallel to one another. Here, a smaller pupil P<b>2</b> is deemed to be more remote from the reference point than a larger pupil P<b>1</b>. Of course, the pupil's size in a recorded image may also be reduced because the pupil is partially occluded, for example because it is covered by an eyelid, and/or because the eye's angle toward the camera is very large. The control unit <b>220</b> is preferably also configured to interpret a smaller pupil size as a pupil being partially occluded. In any case, the test criterion is such that a closer/less occluded pupil is favored over a more distant/occluded ditto.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0050">According to one embodiment of the invention, the control unit <b>220</b> is specifically configured to determine the pupil position based on a shape of the pupil P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>. Namely, the smaller the angle is between a main optic axis of the camera and the normal of the pupil, the more circular the pupil will be imaged, and vice versa. Here, the test criterion is such that a more circular pupil Pi is favored over a less circular ditto.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0051">Namely, an eye looking more away from the camera is depicted with a pupil shape being more oval, or &#x201c;thinner&#x201d;, than what an eye looking less away from the camera is depicted. Thus, the overall pupil size will be smaller in the former case than in the latter. Ideally, a subject who is looking straight into the camera will show a maximum pupil size, i.e. that of a pupil P<b>1</b> being depicted with a roughly circular shape.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0052">Typically, in an HMD implementation, the pupil shape at large angles affect the pupil size much more than the actual change in distance between the camera and the pupil.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0053">It is typically advantageous to first determine the pupil position in the image, and then determine the pupil size and/or shape as a basis for assigning an operation state to a particular camera, such as turning it on or off. In general, it is more difficult to accurately determine gaze data if the angle between the camera's main optic axis and the normal of the pupil P<b>2</b> is large. Therefore, a camera having a small angle between the camera's main optic axis and the normal of the pupil P<b>1</b> will be favored over a camera having a larger angle between the camera's main optic axis and the normal of the pupil P<b>2</b> . In other words if the angular difference between an active camera's main optic axis and the normal of the pupil P<b>2</b> becomes too large, the strategy is to turn off/reduce the contribution from this camera, and instead turn on/increase the contribution from one or more other cameras depicting the same eye.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0054">Above, the &#x201c;pupil position&#x201d; refers to a two-dimensional coordinate in the respective eye image. Moreover, the distance difference of interest is the distance difference between the pupil positions in the eye images, for example represented by the above-mentioned distance to the reference point in the eye image, where a main optic axis of the camera and a normal of the pupil are parallel to one another.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0055">However, the distance difference between the pupil to the camera is less interesting. Preferably, namely, the cameras form part of an HMD, which basically remains static relative to the subject's eyes during operation, and therefore also the distances to the cameras are static in relation to the eye. Consequently, in such an HMD environment, each camera may determine an approximate location where the subject is looking only by identifying the pupil position in an eye image.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0056">For example, the pupil position of the eye in the first eye image D<sub>A1 </sub>(T<b>1</b>) or D<sub>B1 </sub>(T<b>1</b>) may be compared to the pupil position in the second eye image D<sub>A1 </sub>(T<b>2</b>), D<sub>A2 </sub>(T<b>1</b>), D<sub>B1 </sub>(T<b>2</b>) or <sub>DB2 </sub>(T<b>1</b>), captured by the same camera during the second time period T<b>2</b>, or by another camera during the same time period T<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0057">Alternatively, the pupil position in the first eye image D<sub>A1 </sub>(T<b>1</b>) or D<sub>B1 </sub>(T<b>1</b>) may be compared to a previously known pupil position, e.g. a reference image when the subject is looking straight into the camera in question CA<b>1</b> or CB<b>1</b> respectively.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0058">As yet an alternative, the pupil position in the first image D<sub>A1 </sub>(T<b>1</b>) or D<sub>B1 </sub>(T<b>1</b>) may be compared to a previously known pupil position of when the subject is looking in another well-defined direction, for instance straight ahead.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0059">If more than two operation states are employed, it may be advantageous to assign an operation state to a particular camera according to a hierarchical principle in relation to different operation criteria. For example, this may involve operating the camera at the high frame rate, if the test parameter PT indicates that the eye image from the camera fulfills a first operation criterion. If the test parameter PT indicates that the eye image from the camera fulfills a second operation criterion, however not the first operation criterion, the camera may be operated at the reduced frame rate, i.e. below the high frame rate. Further, if the test parameter PT indicates that the eye image from the camera fulfills a third operation criterion, however neither the first nor the second operation criterion, the camera may be placed in the standby mode. Finally, if the test parameter PT indicates that the eye image from the camera does not fulfil any of the first, second or third operation criteria, the camera may be powered off.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>also illustrate examples of how glints may occur in an eye of a subject according to one embodiment of the invention, for instance as depicted by the first and second cameras CA<b>1</b> and CA<b>2</b> respectively.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0061">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>, nine glints are visible in the form of G<b>11</b>, G<b>12</b>, G<b>13</b>, G<b>14</b>, G<b>15</b>, G<b>16</b>, G<b>17</b>, G<b>18</b> and G<b>19</b>, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>eight glints are visible in the form of G<b>21</b>, G<b>22</b>, G<b>23</b>, G<b>24</b>, G<b>25</b>, G<b>26</b>, G<b>27</b> and G<b>28</b>. According to one embodiment of the invention, the first and second pupil parameters PP<b>1</b> and PP<b>2</b> specify the respective number of glints, i.e. here nine and eight respectively, the control unit <b>220</b> is configured to assign the operation state, e.g. OP<b>1</b>, OP<b>2</b>, OP<b>3</b> or OP<b>4</b> to the at least one camera in the subset of the at least two cameras, here CA<b>1</b> or CA<b>2</b>, based on the number of glints detected in the first and second eye images respectively. Here, the test criterion is such that a larger number of detected glints is favored over a smaller ditto. Thus, the first camera CA<b>1</b> is favored over the second camera CA<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0062">According to embodiments of the invention, the operation state may also be assigned at higher precision and/or on alternative bases. For example, the first and second pupil parameters PP<b>1</b> and PP<b>2</b> may specifically express a respective number of detected glints in the cornea CR because corneal glints are more useful than for example glints in the sclera. Therefore, the test criterion may here be such that a larger number of corneal glints is favored over a smaller ditto. Again, in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>, this means that the first camera CA<b>1</b> is favored over the second camera CA<b>2</b>. Thus, a higher number of glints on or in the vicinity of the pupil P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> is preferred.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0063">Alternatively, or additionally, a shape of a pattern formed by the glints, and/or the shapes of the glints themselves may be used as quality indicators. Here, the test criterion may be such that a high similarity between the pattern formed by the glints and the pattern formed by the light sources is favored over a low similarity. Analogously, less distorted the glints relative to the shape of the light sources, are favored over more distorted ditto.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0064">Returning again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, according to one embodiment of the invention, the control unit <b>200</b> is configured to selectively control at least one light source in the first set of light sources LA<b>1</b>, LA<b>2</b>, LA<b>3</b>, LA<b>4</b>, LA<b>5</b>, LA<b>6</b>, LA<b>7</b>, LA<b>8</b>, LA<b>9</b> and LA<b>10</b>; and at least one light source in the second set of light sources LB<b>1</b>, LB<b>2</b>, LB<b>3</b>, LB<b>4</b>, LBS, LAB, LB<b>7</b>, LBB, LB<b>9</b> and LB<b>10</b> to be on or off based on the checking of the test parameter PT against the at least one operation criterion. Namely, this may save large amounts of energy, especially since the cameras registering eye images of the eye being illuminated by the light sources in question may be temporarily switched off as described above. For instance, if the light sources are near-IR LEDs, each light source may consume 8 mW. Consequently, by powering off a complete set of light sources, in total 8 mW&#xd7;10=80 mW can be saved.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0065">If the eye tracking system is performing gaze tracking and/or tracks eye movements, it is advantageous to track a gaze ray direction, and based thereon, dynamically control a power state of all the light sources per eye, i.e. the first set of light sources LA<b>1</b>, LA<b>2</b>, LA<b>3</b>, LA<b>4</b>, LA<b>5</b>, LA<b>6</b>, LA<b>7</b>, LA<b>8</b>, LA<b>9</b> and LA<b>10</b>; and the second set of light sources LB<b>1</b>, LB<b>2</b>, LB<b>3</b>, LB<b>4</b>, LB<b>5</b>, LB<b>6</b>, LB<b>7</b>, LB<b>8</b>, LB<b>9</b> and LB<b>10</b> respectively.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0066">Furthermore, knowledge of an eye movement state such as whether the eye is in fixation/saccade state and information about which camera that currently has the eye in its field of view, may be used to control the power state of the light sources in the first and second sets.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0067">It is generally advantageous if the control unit <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is configured to effect the above-described procedure in an automatic manner by executing a computer program <b>235</b>.
