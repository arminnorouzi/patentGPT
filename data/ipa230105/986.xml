They also serve as a hub, filtering and interpreting signals from the cell's surroundings and translating external signals into a cellular response by directing changes in gene expression. Healthy cell membranes also send, receive, and coordinate signals to and from other cells, and can elicit responses in cells close by, or even in cells at the opposite end of the body.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The modem Western diet filled with processed foods rich in &#x3c9;6 rather than &#x3c9;3 fats (in combination with other factors of modem life such as the ubiquitous use of plastics, pesticides, synthetic food additives) may alter membrane compositions and lead to changes in many physical parameters of a cell membrane such as membrane fluidity, permeability, and may interfere with the ability of intramembrane proteins and structures to interact (Phillips R., Membranes by the Numbers arxiv.org 6 Mar. 2017). These changes may contribute to the development of many chronic diseases, especially in patients with genetic predispositions for specific illnesses.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many disease states are driven by imbalances of lipids and phospholipids in cell membranes and impairments in cell membrane composition and functions. Disturbances in cell membrane function may manifest as dysregulated growth and proliferation (leading to diseases such as cancer, keloids, or psoriasis, among others); as a disrupted skin barrier (leading, for example, to eczema or a non-healing wound); as hormone dysregulation such as, for example, in diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome; as poor immune function; or as disrupted neuronal signaling such as, for example, in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's Disease.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One of the possible manifestations of impairments in cell membrane function is a decreased tolerance to pain and an increased predisposition to inflammation. Pain is defined as a sensation related to potential or actual damage in a bodily tissue (PMID 25722692). Pain is a multifaceted experience for the patient, involving both a physical response in the damaged structures or tissues (inflammation, swelling, increased muscle tension, and physical sensitization) as well as a secondary emotional response to the pain itself (anger, frustration, anxiety, insomnia, and emotional sensitization). Of note, insomnia further decreases global pain tolerance, worsens inflammation, and increases abnormal muscle tension, pain and swelling, thus perpetuating a negative feedforward cycle of pain.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Current oral and topical solutions for the treatment of pain for the most part only temporarily address some and not all aspects and not the root cause of pain. For example, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, leading to a reduction in inflammation and swelling while leaving central pain processing unaddressed. Similarly, opioids bind to mu, delta or kappa opioid receptors, reducing neuronal excitability in the neurons carrying pain signals to the Central Nervous System (CNS) leading to less perceived pain (PMID 9202932) but do not address inflammation, local swelling, or muscle tension. In fact, none of the pain pills currently on the market address all of the multiple components or the root cause of pain.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additionally, current oral pain medications have significant safety concerns. For example, opioids are highly addictive, requiring higher doses over time to achieve the same effect, creating a hyperalgesic state via multiple molecular mechanisms (Zhizhong Z. Pan, Mechanisms of Opioid Tolerance, Molecular Pain pp 413-422) in both central and peripheral pain systems in the body. There is a high risk of accidental death from self-administered overdose, due to the ease of addiction to this class of medications. NSAIDs are toxic to the kidneys, ears, and liver; and carry a significant risk for generalized bleeding as well as peptic ulcer formation. NSAIDs may also lead to a hyperalgesic state via multiple proposed mechanisms (PMID 25722692). Acetaminophen, the third major oral pain medication, is toxic to the liver and kidneys, and potentially increases risk of bleeding and peptic ulcers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Current topical pain preparations also have limitations. For example, NSAID creams have a potential to significantly increase the risk for bleeding, heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, peptic ulcers, and bowel perforation in addition to inhibiting tissue healing. Menthol-based creams are not practical for use in cold weather, or by patients with broken skin. Capsaicin and arnica creams carry a lesser risk of bleeding, heart attack, high blood pressure and stroke than NSAID creams, but still have a potential to cause skin irritation. Additionally, none of the current topical pain medications penetrate further than the outermost layer of the epidermis, resulting in pain relief for superficial structures only, leaving the pain of underlying structures untreated. Furthermore, the effects of current topical pain medications typically wear off after a few hours, requiring repeated application.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The above listed diseases are simply a few examples of the most common chronic illnesses which plague modern humans. In reality, virtually all diseases may be affected to some degree by imbalances of cell membrane composition and/or functions.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is a need for a formulation that can address disturbances in cell membrane composition and functions, including, e.g., the formulation that is capable of safely and effectively addressing the multiple aspects of pain. For topical formulations, it would need to penetrate into affected tissues to deliver active ingredients into the injured area. Ideally, it would have a fast onset of efficacy, have a long duration of efficacy, and hasten healing of the affected tissues such that pain or other pathological processes improve.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">There is also a need for a formulation that can improve absorption of substances applied to the skin. Application of such a formulation prior to applying commercially available products ideally would facilitate, restore and/or improve delivery into the skin and would facilitate incorporation of an ingredient(s) into cell membranes or into the intracellular space depending on size, charge, or other properties.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is an object of the invention to provide a formulation that can correct an imbalance in a cell membrane composition.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a formulation that can correct a disturbance in a cell membrane function.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a formulation that can improve absorption of substances applied to the skin.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a formulation that treats a disease by modulating cell membrane composition and/or function.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It also an object of the present invention to provide a topical formulation that is capable of inducing production of pluripotent stem cells.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is an additional object of the invention to provide a topical formulation that can reprogram differentiated skin cells into a pluripotent stem cell state.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is a further object of the invention to provide a topical formulation that is capable of altering gene expression without the use of a viral vector.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is also an object of the invention to provide a topical formulation that is capable of penetrating and delivering active ingredient(s) into the injured area beyond the outermost layer of epidermis.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is also an object of the invention to provide a topical formulation that is capable of penetrating and delivering active ingredient(s) distal from the site of injury or distal from target tissues beyond the outermost layer of the epidermis in order to purposely facilitate a delayed response.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In furtherance of the above objects and others, the present invention provides formulations capable of incorporating into existing cell membranes and restoring cell membrane composition and/or function(s) and modulating therapeutic effect(s). The formulations comprise a mixture of fatty acids in specific ratios such that the formulation may cross, integrate, modulate, regulate, or restore a function(s) of a membrane of a cell, an organelle or an exosome, and/or a function of cell and/or an organelle and/or an exosome. The formulations may, e.g., supply a component(s) to correct a deficiency in a cell membrane composition. The formulation may also be formulated to reduce transmission of signals in and between the cells, e.g., to reduce signaling for pain, inflammation, excess oxidation, etc. The formulation may also be formulated to increase healthy stem cell response to injury while limiting abnormal proliferation, division and/or other unhealthy responses of cells. The formulations may also be formulated to interfere with functions of cell membranes of microbes, viruses, fungi, insects, and parasites thereby resulting in a destruction or inactivation of microbes, viruses, fungi, insects, and parasites or an inability of microbes, viruses, fungi, insects and parasites to infect or inhabit their host(s). The fatty acids in the formulations may come from oil(s) and/or fats or may be individually incorporated into the mixture. In addition to the fatty acids, the formulations may comprise other components, as, e.g., described in detail below. The ratio of the fatty acids in the mixture and the formulations themselves (i.e., the individual components of the formulation and their amounts) are customizable, as for example, described in detail below, to address specific diseases, and/or root deficiencies, and/or restore a composition of a membrane of a cell, as well as the membrane of various organelles within a cell (e.g., a mammalian cell), and/or restore and/or improve cellular function(s). The formulations may allow, e.g., for 1) delivery of therapeutic materials directly into tissues and cells and/or 2) delivery of raw materials (e.g., proteins, minerals, vitamins, therapeutics, etc.) necessary to rebuild tissues into the inter- and intracellular space, to rebuild tissues and/or restore a cell membrane's function or the function of membranes of subcellular organelles. In certain embodiments, the incorporation of the formulation into a cell membrane may directly disrupt the lipid rafts housing clusters of pain transmembrane proteins which require being clustered together in order to signal for pain.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A formulation in accordance with the invention generally comprises: (i) a base composition, and one or more additional ingredient(s) dispersed in the base composition such that the formulation has a fatty acid composition that is substantially similar to that of a membrane of a cell, an organelle or an exosome. The fatty acid composition of the formulation renders the formulation capable of one or more of the following: crossing, integrating, modulating, regulating, or restoring the membrane's function(s) and/or a function(s) of a cell, an organelle or an exosome. The base composition may include a lipid. A lipid may, e.g., be an oil or a mixture oils or another substance comprising fatty acids. Thus, a lipid may, e.g., be an essential oil or a mixture of essential oils. The base composition may comprise from about 40% to about 99% of the formulation by volume. In some of the embodiments, the base composition comprises one or more oils. The one or more oils of the base composition may, e.g., be selected from a group consisting of emu oil, coconut oil, macadamia nut oil, high oleic sunflower seed oil, olive oil, and mixtures comprising two, three, four or five of the foregoing oils. In some embodiments, the base composition comprises a mixture of emu oil, coconut oil and macadamia nut oil. In some embodiments, the base composition comprises a mixture of high oleic sunflower seed oil, coconut oil and macadamia nut oil. Emu oil may, e.g., comprise from 0% to about 99% of the base composition by volume. Coconut oil may, e.g., comprise medium chain triglycerides derived from coconut oil, and comprise from 0% to about 95% of the base composition by volume. High oleic sunflower seed oil may, e.g., comprise from 0% to about 90% of the base composition by volume. Macadamia nut oil may, e.g., comprise from 0% to about 25% of the base composition by volume. Olive oil may, e.g., comprise from about 0% to about 80% of the base composition by volume. In some embodiments, the base composition consists of medium chain triglycerides derived from coconut oil. However, other oils and lipids can also be used in the formulations of the invention as long as they are combined in amounts that provide a base composition that has a fatty acid composition that is substantially similar as that of a membrane of a cell, an organelle or an exosome (or, in certain embodiments, a fatty acid composition that contains more oleic acid than that of a membrane of a cell, an organelle or an exosome), and renders the formulation capable of crossing, integration, modulation, regulation, or restoration of membrane's function(s) and/or a function(s) of a cell and/or organelle and/or an exosome. The formulation may further comprise a biosilicate (e.g., a Food Grade Diatomaceous Earth (FDGE) biosilicate) or a plurality of biosilicates (e.g., a plurality of FDGE biosilicates). The biosilicate(s) may, e.g., extend a duration of a desired effect(s) of the formulation. The formulation may be free from conventional drugs (i.e., substances approved by regulatory authorities (e.g., US FDA) for treatment of diseases in humans). The formulations may also be free from preservatives.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The one more additional ingredient(s) of the formulation may be selected from a group consisting of a phospholipid, a ceramide, cholesterol, a fatty acid, an oil, a vitamin, a mineral, a therapeutic agent, an exosome, or a combination of any of the foregoing. In some of the preferred embodiments, the one or more additional ingredient(s) in the formulation may be an essential oil or a mixture of essential oils or an exosome.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The base composition and the one or more additional ingredient(s) may be included in the formulation in an effective amount to reduce severity or alleviate a symptom of a disease, associated with an injury, damage or dysfunction of a cellular membrane or an organelle in a mammal.

The fatty acid composition of the base composition may be identical or substantially similar to a fatty acid composition of the cell membrane of a human cell. The lipid could, e.g., be a mixture comprising coconut oil and macadamia nut oil and may further comprise emu oil and/or high oleic sunflower seed oil. The one or more additional ingredients may comprise a mixture of German chamomile oil, Roman chamomile oil, and Moroccan chamomile oil, the mixture comprising from about 5% to about 30% of the formulation by volume.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The formulation may also comprise a mixture of individual fatty acids, wherein the fatty acids are combined in the mixture such that the mixture and/or formulation has a fatty acid composition that is substantially the same (i.e., approximate) as that of non-diseased human skin and/or sebum and/or cell membranes. In some of these embodiments, the fatty acids are combined such that the fatty acid composition of the mixture is substantially the same as that of human skin and/or sebum. In some of these embodiments, the fatty acids are combined such that the composition of the mixture supplements components of a membrane of a cell, organelle or exosome which may be deficient in such components due to disease, poor diet, or another cause. The mixture may, e.g., comprise, in % by volume, from about 0% to about 40% ceramides (e.g., 13%), from about 5% to about 99% fatty acids (e.g., 47%), including, e.g., phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol; from about 0% to about 25% cholesterol (e.g., 7%), from about 0% to about 25% cholesterol esters (e.g., 2%), from about 0% to about 25% squalene (e.g., 11%), from about 0% to about 20% triglycerides (e.g., 3%), from about 5% to about 99% proteins (e.g., 47%), and from about 0% to about 30% wax esters (e.g., 17%).

The mixture may also comprise a composition that is sufficient to correct an imbalance in a membrane of a cell or a membrane of a cell organelle, e.g., supply deficient membrane component(s). In some of the embodiments, oleic acid comprises greater than 50% (e.g., about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, or about 95%) of the fatty acid composition. Generally, higher concentrations of oleic acid is required to penetrate into the subcellular organelles (e.g., to directly influence cellular metabolism) than a cell membrane because the compounds must cross more than one set of cell membranes. The fatty acids may be incorporated into the formulations by themselves or in the form of oils, phospholipids or mixtures of lipids.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present invention is specifically directed in part to a formulation comprising a composition comprising palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid, wherein the palmitic acid comprises from about 20% to about 75% of the composition by weight, the stearic acid comprises from about 11% to about 13% of the composition by weight, the oleic acid comprises from about 8% to about 31% of the composition by weight, the linoleic acid comprises from about 15% to about 23% of the formulation by weight, and the formulation is capable of crossing a cell membrane and/or incorporating into a cell membrane and/or modulating a cell membrane composition and/or function.

In certain embodiments, the mixture comprises emu oil. Emu oil possesses a high concentration (up to 47%) of oleic acid in addition to other naturally occurring substances which result in anti-inflammatory properties useful in the treatment of pain and other inflammatory illnesses. The composition by percentage of fatty acids from Emu shows that it is quite comparable to that of human skin (See Table 2A and Table 2B), with the exception of a slightly higher percentage of oleic acid (47%) vs 31% for human skin. This similarity in composition to human skin renders it capable of serving as a carrier for other lipid as well as aqueous ingredients. For example, in certain embodiments emu oil may be combined with a selected mixture of vegetable oils composed to mimic the fatty acid profile of human skin and sebum (hereinafter, &#x201c;Liquid Skin&#x201d;) that can be admixed with medicinally active compounds such that they incorporate into existing skin cells or may be used as raw material for creating new cells. Similarly, it is possible to create a &#x201c;Vegan Liquid Skin&#x201d; by using a mixture of vegetable oils to approximate the fatty acid profile of human skin and sebum. For ease of reference, &#x201c;Liquid Skin&#x201d; in the present disclosure encompasses both types of mixtures.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0149">Additionally, the integration of additional phospholipids, ceramides, cholesterol, essential and free fatty acids into existing cell membranes create distance between receptors for pain and inflammation within the cell membrane, which require proximity in order to function in signal transduction (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>14</b></figref>). This culminates in an increased pain threshold, since it would decrease the chance of transmembrane receptors interacting to signal for pain.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0150">Many disease states such as diabetes (PMID 23878791, PMID 30216387) and cancer (PMID 30413053, PMID 31379986) are driven by and result in imbalances of lipids and phospholipids of the cell membrane (PMID 29410529). Dietary intake of fatty acids changes the fatty acid profile of human cell membranes, which in turn affect transmembrane proteins such as mechanosensitive ion channels which change cell function (PMID 30867417). Additionally, lipid profiles in the human forebrain are closely maintained throughout the healthy adult life span but are shown to decay at advanced ages (PMID 28958038). Dietary intake of other macro and micronutrients affect the overall fatty acid profile of the cell membrane. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to take the nutritional composition of our foods, as well as our medicines, into consideration if the desire is to restore and maintain health.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0151">Thus, in one aspect, the invention is directed in part to a mixture of various oils to mimic or restore or modulate the fatty acid profile of healthy human skin and sebum, which can be customized to deliver medicinally active compounds for the treatment of multiple diseases.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0152">To further illustrate these concepts and to emphasize the significance of the oil blend that is identical or substantially similar or can modulate the composition of healthy human skin/oil in the treatment of diseases, and can modify it, basic cellular biology of the following information is provided.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0153">Phospholipids are phosphorus-containing lipids composed of a fatty acid, a phosphate group, a glycerol, and a simple organic molecule such as choline; they are the basic building block of cell membranes, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0154">Due to the complexity of the chemical structure, phospholipids are typically represented as a ball-like structure with two tails in most diagrams, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0155">Of note, phospholipids can self-assemble in water into organized bilayer structures or even micelles (spheres).</p><p id="p-0158" num="0156">The cell is essentially a giant double-layered liposome (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), which houses many smaller organelles &#x201c;mini organs&#x201d; which are the machinery of the cell (akin to lifting up the hood of a car to see the parts that make up an engine) including the cell nucleus (seen in yellow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) which is the command center of the cell housing the deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA (think of the nucleus as the hub that directs the organelles how to function, what proteins to make, etc.). Any cell can individually activate specific DNA sequences to make proteins that cause the cell to signal to other cells. If the DNA sequences become activated out of sequence or lose their system of checks and balances, then cancer or other diseases may result. Similarly, if cells lose their function, or the healthy ability to recognize that it is damaged and fail to auto-destruct in an orderly fashion (apoptose), this also leads to disease. Thus, the cell surface is critical for how signals from outside the cell make its way into the cell nucleus to change the activity and function of the cell. A healthy cell membrane is required for signals from within the cell to be sent appropriately into the environment outside of the cell. One cell's signaling has the ability to alter the activity of other cells locally or in remote locations.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0157">If one were to snip out a small square from the surface of the human cell membrane, one would discover that there are many proteins, lipids, signaling proteins, ceramides, cholesterol, receptors and other biologically active molecules spanning the cell surface; as well as some that are only on the outer or inner leaflet of the cell membrane, each which are important in signaling for different cell pathways (such as ones for cell division, cell death, inflammation, cancer, diabetes, etc.) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0160" num="0158">Information from outside of the cell is transmitted via reactions at the outer cell membrane leaflet, resulting in changes in membrane-embedded cell receptors that leads to changes inside the cell, resulting in gene expression and protein production within the cell (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0161" num="0159">For example, this cross section of a cell shows the EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) embedded in the cell membrane (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).

Similar receptors exist for pain, and other biological processes in a mammal</p><p id="p-0163" num="0161">The cell membrane is the site where signals from the outside environment are interpreted and translated into directions that drive that cell's behavior. A healthy cell membrane is composed of a mixture of lipids, proteins, and sugars, (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) organized into regional domains (commonly called &#x201c;lipid rafts&#x201d;) that serve to signal for multiple aspects of cell behavior such as growth, cell division, pain, cell differentiation, or cell death (PMID 31052427). Specific sub-compartments of the cell possess different lipid compositions (PMID 31052427), which when altered due to diet or genetic defects lead to alterations in cell function, metabolism, and ultimately to chronic disease such as cancer (PMID 30518103), diabetes (PMID 29462590, 28742512), Alzheimer's Disease (PMID 31379503), neuroinflammation (PMID 31862695) and altered pain processing (PMID 31862695, PMID 29459435) as just a few examples.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0162">Fatty acids and other plant-derived compounds have an ability to insert into the human cell membrane. For example, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); as well as plant-derived polyphenolic and terpenoid phytochemicals such as curcumin (diferuloylmethane) possess the ability to span the cell membrane and disrupt cell signaling. When EPA, DHA and curcumin were used separately or together in one study, they reduced the number of atypical/precancerous stem cells in an animal model of colorectal cancer (PMID 16475686, 29860560). The proposed mechanism was the disruption of the lipid rafts (regions of the cell surface enriched in signaling proteins) necessary for transmembrane signaling.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0163">Similarly, a possible mechanism by which &#x201c;Liquid Skin&#x201d; (a blend of oils to approximate the fatty acid composition of human cell membranes and sebum) may treat a medical condition (e.g., pain) is by disrupting the signaling that occurs at the cell surface by inserting into the cell membrane, decreasing the likelihood of the paired or multimeric receptors interacting with each other (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>14</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0166" num="0164">Transmembrane receptors migrate along the surface of the cell in multiple directions according to Brownian Motion (a random movement of microscopic particles suspended in liquids or gases resulting from the impact of molecules of the surrounding medium), but in this case restricted to the plane of the cell membrane surface until they encounter an appropriate counterpart. Once dimerized (see the transmembrane protein-protein interaction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) or multimerized (formation of a multi-protein cluster) new signaling receptor docking sites may form (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>).</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Pain Mechanism Involves Multimerization of 2 or 4 Transmembrane Proteins</heading><p id="p-0167" num="0165">For example, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a superfamily of transmembrane ion channels that become activated in response to chemical or physical stimuli which ultimately signal for pain. These channels are made up of four subunits which are embedded on the cell surface in the cell membrane. The four individual subunits must find each other to lock into formation, resulting in a clover-leaf-like pattern before the channel can form in the cell surface to allow ions to flow through, signaling pain. If there are more phospholipids exogenously incorporated into the cell surface, then the chances that the four submits find each other and bind to form the channel decreases (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>14</b></figref> for an example of exogenous phospholipids decreasing changes of transmembrane protein interaction and reduced intracellular signaling). In essence, the net effect is to increase the pain threshold for a patient, as it would require a longer time for chance encounter of pain receptors to multimerize and allow for docking. Of note, unlike opioid pain medications, the mechanism targeted by this invention does not activate the mu opioid receptors, which are associated with the unwanted side effects of respiratory depression (which frequently can lead to unintentional death), as well as decreased heart rate, nausea, and constipation.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0166">Multiple disease processes (e.g., cancer, psoriasis, eczema, etc.) show a deficit or imbalance in cell surface lipids, ceramides, and phospholipids (PMID 29410529). The derangement in fatty acid profile is due to a combination of susceptible genetics combined with a modern diet of processed foods with unhealthy excess of &#x3c9;6 polyunsaturated fatty acids that predispose to inflammation, and a concomitant deficit in &#x3c9;3 polyunsaturated fatty acids that result in an anti-inflammatory response when ingested (PMID 29860560). Directly restoring cell surface lipids and other cell membrane components which incorporate into cell membranes may serve to limit and prevent these disease processes by preventing abnormal cell signaling.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0167">Significantly, this could mean that patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, cancer, psoriasis, eczema, chronic pain, fibromyalgia (to name a few) would benefit from topical application of &#x201c;Liquid Skin&#x201d; and potentially by ingestion of &#x201c;Liquid Skin&#x201d; especially when customized for each specific disease state to deliver disease-specific therapeutics into affected tissues (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>). Any disease involving subunit transmembrane receptors could potentially be targeted with this invention. As of 2019 there are over 4333 known transmembrane proteins (PMID 31874615) with more being discovered by Deep Learning methods (computerized protein structural modeling, PMID 33336200). Consequently, there exists an untold number of illnesses caused by dysregulation in cell membrane composition, resulting in altered protein-protein interaction and signaling. These diseases could potentially be helped by restoring a healthy fatty acid profile to the cell membrane.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0168">Additionally, exogenous phospholipids and other lipid mixtures like Liquid Skin can be used to confer penetrability to nanoparticles such as naturally occurring biosilicates such as Food Grade Diatomaceous Earth (FGDE). FGDE are biocompatible, nontoxic porous biosilicate skeletal remains of unicellular diatom microalgae that measure between 1.9 &#x3bc;m to 180 &#x3bc;m. They have many complex shapes and surfaces (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>) which renders them useful as micro drug delivery systems (PMID 31618958)&#x2014;particularly useful in the delivery of substances with poor water solubility and low oral bioavailability such as quercetin (PMID 31496698), useful for prolonging drug delivery (PMID 316618958) and useful in the treatment of metastatic cancer (PMID 31330820), which requires the sustained ability to regain control of intracellular signaling pathways appropriated by cancer (PMID 25239399).</p><p id="p-0171" num="0169">FGDE is safe to consume but hazardous to work with when dry. Thus, in certain embodiments, an N95 mask must be worn to cover the nose and mouth when handling it in a well-ventilated space to prevent interstitial lung disease from silicosis. When taken orally after it has been coated, FGDE will pass through the digestive tract unchanged and does not enter the bloodstream. Diatoms do not penetrate the skin when applied to the skin as a clay paste, unless coated with substances that confer penetrative properties. The diatoms are possessed of many pores and have complex 3-dimensional architecture, ideal for loading multiple bioactive compounds (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0172" num="0170">In certain embodiments, the invention is directed in part to diatoms hydrated in a dead sea saltwater solution to render the surface of the diatoms able to form bonds and to load minerals.

Alternatively, hydrated diatoms may be loaded with one bioactive ingredient; mixtures of these individually loaded diatoms may be combined to provide benefit in the target disease.

With time, and with the kinetic energy provided by being placed on warm human skin, the loaded components held by reversible bonds may be released gradually for, e.g., a duration from about 1 minute to 8, or more, weeks (e.g., for at least 2-8 weeks); while the components coated with lipid coating may confer immediate action. Each application of the preparations may have an additive effect due to long duration of action (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>-<b>24</b></figref>). Thus, for example, the goals of immediate relief from pain and inflammation are achieved, while providing long-term release of active elements required for tissue regeneration and repair over a number of weeks. With each application the patient will build more nutrients only in the area that needs restoration and healing (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>).

The oils for inclusion in the mixture may be selected from the oils listed in Table 2B, or other oils. The oils are combined in specific amounts to provide a fatty acid composition that is different from a fatty acid composition of the individual oils used and is better suited for an intended purpose.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0179">For example, in certain embodiments, the formulation may comprise a mixture of (i) macadamia nut and coconut oil and (ii) emu oil or high oleic sunflower seed oil. The addition of macadamia nut and coconut oils to either emu oil or to high oleic sunflower seed oil results in a fatty acid composition comprising oleic acid concentration that is substantially identical to (or higher) than the concentration of oleic acid in human cell membranes, and may therefore facilitate and/or improve permeability of the formulation and its components into cell membranes and/or into the subcellular spaces and/or into the subcellular organelles of a mammalian cell. In some of these embodiments, the addition of macadamia nut and coconut oils to either emu oil (as in liquid skin) or to high oleic sunflower seed oil (as in vegan liquid skin) increases the oleic acid at minimum 5-fold that of human cell membranes, resulting in greater penetrability of admixed therapeutic substances into the cell membrane, into the subcellular space, or into the subcellular organelles of a mammalian cell (e.g., a mammalian cell). Higher concentrations of oleic acid may be required to penetrate into the subcellular organelles (e.g., to directly influence cellular metabolism) because the compounds must cross more than one set of cell membranes.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0180">In view of the information provided herein, including Table 1, Tables 2A and 2B, one of ordinary skill in the art would be able to tailor a fatty acid composition of the mixture by using various oils and in specific amounts and provide a desired fatty acid composition and/or formulation without undue experimentation.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0181">In certain embodiments, the composition comprises emu oil. Emu oil may comprise, in % by volume, from about 1% to about 99%, from about 2% to about 99%, from about 5% to about 98%, from about 10% to about 96%, from about 15% to about 96%, from about 20% to about 95%, from about 25% to about 95%, from about 30% to about 95%, from about 40% to about 95%, from about 45% to about 95%, from about 60% to about 95%.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0182">In consideration of patients who may object to the animal origin of emu oil, in certain embodiments, the invention is directed in part to the use of a blend of organic vegetable oils to achieve a profile similar to that of the composition seen in healthy human skin and human subcutaneous adipose (PMID 23878791). In shall be noted that the fatty acid profile of the formulation may be optimized for specific diseases intended to be treated by the formulation and route of administration. For example, in certain embodiments the formulation may comprise organic high-oleic sunflower seed oil, with a high oleic acid content of 75-91% and used as a topical preparation useful in stimulating peripheral neuronal growth, since oleic acid is a necessary component of myelin sheath formation for neuronogenesis (the formation of new neurons in an adult human). Some of the vegetable oils that can be used in the formulation of the invention are listed in Table 2B, above, and include olive oil, due to the additional benefits of polyphenols (antioxidants), vitamins, and essential fatty acids present in this healthful oil, as well as flax seed oil and coconut oil.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0183">Oleic acid is postulated to be the fatty acid most responsible for the superior penetration properties of emu oil, which confer its penetration properties upon substances intermixed in it. Emu oil has been demonstrated to penetrate and to carry active ingredients (PIMD 27178879, PMID 28527394) around 3 mm into human skin, by destabilizing the alpha-helix structure of keratin (PMID 28527392), interacting with fats in the skin (PMID 28527394), and promoting restructuring of skin (PMID 15837639, PMID 15567771, PMID 27069472). Application of pure emu oil alone has been found to have anti-inflammatory, and thus analgesic effects. This effect may be improved, in the present invention, upon modifying the fatty acid composition of emu oil, e.g., by blending emu oil with one or more additional oil(s) (e.g., vegetable oils) to make the profile to more closely resemble that of a human or mammalian cell membrane, a cell, an organelle, or an exosome, depending on the intended target.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0184">In certain embodiments such as in the treatment of diseases of inflammation (such as cancer, Multiple Sclerosis, Diabetes, atherosclerosis, Coronary Artery Disease, and obesity, to name a few) emu oil in combination with one or more additional oil(s) in accordance with the present invention may be used to shift white blood cells from a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0185">In certain embodiments, emu oil in combination with one ore additional oil(s) may be used to upregulate stem cell markers Sox-2, Nanog, Oct4, Klf4, and c-Myc, which possess the ability to reprogram differentiated skin cells back into a stem cell-like progenitor state. This property alone may be useful in hastening recovery times for injured skin or for maintaining youthful and healthy skin. It could also be useful in the treatment of cancer (in which reprogramming of cancer stem cells into a na&#xef;ve stem cell-like state could result in selective apoptosis of cancer stem cells (normal stem cells which have sustained damage and become transformed to give rise to tumor-forming cells).</p><p id="p-0190" num="0186">In certain embodiments, every ingredient of the formulation is considered an active ingredient, as it benefits the body by addressing, e.g., specific aspects of pain.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0187">For example, while oleic acid plays a significant role in allowing superior delivery of substances into the human body, it also decreases anger (treating one of the emotional aspects of pain) while increasing mitochondrial function (PMID 23446891), decreases intracellular oxidative stress (PMID 31802387) thus decreasing inflammation and swelling, thus decreasing pain.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Additional Applications:</heading><p id="p-0192" num="0188">There are multiple applications that can utilize the technology outlined above using pain as an example. A non-limited list of ingredients and their potential utility was listed in Table 1 above. Both Liquid Skin and Vegan Liquid Skin were designed to mimic the fatty acid profile of human skin and cell membranes in order to facilitate the transport of admixed compounds into the epidermis and into cells. High and low concentration versions of Liquid Skin and Vegan Liquid Skin were designed to generally address cell membranes severely deficient vs. moderately deficient in membrane fatty acids and other components, respectively. Food Grade Diatomaceous Earth (FGDE) loading technology as described above may be used to create loaded nanoparticles that facilitate delayed release of active compounds to injured or affected tissues. FGDE loading technology in accordance with the present invention, however, is not limited to pain but may be modified as needed for the specific disease being treated. Addition of instant-acting active compounds rounds out the design to permit immediate relief from pain, in addition to delayed release for prolonged relief from pain for example.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0189">Potential Applications/Examples encompass the following (for each of these, a long-acting and/or a short-acting component may be formulated as described herein).</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Pain Preparation:</heading><p id="p-0194" num="0190">The invention encompasses various formulation which pay be used for treatment of pain, including vegan, non-vegan, prescription strength, and over-the-counter preparations.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0191">In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a formulation for treatment of pain.

German chamomile essential oil (over Roman chamomile essential oil) was investigated because the inventor recognized that it could exert its effects on the Central Nervous System (CNS) despite it being applied distally. Emu oil was used for its ability to penetrate deeply and deliver ingredients admixed therein.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0238">The formulation was tested and found to be effective for relieving abnormal muscle tension when other topical preparations purchased on the market failed.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0239">The formulation was also found to be effective for relieving insomnia, which is believed to be due to the formulation's mild anxiolytic properties.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0240">The formulation was also found to be effective in a patient with chronic neck pain from multiple neck injuries who had no history of neck surgery. The patient used PP1, the near infrared (NIR) light, along with other natural methods of pain management, and found it effective for the treatment of pain.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0241">PP1 was also tried in a patient with intractable neck pain status post multiple neck surgeries who was looking for a natural topical solution for the pain. The patient had tried opiate pain pills and patches to no avail. The patient applied PP1 to her neck and found it effective for pain relief shortly after application.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0242">PP1 could be used alone, or in conjunction with a near-infrared (NIR) lamp (from approximately 600 nm to 2500 nm. The NIR lamp may be used, e.g., to dilate blood vessels and increase local blood flow to &#x3e;400% within seconds of applying the light, &#x2dc;10 inches from the skin, for 5-60 minutes at a time or as tolerated (PMID 28935419).</p><p id="p-0245" num="0243">PP1 had a distinctive odor. A cold-pressed orange essential oil, as well as peppermint essential oil, was initially added to improve the odor of PP1; and the use of perfumed anointing oil was contemplated for inclusion in the formulation. This led to the design of Preparation 2.0.</p><heading id="h-0049" level="1">Example 2</heading><heading id="h-0050" level="1">Pain Preparation 2.0 (PP2)</heading><p id="p-0246" num="0244">PP2 versions comprised 20-30 drops (1-1.5 ml) of German chamomile oil, with the addition of 40 drops (2 ml) premium cold-pressed orange essential oil, 10 drops (0.5 ml) peppermint essential oil, and 10 drops (0.5 ml) Bridal Garden Jerusalem Anointing Oil by www.thenewjerusalem.co. The remaining balance was Emu oil up to a final volume of 1 fluid ounce. 12 bottles of PP2 were distributed to 12 subjects who agreed that the new formulation smelled pleasant and was more effective than the original.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0245">PP2 was applied in the evening on two patients with neck stiffness who reported relief from stiffness and pain shortly thereafter. Patients remained at 0/10 pain the next morning and both stated they slept well, felt relaxed, and that their neck muscles were no longer stiff.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0246">PP2 was also tried in a patient suffering from severe eczema for the past 6 years. His hands were covered with patches of cracked, dry, thickened, bleeding skin. After he applied PP2 to his hands (3 applications over 48 hours) he noted improvement as the lesioned skin became noticeably softer, thinner, and with a more normal texture. The pin-point bleeding had closed. He noted additional improvement when PP2 was applied to damp hands with an occlusive barrier cream applied on top overnight. His previously lesioned skin felt almost smooth after the third application.</p><heading id="h-0051" level="1">Example 3</heading><heading id="h-0052" level="1">Pain Preparation 3.0 (PP3)</heading><p id="p-0249" num="0247">PP3 was designed with an immediate-acting portion for instant pain relief, as well as a long-acting portion that would continually release bioactive substances such as the terpenoids, sesquiterpenes and flavonoids found in Moroccan Chamomile Oil, German Chamomile Oil, Roman Chamomile Oil; as well as minerals, amino acids, and vitamins required for tissue repair. The long-acting portion may provide effects for at least 2-8 weeks (PMID 31618958).</p><p id="p-0250" num="0248">Naturally occurring micron-sized biosilicates such as Food Grade Diatomaceous Earth (FGDE) were contemplated for use in PP3. These biosilicates are already pre-formed, do not require toxic chemicals to create, are chemically inert, are safely tolerated by living organisms for ingestion or topical application, have a large surface area for loading of pharmaceutically active compounds, thermostability, and most importantly safely serve as inert carriers of pharmaceutically active compounds without interfering with their native function (PMID 31618958).</p><p id="p-0251" num="0249">Additionally, loading these biosilicates with pharmaceutically active compounds simply requires incubating the hydrated diatoms/biosilicates with compounds of interest in sequential order to allow for attachment of the pharmaceutically active substances onto the biosilicates (PMID 31618958). In other embodiments, hydrated biosilicates may be loaded with only one active compound; and a mixture of such singly loaded biosilicates may be considered depending on desired effect in target tissues.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0250">It was contemplated that sequential incubations with other substances will extend the complexes with each new additional substance. When the single complex or the multiply loaded complex is admixed with Liquid Skin to facilitate absorption into the skin, with time and body heat the temporary bonds holding the pharmaceutically active substances together will break and release the individual active components into the tissue in need of repair. This process is time-released as it requires time (and increased kinetic/thermal energy; supplied by contact with a human body for example) for the bonds to break. This delayed release of active compounds will confer PP3 with a longer duration of effectiveness.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0251">The design was to first create the long-acting portion, and then add the immediate-acting portion (including the anxiolytic), as these should be readily available for immediate effectiveness. An objective is to have immediate pain relief, as well as extended release of minerals, amino acids, vitamins, and bioactive plant flavonoids, terpenoids, sesquiterpenes, etc. which promote tissue regeneration and repair into the specific tissues that need it. Thus, with each application, the tissues will be directly supplied with raw materials required for tissue formation and repair, facilitating healing and recovery.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0252">PP3 could be made in multiple strengths (See Table 3 for sample recipes).</p><p id="p-0255" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00004" num="00004"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="343pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>PP3 Formulation Sample Recipes by Patient Population</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Function</entry><entry>Extra Strength*</entry><entry>Adult</entry><entry>Elderly or Child</entry><entry>Infant &#x3c;1 yr</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="10"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="28pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="28pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="10" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Loaded</entry><entry>Time release delivery of minerals,</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>ml</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>ml</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>ml</entry><entry>0.5</entry><entry>ml</entry></row><row><entry>Biosilicates</entry><entry>amino acids, vitamins &#x26; bio-actives</entry></row><row><entry>(Long-</entry><entry>for long-acting relief of pain and</entry></row><row><entry>Acting</entry><entry>anxiety, delivery of substances</entry></row><row><entry>Fraction)</entry><entry>required for tissue repair.</entry></row><row><entry>German</entry><entry>Immediate-acting relief of pain,</entry><entry>0.15</entry><entry>ml</entry><entry>0.05</entry><entry>ml</entry><entry>0.025</entry><entry>ml</entry><entry>0.0125</entry><entry>ml</entry></row><row><entry>Chamomile</entry><entry>anxiety, abnormal muscle tension,</entry></row><row><entry>Moroccan</entry><entry>local allergy, itch, inflammation,</entry><entry>0.30</entry><entry>ml</entry><entry>0.10</entry><entry>ml</entry><entry>0.05</entry><entry>ml</entry><entry>0.025</entry><entry>ml</entry></row><row><entry>Chamomile</entry><entry>rashes.

After two applications, the patient noticed that the deep horizontal line across the bridge of the patient's nose that the patient had for the past 10 years was no longer visible unless the patient wrinkled the nose on purpose; and that the enlarged pores on the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin) were significantly smaller, the skin surface itself was finer and more radiant. PP3.1 reduced wrinkles and pore size, and improved skin radiance and texture.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0339">Ingredients for PP1-PP3.1 were chosen and formulated so as to stimulate 4 canonical transcription factors Sox2, Oct-4, c-Myc, and Klf4 (PMID 16904174). It was reported that stimulation of Sox2, Oct-4, c-Myc, and Klf4 in terminally differentiated cells can reprogram them back into an undifferentiated stem cell state (e.g., using viral vectors to drive expression of transcription factors Sox2, Oct-4, c-Myc, and Klf4 in mature skin cells was sufficient to revert them back into a stem cell state) (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> and (PMID 16904174)). This original work (PMID 16904174) by Dr. Shinya Yamanaka earned him the Nobel Prize in Medicine but applications of his work have mostly remained in the lab and have not been translated into the clinical setting for use in human patients.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0340">In essence, the difference between earlier work and PP3.1 appears to be that the latter transports a combination of signals into the cell using natural ingredients without the use of a viral vector and can transform the differentiated skin cells back into a &#x201c;biologically younger&#x201d; pluripotent stem cell state.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0341">Pluripotency is the ability to give rise to other cell types, depending on the signals in the cell's microenvironment; thus, it is possible to regenerate neurons, blood vessels, connective tissues, and a variety of other cell types appropriate to the specific cell environment (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>). For example, when PP3.1 is applied to the scalp it activates hair follicles to produce more hair, when applied to the skin it stimulates production of additional connective tissue (such as within a wrinkle) or additional skin cells. The local environmental signals within any given tissue will direct the induced pluripotent stem cells to restore the tissue as needed. Signals within facial skin will direct production of more facial skin, while signals within the scalp will direct production of more follicles/hair. Thus, there is no concern for scalp hairs growing on the face, for example.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0342">Increasing the number of stem cells in the skin has a potential to promote youthfulness, decrease inflammation, and promote rapid wound healing as well as the formation of new skin. It shall be noted that there are endless applications for any topical preparation capable of creating inducible stem cells out of terminally differentiated skin cells, or any other cell to which it is applied. For example, in a patient with peripheral neuropathy it may be possible to regenerate neurons in the tissues underlying the skin where PP3.1 is applied. In a patient with a burn requiring new blood vessels, connective tissue and skin cells it may be possible to regenerate each of these. All that is required is being able to deliver PP3.1 or future iterations into the injured tissue.</p><heading id="h-0059" level="1">Example 7</heading><heading id="h-0060" level="1">Skin Brightening Properties of PP3.1</heading><p id="p-0279" num="0343">Use of PP3.1 resulted in more rapid healing of blemishes as well as a brightening effect. The quality of a patient's skin was more radiant, healthy, and vibrant. One possible explanation is that licorice root extract contains glabridin, which has been shown to inhibit melanogenesis and inflammation, as well as UBV-induced pigmentation (PMID 9870547). Coating the glabridin with the lipid mixture conferring skin penetrative properties delivered this into tissues leading to a skin-brightening effect.</p><heading id="h-0061" level="1">Example 8</heading><heading id="h-0062" level="1">Hair Retention Properties of PP3.1</heading><p id="p-0280" num="0344">A few drops of PP3.1 was sporadically applied to the center part of a patient's scalp (1 application approximately every 3-7 days).

One drop of PP3.1 was placed on the ulcer and the pain instantly resolved on contact; the ulcer immediately began to heal and shrink in size, and by morning the ulcer was gone. This is a much more powerful response than in PP1, PP2 and PP3. The floral/bitter taste may be a repellent to some, but the effectiveness will likely make up for it. This preparation facilitates rapid healing by stimulating a stem cell response in the injured tissue, in addition to treating pain.</p><heading id="h-0065" level="1">Example 10</heading><heading id="h-0066" level="1">Validation of Long-Term Release of Active Compounds and Lymph Fluid Drainage Properties of PP3.1</heading><p id="p-0282" num="0346">After a trauma, a patient was unable to lift her right leg more than an inch off the floor due to a sprained right groin, sprained right gluteus muscle, sprained right hip and lower back with rupture of one of the right pelvic stabilizing muscles in addition to disc herniation at L3 and L4. Approximately 10 drops of PP3.1 total were applied to affected areas and a set of near-infrared lamps were utilized for 5 minutes to allow for deeper penetration of PP3.1.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0347">Twenty-three hours after application of PP3.1, the patient went to get a lymphatic drainage/deep tissue massage. The masseuse began working on the injured right gluteus/hip/groin and remarked that the area was neither inflamed nor swollen. The patient noted a lack of pain only on the areas where PP3.1 had been applied despite the superficial lymphatic drainage massage, which normally causes discomfort. When the masseuse began the same massage in areas where PP3.1 had not been applied, the patient experienced the usual discomfort.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0348">It shall be noted that the patient was able to tolerate deeper pressure on the injured side as compared to the uninjured side. While the masseuse worked on the right/injured side the patient could feel light/medium/deep touch the same as usual; no numbness was noted. Therefore, it was hypothesized that a dampening of inflammation resulting in less lymph fluid trapped in the patient's tissues resulting in less pain. Additionally, PP3.1 could raise the patient's threshold for pain by insertion of lipids into cell membranes, disrupting multimerization of pain receptors which is required for pain signaling. The long-term fraction (the loaded biosilicate nanoparticles) was found to be effective reducing swelling and pain. Additionally, since the patient did not experience a recurrence of pain, inflammation or swelling (as would be expected within 4-6 hours after taking traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatories), this is evidence that the FDGE loaded diatom nanoparticles are effective for extended release of bioactive compounds. One application of PP3.1 was sufficient to provide relief.</p><heading id="h-0067" level="1">Example 11</heading><heading id="h-0068" level="1">Wound Healing Properties of PP3.1</heading><p id="p-0285" num="0349">A patient had idiopathic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities and was mostly without sensation from his knees down, and thus did not notice for over a month that he had developed a slowly spreading infection due to poor wound healing. Approximately 1-month post-injury he was seen in Urgent Care and prescribed an oral antibiotic (cephalexin) which failed to control the skin infection; he was then given oral Bactrim as a replacement however this also failed to control the cellulitis. Thus, he was hospitalized and received an IV antibiotic (clindamycin) overnight and then was discharged home on oral clindamycin. A few days later this was switched to oral linezolid, when it became apparent that his wound persisted without healing. He remained on linezolid for 3 weeks, and while MRI showed that the infection had not spread to his bone, the wound persisted.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0350">The patient then showed his wound, which had not healed in the past four months, to a family medicine practitioner. The family medicine practitioner applied 3 drops of PP3.1 to the wound and covered up the patient's leg.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0351">Twenty-four hours later, examination of the wound showed decreased edema, however some erythema and warmth near the wound site with some mild fluctuance underneath was noted. The Infectious Disease specialist who had been managing the patient's care was consulted and was told that observation without further antibiotic intervention was appropriate. Desiring a more rapid healing response and noting the continued presence of infection in the wound, the family practitioner applied Antimicrobial Blend 1 formulation made in accordance with the present invention.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0352">Antimicrobial Blend 1, or AB1 which was previously made by the inventor to protect against colds/flu was admixed with PP3.1 in a 1:1 ratio and spread in a thin layer over the patient's anterior right calf, and thickly over the wound site. A blow dryer was used diffusely for several minutes over the areas where the mixture was applied, to gently increase circulation.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0353">Shortly after the application with heat, the wound skin began to change and turn mildly erythematous. Multiple tiny blebs measuring 2-3 mm formed, filled with a clear yellow serous fluid. These resolved within minutes to hours while the lesion itself began to coalesce. The patient noted that the heat helped so he spent the day sitting outside under the sun with his wound exposed to sunshine. The brawny changes of vascular insufficiency began dissipating within a few minutes of application+heat. The change was most noticeable 6 hours later.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0354">After 6 hours, the edema dissipated, the patient's leg shrunk by at least about 30-40%, his wound had partly closed, and the brawny changes of venous insufficiency that had been there for decades were noticeably improved. When each application had fully absorbed into the skin, the patient would thickly apply a fresh round of AB1+PP3.1 and use the blow dryer or sunshine to improve absorption.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0355">It shall be noted that this wound had not healed in 4 months, but when provided a combination of appropriate nutrients and bioactive ingredients the immune system and stem cells responded rapidly and appropriately. By the end of 9 hours his 3+ pitting edema of bilateral lower extremities had completely resolved. His brawny discoloration had minimized to the point of looking like a tan, and his wound had further shrunk in size to a small scab. His legs were more comfortable due to the resolved edema, he walked better, and he noted slightly improved sensation in both feet and lower legs. He stated that his balance had improved and that he felt steadier on his feet. In the past two decades with the progression of the peripheral neuropathy, the patient had gradually lost the hair on his anterior shins starting from the ankles and progressing upwards towards his knees. After several weeks of daily application of AB1+PP3.1, the patient noted regrowth of hair that began near his knees and progressed downwards towards his ankles.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0356">The patient also noted that previously he was unable to wear his moccasin house slippers as his ankles and feet were so swollen that he would struggle to fit his feet into his slippers. 9 hours after initial treatment the patient's ankles were normal in size and shape such that his slippers were actually loose, with a large gap causing the moccasins to fall off his foot, which he had never experienced before.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0357">It was concluded that AB1+PP3.1 in a 1:1 ratio may be used in wound care to help non-healing wounds to close rapidly, to improve edema and to improve regrowth of hair. However due to the strong smell and concentration of AB1 care will need to be used when applying the mixture on the face or near mucus membranes. It is important to note that a patient must first be patch-tested for allergies to the mixture, which should not be applied to broken skin.</p><heading id="h-0069" level="1">Example 12</heading><heading id="h-0070" level="1">Antimicrobial Blend (AB1)</heading><p id="p-0294" num="0358">To 500 ml Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil add:</p><p id="p-0295" num="0359">30 ml Clove essential oil (<i>Eugenia caryophyllus</i>)</p><p id="p-0296" num="0360">30 ml Cinnamon essential oil (<i>Cinnamonum cassia</i>)</p><p id="p-0297" num="0361">30 ml Rosemary essential oil (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>)</p><p id="p-0298" num="0362">30 ml Eucalyptus essential oil (<i>Eucalyptus globulus</i>)</p><p id="p-0299" num="0363">30 ml Lemon essential oil (<i>Citrus limon</i>)</p><p id="p-0300" num="0364">10 ml Ravintsara essential oil (<i>Cinnamomum camphora</i>)</p><p id="p-0301" num="0365">5 ml Cinnamon Leaf essential oil (<i>Cinnamomum vera</i>)</p><p id="p-0302" num="0366">Mix all ingredients well.

For example, the rapidly dissolving capsules would be most useful for healing peptic ulcers of the most proximal parts of the gastrointestinal tract such as the stomach; the intermediate release would be best for healing duodenal ulcers, delayed release would be best for healing jejunal or ileal lesions, and extended delay release best for healing diseases of the colon and rectum such as in Ulcerative Colitis. Crohn's Disease affects any part of the GI tract and will require treatment with all four types of gel capsules. Suppositories of this formula can also be made to treat internal hemorrhoids and can be applied topically to external hemorrhoids. This formulation should help stimulate regeneration of the mucosal lining.</li>        <li id="ul0060-0007" num="0495">7. Case report: A patient had been bedridden for 2 decades with Ulcerative Colitis due to severe abdominal pain and diarrhea up to 15 times daily despite state-of-the-art treatment with mesalamine, biologics and steroids. He could only get up to use the bathroom. A family medicine practitioner advised him to take 1 g of emu oil daily, and to increase by 1 g per week until symptoms resolved, or side effects were encountered (at which point he should revert to dose that did not produce side effects). The patient took the emu oil as advised and within 1 week reported decreased abdominal pain, less frequent diarrhea to only 1-2 times daily, and that he was now able to participate in activities of daily living such as driving, shopping and running errands. He increased up to 2 g daily and was able to wean off prescription medications and eventually stopped taking the emu oil capsules.</li>        <li id="ul0060-0008" num="0496">8. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is an important component of the mucosa of the GI tract and acts as a surfactant within the mucus to create a barrier which protects against erosion and microbial invasion. PC is critically reduced in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease, which includes Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis (Parian et al Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Integrative Medicine Fourth Edition, 2018). For this reason, lecithin was incorporated into the formula to replenish PC in this patient population. The chamomile mixture combined with the emu oil will further stimulate mucosal stem cells to regenerate and repair ulcerated and inflamed tissues while reducing inflammation, and the macadamia and coconut oils will provide essential components of the cell membrane to repair a new gut lining.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0337" num="0497">The formulation may be taken internally.</p><heading id="h-0112" level="1">Example 34</heading><heading id="h-0113" level="1">Insomnia Nasal Spray (INS1)</heading><p id="p-0338" num="0498">INS1 is a formulation for treating insomnia, anxiety, and improve metabolism of fat.
