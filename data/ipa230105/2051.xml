Specifically, this disclosure relates to systems and methods for automatically releasing a payload when a force is applied to a release mechanism.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Aerial vehicles, including but not limited to unmanned aerial vehicles such as drones, may be used to transport payloads to remote locations. For example, in rescue scenarios, it may be desirable to use an aerial vehicle to deliver a life vest or floatation device, a first aid kid, or other package to a person in need. In other cases, it may be desirable to deliver a payload, such as a delivery package, to a person or other delivery target. In still other cases, it may be desirable to deliver a payload, such as a sensor or antenna, in a remote location. For example, following natural disasters, workers may wish to deploy communications relays, cameras, or other sensors in locations that are dangerous or difficult to reach with human personnel.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Current payload delivery systems for small aerial vehicles generally involve mechanisms actuated by motors. In these systems, release of the payload is typically controlled by the operator of the vehicle, who activates the release mechanism. This makes the system less suitable for many applications. For example, in a water rescue scenario, a person who is being rescued should be able to grab the rescue package and cause it to be released, without requiring any action by the operator. Otherwise, there may be discoordination between the operator and the person being rescued, which may cause the payload to be released out of reach or the delivery vehicle to be pulled in to the water. There are many other applications where initiating release based on an external force being applied at a delivery location is desirable. For example, in a disaster scenario, an operator may wish to attach a payload to a specific structure. In systems where the operator must initiate a release mechanism, it is easy for the payload to miss its target. Conversely, if the payload releases automatically when the payload engages the target (e.g., via a magnet), successful deployment at the target can be assured.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there is a need for systems and methods that can deliver payloads in a way that is simple, reliable, and cost-effective. Further, there is a need for delivery systems and methods which can enable automated release upon engagement with a delivery target.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following description presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview of the claimed subject matter. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the claimed subject matter nor delineate the scope thereof.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, a system for delivering a payload may be provided. The system may include a tether being configured to support a payload, a release wire arranged such that it does not support the weight of the payload when the payload is supported by the tether, and a coupling configured to releasably couple the tether to a delivery vehicle. In some embodiments, the system may have a first state and a second state. In the first state, the release wire may be in a first position, and a portion of the coupling may extend through an opening in the tether and engage the release wire such that the release wire in the first position holds the coupling in place and maintains the system in the first state. In the second state, the release wire may be in a second position in which the release wire does not engage the portion of the coupling, and the portion of the coupling may be configured to pass freely through the opening in the tether. The system may be configured such that, when the system is in the first state, moving the release wire from the first position to the second position may cause the system to transition from the first state to the second state. The system may be further configured such that, when the tether is coupled to a delivery vehicle by the coupling, transitioning the system from the first state to the second state may cause the tether to become released from the delivery vehicle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, a method for delivering a payload may be provided. The method may include attaching a payload to a tether, wrapping a coupling around a portion of a delivery vehicle or an object secured to the delivery vehicle, the coupling being attached to the tether and configured to releasably couple the tether to the delivery vehicle, extending a portion of the coupling through an opening in a tether, and passing a release wire through the portion of the coupling, thereby securing the coupling in a first state in which the portion of the coupling extends through the opening in the tether and engages the release wire. In some embodiments, the release wire and the coupling may be arranged such that removing the release wire from the portion of the coupling causes the coupling to transition to a second state in which the portion of the coupling may pass freely through the opening, thereby releasing the tether from the delivery vehicle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further variations encompassed within the systems and methods are described in the detailed description of the invention below.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated herein and form part of the specification, illustrate various, non-limiting embodiments of the present invention.

The system <b>100</b> may include a tether <b>101</b>, a release wire <b>104</b>, and a coupling <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the coupling <b>110</b> may be a loop of material, such as fiber, rope, or polymer. The coupling <b>110</b> may be attached to the tether by any suitable mechanism. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, a portion of the tether <b>101</b> is doubled back to form a slot <b>114</b> through which the coupling <b>110</b> extends.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the coupling <b>110</b> may be configured to extend, at least in part, through an opening <b>112</b> in the tether. In some embodiments, the release wire <b>104</b> may include an engagement portion <b>106</b>, which may be configured to engage a portion of the coupling <b>110</b> that passes through the opening <b>112</b>. For example, the engagement portion <b>106</b> may be extend at an angle or be curved or hook-shaped, such that, when a portion of the coupling <b>110</b> extends through the opening <b>112</b> and engages the engagement portion <b>106</b>, the portion of the coupling <b>110</b> will not readily disengage the engagement portion <b>106</b> unless the release wire <b>104</b> is withdrawn (as described below with respect to, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B and <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>). The release wire <b>104</b> may include or be attached to a handle <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the handle <b>116</b> and the engagement portion <b>106</b> may be disposed at opposite ends of the release wire <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, a portion of the release wire <b>104</b> may be looped back and fastened with a fastener <b>118</b> to form the handle <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the release wire <b>104</b> may extend through a channel defined in the tether <b>101</b>. In some embodiments, the release wire <b>104</b> may be configured to move independently from the tether <b>101</b>. For example, the release wire <b>104</b> may be arranged to slide axially within the channel relative to the tether <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the system may include a payload attachment portion <b>120</b>. The payload attachment portion <b>120</b> may be configured to allow payloads to be securely attached to the system <b>100</b> by fastening the payload to the payload attachment portion <b>120</b>. Any suitable attachment mechanism may be used. For example, a payload may be attached using a fastener, such as a clasp or carabiner. In some embodiments, the attachment portion may be a length of material that is attached to the tether to form a closed loop to which attachment mechanisms may be coupled.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an exploded view of the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. This view shows that an exemplary tether <b>101</b> may include a first tether portion <b>102</b> and a second tether portion <b>103</b>, which may be attached to one-another to form a channel through which the release wire <b>104</b> may extend. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a bearing <b>113</b> may be placed within opening <b>112</b>. This may advantageously reduce wear on the portion of the tether <b>101</b> surrounding the opening <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, the handle <b>116</b> may include a cover <b>117</b>, which may be made from a material suitable for being gripped by a human hand.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrate a transition of the system <b>100</b> from a first state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) to a second state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, when the system <b>100</b> is in the first state, the release wire <b>104</b> may be in a first position, and a portion of the coupling <b>110</b> may extend through the opening <b>112</b> in the tether and engage the release wire <b>104</b>. The release wire <b>104</b> may hold the coupling <b>110</b> in place and thus maintain the system in the first state.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, when the system <b>100</b> is in the second state, the release wire <b>104</b> may be in a second position in which the release wire <b>104</b> does not engage the portion of the coupling <b>110</b>.

For example, when the system is in the first state, a tension force may be applied to the tether <b>101</b>, for example, by pulling the handle <b>116</b>, which may cause the release wire <b>104</b> to move relative to the tether in direction D. As a result, the release wire <b>104</b> may move from the first position to the second position, thus disengaging the coupling <b>110</b> and causing the system to transition from the first state to the second state. In some embodiments, the system may be attached to a delivery vehicle by wrapping the coupling <b>110</b> around a portion of the delivery vehicle or an object affixed thereto. In some embodiments, transitioning the system from the first state to the second state may release the coupling <b>110</b> from the delivery vehicle, thus releasing the system <b>100</b> and an accompanying payload from the delivery vehicle.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an exemplary arrangement for attaching the system <b>100</b> to a delivery vehicle <b>300</b>.

In some embodiments, the handle <b>316</b> may include a cover <b>317</b>, which may be made from a material suitable for being gripped by a human hand.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref> illustrate a transition of the system <b>300</b> from a first state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>) to a second state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, when the system <b>300</b> is in the first state, the release wire <b>304</b> may be in a first position, and a portion of the coupling <b>310</b> may extend through the opening <b>312</b> in the tether and engage the release wire <b>304</b>. The release wire <b>304</b> may hold the coupling <b>310</b> in place and thus maintain the system in the first state.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, when the system <b>300</b> is in the second state, the release wire <b>304</b> may be in a second position in which the release wire <b>304</b> does not engage the portion of the coupling <b>310</b>. In the second state, the portion of the coupling <b>310</b> may pass freely through the opening <b>312</b> in the tether <b>301</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the system <b>301</b> may be transitioned from the first state to the second state by moving the release wire <b>304</b> from the first position to the second position. For example, when the system is in the first state, a tension force may be applied to the tether <b>301</b>, for example, by pulling the handle <b>316</b>. Applying a tension force to the tether <b>301</b> may cause the elastic portion to expand, such that a distance between the first tether portion <b>307</b> and the second tether portion <b>302</b>, <b>303</b> is increased. As a result, the release wire <b>304</b> may be moved relative to the first tether portion <b>307</b> from the first position to the second portion, and the release wire <b>304</b> may be caused to disengage from the coupling. The system may thereby transition from the first state to the second state. As described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, and <b>4</b></figref>, this may cause the system <b>301</b> to be released from a delivery vehicle.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Although the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>7</b></figref> show handle mechanisms for applying tension to the tethers, any suitable mechanism may be used. Handles may be desirable where a person is available at the target location, such that the person may grasp the handle and actuate a release mechanism. In other cases, magnets, hooks, or other mechanisms may be used to engage an object at a target location. Once the object is engaged, the delivery vehicle may pull away from the object, thereby generating a tension force on the tether, which may actuate the release mechanism. Using magnets, hooks, and other engagement mechanisms may be desirable in disaster scenarios, such as hurricanes or nuclear meltdowns, where humans may not be available at the target location to initiate release of the payload.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an exemplary method <b>800</b> for delivering a payload. In step <b>802</b>, a payload may be attached to a tether. For example, a payload (e.g., a floatation device, a first aid or medical kit, a package containing food or goods, a communication device, or any other object that may need to be delivered) may be attached to an attachment portion of the tether. The attachment may be made by any suitable mechanism, such as by tying or clasping the payload using, e.g., a carabiner. In step <b>804</b>, a coupling may be wrapped around a portion of a delivery vehicle or an object secured to the delivery vehicle. An exemplary arrangement for wrapping a coupling around a portion of a delivery vehicle or an object secured thereto is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The coupling may be attached to the tether and configured to releasably couple the tether to the delivery vehicle. In some embodiments, the delivery vehicle may be an aerial vehicle. In some embodiments, the delivery vehicle may be an unmanned aerial vehicle.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In step <b>806</b>, a release wire may be passed through the portion of the coupling, thereby securing the coupling in a first state in which the portion of the coupling extends through the opening in the tether and engages the release wire. Upon completing step <b>808</b>, the release wire and the coupling may be arranged such that removing the release wire from the portion of the coupling will cause the coupling to transition to a second state in which the portion of the coupling may pass freely through the opening. As discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B and <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>, this may cause the tether to be released from the delivery vehicle. In some embodiments, method <b>800</b> may include step <b>810</b>, in which the release wire may be released from the portion of the coupling, thereby causing the coupling to transition to the second state in which the portion of the coupling may pass freely through the opening, and the tether may be released from the delivery vehicle.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref>, moving the release wire from the first position to the second position may include moving the release wire relative to the tether, such as by sliding the release wire through a channel defined in the tether.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>, the tether may include a first portion to which the coupling is affixed, a second portion to which the release wire is affixed, and an elastic portion between the first portion and second portion. In some embodiments, optional step <b>810</b> may include applying a tension force to the tether, thereby causing the elastic portion to expand and the release wire to disengage from the coupling. This may result in the coupling transitioning from the first state to the second state, and the tether becoming released from the delivery vehicle.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">While the subject matter of this disclosure has been described and shown in considerable detail with reference to certain illustrative embodiments, including various combinations and sub-combinations of features, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate other embodiments and variations and modifications thereof as encompassed within the scope of the present disclosure.
