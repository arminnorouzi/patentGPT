FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure relates to an electronic component, which is formed by a semiconductor component or a semiconductor-like structure having gate electrode assemblies, for initializing the quantum mechanical state of a qubit. The disclosure further relates to a method for such an electronic component.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventional computers use semiconductor components with integrated circuits. These circuits always work with systems which are based on a logical &#x201c;0&#x201d; or &#x201c;1&#x201d;&#x2014;i.e. the switch is &#x201c;on&#x201d; or &#x201c;off&#x201d;. In semiconductor memories, this is realized in that the potential is either above or below a threshold value. These two states form the smallest unit in computers and are referred to as &#x201c;bits&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">These semiconductor components often consist of doped silicon elements in order to realize the circuits. For example, transistor circuits can be arranged in such semiconductor components and linked to form a logic circuit. Through continuously improving chemical and physical manufacturing processes, these semiconductor components can now be produced with increasingly extreme compactness. However, this compactness has reached its physical limits. The density of the circuits as well as the temperature often leads to problems in such semiconductor components. In this manner optimizations in particular can be achieved through several layer models, higher switching speeds, or the selection of the semiconductor material. Nevertheless, the computing power is often insufficient for many applications, e.g. in cryptographic technology or when calculating weather or climate models, due to the enormous amounts of data.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To significantly increase computing power, models for so-called quantum computers have long been known. For a variety of reasons, though, it has not yet been technically possible to implement them. The models of quantum computers are designed to exploit the quantum mechanical states of particles such as electrons. A quantum mechanical system with two states as the smallest unit for storing information is referred to as a &#x201c;qubit&#x201d;. A qubit is defined, for example, by its quantum mechanical spin state, which can be &#x201c;up&#x201d; or &#x201c;down&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The principle of electron spin qubits is always the same, regardless of the material system selected. A semiconductor heterostructure serves as the substrate in this case. The semiconductor heterostructure comprises a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Semiconductor heterostructures are monocrystalline layers of semiconductors with different compositions grown on top of each other. These layer structures provide numerous technically relevant quantization effects in terms of their electronic and optical properties. For this reason, they are particularly suitable for use in the production of microelectronic components. The most important combination of materials at the present time for the production of semiconductor heterostructures is the GaAs/AlGaAs system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Semiconductor heterostructures form so-called quantum films at the interfaces between different materials. These arise in particular because of the different energy levels in the two materials. The defined energy distribution resulting therefrom causes charge carriers from the surrounding area to collect in the quantum film. Their freedom of movement is largely restricted to the layer in the film, and they form the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A nanoscopic material structure is referred to as a quantum dot. Semiconductor materials are particularly suitable for this. The mobility of the charge carriers, both electrons and holes, is so restricted in a quantum dot that their energy can no longer assume continuous values, and can thus only assume discrete values. Using nanoscale gate electrodes (also referred to as gates), which are applied to the surface of the component, the potential landscape within the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is shaped in such a manner that individual electrons can be captured in the quantum dots. The spins of these electrons then serve as the basis for the formation of a logical qubit.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Electronic states can be split with regard to their spin state by means of an external magnetic field (Zeeman effect) and thus addressed separately. The spins of these electrons then serve as the basis of eigenstates for the purpose of forming a logical qubit. Furthermore, superimposed states of these two eigenstates can also be realized due to quantum mechanical effects.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">US 2017/0317203 A1 discloses a quantum dot device comprising at least three conductive layers and at least two insulating layers. The three conductive layers are electrically insulated from one another. It is described there that one conductive layer is composed of a different material than the other two conductive layers. The conductive layers can include or be composed entirely of aluminum, gold, copper, or polysilicon, for example. The insulating layers, on the other hand, are composed of silicon oxide, silicon nitride, and/or aluminum oxide, for example. The connections between the conductive layers and the insulating layers can cause, inter alia, individual electrons to be shuttled through quantum dots of the device using voltage pulses.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this quantum dot device, an electron is confined in a potential well. Through quantum mechanical tunneling, an electron is moved from quantum dot to quantum dot. This can lead to inaccuracies or falsifications of the information regarding the quantum mechanical state when an electron moves over longer distances.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">WO 2017/020095 A1 discloses a scalable architecture for a processing device for performing quantum processing. The architecture is based on full-silicon CMOS fabrication technology. Transistor-based control circuits are used together with floating gates to operate a two-dimensional array of qubits. The qubits are defined by the spin states of a single electron, which is trapped in a quantum dot. A higher level is described here, meaning how individual qubits can be electrically driven, for example via transistors, etc., including qubit operation and readout. Although reference is made to a &#x201c;scalable architecture&#x201d;, the array shown does not allow any real scaling, meaning inter alia integration of cryogenic electronics, since no space can be created between the qubits.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">U.S. Pat. No. 8,164,082 B2 describes a spin bus quantum computer architecture comprising a spin bus comprising of a plurality of strongly coupled and always on qubits defining a string of spin qubits. A plurality of information-bearing qubits are arranged adjacent to a qubit of the spin bus. Electrodes are formed to the information-bearing qubits and the spin bus qubits to allow control of the establishment and breaking of coupling between qubits in order to allow control of the establishment and breaking of coupling between each information-bearing qubit and the spin bus qubit adjacent to it. The spin bus architecture allows rapid and reliable long-range coupling of qubits.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">EP 3 016 035 B1 describes a processing apparatus and methods to operate the same, and particularly, but not exclusively, the invention relates to a quantum processing apparatus which is controllable to perform adiabatic quantum computations.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A quantum processor has the following features: a plurality of qubit elements and a control structure comprising a plurality of control members, wherein each control member is arranged such that it can control a plurality of qubit elements. The control structure is controllable to perform quantum computation using the qubit elements, wherein a quantum state of the qubit elements is encoded in the nuclear or electron spin of one or more donor atoms. The donor atoms are arranged in a plane embedded in a semiconducting structure. A first set of donor atoms is arranged to encode quantum information related to the quantum computation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A second set of donor atoms is arranged to facilitate electromagnetic coupling between one or more of the first set of donor atoms. The donor atoms of the first set are arranged in a two-dimensional matrix arrangement. The plurality of control members comprises a first set of elongated control members arranged in a first plane above the plane comprising the donor atoms. A second set of elongated control members are provided which are arranged in a second plane below the plane comprising the donor atoms.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">To implement a universal quantum computer, it must be possible to couple the qubits over distances of at least a few micrometers, in particular to create space for local control electronics. Structures and structural elements must be provided which allow a quantum dot to be transported to different targets in order to be able to construct logic circuits. There are already approaches in the state of the art in which one or two-dimensional arrays were built from separate quantum dots, through which electrons can then be transported. Due to the very large number of gate electrodes required and corresponding voltages to be set, coupling over several micrometers is impossible to implement or can only be implemented with significant effort using this approach.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">While operations on individual qubits can already be checked and evaluated to a satisfactory extent, the ability to connect qubits to form logic circuits is possibly the main problem still to be solved in order to realize a universal quantum computer. Definable quantum mechanical states must be present in order to realize such logic circuits.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">An object of the disclosure is to eliminate the disadvantages of the prior art and to provide an electronic component which allows logic circuits to be realized with quantum dots, whereby the quantum mechanical state is intended to be produced to initialize, for example, a qubit.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The object is achieved by the electronic component for initializing the quantum mechanical state of a qubit of the type mentioned at the outset, comprising<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0020">a) a substrate with a two-dimensional electron gas or electron hole gas;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0021">b) electrical contacts for connecting the gate electrode assemblies to voltage sources;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0022">c) a gate electrode assembly having gate electrodes, which is arranged on a surface of the electronic component, for producing a potential well in the substrate;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0023">d) a reservoir, which is provided as a donor of charge carriers;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0024">e) the gate electrodes of the gate electrode assemblies having parallel electrode fingers, whereby        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0025">i. the gate electrodes of a first gate electrode assembly in the substrate form a static potential well in which quantum dots are introduced from the reservoir;</li>            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0026">ii. the gate electrodes of a second gate electrode assembly form a movable potential well in the substrate, wherein a charge carrier with its quantum mechanical state can be transported with this potential well;</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0027">f) means for transferring two quantum dots from the reservoir into the static potential well;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0028">g) a stimulator for orienting or splitting the quantum dots;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0029">h) means for transferring a charge carrier from the static potential well into the movable potential well.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0021" num="0030">The object is further achieved by a method for such an electronic component having the following method steps:<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0031">a) introduction of two charge carriers from the reservoir into the static potential well;</li>        <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0032">b) bring the movable potential well towards the static potential well;</li>        <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0033">c) exchange between the static potential well and the movable potential well so that a charge carrier is located in the movable potential well;</li>        <li id="ul0005-0004" num="0034">d) defined orientation of the quantum dots in the static potential well and the movable potential well by means of the stimulator;</li>        <li id="ul0005-0005" num="0035">e) moving the movable potential well away.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0022" num="0036">The disclosure is based in principle on the physical Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that an electron level can never be occupied by electrons with the same spin. By means of the gate electrodes, a static potential well is now generated on the one hand and, on the other hand, a movable potential well. A pair of charge carriers from the reservoir and with the same energy level is introduced into the static potential well. The pair of charge carriers is subsequently split. The one quantum dot is transferred into the movable potential well. The quantum mechanical state of the quantum dots is oriented in a defined manner by the stimulator to the level, which in the case of an electron is the spin. The quantum dot having the known quantum mechanical state in the movable potential well can now be transported away, for example as an initialized qubit, with the movable potential well.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0037">In order to guide the quantum dot with the movable potential well to the static potential well, the quantum dot must be transported through the substrate over a longer distance without changing the quantum mechanical state. For this purpose, the quantum dot is confined in the potential well, which is generated in a suitable manner by the gate electrode assembly. The potential well then moves continuously and in a directed manner through the substrate and carries the quantum dot with its quantum mechanical state over the distance. To enable continuous movement of the potential well, the electrode fingers of the gate electrodes are connected accordingly.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0038">In an advantageous embodiment of the electronic component, the stimulator is designed as a magnet, which generates a gradient magnetic field for initializing the quantum dots in the static potential well. The quantum dots of an energy level are oriented in a defined manner depending on the orientation of the magnetic field. In the often small structures of this component, micro-magnets, which can be integrated easily into the semiconductor component, can preferably be used. The gradient magnetic field therefore serves to initialize the quantum dots in the static potential well. An oscillating magnetic field can also be used as a gradient magnetic field. These gradient magnetic fields place the quantum dot in a desired quantum mechanical state. The electronic component can thus be initialized so that it is then able to interact with the quantum dot introduced into the same level.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0039">In a further advantageous embodiment of the electronic component, the gate electrodes of the first gate electrode assembly form a static double potential well, wherein means for transporting a quantum dot from the one static potential well into the next static potential well of the static double potential well are provided. Each of the static potential wells thus has a quantum dot with different quantum mechanical states of the same level. The defined orientation of the states is in turn determined by the stimulator. In this case, each of the potential wells is occupied by known quantum mechanical states, which in the case of electrons are the spins. One of the quantum dots held in the double potential well exchanges with the quantum dot of the moved potential well. As a result, the moved quantum dot obtains a defined quantum mechanical state.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0040">In a corresponding advantageous embodiment of the method for such an electronic component, the static potential well is formed as a double potential well in a further step. Each of the two static potential wells of the double potential well is then occupied by charge carriers having different, known quantum mechanical states. The movable potential well is now moved towards the static double potential well. A charge carrier is exchanged between a static potential well and the movable potential well. The movable potential well with the quantum dot can then be guided away. The movable potential well therefore contains a quantum dot whose quantum mechanical state is known and which can then be used to initialize a qubit, for example.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0041">In a preferred embodiment of the electronic component, a gate electrode assembly comprises two parallel gate electrodes, which form a channel-like structure. This measure serves to ensure that the potential well can only move along a certain path in the substrate.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0042">In an advantageous embodiment of such an electronic component, the substrate comprises gallium arsenide (GaAs) and/or silicon germanium (SiGe). These materials are able to form a two-dimensional electron gas in which quantum dots can be generated, held, and moved. In the case of gallium arsenide, the quantum dots are occupied by electrons. In the case of silicon germanium, the quantum dots are occupied by holes that are missing an electron.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0043">In a further preferred embodiment of the electronic component, the respectively interconnected gate electrodes for the moved potential well are configured such that a periodic and/or phase-shifted voltage can be applied to them. This measure enables the potential well to be guided continuously through the substrate. A quantum dot located in the potential well can thus be transported through the substrate with the potential well while retaining its original quantum mechanical state.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0044">In a preferred embodiment of the electronic component, at least every third electrode finger of a gate electrode for the movable potential well is connected together. This is intended to ensure that the potential well is always guaranteed over at least one period through which the potential well is moved. Only in this way is it possible to ensure continuous movement of the potential well with the quantum dot. In principle, other combinations are also possible when interconnecting gate electrodes, as long as the potential well can be moved together with the quantum dot. Correspondingly, an advantageous embodiment for the method for an electronic component is obtained in that at least every third gate electrode is connected together and a voltage is applied periodically to the interconnected gate electrodes.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0045">In a further advantageous embodiment of the electronic component, means of connection are provided for connecting to a qubit of a quantum computer. Transporting the states of quantum dots over greater distances is particularly suitable for quantum computers. In quantum computers, it is necessary to connect qubits to one another. For this reason, the electronic component must provide contacts to connect at least two qubits to one another in order to transfer the quantum states of the quantum dots from one qubit to another qubit.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0046">Further embodiments and advantages will become apparent from the subject matter of the subclaims and the drawings with the accompanying descriptions.
