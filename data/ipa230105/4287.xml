The execution screen for schedule registration may include an input field for inputting a variety of information related to the schedule (e.g., schedule title, date, time, period, location, and/or detailed description). According to an embodiment, in the input field, the type of data to be input (e.g., text and/or numbers {date, time}) may be predetermined. According to an embodiment, when the application is installed in the electronic device <b>101</b>, data related to the execution screen of the application may be stored and recorded in the memory <b>130</b>.

For example, when the user selects the object included in the input list, the processor <b>120</b> may identify the input field corresponding to the selected object and the type of data to be input to the identified input field (e.g., date, time, account, and notification). The processor <b>120</b> may generate the key input interface based on the type of data. For example, the processor <b>120</b> may generate a date input interface configured to facilitate date selection when a date input is required, and may generate a time input interface configured to facilitate time selection when a time input is required. When an account input is required, the processor <b>120</b> may generate an account input interface in which at least one previously input account is configured in a list form. The date input interface may be implemented so that the user can select the year/month/day within a configured range, and the time input interface may be implemented so that the user can select the hour/minute within a configured range (e.g., 1 hour to 24 hours). As another example, when the user uses the electronic pen, the processor <b>120</b> may generate a board-type key input interface for inputting the electronic pen. According to an embodiment, the processor <b>120</b> may identify the type of data to be input into the input field (e.g., date, time, account, or notification), and may generate the input interface (e.g., a date input interface, a time input interface, an account input interface, or a notification input interface).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In operation <b>309</b>, the processor <b>120</b> may display a user interface including the application execution screen, the input list, and the key input interface.
