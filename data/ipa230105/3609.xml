In the method for investigating structural performance of a railway bridge according to JP-B-6543863, a theoretical analysis model of dynamic response of a railway bridge during traveling of a train is formulated using a train as a moving load train and a bridge as a simple beam, acceleration of the bridge during traveling of the railway train is measured, and unknown parameters of the theoretical analysis model are estimated from this acceleration data by a reverse analysis method.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">JP-B-6467304 discloses a method for obtaining an impact coefficient (dynamic response component) of a bridge by using a vehicle vertical acceleration response of a traveling train particularly when the traveling train passes through the bridge.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a case where a formation moving object formed with one or more moving objects, such as a railway train, moves on a structure such as a bridge.

The RC is an abbreviation for reinforced-concrete. In the present embodiment, the bridge <b>5</b> is a structure to which Bridge Weigh In Motion (BWIM) is applicable. The BWIM is a technology in which a bridge is regarded as a &#x201c;scale&#x201d;, deformation of the bridge is measured, and thereby a weight and the number of axles of a moving object passing through the bridge is measured. The bridge, which enables analysis of the weight of the moving object traveling on the bridge, based on a response such as deformation or strain of the bridge, is considered to be a structure to which BWIM is applicable. Therefore, the BWIM system, which applies a physical process between an action on the bridge and the response, enables the measurement of the weight of the moving object that travels on the bridge. The weight of the moving object is measured by measuring a correlation coefficient between the displacement and a load in advance, and using the correlation coefficient to derive the load of the moving object passing through from the measurement result of the displacement of the bridge when the moving object passes through.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The bridge <b>5</b> includes the superstructure <b>7</b> that is a portion where the moving object moves, and a substructure <b>8</b> that supports the superstructure <b>7</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the superstructure <b>7</b> taken along a line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the bending moment generated in the bridge due to the load P is 0 at the entry end, increases proportionally as the position approaches the position to which the load P is applied from the entry end, and becomes a value represented by Equation (6) at the position to which the load P is applied. The bending moment generated in the bridge due to the load P decreases proportionally as the position approaches the exit end from the position to which the load P is applied, and becomes 0 at the exit end.
