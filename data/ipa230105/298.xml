In one embodiment, the apparatus is an upright surface cleaning apparatus and is optionally operable in a floor cleaning mode and an above floor cleaning mode.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following is not an admission that anything discussed below is part of the prior art or part of the common general knowledge of a person skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various types of surface cleaning apparatus are known including upright vacuum cleaners and extractors. Typically, an upright vacuum cleaner includes an upper section, including an air treatment member such as one or more cyclones and/or filters, drivingly mounted to a surface cleaning head. An up flow conduit is typically provided between the surface cleaning head and the upper section. In some such vacuum cleaners, a spine, casing or backbone extends between the surface cleaning head and the upper section for supporting the air treatment member. The suction motor may be provided in the upper section.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 7,188,388 (Best) discloses a multi-use vacuum cleaner with a detachable cyclonic vacuum module. The vacuum cleaner may be used as an upright vacuum cleaner when the detachable vacuum module is mounted to the base or the detachable vacuum module may be detached and used by itself. The detachable vacuum module includes a vacuum motor, a motor driven fan, a cyclonic dirt separator and a hose.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">US patent publication No. US 2015/0096143 (Conrad) discloses an upright vacuum cleaner with a removable hand vacuum cleaner. The upright vacuum cleaner may be used in different cleaning modes including use as an upright vacuum cleaner when the hand vacuum cleaner is mounted to the handle.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This summary is intended to introduce the reader to the more detailed description that follows and not to limit or define any claimed or as yet unclaimed invention. One or more inventions may reside in any combination or sub-combination of the elements or process steps disclosed in any part of this document including its claims and figures.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A surface cleaning apparatus, such as an upright surface vacuum cleaner, may be used to clean floors and other surfaces. When in use, it sometimes desirable to clean beneath furniture and other objects that are resting on the floor, such as beds, couches, tables and the like. Often, the space beneath the furniture (i.e. the distance between the floor and the lower surface of furniture) can be relatively narrow, and may be about 6-8 inches in some instances. Configuring a vacuum cleaner to help clean underneath such furniture, preferably using its primary surface cleaning head, may help users clean hard to access areas.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Optionally, a vacuum cleaner can be configured so that its surface cleaning head can fit underneath furniture, and can have a height that is less than the height beneath the furniture. Using such a configuration may allow the vacuum cleaner to extend under furniture up to the depth (front to back) of the surface cleaning head. However, the upper section will limit the extent to which the surface cleaning head can extend under furniture. For example, in Best, the surface cleaning head is not operable when the detachable cyclonic vacuum module has been removed from the upright section. Therefore, when the vacuum cleaner is used to clean under furniture, the extent to which the cleaning head may pass under furniture is limited by the height of the surface cleaning head (from the floor to the upper end of the surface cleaning head) and the depth (front to back) of the upright section.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In Conrad, in one mode, the hand vacuum cleaner may be removed from the handle but may remain in air flow communication with the surface cleaning head via a flexible hose. In this mode, the depth of the upright section (front to back) is reduced since the hand vacuum cleaner has been removed. Therefore, the extent to which the depth of the upright section inhibits cleaning under furniture is reduced. However, this design requires a user to remove and carry the hand vacuum cleaner</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with this disclosure, an upright surface cleaning apparatus, such as an upright vacuum cleaner, is configured so that the surface cleaning head and at least a portion, and optionally all, of the upright section of the vacuum cleaner is sized to fit beneath furniture having a lower surface positioned close to the floor, such as a bed or a couch. Preferably, the portion of the upright section that can fit underneath the furniture includes a cleaning unit provided on the upper section, which itself may include an air treatment member assembly and suction motor. Configuring the cleaning unit to fit beneath furniture while mounted to the upright section, and making it moveable into a suitable orientation/alignment so as to be moved beneath the furniture, allows part if not all of the upright section to be positioned beneath furniture such that the surface cleaning head may clean the entire floor that underlies furniture. Accordingly, a user may be able to extend a sufficient portion of the upright section of the vacuum cleaner beneath a couch such that the entire area under the couch can be cleaned without requiring the couch to be moved, or the use of secondary cleaning tools like wands and/or crevice tools.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">When the upright section is rotated rearwardly into an orientation suitable for low profile cleaning (i.e. beneath furniture), the upright section with the air treatment member may extend substantially horizontally from the surface cleaning head (i.e., the upright section may have been rotated rearwardly about 90&#xb0;). Therefore, if the upright section has a small depth in the forward/backward direction, then the upright section will have a relatively short height in the upward direction when oriented for low profile cleaning. In accordance with one aspect of this disclosure, the depth in the forward/backward direction is generally reduced and the width of the upright section in the left/right, lateral direction may be adjusted so as to be greater than the depth so as to provide a vacuum cleaner which has good dirt separation efficiency and suitable dirt storage capacity for use to clean a house. Optionally, the cleaning unit may have a generally rectangular, slab like configuration, such that it has a generally rectangular shape in a top plan view.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">To help reduce the depth of the upright section, components of the upright section of the surface cleaning apparatus may be at least partially, and optionally entirely, overlapped with each other. For example, portions of the air flow path may be positioned behind and/or beside portions of the air treatment member assembly. The suction motor may be positioned below, and may underlie at least portions of the air treatment member assembly (including for example, a cyclone chamber and/or a dirt collection chamber). Configuring the components vertically in this manner may help reduce the front/back depth of the cleaning unit. Positioning the suction motor below the air treatment member assembly may help lower the centre of gravity of the upright section, which may help maneuverability. Optionally, the air inlet of the suction motor may be substantially aligned with the air outlet of the air treatment member (such as a cyclone chamber), which may help reduce the overall size of the cleaning unit and/or the length and complexity of the air flow path therethrough.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Alternately, or in addition, to help reduce the depth of the upright section/cleaning unit of the surface cleaning apparatus, the amount of material/housings that are provided in front of or behind the operating components (such as the air treatment member assembly and/or the suction motor) may be reduced. For example, the cleaning unit (which may comprise one or more air treatment members and the suction motor) may not be provided with a surrounding support structure. Instead, the cleaning unit may itself be rotatably mounted to the surface cleaning head and may have the drive handle attached thereto.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Alternately, or in addition, the upright section may be configured such that the air treatment member assembly forms the front and/or rear face of the cleaning unit, and may extend almost the entire depth of the cleaning unit (and optionally the entire depth), such that the overall depth of the cleaning unit may be the depth of the air treatment member assembly. This may help provide an air treatment member assembly that has an acceptable size and dirt collection volume, while keeping the overall depth in an acceptable range. Similarly, the components may be sized such that the depth of the air treatment member assembly is not substantially greater than the depth (i.e. diameter if vertically oriented) of the suction motor, and vice versa. For example, the depth of the air treatment member assembly may be the same as the diameter of the suction motor &#xb1;2 inches. This may allow both components to be an acceptable size, while helping to keep the overall depth of the cleaning unit in an acceptable range.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">If the dirt collection region in the apparatus is external the air treatment member, e.g. a dirt collection chamber that is external a cyclone chamber, some and preferably all of the dirt collection region may be positioned laterally beside the cyclone chamber. Accordingly, the dirt collection region may not be positioned forward of the forward most part of the air treatment member and/or rearward of the rearward most part of the air treatment member, thereby reducing the depth of the cleaning unit. The dirt collection region can be located on only one side lateral of the air treatment member, or alternatively dirt collection regions (either discrete regions or portions of a common region) may be positioned on both lateral sides of the cyclone chamber. The volume of the portions of the dirt collection region that are laterally beside the cyclone chamber may be more than 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% of the total volume of the dirt collection region. Optionally, the dirt outlet on the cyclone chamber may be on a lateral side of the cyclone chamber, and be in communication with the laterally positioned dirt collection chamber.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Optionally, portions of the air flow path, including portions of the above floor cleaning assembly may be configured in a non-circular shape, and oriented so that their depth in the forward/rearward direction is less than their length or width. This may help reduce the overall depth of the apparatus while maintaining, and may help nest portions of the air flow path with other portions of the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Optionally, the apparatus may include additional filters in the air flow path between a dirty air inlet and a clean air outlet, including one or more pre-motor filter(s) and post-motor filter(s). The suction motor may be laterally centered in the cleaning unit, and a post-motor filter and clean air outlet may be provided on at least one, and optionally both of the lateral sides of the suction motor. If on both sides, the cleaning unit may include two clean air outlets, each preceded by a respective post-motor filter. Providing the post-motor filters and clean air outlets on the lateral sides of the suction motor, as opposed to forward or rearward of the suction motor, may help reduce the depth of the cleaning unit and upright section. Optionally, providing a post-motor filter below the suction motor as an alternative to the laterally positioned filters, or in addition thereto, may also help provide a desired amount of filtration while helping to control the overall depth.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, to help move the upright section of the vacuum cleaner beneath an object, at least a portion of the upright section, such as the cleaning unit, may be moveable so as to be oriented into a low profile, generally horizontal position&#x2014;such that the cleaning unit is substantially parallel to the floor being cleaned. That is, the vacuum cleaner may be configurable in a storage position (where the upright section is generally upright), an upright mode floor cleaning position (where the upright section is inclined rearwardly from the surface cleaning head) and a low profile floor cleaning mode (in which at least the cleaning unit portion of the upright section is parallel or at least substantially parallel to the surface being cleaned). This may help the cleaning unit to be moved beneath the object.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">To move the cleaning unit into the low profile cleaning position, the drive handle may be bendable or otherwise reconfigurable. This may allow a user to continue holding the same grip portion in the different modes, and may help reduce the need to lower the grip portion down to the floor by requiring a user to bend over. Instead, the grip portion may remain at a more comfortable position, while allowing the cleaning unit to be oriented horizontally. For example, the handle may include a pivot joint or other suitable mechanism, whereby an upper handle portion may be pivotal relative to the cleaning unit. The pivot joint can preferably be lockable, to help a user secure the handle in one or more of its possible positions.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">To help facilitate above floor cleaning, the surface cleaning apparatus may include an above floor cleaning assembly, which may optionally include a flexible hose and a generally rigid cleaning wand.

The following is a general discussion of this embodiment which provides a basis for understanding several of the features which are discussed herein. As discussed in detail subsequently, each of the features may be used in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0348">In the embodiment illustrated, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is an upright-style vacuum cleaner. Optionally, the surface cleaning apparatus incorporating some or all of the features described herein could alternatively be configured as another suitable type of surface cleaning apparatus, including, for example, an extractor, a stick vac, a wet-dry vacuum cleaner and the like.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0349">In this embodiment, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> includes an upright section <b>102</b> that is movably and drivingly connected to a surface cleaning head <b>104</b>, such that the upright section <b>102</b> is movable between an upright position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), such as for storage and optionally when in an above floor cleaning mode, and one or more inclined positions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>), such as for when the apparatus <b>100</b> is operated in a floor cleaning mode to clean floors or other such surfaces. Optionally, the apparatus <b>100</b> may be operable in an inclined, upright-style floor cleaning mode as well as a low profile floor cleaning mode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>), during which some or all of the upright section <b>102</b> may be maneuvered underneath relatively low objects, such as furniture.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0350">The surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> also includes at least one dirty air inlet <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), at least one clean air outlet <b>108</b> and an air flow path or passage extending therebetween. The air flow path may include any suitable combination of air flow conduits, chambers and the like, and may include rigid conduits, flexible conduits (such as hoses) and a combination of rigid and flexible conduits. Optionally, the air flow path may be at least partially reconfigurable, such that two or more dirty air inlets can be connected to the air flow path. In such configurations, the two or more dirty air inlets may be connected to the air flow path in parallel and accessible independently of each other (e.g., each may be used in different cleaning modes).</p><p id="p-0343" num="0351">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the upright section <b>102</b> has a cleaning unit <b>130</b> that includes at least one air treatment member assembly <b>110</b>, for removing dirt and/or debris from the air flow, and at least one suction motor <b>112</b>, for generating the vacuum air flow, are positioned in the air flow path, between the at least one dirty air inlet <b>106</b> and the at least one clean air outlet <b>108</b>. The air treatment member assembly <b>110</b> may be any suitable apparatus, and preferably includes an air treatment member <b>114</b> and a dirt collection region <b>116</b>, that may be either inside the air treatment member <b>114</b> or external the air treatment member <b>114</b> as illustrated. Some examples of air treatment members may include, for example, one or more cyclones, filters, and bags, and preferably the at least one air treatment member is provided upstream from the suction motor. The dirt collection region or regions are preferably exterior to and laterally spaced from the air treatment member. Preferably, the air treatment member <b>114</b> and/or dirt collection region <b>116</b> may be removable from the upright section <b>102</b> for emptying and/or maintenance (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>). The suction motor <b>112</b> may be housed in a motor housing portion <b>118</b>, which in the illustrated embodiment is located beneath the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b>. Optionally, the suction motor <b>112</b> may be positioned directly beneath the air treatment member <b>114</b>, such that the air treatment member <b>114</b> (or optionally only portions thereof) overlie at least a portion of the suction motor <b>112</b>, and preferably the entire suction motor <b>112</b> may be positioned directly beneath air treatment member <b>114</b>. This stacked arrangement may help reduce the overall size of the upright section.</p><p id="p-0344" num="0352">Optionally, one or more pre-motor filters <b>120</b> may be provided in the air flow path between the air treatment member <b>114</b> and the suction motor <b>112</b>, and/or one or more post-motor filters <b>122</b> may be provided in the air flow path downstream from the suction motor <b>112</b> and preferably upstream from the clean air outlet <b>108</b>. The pre-motor filter <b>120</b> and post-motor filter <b>122</b> may each be any suitable type of filter, including a physical, porous media type filter such as foam or felt, and optionally may include a HEPA filter.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0353">The apparatus <b>100</b> also includes a push handle <b>124</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that can be used by a user to drive and maneuver the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. The handle <b>124</b> may be of any suitable configuration, and in the illustrated embodiment includes an elongate extension member <b>126</b> that has a lower end <b>128</b> that may be connected to the cleaning unit <b>130</b>, a support for the cleaning unit or optionally to the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b>, and an upper end <b>132</b> that is spaced apart from the lower end along a handle axis <b>134</b>, which defines a drive axis of the apparatus <b>100</b> when in the upright floor cleaning mode. A hand grip portion <b>136</b> that can be grasped by the user may also be provided, and in the illustrated embodiment is located at the upper end <b>132</b> of the extension member <b>126</b> and forms the upper most portion of the handle <b>124</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). Optionally, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may be configured so that the upper most portion of the handle <b>124</b>, i.e. the handgrip portion <b>136</b>, is at a generally comfortable height <b>138</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) for an average user, and may be positioned between about 36-48, 40-48 or 42-48 inches above the ground when the apparatus <b>100</b> is in the upright position. Optionally, the handle <b>124</b> may be adjustable, such that the height <b>138</b> can be modified. For example, the extension member <b>126</b> may be extendible to help provide a desired combination of comfortable heights <b>138</b> in both the low profile mode and the upright mode. For example, providing an extendible extension member <b>126</b> may allow the height <b>138</b> in the upright position to be in a desired range, and may then allow the extension member <b>126</b> to be extended to help increase the height <b>138</b> between the floor and hand grip <b>136</b> in the low profile mode to a desired range (or contracted). The extension of the extension member <b>126</b> may be achieved using any suitable mechanism, including configuring the extension member as a telescoping member. In such configurations, the distance between the hand grip and the pivot joint of the handle may be adjusted (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>64</b>-<b>71</b></figref>).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Surface Cleaning Head</heading><p id="p-0346" num="0354">The following is a description of a surface cleaning head that may be used by itself in any surface cleaning apparatus or in any combination or sub-combination with any other feature or features described herein. For example, any surface cleaning head described herein may be used with any one or more of the moveable wheels, upright section, air treatment member assemblies, carry handles, cyclone configurations, dirt collection chambers, pre-motor filters, suction motors, post-motor filters, cleaning unit air flow ducts, above floor cleaning assemblies, low profile floor cleaning mode, bendable handle, adjustable handles, hose wraps and other features described herein.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0355">In accordance with this embodiment, the surface cleaning head is configured to have a low profile (e.g., it may have a vertical height of less than 6 inches, and more preferably is less than about 4 inches and may be less than 3 inches). Accordingly, the upper and lower surfaces of the surface cleaning head may be generally planar (horizontal) and the suction motor may be provided in the upright section. Rear wheels may be provided which have a large diameter (e.g., larger than or the same height as the surface cleaning head) to enhance stability of the surface cleaning apparatus when in the upright position.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0356">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, in the illustrated embodiment, the surface cleaning head <b>104</b> has a front end <b>140</b>, a rear end <b>142</b> spaced apart from the front end along central longitudinal axis <b>144</b>, and laterally spaced apart sides <b>146</b>. The surface cleaning head <b>104</b> is rollable across the floor or surface to be cleaned in a generally forward/rearward direction that is parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>144</b>, and may also be steerable, e.g., by a steering coupling that connects the push handle/upper section to the surface cleaning head, such that the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is not limited to only linear, forward/rearward movements.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0357">The surface cleaning head <b>104</b> also has an upper surface <b>148</b> and an opposed lower surface <b>150</b> that faces the floor to be cleaned. The upper and lower surfaces <b>148</b> and <b>150</b> may have any suitable configuration, and in the present embodiment are each optionally configured as substantially flat, planar surfaces. The upper surface <b>148</b> lies generally in an upper plane <b>152</b>, and the lower surface <b>150</b> lies generally in a lower plane <b>154</b>. A vertical distance between the upper and lower planes/surfaces defines a surface cleaning head height <b>156</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The height <b>156</b> may be any suitable height, and preferably is less than 6 inches, and more preferably is less than about 4 inches and may be less than 3 inches.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0358">The downward facing dirty air inlet <b>106</b> is provided in the lower surface <b>150</b>, and may be positioned toward the front end <b>140</b>. Main wheels <b>158</b> are provided at the rear end <b>142</b> of the surface cleaning head <b>104</b>, and are rotatable about a laterally oriented rotation axis <b>160</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The wheels <b>158</b> may have any suitable diameter <b>162</b>, which may be greater than or about the vertical height <b>156</b> of the surface cleaning head <b>104</b>. The rotation axis <b>160</b> of the wheels <b>158</b> may be offset from the front end <b>140</b> of the surface cleaning head <b>104</b> by an offset distance <b>164</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). This distance may be any suitable distance, and may be selected so that (as illustrated) the wheels <b>158</b> extend rearwardly beyond the rear end <b>142</b> of the surface cleaning head <b>104</b>. This may help stabilize the apparatus <b>100</b> when in the upright position. This may also help enhance maneuverability of the apparatus <b>100</b> when in use. Optionally, as illustrated in these embodiments, the wheels <b>158</b> may be positioned such that the rotation axis <b>160</b> is positioned below the cleaning unit <b>130</b> when the upright section <b>102</b> is in the upright, storage position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). In this configuration, the rotation axis <b>160</b> underlies the suction motor <b>112</b> and portions of the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b>, including the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> and dirt collection chamber <b>190</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>). This may help improve the stability of the apparatus <b>100</b> when in the storage position.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0359">In addition to the main wheels <b>158</b>, the surface cleaning head <b>104</b> may include one or more additional wheels to help rollingly support the surface cleaning head <b>104</b>, and the rest of the apparatus <b>100</b>, above the floor. For example, smaller front wheels may be provided on the lower surface <b>150</b>, toward the front end <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0360">Optionally, the surface cleaning head <b>104</b> may include a rotating agitating member, such as a brush <b>168</b> and the like, positioned at the dirty air inlet <b>106</b> to help dislodge debris from the surface being cleaned (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>). The agitating member may be any known in the art (e.g., a rotatable brush) and may be driven by an electric motor (optionally positioned within the surface cleaning head <b>104</b>), an air powered turbine or other suitable mechanism as is known in the art.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0361">The surface cleaning head <b>104</b> may be used with a variety of differently configured upright sections <b>102</b>, including, for example, the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>42</b>-<b>48</b> and <b>49</b>-<b>52</b></figref>. Similarly, a surface cleaning head having a different configuration than the embodiment shown may be used in combination with any of upright sections described herein.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0362">It will be appreciated that, as exemplified, the suction motor may be provided in the upper section. Therefore, the height of the surface cleaning head may be reduced as it need not include a suction motor, thereby permitting the height of the surface cleaning head to be reduced and to thereby increase the ability of the surface cleaning head to extend under furniture having a small ground clearance.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Moveable Wheels</heading><p id="p-0355" num="0363">The following is a description of moveable wheels that may be used by itself in any surface cleaning apparatus or in any combination or sub-combination with any other feature or features described herein. For example, the movable wheels described herein may be used with any one or more of the surface cleaning head, upright section, air treatment member assemblies, carry handles, cyclone configurations, dirt collection chambers, pre-motor filters, suction motors, post-motor filters, cleaning unit air flow ducts, above floor cleaning assemblies, low profile floor cleaning mode, bendable handle, adjustable handles, hose wraps and other features described herein.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0364">In accordance with this aspect, the surface cleaning head may have rear wheels that are moveable in the rearward forward/direction and/or the lateral direction. The movement may be automatic upon reconfiguring the surface cleaning apparatus between different operating positions. For example, the rear wheels may be extended when the upright section is placed in a storage position so as to enhance stability. Alternately or in addition, the rear wheels may be moved laterally inwardly in the floor cleaning position so as to enhance maneuverability.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0365">Optionally, the offset distance <b>164</b> may be variable and/or adjustable (automatically as the configuration and/or operating mode of apparatus <b>100</b> is adjusted, or manually by a user, or a combination of both). In such embodiments, the wheels <b>158</b> may be in one location when the upright section <b>102</b> is in the upright configuration and a different position when the upright section <b>102</b> is in the use configuration. Optionally, the wheels <b>158</b> may be moved in the forward/rearward direction (thereby changing the offset distance <b>164</b>) and/or the lateral spacing between the rear wheels may also be adjusted. This may allow the wheel position, balance and/or handling of the apparatus <b>100</b> to be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0366">Accordingly, the rear wheels may be biased to a forward position and the upper section may be drivingly connected to the rear wheels so as to move the rear wheels rearward when the upper section is moved to the upright configuration. Alternately, the rear wheels may be biased to a rearward positon and the upper section may be drivingly connected to the rear wheels so as to move the rear wheels forward when the upper section is moved to the inclined floor cleaning position.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0367">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>58</b></figref>, one embodiment of a wheel deployment mechanism is schematically illustrated. In this embodiment, the axle <b>170</b> supporting the rear wheel <b>158</b> is translatable in the forward/rearward direction (for example slidable within a slot). A linkage <b>172</b> between the upright section <b>102</b> and the axle <b>170</b> is provided, such that moving the upright section <b>102</b> relative to the surface cleaning head <b>104</b> translates the axle <b>170</b> in the forward/rearward direction. As illustrated, when the upright section <b>102</b> is moved into the upright position, a rod <b>174</b> is driven backwards and pushes the axle <b>170</b> rearward. This may increase the stability of the apparatus <b>100</b> when the upright section <b>102</b> is in the upright position. When the upright section <b>102</b> pivots to the inclined floor cleaning position, the rod <b>174</b> is pulled forwardly and/or may be moved forwardly by a biasing member <b>176</b> (e.g., the rod may be biased to the forward position by a spring or the like). This may enable axle <b>170</b> to move forwardly. Moving the rear wheels forwardly may increase the maneuverability of the surface cleaning head <b>104</b> when a push handle is used to drive the surface cleaning head.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0368">An alternative embodiment of a linkage <b>172</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b></figref>, in which gear teeth <b>178</b> on the upright section <b>102</b> engage complimentary teeth on a linkage rod <b>174</b> and urge it backward when the upright section <b>102</b> is in the upright position. When the upright section <b>102</b> is inclined, the teeth <b>178</b> disengage, and a biasing spring <b>176</b> urges the axel <b>170</b> forwardly. In an alternate embodiment, it will be appreciated that the teeth <b>178</b> may drive rod both forward and rearward without any biasing member being required.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0369">Alternatively, instead of being linked to movement of the upright section <b>102</b>, the apparatus may be manually adjustable by a user, such that a user can manually select the forward/rearward position of the wheels <b>158</b>.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0370"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>60</b>-<b>63</b></figref> schematically illustrate an example of an apparatus <b>100</b> that can adjust the lateral spacing <b>180</b> of the rear wheels <b>158</b>, from a relative narrow spacing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b></figref>) to a relatively wider spacing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>61</b></figref>). This may also optionally be used in combination with the mechanisms for adjusting the forward/rearward position of the wheels. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>62</b> and <b>63</b></figref>, the wheels <b>158</b> may be supported on threaded sleeves <b>182</b> that can threadingly engage a threaded axel <b>170</b>. Rotating the sleeves <b>182</b> and axles <b>170</b> relative to each other causes the sleeves <b>182</b> to translate axially along the axis <b>160</b>, thereby changing the lateral wheel spacing <b>180</b>. The axle <b>170</b> may be rotated using any suitable mechanism, including providing teeth <b>184</b> on the axle <b>170</b> and using a driving member <b>186</b> associated with the upright section <b>102</b> for engaging the teeth <b>184</b>. The driving <b>186</b> member may be independently operable, or may be linked to the movement of the upright section <b>102</b> relative to the surface cleaning head <b>104</b>. The wheels <b>158</b> may be configured to be moveable only in the lateral direction, only in the forward rearward direction, a combination of both types of movement and/or need not be movable at all.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Upright Section</heading><p id="p-0363" num="0371">The following is a description of an upright section that may be used by itself in any surface cleaning apparatus or in any combination or sub-combination with any other feature or features described herein. For example, the upright section described herein may be used with any one or more of the surface cleaning head, moveable wheels, air treatment member assemblies, carry handles, cyclone configurations, dirt collection chambers, pre-motor filters, suction motors, post-motor filters, cleaning unit air flow ducts, above floor cleaning assemblies, low profile floor cleaning mode, bendable handle, adjustable handles, hose wraps and other features described herein.</p><p id="p-0364" num="0372">In accordance with this aspect, the components of the upright section may be arranged to reduce the depth (front to back) of the upright section. It will be appreciated that if the upright section includes a bendable wand such that the surface cleaning apparatus may be reconfigured into the low profile floor cleaning mode of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, then the depth of the handle does not affect the extent to which the upright section below the bendable portion of the handle can extend under furniture. In such a case, the components of the upright section may be arranged to reduce the depth (front to back) of the cleaning unit. For example, the dirt collection region may be positioned such that it is not located in front of the air treatment member. Alternately or in addition, the dirt collection region may be positioned such that it is not located behind the air treatment member. For example, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the dirt collection regions are positioned such that the depth of the air treatment member is the diameter of the cyclone chamber. The dirt collection regions are exemplified as having a greater lateral extent then depth such that they have a rear side that is recessed inwardly (forwardly) compared to the rearward extent of the cyclone chamber. Recessing the rearward side of the dirt collection regions inwardly provides, as exemplified, two recesses in which air flow passages, accessory tools or the like may be positioned. If the components positioned in the recesses do not extend rearward of the rearward extent of the cyclone chamber, then the maximum depth of the upright section that houses the cleaning unit may be the depth of cyclone chamber (i.e. the air treatment member). If the components positioned in the recesses do extend rearward of the rearward extent of the cyclone chamber, then the maximum depth of the upright section that houses the cleaning unit will increase but will still be reduced due to the recessing of the rearward side of the dirt collection regions.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0373">It will be appreciated that some of the dirt collection regions may be forward and/or rearward of the air treatment member however this amount is preferably minimized. For example, at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or more of the dirt collection regions is laterally spaced from the air treatment member. It will also be appreciated that the shapes of the dirt collection regions may be varied but still provide one or more recesses for receiving components of the surface cleaning apparatus.</p><p id="p-0366" num="0374">In the illustrated embodiments (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>25</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>29</b>, <b>42</b>-<b>48</b>, <b>49</b>-<b>52</b> and <b>53</b>-<b>57</b></figref>, the upright section <b>102</b> includes a cleaning unit <b>130</b> and a push handle <b>124</b>.

For example, the cyclone configurations described herein may be used with any one or more of the surface cleaning head, moveable wheels, upright section, air treatment member assemblies, carry handles, dirt collection chambers, pre-motor filters, suction motors, post-motor filters, cleaning unit air flow ducts, above floor cleaning assemblies, low profile floor cleaning mode, bendable handle, adjustable handles, hose wraps and other features described herein.</p><p id="p-0415" num="0423">In accordance with this aspect, the air treatment member is configured to reduce the overall depth of the air treatment member assembly. Accordingly, the dirt collection region or regions are positioned external to the air treatment member. By positioning the dirt collection region or regions external to the air treatment member, a portion of a dirt collection region need not be positioned in front or behind the air treatment member (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>), thereby reducing the depth of the air treatment member assembly. Accordingly, the maximum depth of the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b> may be the depth of the air treatment member. Further, the shape of the dirt collection region or regions may be varied so as to fit within a desired footprint of the cleaning unit.</p><p id="p-0416" num="0424">It will be appreciated that the air treatment member may be provided in the form of any suitable cyclone(s), swirl chamber or the like which are known in the surface cleaning art. In the illustrated embodiments (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>, <b>22</b>-<b>24</b>, <b>31</b>-<b>41</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>77</b>-<b>85</b></figref>), the air treatment member is provided in the form that includes at least one cyclone chamber <b>188</b> that extends along a cyclone axis <b>276</b>, which may also define a cyclone bin assembly axis. The cyclone chamber may be of any design known in the art. Optionally, the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b> may include more than one air treatment member. For example, the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b> may include two or more cyclonic cleaning stages (each containing one or more cyclone chambers), arranged in parallel or in series with each other. One example of such an air treatment member assembly <b>110</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>77</b>-<b>85</b></figref>, and includes a first cyclone chamber <b>188</b>, and a second cyclone chamber <b>188</b><i>a </i>that is positioned downstream from the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> and functions as a secondary cyclonic cleaning stage. Alternatively, the cyclones <b>188</b> and <b>188</b><i>a </i>may be connected in parallel with each other. The second cyclone chamber <b>188</b><i>a </i>and second dirt collection chamber <b>190</b><i>a </i>may include analogous features to the cyclone chambers <b>188</b> and dirt collection chambers <b>190</b> described herein, and like features are indicated using like reference numerals with an &#x201c;a&#x201d; suffix.</p><p id="p-0417" num="0425">A variety of air treatment member assemblies are described herein, having different arrangements and configurations of the cyclone chambers and dirt collection chambers. Any of these air treatment member configurations may be used in combination with any of the other, compatible features described herein.</p><p id="p-0418" num="0426">As exemplified, the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> includes a first end wall <b>278</b>, a second end wall <b>280</b> axially spaced apart from the first end wall and a generally cylindrical sidewall <b>282</b> extending between the first and second end walls <b>278</b>, <b>280</b>. Optionally, some or all of the cyclone walls may coincide with portions of the dirt collection chamber walls, and/or may form portions of the outer surface of the cleaning unit <b>130</b> and upright section <b>102</b>. Alternatively, in some examples some or all of the cyclone walls can be distinct from other portions of the cleaning unit <b>130</b>, and may not overlap or be co-incident with other walls in the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b>. Referring to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>77</b> and <b>82</b></figref>, the sidewall <b>282</b> of the first cyclone chamber <b>188</b> is coincident with portions of the dirt collection chamber sidewalls (at the front and rear sides of the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b>), whereas, as exemplified, the diameter of second cyclone chamber <b>188</b><i>a </i>may be slightly smaller, and may be positioned such that the sidewall <b>282</b><i>a </i>is distinct from the dirt collection chamber sidewalls. In this example, there is an optional overlap between the cyclone chamber sidewalls, such that a portion of sidewall <b>282</b> is coincident with a portion of sidewall <b>282</b><i>a</i>. This may help reduce the combined lateral width of the cyclones <b>188</b> and <b>188</b><i>a</i>, and in some instances may help provide structural support/strength for the sidewalls <b>282</b> and <b>282</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0419" num="0427">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> as an example, in these embodiments the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> has a cyclone air inlet <b>284</b>, through which dirty air can enter the cyclone chamber <b>188</b>, and a cyclone air outlet <b>286</b>, through which treated air can exit the cyclone chamber <b>188</b>. While some dirt may settle/collect on the interior surface of the second end wall <b>280</b>, the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> may also include at least one dirt outlet <b>288</b> through which dirt and debris can exit the cyclone chamber <b>188</b>, and preferably collect in an external dirt collection chamber <b>190</b>. If a second cyclone chamber <b>188</b><i>a </i>is included (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>77</b>-<b>85</b></figref>) it may include an analogous air inlet <b>184</b><i>a</i>, and optionally, may include two or more air inlets <b>184</b><i>a</i>. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>83</b></figref>, in this embodiment the second cyclone <b>188</b><i>a </i>includes four air inlets <b>284</b><i>a</i>, and other embodiments may have different numbers of air inlets. In this embodiment, all four air inlets <b>184</b><i>a </i>are in air flow communication with a common air plenum <b>285</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>78</b>, <b>83</b> and <b>84</b></figref>) that is downstream from the air outlet <b>286</b> of the first cyclone chamber <b>188</b>. That is, air exiting the first cyclone <b>188</b>, via the air outlet <b>286</b>, flows into the air plenum <b>285</b> and is then distributed amongst the four air inlets <b>184</b><i>a</i>. After flowing in via the inlets <b>184</b><i>a</i>, the air circulates within the second cyclone chamber <b>188</b><i>a </i>and exits via the air outlet <b>286</b><i>a </i>and travels into the pre-motor filter chamber <b>194</b>. In this arrangement, the air plenum <b>285</b> extends beneath at least a portion of the second dirt chamber <b>190</b><i>a</i>, and laterally surrounds a lower end of the cyclone chamber <b>188</b><i>a</i>. The second cyclone chamber <b>188</b><i>a </i>includes dirt outlets <b>288</b><i>a </i>(two in the illustrated example) which are in communication with a corresponding second dirt collection chamber <b>190</b><i>a</i>. In the illustrated example, the second dirt chamber <b>190</b><i>a </i>is fluidly isolated from the dirt chamber <b>190</b>, which may help maintain a desired air flow path through the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0428">The dirt outlet <b>288</b> (or <b>288</b><i>a</i>) may have any suitable configuration and be provided at any location in the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> (or <b>188</b><i>a</i>). For example, if a dirt collection region is provided below or above a cyclone chamber that has a longitudinal axis that extends vertically when the upright section is in the upright storage position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, then the overall height of the cleaning unit may be too large. Accordingly, if the cyclone chamber has a longitudinal axis that extends vertically when the upright section is in the upright storage position, it is preferred to position the dirt collection region or regions exterior to the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> and to extend in the same direction as the cyclone chamber <b>188</b>. Accordingly, the dirt outlet or outlets <b>288</b> may be configured so that dirt travelling through the dirt outlet <b>288</b> travels in a generally lateral/radial outward direction and then falls downwardly into the dirt collection chamber <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0421" num="0429">Optionally each cyclone chamber may be configured to include one dirt outlet, or more than one dirt outlet. For example, a dirt outlet <b>288</b> may be provided for each dirt collection chamber <b>190</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> and <b>23</b></figref>, in the illustrated embodiment, the cyclone assembly includes two dirt collection chambers <b>190</b>, each of which is spaced laterally from the cyclone chamber. Accordingly, the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> includes two, spaced apart dirt outlets <b>288</b> that are provided on opposing lateral sides of the cyclone chamber <b>188</b>. Each dirt outlet <b>288</b> may be configured as a slot that extends around a portion of the cyclone chamber sidewall <b>282</b>, and may be partially bounded by the first end wall <b>278</b> of the cyclone chamber <b>188</b>.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0430">As exemplified, the dirt outlets <b>288</b> may be provided toward the upper end of the cyclone chamber <b>188</b>, and at the upper end <b>244</b> of the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b> itself. In contrast, both the air inlet <b>284</b> and air outlet <b>286</b> may be provided toward the opposed, lower end <b>280</b> of the cyclone chamber <b>188</b>, which corresponds to about the vertical mid-point of the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b>. A cyclone with this orientation may be referred to as an inverted cyclone.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0431">In this embodiment, and in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b>-<b>33</b> and <b>38</b>-<b>40</b></figref>, air exiting the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> travels downwardly, and, as exemplified, may travel through a portion of the dirt collection chamber <b>190</b> if a dirt collection region is positioned below the cyclone chamber <b>188</b>, via an exit conduit <b>290</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>), to an aperture <b>292</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>10</b></figref>) provided in the lower door <b>260</b> of the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b>. The exit conduit <b>290</b> in these embodiments is at least partially surrounded by the dirt collection chamber <b>190</b>, and as illustrated is entirely laterally surrounded (whereas it is only partially surrounded in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>35</b> and <b>36</b></figref>). Positioning the exit conduit <b>290</b> at least partially within, and extending through, the dirt collection chamber <b>190</b> may help reduce the overall size of the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b> while increasing the volume for dirt collection, for example as compared to placing the exit conduit outside of the dirt collection chamber.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0432">In other embodiments, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>78</b> and <b>84</b></figref>, the lower end of the cyclone chamber <b>188</b><i>a </i>is positioned adjacent the openable bottom door <b>260</b>, such that the dirt collection chambers <b>190</b> and <b>190</b><i>a </i>do not extend beneath the cyclone chamber <b>188</b><i>a</i>. In this arrangement, instead of using a separate exit conduit, the air outlet <b>286</b><i>a </i>of the cyclone chamber <b>188</b><i>a </i>includes the aperture <b>292</b> in the door <b>260</b>. In addition to the aperture <b>292</b> being movable with the lower door <b>260</b>, in this example an upwardly extending conduit <b>293</b><i>a </i>that forms part of the air outlet <b>286</b><i>a </i>is also movable with the door <b>260</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>84</b></figref>). In this embodiment, opening the lower door <b>260</b> provides access to the interior of the cyclone chamber <b>188</b><i>a </i>and removes the conduit <b>293</b><i>a </i>from within the cyclone chamber <b>188</b><i>a</i>. The cyclone chamber <b>188</b> includes a similar conduit <b>293</b> (also referred to as a vortex finder&#x2014;and similar conduits are included in the other embodiments described herein), but the conduit <b>293</b> is not moveable when the door <b>260</b> is opened. In the illustrated embodiment, opening the door <b>260</b> also opens the lower sides of each of the air inlets <b>284</b><i>a </i>(see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>83</b></figref>), which may be useful for cleaning or inspection of the air inlet s <b>284</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0425" num="0433">When the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b> is mounted to the upright section, the aperture <b>292</b> is in fluid communication with the pre-motor filter chamber <b>194</b>. This arrangement can also help simplify the air flow path, as the air exiting the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> may travel linearly along the direction of the cyclone axis <b>276</b> directly into the pre-motor filter chamber <b>194</b> and, in the illustrated embodiments, to the suction motor <b>112</b> that is positioned beneath the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b>. Reducing the number of turns/corners along this portion of the air flow path may help reduce the back pressure in the air flow path. It will be appreciated that, in some embodiments, the suction motor inlet need not be aligned with, or extend in the same direction as, the cyclone chamber air outlet.</p><p id="p-0426" num="0434">Alternatively, the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> may be configured as an inverted cyclone but may only include a single dirt outlet <b>288</b>, which in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref> is provided at the front of the cyclone chamber <b>188</b>. It will be appreciated that the overall depth <b>256</b> of the cyclone assembly is reduced in this embodiment since the dirt collection chamber <b>190</b> is not positioned rearward of the rearward extent of the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> and is configured to have a lateral length that is greater than its depth. It will also be appreciated that a single dirt outlet <b>288</b> need not be positioned directly at the front of the cyclone chamber, but instead may be offset toward one lateral side of the cyclone chamber, such as shown in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b>-<b>33</b>, <b>39</b>, <b>40</b> and <b>77</b></figref>, or toward the bottom of the cyclone, such as shown in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>35</b>-<b>37</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0427" num="0435">Optionally, the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> may be oriented in a generally upright configuration (i.e. the cyclone axis <b>276</b> (or axis <b>276</b><i>a</i>) is generally parallel to the handle axis <b>134</b> when the apparatus is in the upright position), but may alternatively be arranged so that the air outlet <b>286</b> is provided toward the top of the cyclone chamber <b>188</b>, instead of the bottom. For example, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>, the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> is arranged so that the air inlet <b>284</b> and the air outlet <b>286</b> are at the top of the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b>, and the dirt outlet <b>288</b> is at the bottom. To connect this air treatment member assembly <b>110</b> to the air flow path, and aperture <b>292</b> may be provided in the upper door <b>262</b> of the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b> (not shown in this figure) and may be connected to suitable air flow conduits that may be external the dirt collection chamber <b>190</b> (for example conduits provided on or in the cleaning unit <b>130</b>) to direct the air exiting the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> to suction motor <b>112</b>. Configuring the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b> in this manner may, in some embodiments, increase the complexity of the air flow path between the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> and the suction motor <b>112</b> (for example as compared to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> and <b>23</b></figref>), but may help increase the capacity of the dirt collection chamber <b>190</b> by removing the need for the internal exit conduit <b>290</b>. This may also help simplify the construction and/or operation of the lower door <b>260</b> of the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b>, as it need not include an air exit aperture <b>292</b> and the associated gaskets and/or seals.</p><p id="p-0428" num="0436">Alternatively, instead of arranging the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> in a generally upright configuration (in which the cyclone axis <b>276</b> is substantially parallel to the handle axis <b>134</b> in the upright position), the cyclone chamber <b>188</b> may be oriented in a lateral/sideways configuration in which the cyclone axis <b>276</b> is generally horizontal when the apparatus <b>100</b> is in the storage position, and optionally the cyclone axis <b>276</b> may be substantially orthogonal to the handle axis <b>137</b> when in the upright position.

In other embodiments, only one of the height and the width may be increased. The air entering a cyclone chamber tends to maintain a similar profile to the cyclone air inlet. Accordingly, increasing the width of the cyclone air inlet (in a plane transverse to the direction of air flow through the cyclone inlet) increases the width of the air entering the cyclone chamber, which in turn requires the cyclone chamber to have a larger diameter to reduce the tendency of air entering the cyclone chamber to travel directly to the cyclone air outlet if the cyclone air outlet is located at the inlet end of the cyclone chamber. Increasing the height of the cyclone air inlet (in a plane transverse to the direction of air flow through the cyclone inlet) increases the height of the air entering the cyclone chamber, which in turn requires the cyclone chamber to have a larger height to enable the air to turn the same number of times in the cyclone chamber prior to exiting the cyclone chamber.

The button <b>390</b> may be pressed by a user, which may urge a linkage rod <b>392</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>) within the extension member <b>126</b> downwardly, thereby disengaging a latch <b>394</b> member and allowing the extension member <b>126</b> to pivot. Optionally, the linkage rod <b>392</b> and/or button <b>390</b> may be biased toward the locked positions. Other suitable pivoting mechanisms, locking mechanisms and actuators, as well as positioning of the actuator, may be used, including those described in U.S. patent application Ser.

In this embodiment, the pivot joint <b>386</b> includes a second pivot axis <b>398</b> that is generally parallel to the pivot axis <b>388</b>, thus providing two pivot joints, pivot joint <b>422</b> having an axis <b>388</b> and pivot joint <b>424</b> having an axis <b>398</b>. When in the storage configuration, the second pivot joint <b>424</b> may be positioned above, and may lie in the same plane as, pivot joint <b>422</b>.

In this configuration, interference between the tab <b>426</b> and the walls of the gap <b>430</b> and intermediary housing <b>434</b> prevent rotation of the intermediary housing <b>434</b> relative to the lower housing <b>432</b>, about the first axis <b>388</b>. The upper pivot joint <b>424</b> may have a generally analogous configuration, in which the upper pivot joint <b>424</b> is locked when a tab portion <b>442</b> on an upper slider <b>438</b> projects through a gap <b>444</b> in the intermediary housing <b>434</b> and engages an upper housing <b>446</b>.</p><p id="p-0541" num="0549">To unlock the lower pivot joint <b>422</b>, a user may push the button <b>390</b> which may be, e.g., on the hand grip <b>136</b>.

A lower end <b>436</b> of the rod <b>392</b> pushes on the upper slider <b>438</b>, pushing it downwardly (as illustrated). An elongate portion <b>440</b> of the upper slider <b>438</b> bears against the tab <b>426</b>, and downward translation of the upper slider <b>438</b> thereby leads to a corresponding downward translation of the lower slider <b>428</b>.

In some embodiments, this may be sufficient to allow rotation about the second axis <b>398</b>. Alternatively, as illustrated a second release actuator <b>400</b> may need to be released to allow rotation about the axis <b>398</b>. In this embodiment, when the release actuator <b>400</b> remains engaged it is sufficient to inhibit rotation about the axis <b>398</b>, even when button <b>390</b> is pressed.

Increasing the path length in this manner may allow a longer hose <b>113</b> to be provided and stored on the cleaning unit <b>130</b>, which may help improve the above floor cleaning range.</p><p id="p-0566" num="0574">In embodiments having a hose support <b>396</b> (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>27</b></figref>), when the apparatus <b>100</b> is used in the floor cleaning mode, a first vertical portion <b>416</b> of the hose <b>113</b> may convey air upwardly on one side of the cleaning unit <b>130</b> and a second vertical portion <b>418</b> of the hose <b>113</b> may convey air downwardly on the opposing side of the cleaning unit <b>130</b>. In such embodiments, a transverse portion <b>420</b> of the hose <b>113</b> may extend between the first and second vertical portions <b>416</b>, <b>418</b> (and may be generally curved) over the upper end of the cleaning unit <b>130</b>. In this configuration, the transverse portion <b>420</b> of the hose <b>113</b> is positioned vertically above, and may be rearward or forward of the pivot axes <b>388</b> and <b>398</b>. Also, in this embodiment the first vertical portion <b>416</b> of the hose, along with a portion of the wand <b>222</b>, may be positioned behind the first dirt collection chamber <b>190</b> and the second vertical portion <b>418</b> of the hose <b>113</b> may be positioned behind the second dirt collection chamber <b>190</b> (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>18</b></figref>). This can help reduce the overall depth <b>201</b> of the cleaning unit <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0567" num="0575">In this embodiment, the first and second vertical portions <b>416</b>, <b>418</b> and the transverse portion <b>420</b> of the hose and the rigid extension wand <b>222</b> (i.e. the above floor cleaning assembly) may all lie in a common, central transverse plane <b>232</b>, which in this embodiment may extend through one or both of the suction motor <b>112</b> and cyclone chamber <b>188</b> (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>20</b></figref>) and may be disposed toward the rear side of the cleaning unit <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0568" num="0576">Similarly, in this embodiment, the transverse plane <b>234</b> that contains the forward most portions of the rigid wand <b>222</b> and hose <b>113</b> may be positioned forward of the rearmost portion of the air treatment member assembly <b>110</b>, and a rearmost portion of the above floor clean assembly may lie in, or forward of, the rear plane <b>200</b> (bounding the rear side of the cleaning unit).</p><p id="p-0569" num="0577">What has been described above has been intended to be illustrative of the invention and non-limiting and it will be understood by persons skilled in the art that other variants and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the claims appended hereto.
