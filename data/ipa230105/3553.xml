The scale includes a periodic pattern of signal modulating elements (SME) arranged along a measuring axis (MA) with a spatial wavelength W1. The detector comprises sensing elements and a field generating coil that generates a changing magnetic flux. The sensing elements comprise conductive loops that provide detector signals responsive to a local effect on the changing magnetic flux provided by adjacent SME's. Some or all of the conductive loops are configured according to an intra-loop shift relationship wherein equal &#x201c;shifted proportions&#x201d; of a loop are shifted in opposite directions by W1/4K. K is an odd integer. The intra-loop shift relationship can be used to suppress Kth spatial harmonic components in the detector signals, while also overcoming longstanding detrimental layout problems.

This summary is not intended to identify key features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An electronic position encoder is provided that is usable to measure a relative position between two elements along a measuring axis direction. In various implementations, the electronic position encoder includes a scale, a detector portion and a signal processing configuration.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The scale extends along the measuring axis direction and includes a periodic scale pattern comprising at least a first type of signal modulating elements. The periodic scale pattern has a spatial wavelength W1. The signal modulating elements of the first type comprise similar conductive plates or similar conductive loops that are located along the measuring axis direction corresponding to the spatial wavelength W1. The detector portion is configured to be mounted proximate to the periodic scale pattern and to move along the measuring axis direction relative to the periodic scale pattern. In various implementations, the detector portion includes a field generating coil and at least one respective set of sensing elements corresponding to a respective nominal spatial phase (e.g., two respective sets differing by 90 degrees of spatial phase to provide quadrature signals, or three respective sets differing by 120 degrees of spatial phase to provide three phase signals). The field generating coil is fixed on a substrate and surrounds an interior area that is aligned with an effective region of the periodic scale pattern of signal modulating elements during operation. As used herein, the term &#x201c;surrounds&#x201d; may mean completely surrounds, or partially surrounds, in various implementations. The only constraint is that the field generating coil is configured to generate a changing magnetic flux in the interior area in response to a coil drive signal, in a manner that supports operation according to the principles disclosed and claimed herein. Each respective set of sensing elements is arranged along the measuring axis direction and fixed on the substrate. The members of the set of sensing elements comprise conductive loops or conductive loop portions that define a sensing element effective area EffASEN corresponding to that portion of their sensing element that is aligned with or overlaps the interior area surrounded by the field generating coil.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Each respective set of sensing elements is configured to provide detector signals which respond to a local effect on the changing magnetic flux that is provided by adjacent signal modulating elements of the scale pattern, and which corresponds to its respective nominal spatial phase. The signal processing configuration is operably connected to the detector portion to provide the coil drive signal and to determine the relative position between the detector portion and the scale pattern based on detector signals input from the detector portion.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In various implementations of a first type according to principles disclosed herein (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>13</b></figref>), at least one respective set of sensing elements corresponding to a respective nominal spatial phase comprises the combined features A1, B1 and C1, and further combines at least one of the features D1 or E1, defined as follows:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A1) A number of positive polarity loops corresponding to a first winding direction or polarity, and the same number of negative polarity loops corresponding to a second winding direction or polarity opposite to the first;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">B1) Each of the positive and negative polarity loops have a total sensing element effective area EffASEN that is aligned with or overlaps one or more interior areas and is defined to have an effective y-axis dimension EffYSEN along a y-axis direction that is the sum of the dimensions of the one or more interior areas perpendicular to the measuring axis direction, and at least a majority of the positive and negative polarity loops are configured to provide a sensing element average dimension DSENavg=(EffASEN/EffYSEN) along the measuring axis direction that is within the range 0.33*W1+/&#x2212;15%;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">C1) The positive polarity loops are configured with their sensing element effective areas arranged in a positive polarity loop prescribed relationship (or positive loop prescribed relationship, for short) relative to the respective nominal spatial phase of the respective set of sensing elements, and the negative polarity loops are configured with their sensing element effective areas arranged in a negative polarity loop prescribed relationship (or negative loop prescribed relationship, for short) relative to the respective nominal spatial phase of the respective set of sensing elements. The positive loop prescribed relationship comprises a configuration wherein a shifted proportion up to half of a total sensing element effective area of the number of positive polarity loops is shifted along the measuring axis direction in a first direction by an amount (W1)/4K in relationship to the respective nominal spatial phase, and a nominally the same shifted proportion of the total sensing element effective area of the number of positive polarity loops is shifted along the measuring axis direction in a direction opposite to the first direction by an amount (W1)/4K in relationship to the respective nominal spatial phase, such that the two shifted proportions of the total sensing element effective area of the positive polarity loops area are shifted by (W1)/2K relative to one another, wherein K is one of 3, 5, 7 or 9. The negative loop prescribed relationship comprises a configuration wherein a shifted proportion up to half of a total sensing element effective area of the number of negative polarity loops is shifted along the measuring axis direction in a first direction by an amount (W1)/4K in relationship to the respective nominal spatial phase, and nominally the same shifted proportion of the total sensing element effective area of the number of negative polarity loops is shifted along the measuring axis direction in a direction opposite to the first direction by an amount (W1)/4K in relationship to the respective nominal spatial phase, such that the first two shifted proportions of the total sensing element effective area of the negative polarity loops area are shifted by (W1)/2K relative to one another;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">D1) Each of the positive and negative polarity loops comprise a sensing element effective area EffASEN that has a maximum dimension DSENmax along the measuring axis direction that is at most 0.45*W1; and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">E1) The respective set of sensing elements corresponding to a respective nominal spatial phase (SETSENPh0) is configured in a two-portion configuration comprising: a first separated portion comprising the same number of positive polarity loops and negative polarity loops; and a second separated portion that is nominally aligned along the measuring axis direction with the first portion, and that comprises the same number of positive polarity loops and negative polarity loops as the first separated portion; wherein the first and second separated portions are separated by a gap located along the measuring axis direction between the first portion and the second portion, wherein the gap is at least as wide along the measuring axis direction as one of the positive or negative polarity loops and no positive polarity loop effective area or negative polarity loop effective area of that respective set of sensing elements is located in the gap;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">whereby the respective set of sensing elements corresponding to the respective nominal spatial phase (SETSENPh0) is configured in a practical configuration that provides a spatially filtered detector signal or signals usable to reduce or suppress both a potential unwanted 3rd spatial harmonic detector signal component and a potential unwanted Kth spatial harmonic detector signal component, that may otherwise contribute to error in the determined relative position between the detector portion and the scale pattern.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As a result of implementing the features A1, B1, C1, along with at least one of the features D1 and/or E1 as outlined above, the respective set of sensing elements corresponding to the respective nominal spatial phase is thereby configured to provide a spatially filtered detector signal or signals usable to reduce or suppress both a potential unwanted 3<sup>rd </sup>spatial harmonic signal component and a potential unwanted Kth spatial harmonic signal component that may otherwise contribute to error in the determined relative position between the detector portion and the scale pattern. Furthermore, the configuration provides the spatial filtering outlined above, while also providing a novel &#x201c;layout friendly&#x201d; loop arrangement to solve longstanding detrimental layout problems, as described in greater detail below. In some implementations of the first type, it may be particularly advantageous when K=5. In certain implementations of the first type, it may be advantageous when at least a majority of the positive and negative polarity loops are configured to provide a sensing element average dimension DSENavg that is at least 0.29*W1 and at most 0.31*W1, as described in greater detail below with respect to various figures.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In various implementations of the first type, each respective positive or negative polarity loop included in a respective set of sensing elements that comprises the features A1, B1, C1 and at least one of the features D1 and/or E1, may be configured to provide a respective sensing element effective area EffASEN that does not overlap a sensing element effective area EffASEN of any other respective positive or negative polarity loop included in that respective set of sensing elements. This may facilitate a layout with lower fabrication costs and/or may allow elimination of detrimental loop shape irregularities arising from layout problems arising in prior art methods for providing spatial filtering and/or misalignment error reduction features. There is no configuration in the prior art that provides a comparable combination of spatial filtering performance, robustness against misalignment, and relatively ideal loop shapes throughout a set of sensing elements along with an economical fabrication layout.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some implementations of the first type, at least a first respective set of sensing elements corresponding to a respective nominal spatial phase comprises the features A1, B1, C1 and D1, and does not comprise the feature E1.

The first and second adjacent portions may be located closer to one another along the measuring axis direction than a width of one of the positive or negative polarity loops (which is why they are called &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; portions herein), and the respective loops of the first and second adjacent portions that are closest to one another may have opposite loop polarities.

Such implementations having aligned centroids may offer certain advantages with respect to rejecting certain errors due &#x201c;pitch&#x201d; misalignment between the detector portion and the scale pattern, while at the same time facilitating economical layout and fabrication, as described in greater detail below with respect to various figures. In some such implementations, each respective positive or negative polarity loop included in one of the first or second respective set of sensing elements is configured to provide a respective sensing element effective area EffASEN that does not overlap a sensing element effective area EffASEN of any other respective positive or negative polarity loop included in that same one of the first or second respective set of sensing elements.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In various implementations that include two adjacent portions, or two separated portions as outlined above, the electronic position encoder may be configured according to one of M1 or M2, wherein: M1) the first adjacent (or separated) portion is configured to output a first detector signal and the second adjacent (or separated) portion is configured to output a second detector signal, and the signal processor is configured to determine the relative position between the detector portion and the scale pattern based at least partly on a combination of the first and second signals; or M2) the first adjacent (or separated) portion is connected in series with the second adjacent (or separated) portion to form a combined signal and the series connection is configured such that the respective signal contributions of the first and second portions are additive in the combined signal; and the signal processor is configured to determine the relative position between the detector portion and the scale pattern based at least partly on the combined signal.

A transmitter winding <b>102</b> (FGC) forms a large planar loop. A receiver winding <b>104</b> (SETSEN), in substantially the same plane as the transmitter winding <b>102</b>, is laid out in one direction as indicated by the arrows in a zig-zag or sinusoidal pattern and then in a reverse direction as indicated by the arrows so that the winding crosses over itself to form alternating loops <b>106</b> (SEN+) and <b>108</b> (SEN&#x2212;) interposed between each other, as shown. As a result, each of the alternating loops <b>106</b> (SEN+) and <b>108</b> (SEN&#x2212;) of the receiver winding <b>104</b> (SETSEN) have a different winding direction or polarity as compared to adjacent loops. By applying an alternating (changing) current to the transmitter winding <b>102</b> (FGC), the transmitter winding produces a time-varying magnetic field, extending through the loops <b>106</b> (SEN+) and <b>108</b> (SEN&#x2212;) of the receiver winding <b>104</b> (SETSEN).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">If a scale or scale pattern <b>112</b> (<b>180</b>) (a segment of which is outlined by edges indicating alternating long-dash lines and short-dash lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), including a conductive object (e.g., a conductive plate <b>114</b> (SME), several of which are outlined using short-dash lines on the scale pattern <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) is moved close to the transducer, the varying magnetic field generated by the transmitter winding <b>102</b> (FGC) will induce eddy currents in the conductive object, which in turn sets up a magnetic field from the object that counteracts the varying transmitter magnetic field. As a result, the magnetic flux that the receiver winding <b>104</b> (SETSEN) receives is altered or disrupted, thereby causing the receiver winding to output a non-zero EMF signal (a voltage) at the output terminals V+ and V&#x2212; of the receiver winding <b>104</b>, which will change polarity as the conductive object moves between the positive polarity &#x201c;+&#x201d; loops <b>106</b> (SEN+) and negative polarity &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; loops <b>108</b> (SEN&#x2212;).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In this prior art example, the distance between the location of two loops of the same polarity, (e.g., between the location of a loop <b>106</b> (SEN+) to the location of the next loop <b>106</b> (SEN+)) is defined as a pitch or wavelength <b>110</b> (W1) of the transducer. It may be seen that each loop <b>106</b> (SEN+) and/or <b>108</b> (SEN&#x2212;) therefore has a length or maximum dimension 0.5*W1 along the measuring axis direction <b>300</b>. If the conductive object described above (e.g., a conductive plate <b>114</b> (SME)) is proximate to the receiver winding <b>104</b> (SETSEN) and is continuously varied in position along a measuring axis <b>300</b> (MA), the AC amplitude of the signal output from the receiver winding (SETSEN) will vary continuously and periodically with the wavelength <b>110</b> (W1) due to the periodic polarity alternation of the loops <b>106</b> (SEN) and <b>108</b> (SEN) and local disruption of the transmitted magnetic field caused by the conductive object (e.g., a conductive plate <b>114</b> (SME)).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The '389 patent emphasizes that if the conductive object (e.g., a conductive plate <b>114</b> (SME)) is much smaller or larger than the loops <b>106</b> and/or <b>108</b> (SEN+, SEN&#x2212;), then the amplitude of the signal output will be weak and high accuracy will be difficult to obtain. The signal output will have a large amplitude and, thus, be most sensitive to position of the conductive object (e.g., a conductive plate <b>114</b> (SME)) if it has a length equal to about half the wavelength <b>110</b> (W1) (i.e., when it is possible for the object to be positioned coincident with the loops <b>106</b> or <b>108</b> (SEN+ or SEN&#x2212;) exactly).

The interior area INTA is aligned with the periodic scale pattern <b>380</b> of signal modulating elements SME during operation, approximately as illustrated. In the illustrated implementation, the field generating coil FGC comprises a single turn surrounding the interior area INTA.

In various implementations, the sensing element effective area EffASEN that is aligned with or overlaps the interior area INTA may be described as having an effective y-axis dimension EffYSEN along a y-axis direction that is perpendicular to the measuring axis direction, and a maximum dimension DSENmax along the measuring axis direction (the x-axis direction). In the particular implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the effective y-axis dimension EffYSEN is equal to YSEP, because each of the sensing elements SEN has a maximum sensing element dimension YSENMAX along the y-axis direction that exceeds YSEP and its effective area EffASEN therefore extends over the entire dimension YSEP. The maximum dimension DSENmax along the measuring axis direction is nominally 0.5*W1.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an applied coil drive signal current Igen in the field generating coil FGC generates the changing magnetic field GCMF, which inductively couples to the signal modulating element SME. The signal modulating element SME is schematically illustrated as a conductive loop in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In response to the coupled changing magnetic field GCMF, an induced current lind is produced in the signal modulating element SME, which generates an induced magnetic field represented by flux lines (the flux lines including arrow heads in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). The illustrated flux lines represent a central magnetic flux CF represented by the central magnetic flux lines CFL, and a marginal magnetic flux MF represented by the closed marginal magnetic flux lines MFL<b>1</b>-MFL<b>3</b>, which are shown encircling the conductive loop of the signal modulating element SME.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Generally speaking, it will be understood that the members of the set of sensing elements SETSEN produce signals (or signal contributions) that are responsive to the induced changing magnetic flux that is represented as outlined above. In particular, the produced signals are responsive to the amount of magnetic flux that is effectively coupled through their interior loop area, to produce a signal contribution or signal component, which is represented as a current Isense in the sensing element SEN<b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in various implementations, the detector portion <b>367</b> and the scale pattern <b>380</b> may be approximately planar (e.g., they may include or be formed on approximately planar substrates) and the detector portion <b>367</b> may be configured to be mounted approximately parallel to the periodic scale pattern <b>380</b> with a nominal operating gap GapZ between their respective conductors. For example, in various implementations the nominal operating GapZ may be at least 0.075*W1, to facilitate practical assembly and alignment tolerances. In some such implementations, the nominal operating gap may be at least 0.15*W1. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the central magnetic flux CF will generally be effectively coupled through the sensing element SEN<b>14</b> over a practical range of operating gaps. However, due to the operating gap at least some of the marginal magnetic flux MF may not be effectively coupled through the sensing element SEN<b>14</b>. For example, at a relatively larger dimension for the operating gap GapZ, as exaggerated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, none of the marginal magnetic flux lines MFL<b>1</b>-MFL<b>3</b> are coupled through the sensing element SEN<b>14</b>, and do not contribute to the current Isense. As a result, for the configuration qualitatively illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the effective width Weff (represented by a dashed bar line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) of the signal modulating element SME that is sensed by the sensing element SEN<b>14</b> corresponds only to the coupled central magnetic flux lines CFL. It may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, that even as the operational gap GapZ is reduced, for example to couple the marginal magnetic flux line MFL<b>3</b> through the sensing element SEN<b>14</b>, the effective width Weff would still be less than the average dimension DSME of the signal modulating element SME.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Thus, contrary to conventional prior art teachings outlined above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a signal modulating element SME advantageously has an average dimension DSME that is greater than the desired effective width Weff, in order to have an effective width Weff that produces the desired maximum signal variation and/or desired signal profile vs. displacement as it is moved past the sensing elements SEN along the measuring axis direction. For example, in some implementations it may be desirable for the dimension Weff to be approximately 0.5*W1, which according to the foregoing discussion means that when using a practical operational gap GapZ the average dimension DSME of a signal modulating element SME may desirably be at least 0.6*W1, or 0.66*W1, or 0.7*W1, or more in some such implementations.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">It should be appreciated that when the signal modulating elements SME are conductive plates, rather than conductive loops as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a distribution of &#x201c;concentric&#x201d; eddy currents may be produced in such conductive plates in response to the generated changing magnetic field GCMF. These eddy currents are operationally comparable to the induced current lind shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. However, if the conductive plate has an average dimension DSME that is the same as the conductive loop SME shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, then due to their distributed &#x201c;concentric&#x201d; pattern of its eddy currents, their &#x201c;equivalent current location&#x201d; will be somewhere inside the edges of the conductive plate, resulting in an even smaller effective width Weff that than associated with a conductive loop of similar size. Consequently, in addition to using a relatively larger value of the average dimension DSME when using a relatively larger operating gap between the detector portion <b>367</b> and the scale pattern <b>380</b>, it may be especially desirable for a conductive plate type signal modulating element SME to have an average dimension DSME that is toward the larger end of the desirable ranges outlined above. For example, the inventor has found average dimension DSME between 0.7*W1 and 0.8*W1 to be advantageous in some such implementations.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">As a further consideration, regarding the desired signal profile vs. displacement it should be appreciated that the undesirable spatial harmonics included in the signal profile generally speaking depends on the shape of the signal modulating elements SME and their effective width Weff and the shape and width of the sensing elements SEN, as well as the operating gap between them. For example, in detector and scale configurations analogous to those outlined above, when the effective width Weff is approximately 0.5*W1, the even numbered spatial harmonics are largely eliminated from the detector signals. However, the odd spatial harmonics corresponding to 0.33*W1, and so on, may remain. It has been suggested in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/021,528, published as U.S. 2020/0003581, that configuring the signal modulating element SME to provide an effective width Weff of 0.66*W1 may tend to suppress the odd spatial harmonics corresponding to 0.33*W1. Alternatively, the inventor has recently learned that it has been suggested in the previously incorporated '708 patent that configuring the signal modulating elements with an actual width of &#x215a;*W1 (approximately 0.83*W1), with or without a slot of width &#x2159;*W1 in their middle may tend to suppress the odd spatial harmonics corresponding to 0.33*W1. It is noted that this fails to take into account the explanation of effective width Weff outlined above, and therefore not likely to operate as described in the '708 patent. In any case, these configurations have not provided the expected or desired level of spatial filtering, in practice. Due to the high accuracies already achieved by previously known state-of-the-art inductive position encoders, these configurations have not provided spatial filtering at the expected or predicted level, and have not desirably improved upon or advanced the state of the art in this regard.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As disclosed herein, the inventor has discovered certain configurations of the sensing elements SEN that may be used in combination with configurations of the signal modulating element SME outlined above to remedy the spatial filtering shortcomings outlined above. Various desirable configurations for the shape of the sensing elements SEN are described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b></figref>, and various desirable configurations according to prescribed relationships for the location and/or shape of the sensing elements SEN are described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>13</b>, and <b>14</b>-<b>17</b></figref>. However, prior to that, the definition or interpretation of certain dimensions and terms used in that description are clarified with reference to examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> are plan view diagrams schematically illustrating certain aspects of respective signal modulating element and sensing element implementations analogous to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, including additional examples of certain exemplary dimensions that may characterize their features according to principles disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> are plan view diagrams schematically illustrating respective inductive electronic position encoder implementations, illustrating further examples of the dimensions and terms DSENmax, DSENavg, DSME, EffRSME, EffASEN, and EffYSEN previously outlined with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The dimension YSEG is also introduced and explained. It will be appreciated that certain numbered components <b>5</b>XX of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> may correspond to and/or provide similar operations or functions as similarly numbered components <b>3</b>XX of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and may be similarly understood unless otherwise indicated.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> show the spatial wavelength W1 and the previously outlined dimensions and terms as applied to a non-straight boundary profile for the signal modulating elements SME in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, and for a non-straight boundary profile for a sensing element in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>. The previously outlined effective region EffRSME of the signal modulating elements SME is indicated by a dotted fill within the region or area of the signal modulating elements SME that falls within its boundaries shown in dashed outline and that is aligned with or overlaps the interior area INTA. DSME is the average dimension along the measuring axis direction MA of the effective region EffRSME of a signal modulating element SME. In various implementations, the average dimension DSME may be taken as the area of the effective region EffRSME of a signal modulating element SME divided by the y-axis direction dimension of that effective region EffRSME. For convenience and consistency of definition, for conductive plate type signal modulating elements SME the relevant dimensions may correspond to the edge of the SME, and for conductive loop type signal modulating elements SME the relevant dimensions may correspond to the conductors midline. For the implementations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, the y-axis direction dimension of that effective region EffRSME is the same as the dimension YSEP, because the dimension YSEP of the interior area INTA of the field generating coil FGC is smaller than, and included within, the y-axis dimension of the signal modulating elements SME. However, this need not be the case in all implementations (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), and the previous definition of the effective region EffRSME is more general, including cases where the y-axis direction dimension of that effective region EffRSME is less than the dimension YSEP.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The previously outlined effective area EffASEN of the sensing elements SEN is indicated by slanted line fill within the area of a sensing element SEN that falls within its boundaries shown in solid outline and that is aligned with or overlaps the interior area INTA. As previously outlined, DSENmax is the maximum sensing element width dimension along the x-axis or measuring axis direction MA for the effective area EffASEN of the sensing element SEN. DSENavg is the average sensing element width dimension, defined as DSENavg=EffASEN/EffYSEN. As previously outlined, EffYSEN is the y-axis dimension of the sensing element effective area EffASEN. In the particular implementations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, the effective y-axis dimension EffYSEN is equal to YSEP, because each of the sensing elements SEN has a maximum sensing element dimension along the y-axis direction that exceeds YSEP and its effective area EffASEN therefore extends over the entire dimension YSEP. For the particular implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the effective area EffASEN has parallel sides that are perpendicular to the x-axis direction and have a dimension YSEG that spans YSEP, therefore DSENavg is the same as DSENmax. YSEG is defined for convenience as the y-direction of dimension of segments of the conductors that define sensing elements SEN that are located at the maximum dimension DSENmax apart from one another and that extend straight along the y-axis direction. For the particular implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the effective area EffASEN has a configuration that has the dimension DSENmax at its middle along the y-axis direction, but its sides taper or curve in such that it becomes narrower toward the top and bottom of its effective area EffASEN. Therefore, DSENavg is somewhat less than DSENmax, as shown. For convenience and consistency of definition, when determining DSENavg=EffASEN/EffYSEN a sensing element SEN the relevant dimensions may correspond to the midline of its defining conductors. In the implementations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, DSENmax is nominally 0.5*W1. However, this value is not limiting (e.g., as shown below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). The dimensions DSENavg of the configurations of sensing elements SEN shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> are not preferred according to principles outlined below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, and are presented only to clarify the definition or determination of DSENavg. The dimension CCSEN shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is the center-to-center spacing of the sensing elements SEN along the x-axis direction. In various embodiments, it may be advantageous if CCSEN is 0.5*W1, regardless of the shape or dimension DSENavg of the sensing elements SEN.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> also illustrate a dimension DSPC, which is equal to W1 minus DSME. Described a first way, the dimension DSPC may be described as corresponding to &#x201c;non-signal modulating space&#x201d; between the signal modulating elements SME of the first type. However, more generally described a second way that applies to various other implementations of a periodic scale pattern, the dimension DSPC may be described as corresponding to signal modulating elements of a second type are located between the signal modulating elements SME of the first type along the measuring axis direction. The signal modulating elements of the second type are configured to have relatively less effect on the changing magnetic flux in comparison to the signal modulating elements SME of the first type. For example, in some implementations, the signal modulating elements of the second type comprise regions of non-conductive material. In some such implementations, the signal modulating elements of the second type comprise regions of a non-conductive scale substrate, wherein the first type of signal modulating elements SME comprise conductors fabricated and/or fixed on the non-conductive scale substrate. As another example, in some implementations, the signal modulating elements of the second type may comprise &#x201c;more deeply recessed&#x201d; regions of a conductive material used to form the scale pattern and the signal modulating elements SME of the first type may comprise &#x201c;unrecessed&#x201d; regions of the conductive material.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Returning now to the discussion of filtering the 3<sup>rd </sup>spatial harmonic error component (which is periodic at 0.33*W1) from the sensing element signals, as previously noted, the inventor has discovered certain configurations of the sensing elements SEN that may be used in combination with configurations of the signal modulating element SME outlined above to remedy the spatial filtering shortcomings outlined above. It has been known in the prior art to attempt to filter the 3<sup>rd </sup>spatial harmonic error component from the sensing element signals by various means. One approach has been to configure the sensing elements in a sinusoidal shape which theoretically includes only the fundamental spatial frequency corresponding to W1. However, due to various practical considerations and/or fabrication limitations and/or assembly or gap variations, this has not completely suppressed the 3<sup>rd </sup>spatial harmonic error component. Another approach has been to arrange sets of sensing elements SETSEN at spatial phases that are 0.33*W1 apart from one another and process the resulting signals to remove the 3<sup>rd </sup>spatial harmonic error component. This approach is relatively effective, but in many applications it is desirable for practical reasons to provide quadrature signals (that is, at spatial phases that are 0.25*W1 apart) from the sets of sensing elements SETSEN, which may make it difficult or impractical to arrange sets of sensing elements SETSEN at spatial phases that are 0.33*W1 apart (e.g., due to layout constraints or interferences).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">To solve the problems and deficiencies inherent in the approached outlined above, the inventor has discovered that configurations of the sensing elements SEN that provide a sensing element average dimension DSENavg in a particularly advantageous range may be used in combination with configurations of the signal modulating element SME outlined above to substantially filter and/or suppress the 3<sup>rd </sup>spatial harmonic error component. Surprisingly, for some detector portion and/or sensing element configurations in some encoders, the particularly advantageous range does not include 0.33*W1, which might otherwise be expected based on obvious theoretical considerations. For example, as disclosed herein, it is particularly advantageous for some detector portion and/or sensing element configurations when sensing elements SEN are configured to provide a sensing element average dimension DSENavg that is at least 0.285*W1 and at most 0.315*W1 is used in combination with signal modulating elements SME that have an average dimension DSME that is at least 0.55*W1 and at most 0.8*W1, for a practical range of wavelengths W1 and operating gaps.

In some implementations, it may be particularly desirable if DSENavg is at least 0.29*W1 and at most 0.31*W1.

However, the feedthroughs FT are located within the interior area INTA. This has the advantage that the field generating coil FGC may be fabricated on the first and/or second fabrication layer in this implementation, which reduces the manufacturing cost of the detector portion <b>767</b>.

In some such implementations, DSENavg=0.30*W1 has been verified to be particularly advantageous. However, as implied by previous discussion, this depends to some extent on the particular wavelength W1, and the particular operating gap, and the particular dimension DSME, and shape and construction of the signal modulating element(s) SME.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">It should be appreciated that the 3<sup>rd </sup>spatial harmonic error content in the signal from a set of signal modulating elements SETSEN is extremely sensitive to the selection of dimensions within the ranges disclosed above. For example, it is desirable that the dimension DESNavg be selected such that it rejects the 3<sup>rd </sup>spatial harmonic error content in a signal for practical variations in the fabricated dimensions and/or variations in the operating gap associated with a set of signal modulating elements SETSEN. Surprisingly, when using sensing element shapes and signal modulating elements SME similar to those outlined above, the inventor has discovered that in one implementation configured to provide a value of 0.3*W1 for DSENavg, error components associated with the 3<sup>rd </sup>spatial harmonic error content are uniformly insensitive to variations of the dimension DSME of the signal modulating elements SEN of over a range DSME=0.72*W1 to DSME=0.79*W1. In contrast, if the value DSENavg is changed by as little as 10% from this value (e.g., to 0.27*W1 or 0.33*W1) then error components associated with the 3<sup>rd </sup>spatial harmonic error content increase unacceptably by a factor of 10 or more for variations in the sensing elements SEN of over the range of DSME=0.72*W1 to DSME=0.79*W1.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Regarding why the advantageous range for the dimension DSENavg disclosed is significantly different than the &#x201c;naively&#x201d; expected value of 0.33*, one possible explanation is that error components arising from scale-position-dependent impedance variations in the detector are influenced by DSENavg. Such position-dependent impedance variations may be on the order of 1%, and have been unknown or not considered in the prior art. It may be possible that the advantageous range for DSENavg disclosed herein &#x201c;adjusts&#x201d; or tunes these impedance variations such that when their signal component contributions are &#x201c;aliased&#x201d; to combine with other sources of 3<sup>rd </sup>spatial harmonic error content, the sum of the effects is to negate the 3<sup>rd </sup>spatial harmonic error content. Such subtle effects and associated design characteristics have not been considered in the prior art. It should be appreciated that although particularly advantageous values of DSENavg have been verified and identified above for detector portion and signal modulating element implementations similar to those outlined above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, such values are exemplary only and not limiting. For example, other detector portion and/or signal modulating element implementations, may lead to a different advantageous range of values of DSENavg, for example, possibly due to different error components arising from scale-position-dependent impedance variations in the detector portion, as outlined above. Thus, it should be appreciated that a particular detector portion configured according to the first type or second type of prescribed relationship principles disclosed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>17</b></figref> may benefit from using a particular value of DSENavg that falls outside of the range 0.285*W1 to 0.315*W1. For example, a value of DSENavg somewhere within the larger range of 0.33*W1+/&#x2212;15% may be useful for sufficiently reducing or suppressing unwanted 3<sup>rd </sup>spatial harmonic detector signal components in various detector portions configured according to the first type or second type of prescribed relationship principles disclosed below. In particular, when such detector portions are configured to sufficiently reduce or suppress unwanted 3<sup>rd </sup>spatial harmonic detector signal components using a value of DSENavg somewhere within the range of 0.33*W1+/&#x2212;15%, and additionally are configured to reduce or suppress unwanted 5<sup>th </sup>(or 7<sup>th</sup>, or 9<sup>th</sup>) spatial harmonic detector signal components according to the first type or second type of prescribed relationship principles as outlined below, an unprecedented level of spatial filtering is provided to suppress unwanted spatial harmonics. Furthermore, this unprecedented level of spatial filtering is provided using a layout for the detector portion that is less complicated, higher performing, and more economical to fabricate.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>13</b></figref> are partly representational, partly schematic, plan view diagrams illustrating certain aspects of various exemplary configurations of a set of sensing elements SETSEN configured or arranged according to a first type of prescribed relationship principles disclosed herein, such that the sensing elements SETSEN are located to provide spatially filtered signals for use in a detector portion X<b>67</b> (e.g., <b>967</b>, <b>1367</b>, etc.) in an electronic position encoder such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, along with respective compatible field generating coil configurations FGC and scale patterns X<b>80</b> (e.g., <b>980</b>, <b>1380</b>, etc.), and including various dimensions that may characterize the first type of prescribed relationship principles used for locating their sensing elements SETSEN.

According to a first aspect of the implementation, the first (second) set of sensing elements SETSEN-Ph<b>0</b> (SETSEN-Ph<b>90</b>) corresponding to the respective nominal spatial phase Ph<b>0</b> (Ph<b>90</b>) comprises the features A1, B1, C1, and D1, and is configured according to the feature C1 wherein it is configured with a number of pairs of adjacent positive polarity loop and negative polarity loop sensing element effective areas shifted along the measuring axis direction in the first direction by the amount (W1)/4K, and the same number of pairs of adjacent positive polarity loop and negative polarity loop sensing element effective areas shifted along the measuring axis in the direction opposite to the first direction by the amount (W1)/4K.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">Either of the first or second sets of sensing elements SETSEN-Ph<b>0</b> and SETSEN-Ph<b>90</b> may be further described as follows.

It may provide an additional advantage as follows. As previously indicated the aligned area centroids of the implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> provide the advantage that the respective operating gaps and signal strength of the first and second sets of sensing elements will be affected similarly by any static or dynamic pitch misalignment, which eliminates the majority of error contributions that may otherwise arise due to pitch misalignment. However, it may be appreciated that all of the sensing elements SEN on the left half of the implementation are shifted in a respective first direction by a spatial phase shift of (W1)/4K, and all of the sensing elements SEN on the right half of the implementation are shifted in the respective opposite direction by a spatial phase shift of (W1)/4K. The signal contributions from the right and left half will become unbalanced by a static or dynamic pitch misalignment. As a result, the signal contributions from the opposing spatial phase shifts in the right and left half will become unbalanced to some extent, resulting in a small position error sensitivity to pitch misalignment. In contrast, in the implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, pairs of sensing elements SEN are shifted in both directions in both the right and left halves of the implementation, such that spatial phase errors due static or dynamic pitch misalignment are reduced or eliminated. As one instructive example, it will be understood that because the sensing elements SEN<b>1</b> and SEN<b>8</b>, at opposite ends of the right and left halves, are shifted in the same direction by (W1)/4K in the implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, that both the amplitude and spatial phase of their summed signal contributions is nominally unchanged by pitch misalignment.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">It should be appreciated that first aspect outlined above may provide some advantage as outlined above in certain implementations, even if the second aspect is not used.

Briefly, the scale pattern <b>1380</b> comprises signal modulating elements SME arranged in first and second tracks FPT and SPT, respectively, that extend along the measuring axis direction MA, as shown. The field generating coil FGC is configured to have a first portion that surrounds a first interior area portion FINTA aligned with the first track FPT, and a second portion that surrounds a second interior area SINTA aligned with the second track SPT. The connections and current flow between the portions of the field generating coil FGC will be understood based on the example current flow arrows shown therein in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">In this implementation, the first set of sensing elements SETSEN-Ph<b>0</b> includes two separated portions SETSEN-Ph<b>90</b>sub<b>1</b> and SETSEN-Ph<b>90</b>sub<b>2</b>, according to previously disclosed principles. Their layout includes minor adaptations for better compatibility with a two track implementation, as will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. The first set of sensing elements SETSEN-Ph<b>0</b> corresponding to the nominal spatial phase Ph<b>0</b>nom comprises sensing elements SEN comprising conductive loops that each extend transverse to the measuring axis direction MA across the first and second interior area portions FINTA and SINTA to define first and second sensing element effective area portions FEffASEN and SEffASEN corresponding to those portions of the sensing element SEN that are aligned with or overlap the first and second interior area portions FINTA and SINTA, respectively. Accordingly, a detector signal contribution arising in each conductive loop combines the respective detector signal contributions from its first and second sensing element effective area portions FEffASEN and SEffASEN. In comparison to the previous description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the sum of first and second sensing element effective area portions FEffASEN and SEffASEN of a sensing element SEN may be interpreted as the sensing element effective area EffASen.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">In the implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the scale pattern <b>1380</b> comprises signal modulating elements SME (or signal modulating element portions SME) periodically arranged in the first track FPT according to the wavelength W1, and signal modulating elements SME (or signal modulating element portions SME) periodically arranged in the second track SPT according to the wavelength W1, wherein the periodic arrangements in the first and second tracks FPT and SPT are offset relative to one another by (W1)/2. In addition, the field generating coil FGC is configured to generate a first polarity of changing magnetic flux in the first interior area portion FINTA and an opposite second polarity of changing magnetic flux in in the second interior area SINTA.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">The nature of the combined detector signal contributions is clarified by the paired signs &#x201c;+,+&#x201d; or &#x201c;+,&#x2212;&#x201d; or &#x201c;&#x2212;,&#x2212;&#x201d; or &#x201c;&#x2212;,+&#x201d; in the interior of each sensing element SEN in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, taken in combination with any overlapping signal modulating element SME. The first sign in a pair indicates the loop polarity of a sensing element, and the second sign in a pair indicates the generated flux polarity in the corresponding interior area portion. As one example, in the sensing element SEN<b>2</b>, the signal contribution from the first sensing element effective area portion FEffASEN is a nominal positive polarity contribution which is not reduced by an overlapping signal modulating element SME. The signal contribution from the second sensing element effective area portion FEffASEN would be a nominal negative polarity contribution (due to the negative polarity flux), however, this contribution is reduced or substantially eliminated by the overlapping signal modulating element SME. As a result, the net signal contribution of the sensing element SEN<b>2</b> for the scale position that is illustrated is a net positive signal contribution. The signal contributions of other sensing elements SEN, and/or for other scale positions, may be understood by analogy with the foregoing explanation, and/or as detailed in the '199 patent.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">As previously indicated, the sum of the first and second sensing element effective area portions FEffASEN and SEffASEN of a sensing element SEN may be interpreted as its sensing element effective area EffASen, with regard to a two track implementation.

In the particular implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the sensing element average dimension DSENavg (=EffASEN/EffYSEN) according to the interpretation above is illustrated to fall in the range 0.33*W1+/&#x2212;15%, which conforms to the previous description of the principle or feature B1.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">It will be appreciated that the implementations of the first type or second type disclosed herein with reference to the two track configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, and further below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> are exemplary only, and not limiting.
