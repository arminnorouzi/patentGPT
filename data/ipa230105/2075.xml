Some UAVs are recovered by recovery systems, which employ a recovery tether line that is suspended vertically. In particular, a UAV contacts and/or impacts the tether line and, as a result, the UAV is decelerated and/or stopped from flight, thereby enabling recovery of the UAV without need for a runway. In some known implementations, a parachute or support beam or movable boom is used to suspend the tether line for recovery of the UAV.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Examples disclosed herein enable an effective and relatively low cost recovery of an aircraft (e.g., a UAV) via a stationary platform or a moving vehicle or vessel (e.g., a ship, etc.). According to examples disclosed herein, multiple parafoils (e.g., parafoil kites) extend from a boat or a stationary platform. In particular, a kite generates lift to support and/or suspend a tether line carried by a vessel while a parafoil operatively coupled to the tether line is deployed, thereby enabling controlled deceleration of the aircraft. In other words, the kite supports and/or suspends the tether line while the parafoil decelerates the aircraft. The parafoil can be implemented as a kite, parasail or parachute, for example. Further, the aforementioned tether line can be operatively coupled to a tension device (e.g., a tensioner, a winch, a motorized winch, etc.). The tension device is implemented to retrieve the tether line along with the kite and the aircraft.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to examples disclosed herein, the kite supports the tether line and the parafoil is deployed and/or launched from the tether line in response to the aircraft contacting and/or impacting the tether line. For example, an impact of a wing (e.g., a distal portion of a wing) with the tether line causes a release to launch/deploy the parafoil away from the tether line. In turn, the parafoil expands and/or unfolds as it is deployed from the tether line. In some examples, the parafoil is propelled and/or pushed away from the tether line. The release can include at least a frangible portion (e.g., a breakable section, a portion prone to fracturing) that breaks (e.g., fractures, bends, etc.) when the wing impacts and/or pulls on the tether line.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some examples, a tensioner is operatively coupled to the tether line and/or the release. In some examples, the release includes and/or is operatively coupled to a bag utilized to enclose and/or restrain the parafoil when the parafoil is folded and stowed. In some examples, the bag is moved away from and/or slid away from the parafoil upon movement of the tether line and/or impact of the aircraft with the tether line. In some examples, a spring or other energy storage device is implemented to propel and/or launch the parafoil away from the tether line in response to the aircraft contacting the tether line. In some examples, a shape of the kite is altered and/or changed in response to the aircraft contacting the tether line and/or the parafoil being deployed. In some such examples, the kite is converted to a trailing edge device.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used herein, the term &#x201c;parafoil&#x201d; refers to a nonrigid airfoil flight structure. Accordingly, the term &#x201c;parafoil&#x201d; can refer to a kite, a parachute, a parasail, a glider, any similar type of flight structure to the aforementioned examples, or a combination of any similar type of flight structures.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a UAV recovery system <b>100</b> in accordance with teachings of this disclosure. The UAV recovery system <b>100</b> of the illustrated example is implemented on a vessel <b>101</b> and includes a tether line control mount <b>102</b>, which includes a boom (e.g., a lower tether boom, a rotatable boom, a swivel boom, a pivoting boom, etc.) <b>104</b> and boom supports <b>106</b>. In the illustrated example, a tether line <b>108</b> extends from the tether line control mount <b>102</b> while a tensioner or tension device <b>110</b>, which is implemented as a winch in this example, is operatively coupled to the tether line <b>108</b>. Further, the tether line <b>108</b> is operatively coupled to a kite (e.g., a parafoil kite, a drogue kite, a first kite, etc.) <b>116</b> having support lines (e.g., kite lines, foil lines, etc.) <b>117</b> and a foil (e.g., a lift foil, a lift generation foil, a kite body) <b>118</b>. The UAV recovery system <b>100</b> of the illustrated example is implemented to capture an aircraft <b>120</b>, which is a UAV in this example. In other examples, the aircraft <b>120</b> may be implemented as another type of aircraft (e.g., a manned aircraft), spacecraft, etc.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The example UAV <b>120</b> includes a fuselage <b>121</b>, wings <b>122</b> each of which includes a distal capture portion <b>123</b>, and a propulsion system <b>124</b> with propellers <b>125</b>. In this example, the distal capture portion <b>123</b> extends from at least one of the corresponding wings <b>122</b> generally along a direction of movement of the UAV <b>120</b>. However, any appropriate type of capture or recovery mechanism can, instead, be implemented on any other portion and/or component (e.g., the fuselage <b>121</b>) of the UAV <b>120</b>. Further, any other appropriate type of propulsion of the UAV <b>120</b> can instead be implemented.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the UAV recovery system <b>100</b> includes a parafoil (e.g., a second auxiliary kite, a second kite, a parasail, a parachute, etc.) <b>130</b>, which is depicted as stored/stowed onto the tether line <b>108</b>. As will be described below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>7</b></figref>, the parafoil <b>130</b> is deployable from the tether line <b>108</b> and/or a release component or device operatively coupled to the tether line <b>108</b> when the UAV <b>120</b> contacts and/or impacts the tether line <b>108</b>. In this example, the parafoil <b>130</b> is placed in an inline arrangement such that the parafoil <b>130</b> is positioned on the tether line <b>108</b> between the boom <b>104</b> and the kite <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">To recover and/or capture the UAV <b>120</b> as the UAV <b>120</b> moves along a flight path <b>126</b>, one of the distal capture portions <b>123</b> is brought into contact with the tether line <b>108</b>. As a result, the parafoil <b>130</b> is deployed to decelerate and or control movement of the UAV <b>120</b>. In turn, the UAV <b>120</b> is brought to a rest and remains attached to the tether line <b>108</b>. In this example, the tether line <b>108</b> is suspended by the kite <b>116</b> as the kite <b>116</b> generates lift to support the tether line <b>108</b> in the air (e.g., substantially vertically in the air, within 5 degrees from vertical). However, in some examples, subsequent to decelerating the UAV <b>120</b> by deploying the parafoil <b>130</b>, a shape and/or overall geometry of the kite <b>116</b> is changed (e.g., the kite <b>116</b> changes shape to transition to a trailing edge drag device). For example, the parafoil <b>130</b> may pull on at least a portion of the kite <b>116</b> to change a shape of the kite <b>116</b> while the parafoil <b>130</b> is deployed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some examples, the tensioner <b>110</b> maintains a tension of the tether line <b>108</b> extending between the tether line control mount <b>102</b> and the kite <b>116</b> within a threshold range and/or at a nominal tension value (e.g., to facilitate capture of the UAV <b>120</b> and/or release of the parafoil <b>130</b>). In some examples, the kite <b>116</b> is steered to direct the tether line <b>108</b> within a requisite range of the aforementioned flight path <b>126</b> for deployment of the parafoil <b>130</b> during capture of the UAV <b>120</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the kite <b>116</b> is directed toward to the flight path <b>126</b> based on a desired impact force of the tether line <b>108</b> with the distal capture portion <b>123</b>. In some examples, a degree to which the parafoil <b>130</b> is expanded and/or deployed varies with a degree of impact force of the UAV <b>120</b> with the tether line <b>108</b>. In some other examples, the kite <b>116</b> is coupled to and/or extends from the parafoil <b>130</b> instead of the tether line <b>108</b>. In some examples, a steering device <b>140</b> is implemented to direct lateral and/or translation movement of the tether line control mount <b>102</b> and/or the kite <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">While the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is shown in the context of the vessel <b>101</b>, examples disclosed herein can be applied to any stationary or moving support structure (e.g., a vehicle).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> depict an example recovery sequence of in accordance with teachings of this disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> depicts the UAV <b>120</b> approaching the tether line <b>108</b>, which extends between the vessel <b>101</b> and the kite <b>116</b>. In this example, the kite <b>116</b> is supporting the tether line <b>108</b> as the UAV <b>120</b> is being controlled and/or navigated to cause the distal capture portion <b>123</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the UAV <b>120</b> to contact the tether line <b>108</b> and, thus, decelerate the UAV <b>120</b>. In this example, the parafoil <b>130</b> remains undeployed and positioned on the tether line <b>108</b> proximate the kite <b>116</b>. Particularly, the example parafoil <b>130</b> remains stowed and unfolded prior to being deployed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the UAV <b>120</b> is shown in contact with the tether line <b>108</b>. In this example, the distal portion <b>123</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is caught on the tether line <b>108</b>, thereby causing the parafoil <b>130</b> to deploy from the tether line <b>108</b>. As a result, an amount of force translated to the UAV <b>120</b> is reduced. In this example, the parafoil <b>130</b> is unfolded and/or expanded during the deployment thereof, thereby decelerating the UAV <b>120</b>.

Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, a kite <b>302</b> is shown supporting the tether line <b>108</b> and a parafoil <b>304</b>. In this particular example, the kite <b>302</b> is configured as a frame or diamond kite and the parafoil <b>304</b>, which is implemented as a parafoil kite in this example, is positioned on the tether line <b>108</b> between the kite <b>302</b> and a structure holding the tether line <b>108</b>, such as the vessel <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As can be seen in the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the UAV <b>120</b> is depicted impacting the tether line <b>108</b>. As a result of the impact between the UAV <b>120</b> and the tether line <b>108</b>, the parafoil <b>304</b> begins to expand and deploy, thereby causing the kite <b>302</b> to move to a higher altitude from the ground/sea. In other words, the deployment of the kite <b>302</b> from the tether line <b>108</b> extends an effective distance from the kite <b>302</b> to the ground/sea. Additionally or alternatively, the kite <b>302</b> is coupled to the parafoil <b>304</b> instead of the tether line <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, the parafoil <b>304</b> is depicted as fully deployed.

In some examples, the kite <b>402</b> also plays a role in decelerating the UAV <b>120</b> subsequent to impact of the UAV <b>120</b> with the tether line <b>108</b>. In this example, the kite <b>402</b> extends from a portion of the parafoil <b>404</b> when the parafoil <b>404</b> is deployed.

For example, the kite <b>402</b> can be folded, reshaped and or altered to a trailing edge shape upon impact of the UAV <b>120</b> with the tether line <b>108</b>. In some such examples, folding of the kite <b>402</b> can result from the release of the parafoil <b>404</b> from the tether line <b>108</b> and/or a change in tension of the tether line <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts an example kite release system <b>500</b> that can be implemented in examples disclosed herein.

In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a release assembly <b>506</b> is implemented to deploy a parafoil <b>504</b> from the tether line <b>108</b>. As will be discussed in greater detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the release assembly <b>506</b> causes deployment of the parafoil <b>504</b> in response to impact of the UAV <b>120</b> with the tether line <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a detailed view of a portion of the example kite release system <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. According to the illustrated example, the release assembly <b>506</b> is shown extending between an upper portion <b>601</b><i>a </i>and a lower portion <b>601</b><i>b </i>of the tether line <b>108</b>. The example release assembly <b>506</b> includes a release device (e.g., a release tension device, a frangible release device, a spring-loaded release, etc.) <b>602</b> that is positioned between the upper portion <b>601</b><i>a </i>and a coiled portion <b>606</b> of the tether line <b>108</b>. In this example, the coiled portion <b>606</b> extends between the release device <b>602</b> and the upper portion <b>601</b><i>b </i>of the tether line <b>108</b>. In other examples, the coiled portion <b>606</b> is not part of the tether line <b>108</b>. In some examples, the parafoil <b>504</b> is stowed, captivated and/or stored in a bag <b>610</b>. In some examples, a spring or energy-storage device <b>612</b> is implemented.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">To release and deploy the parafoil <b>504</b> when the UAV <b>120</b> impacts the tether line <b>108</b>, an increase in tension (e.g., a rapid increase in tension) of the tether line <b>108</b> causes the release device <b>602</b> to open (e.g., break, unlock, etc.) and, in turn, enables the coiled portion <b>606</b> to uncoil and/or expand, thereby enabling the kite <b>502</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> to move away from the parafoil <b>504</b>. As a result, the parafoil <b>504</b> is unfolded and deployed from the tether line <b>108</b>. In this example, air flowing proximate to the parafoil <b>504</b> facilitates expansion and/or unfolding of the parafoil <b>504</b>. Additionally or alternatively, movement and/or displacement of the bag <b>610</b> away from the parafoil <b>504</b> causes the parafoil <b>504</b> to expand, unfold and/or deploy. In some examples, the bag <b>610</b> is torn as the parafoil <b>504</b> is deployed (e.g., the bag <b>610</b> is frangible). Additionally or alternatively, the bag <b>610</b> and/or an opening of the bag <b>610</b> is widened when the parafoil <b>504</b> is being deployed to facilitate removal of the parafoil <b>504</b> therefrom. In some examples, the bag <b>610</b> is torn in response to the UAV <b>120</b> contacting the tether line <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some examples, the release device <b>602</b> is frangible. For example, the release device <b>602</b> can break and/or fracture when a tension and/or force of the tether line <b>108</b> exceeds a threshold (e.g., a threshold force value). In some such examples, the release device <b>602</b> can be generally ring-shaped (e.g., an annular ring shape), for example, such that at least a portion of its ring-shape geometry can fracture when tension of the tether line <b>108</b> exceeds the threshold in response to the UAV <b>120</b> impacting the tether line <b>108</b>. In some examples, movement of the tether line <b>108</b> (e.g., movement of the lower portion <b>601</b><i>b</i>) causes the bag <b>610</b> to separate from (e.g., slide off, slip off, uncover, etc.) the parafoil <b>504</b>. In some examples, the spring or energy-storage device <b>612</b> is implemented to propel and/or launch the parafoil <b>504</b> away from the tether line <b>108</b> and/or the bag <b>610</b> in response to the UAV <b>120</b> contacting the tether line <b>108</b>. In some examples, the tether line <b>108</b> and/or the coiled portion <b>606</b> is coupled to a bridle associated with the parafoil <b>504</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Any of the example features and/or aspects described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref> can be combined or implemented separately.

The example method <b>700</b> begins as a kite (e.g., the kite <b>116</b>, the kite <b>302</b>, the kite <b>402</b>, the kite <b>502</b>) is about to be deployed and/or launched to support the tether line <b>108</b> from a ground-based station and/or vehicle (e.g., a land-based vehicle, a watercraft, submersible, an aircraft, a spacecraft, etc.). A parafoil (e.g., the parafoil <b>130</b>, the parafoil <b>304</b>, the parafoil <b>404</b>, the parafoil <b>504</b>) is currently stowed and folded in a compartment or other storage device (e.g., the bag <b>610</b>) associated with the tether line <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">At block <b>702</b>, the kite is deployed to suspend the tether line <b>108</b>. In this example, the kite is caused to hover and/or be suspended in the air at a desired height for recovery of the UAV <b>120</b> (e.g., a recovery flying altitude of the UAV <b>120</b>, a height in which the UAV <b>120</b> can be recovered without significant loading and/or forces, etc.).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">At block <b>704</b>, in some examples, it is determined if a tension of the tether line <b>108</b> is within a threshold range or value. The threshold range or value can correspond to a release, a breakage or fracture value associated with the release device <b>602</b>. For example, if the tension of the tether line <b>108</b> is within the threshold (block <b>704</b>), control of the process proceeds to block <b>708</b>. Otherwise, the process proceeds to block <b>706</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">At block <b>706</b>, the tension of the tether line <b>108</b> is adjusted by the tension device <b>110</b>. In some examples, the tension of the tether line <b>108</b> is adjusted to an amount of tension corresponding to a working range (e.g., operating range) of the release assembly <b>506</b> and/or the release device <b>602</b>. For example, the tension of the tether line <b>108</b> can be adjusted so that the UAV <b>120</b> impacting the tether line <b>108</b> can release and/or cause intended breakage of the release device <b>602</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">At block <b>708</b>, the UAV <b>120</b> is caused to impact and/or contact the tether line <b>108</b>. In this example, the UAV <b>120</b> is directed to fly toward the tether line <b>108</b> so that at least a portion of the UAV <b>120</b> contacts and is captured by the tether line <b>108</b>. In some examples, the UAV <b>120</b> is controlled to impact the tether line <b>108</b> at a defined speed range.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">At block <b>710</b>, the parafoil is deployed from the tether line <b>108</b> in response to the UAV <b>120</b> contacting/impacting the tether line <b>108</b>. In some examples, the parafoil is deployed from the kite. In the illustrated example, the parafoil is deployed to facilitate deceleration of the UAV <b>120</b> in a controlled manner. In some examples, the unfolding and/or expansion of the parafoil also facilitates deceleration of the UAV <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">At block <b>712</b>, the UAV <b>120</b> is drawn via the tether line <b>108</b>. In this example, the UAV <b>120</b> is drawn toward the vessel <b>101</b> for recovery of the UAV <b>120</b>. In other examples, the UAV <b>120</b> is drawn toward a stationary ground-based structure on land.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">At block <b>714</b>, it is determined whether to repeat the process.
