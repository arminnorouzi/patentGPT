More particularly, it includes two intermediate attachment members, it being foreseen that each of them are to be coupled to a respective articulated element and to a respective tray, wherein each of the intermediate attachment members includes first coupling means configured to be coupled to a respective articulated element and second coupling means configured to be coupled to a respective tray.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Due to these features, a configuration is obtained that enables two adjoining trays to be hinged both in the horizontal plane and in the vertical plane. Moreover, the very operator or assembler can decide in real time whether a hinged connection of trays in the horizontal plane or in the vertical plane is required, and consequently, apply the corresponding parts as appropriate.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the intermediate attachment member consists of a body in the shape of an elongated plate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the first coupling means of the intermediate attachment member comprise housings present at one of the ends thereof, for the insertion of an extension present in the first or second articulated member that includes a clipping retention system.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the invention, the extension can have a harpoon-shaped ending.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the second coupling means of the intermediate attachment member consist of a body with at least one through hole configured for the insertion of a screw member.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thus, the multi-position hinge described represents an innovative structure with structural and constituent features heretofore unknown for its intended purpose, reasons which, taken together with its usefulness, provide it with sufficient grounds for obtaining the requested exclusivity

num="0026">Embodiments of the multi-position hinge for the angular connection of two cable trays (<b>100</b>) comprise a pin (<b>1</b>), made, for example, of polymeric material (such as PVC) that defines a geometric articulation axis, a first member (<b>2</b>) and a second member (<b>3</b>) that are articulated together around said geometric axis by means of the pin (<b>1</b>), said first and second members (<b>2</b>, <b>3</b>) being configured so that each is linked with a tray.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is worth mentioning that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a hinge configured for working in a horizontal plane, whereas <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a hinge configured for working in a vertical plane, the same common portions having the same numerical references.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref> show two arrangements of cable trays (<b>100</b>) joined together, through a pair of hinges such as those described below, each of them being housed in side walls of each of the cable trays (<b>100</b>).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The multi-position hinge includes two intermediate attachment members (<b>4</b>) that are the same in shape and size, having the shape of an elongated plate, it being foreseen that each of these intermediate attachment members (<b>4</b>) are to be coupled to a respective articulated member (<b>2</b>, <b>3</b>) and to a respective cable tray (<b>100</b>). Each intermediate attachment member (<b>4</b>) includes first coupling means configured to be coupled to a respective member (<b>2</b>, <b>3</b>) articulated together and second coupling means configured to be coupled to a respective cable tray (<b>100</b>) that will be explained in more detail later.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Now, with regard to the aforementioned first coupling means present in intermediate attachment members (<b>4</b>), they essentially comprise a housing (<b>40</b>) present at one of the ends of the body in the shape of a plate configured for the insertion of an extension present in the first or second articulated member (<b>2</b>, <b>3</b>) that includes a clipping retention system, said extension (<b>6</b>) having a harpoon-shaped ending. This extension (<b>6</b>) having a harpoon-shaped ending that can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is inserted by pressure into complementary slits (<b>7</b>) that are made, particularly in one of the sides of each intermediate attachment member (<b>4</b>).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">With particular reference to the second coupling means present in the intermediate attachment member (<b>4</b>), they consist of a plurality of oblong through holes (<b>41</b>) configured for the insertion of a screw member (<b>8</b>) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>), which extend in a longitudinal direction of the intermediate attachment member (<b>4</b>), which enables the position thereof to be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The details, shapes, dimensions and other secondary elements, used to manufacture the multi-position hinge of the invention, may be suitably replaced with others that do not depart from the scope defined by the claims included below.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
