APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/218,019 filed Jul. 2, 2021, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to lounge chairs, and, more particularly, relates to lounge chairs with specifically placed bolster supports.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most conventional lounge chairs are designed to enable a user to lie on his or her back in the supine (face up) position or prone (face down). Such lounge chairs are tri-fold lounge chairs that typically have a seatback that can be tilted up so that, when the user is in the supine position, the user's back is inclined relative to their legs, which generally extend straight out in front of the user's torso. These chairs, however, while supporting the entire human body, are not able to provide focused support on key areas of the body. As a result, individuals that have back (lumbar) pain or neck (cervical spine) pain, generally referred to as significant chiropractic problems, are not able to comfortably sit or lie down in a conventional lounge chair, which provides only a low level of support throughout.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, a need exists to overcome the problems with the prior art as discussed above.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention provides an orthopedic lounge chair that overcomes the hereinabove-mentioned disadvantages of the heretofore-known devices and methods of this general type and that includes at least three bolster supports, one bolster support being for the lumbar region, one bolster support being for the knee region, and one bolster support being for the ankle region, with an optional bolster support also for the neck region.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The additional firmness provided by the inventive bolster supports disclosed herein ensures the user receives extra support in particular areas of their body and alleviates or avoids pain for the user. The inventive bolsters, which provide extra support compared to a conventional lounge chair, supports the back, knee, ankle, and/or neck of the user. The bolster supports of the herein disclosed orthopedic lounge chair enhance user comfort and relaxation by supporting proper body alignment, thus providing both therapeutic and preventive health benefits. The instant orthopedic lounge chairs enable individuals having chiropractic problems to return to the comfort of relaxing in a wide variety of locations including by a pool, at the beach, or in the peace and tranquility of their own backyard.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Disclosed aspects include a tri-fold orthopedic lounge chair that includes an outer frame having a structural material defining a width and a length of the orthopedic lounge chair, providing an outer boundary for a back support section, a seat section, and a leg support section. In one embodiment, a sling material spans the width and the length of the orthopedic lounge chair. There can be support legs that include a hinge between the back support section and the seat section, a hinge between the seat section and the leg support section. In one embodiment, a hinge is 12 inches from the top of the chair, at the adjoining back-seat area (44.5 inches from the top), and at the adjoining leg support sections (66 inches from the top). The total chair length, in one embodiment, is 84.5 inches, but the invention is not so limited and can be other lengths and dimensions. The orthopedic lounge chair, according to an embodiment of the present invention, also includes a plurality of bolster supports, which each may be releasably attached to the sling material creating a lumbar bolster along the back support section, a knee bolster, and an ankle bolster positioned along the leg support section.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There can also be an optional neck bolster to support the neck and/or a rollout towel. The neck bolster can be a towel rolled into a tubular shape. The non-towel bolster supports can generally be removed and stored within a pouch on the backside of the sling material. Each of the bolster supports (the lumbar, knee, ankle, and neck bolsters) are generally attached to their corresponding pouch by two elastic straps. Elastic straps can be sewn to the pouch on one end and the strap can be secured to the back of the bolster by a fastener, such as a hook and loop fastener, e.g., VELCRO, patch affixed to the other end of the strap and the underside of the bolster. The attached straps provide some assurance the bolster is not lost and remains in the approximate position of its intended placement. The length of the strap allows a bolster to be pulled through from the (underside) pouch and rest on its front placement. Straps <b>902</b>, <b>904</b> will generally be about six-inches in length to enable adjustment to enable positioning the bolster supports in the user's preferred position. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> and description below).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">With the foregoing and other objects in view, there is provided, in accordance with the invention, an orthopedic lounge chair that includes a substantially flat support surface having a length, a width, a front side, and a back side and defining a back support section, a seat section foldably joined to the back support section at a first fold junction, and a leg support section foldably joined to the seat section at a second fold junction. A first bolster support is coupled to and rises away from the front side of the back support section, the first bolster support extending longitudinally at least a majority of the width of the support surface. A second bolster support is coupled to and rises away from the front side of the seat support section, the second bolster support extending longitudinally at least a majority of the width of the support surface. A third bolster support is coupled to and rises away from the front side of the leg support section, the third bolster support extending longitudinally a majority of the width of the support surface. The first bolster, the second bolster, and the third bolster are not located on the first fold junction or the second fold junction of the lounge chair. A towel is provided on the back side of the substantially flat support surface, the surface having a slot for the towel to pass from the back side to the front side of the support surface. The towel can be used as a fourth bolster when manually rolled into a tubular configuration and provided on the front side of the support surface.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with another feature, an embodiment of the present invention includes the first bolster support, the second bolster support, and the third bolster support rising above the substantially flat support surface at least 2.5 inches, but it can rise more than 2.5 inches, e.g., 3.5 inches.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with a further feature of the present invention, the first bolster support is located on the support surface in the area of a user's lumbar, the second bolster support is located on the support surface in the area of a user's knee; and the third bolster support is located on the support surface in the area of a user's ankle.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with an additional feature of the present invention, at least one bolster storage pocket is located on the back side of the substantially flat support surface, the at least one bolster storage pocket being accessible from the front side of the substantially flat support surface, through an aperture in the substantially flat support surface.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with one more feature of the present invention, the first bolster support, the second bolster support, and the third bolster support each have a firmness that prevents a compression of more than 50% when a human body is supported on the support surface.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with an additional feature of the present invention, a towel spool disposed on the back side of the support surface.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with another feature of the present invention, a towel is disposed on the towel spool, the towel being retractable and extendable on the towel spool and long enough to cover at least a majority of the length of the front side of the support surface.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with an added feature of the present invention, a frame defines and supports the back support section, seat section, and leg support section, the frame having at least two fold portions, where a first portion of the frame folds onto a second portion of the frame.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with yet another feature of the present invention, at least two support legs are foldably coupled to the frame.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in an orthopedic lounge chair, it is, nevertheless, not intended to be limited to the details shown because various modifications and structural changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims. Additionally, well-known elements of exemplary embodiments of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Other features that are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims. As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which can be embodied in various forms.

A support surface <b>109</b> made, in one embodiment, of a sling material, spans the width and the length of the frame <b>108</b>. The orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b> has three sections, including a back support section <b>126</b>, a seat section <b>124</b>, and a leg support section <b>122</b>. There is a support leg <b>131</b> attached to a hinge <b>137</b><i>a </i>that is positioned between the back support section <b>126</b> and the seat section <b>124</b> and a support leg <b>138</b> attached to a hinge <b>137</b><i>b </i>that is positioned between the seat section <b>124</b> and leg support section <b>122</b>. When the orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b> is in a fully open configuration as shown, an individual can sit upon the seat section <b>124</b>, lean against the back support section <b>126</b>, and have his/her feet resting upon the leg support section <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Each support leg <b>131</b>, <b>138</b> of the orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b> can fold in as well to secure a compact design. Support leg <b>131</b> will fold against the underside of the back of the seat section <b>124</b>. Support leg <b>138</b> can also fold either against the seat section <b>124</b> or against the leg support section <b>122</b>. Typical embodiments only allow the support legs <b>131</b>, <b>138</b> to fold in one direction, but the invention is not so limited. Each fold allows for a compact and functional design. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the chair <b>100</b> has an overall length of about 84.5 inches and a width of about 25 inches. These exemplary dimensions are slightly larger than common industry-used frames, but are still within limits of standard dimensions (and were tested with similarly constructed prototype for comfort and ease of transport with those of varying age, size and strength), however, other dimensions can be used as well. Selected measurements have been assessed for overall impact on chair construction and function with the conclusion that small adjustments for frame material size will not impact quality, ease of use, comfort, or functionality of chair attributes. Support legs <b>131</b>, <b>138</b>, in one embodiment, have a height of 18.5 inches. The 18.5-inch height on the leg support section <b>122</b> allows the user to adjust hinge <b>137</b><i>b </i>to a 90&#xb0; angle and form a standard upright chair position.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an elevational side view depiction of an exemplary orthopedic lounge chair <b>200</b> that shows bolster supports <b>204</b> (lumbar), <b>206</b> (knee), and <b>208</b> (ankle). As described above, the bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> function to support proper body alignment in both the supine (face-up) and the prone (face-down) positions when they are deployed. In this view, however, each of the bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> are in a non-deployed position, i.e., they are in their storage position under the support surface <b>201</b> of the lounge chair <b>100</b>. The orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b> can be enabled by the bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> to support (90&#xb0;) seated (bi-fold chair position) to (180&#xb0;) horizontal (trifold) position, and all angles of recline as facilitated by the orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b>. Once deployed, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the bolsters <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> provide an upward support force to a user laying on the support surface <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The term &#x201c;bolster support,&#x201d; as used herein, is typically an elongated article, such as a tubular pillow, for example, that is filled with material such as cotton, down, fiber, or the like, for support to render it with a select amount of firmness. The bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> provide extra support to selected areas of the body of the user. The bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> may include machine-washable covers made of a soft fabric. The bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> are relatively firm, with reference to how much (the distance) one of the bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> will compress whenever a given weight is applied to it.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Standard commercially available sized, e.g., 18 inches&#xd7;5.5 inches&#xd7;3.5 inches, half-moon shaped bolsters can be used as the bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> for comfort and medically supported therapeutic benefit. The invention, however, is in no way limited to these exemplary dimensions. Bolsters are commercially available in varying sizes and shapes, so that consumer preference or individual therapeutic benefit may be a viable option for bolster selection. The material for the bolster supports can include a polyester fiber or other types of fill with a suitable outside material (e.g., outer covering of pillow). For example, a water and mildew resistant polyester canvas and polyurethane backed material). Another example is a material marketed as SUNBRELLA or TEXTILENE. SUNBRELLA is an all-weather woven acrylic fabric-selected for its comfort, durability, stain resistance, UV protection, water repellence and fade resistance capability and TEXTILINE is made from polyester yarns that are individually coated with PVC, woven and heat set. Other suitable materials may be used as well.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Optionally the bolster supports can comprise an inflatable or &#x201c;pump&#x201d; action bolster, crank and gear raising bolster, automated rising bolsters, or other bolsters that can be manually moved into position. Such bolster supports can be similar to the lumbar support found in some motor vehicles.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The material for the outer frame <b>108</b> can be, for example, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, recycled plastic, all-weather steel, or heavy-duty aluminum. Material variance may be considered for size, strength, durability and (marketed) environment for use. The support surface <b>109</b> can be Vinyl-coated PHIFERTEX or PVC-coated TESLIN, materials both commonly used with PVC outdoor furniture for their sustainability in diverse outdoor conditions, for stretching across the width of the orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b> from one side of the outer frame <b>108</b> to an opposite side of the outer frame <b>108</b>. Other suitable materials may also be used.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the support surface <b>109</b> can be split and varied in size to include a back &#x201c;pocket&#x201d; or pockets <b>800</b> that can store the bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b>. The support surface <b>109</b> can be constructed with overlapping portions <b>802</b>, <b>804</b> to allow heavy duty strips <b>806</b>, <b>808</b>, e.g., hook and loop fastener material, to align with opposing pieces of the material of the outer frame <b>108</b> creating the (unbolstered) flat chair surface. Heavy duty plastic zippers with an overlapping flap for comfort or a simple overlapping flap design can be substituted for the hook and loop fastener material.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The bolster pockets <b>800</b> can be attached on the underside of the support surface <b>109</b> generally according to standard, industry-measured, areas for back (lumbar), knee and ankle of similar trifold chaise lounge chairs. Regarding example positioning, the bolster pockets can be positioned, from the top-most part of the chair <b>100</b>: approximately 12 inches (neck-if using a bolster and not the towel option), approximately 29 inches (lumbar), approximately 60 inches (knee), and approximately 78 inches (ankle). Measurements for locating the bolster pockets can be obtained from a commercially sold chaise lounge chair with an end-to-end length of approximately 84.5 inches.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a set of towels <b>210</b>, <b>211</b>, which are held on a spool <b>212</b> and positioned on a back side of the orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b>. One of the towels, <b>210</b>, can roll out to cover the lounge chair <b>100</b>, extending to the distal end of the leg support section <b>122</b>. The other towel <b>211</b> can be manually rolled and used as an additional bolster or detached and used as a drying off towel&#x2014;or not used at all. The respective bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> can each be releasably attached to the fabric material that is attached to the outer frame <b>108</b> by straps <b>902</b> and <b>904</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) or the like. On the opposing end of each elastic strap <b>902</b>, <b>904</b> can be a hook and loop piece that connects to an opposing hook and loop patch that has been affixed to the (flat) backside of each bolster support. The two elastic straps <b>902</b> and <b>904</b> allow for a moveable and removeable bolster support.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Bolster supports generally do not span the entire width of the orthopedic lounge chair, generally being approximately 7 inches less than the width of the chair <b>100</b>. This difference in width is to accommodate the legs of the chair when the chair is in its folded, storage and transport, position. Bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> can be equivalent to most standard commercial-size, D-shape bolsters with indicated body placement and of similar use. Bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> can be easily interchanged with similar commercially sold bolsters. Additionally, a slightly shorter bolster support provides easy release and return of bolster supports to their corresponding pouch.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> being &#x201c;moveable&#x201d; gives the user the option to adjust the placement of the bolster to provide an extra level of comfort. The ability of the bolster supports to be &#x201c;removeable&#x201d; enables the user the option to interchange any of the other bolster supports that are provided with the orthopedic lounge chair, or exchange/replace any of the bolster supports for another commercially purchased bolster if desired.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The towel <b>210</b> may be approximately 86 inches in length. Two straps (e.g., 25 inches in length) can be attached underside of the orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b> (and under the spool <b>212</b> holding the towels <b>210</b>, <b>211</b>) oriented to run parallel to each other, such as spaced 5&#xbd; inches from the opposing sides of the orthopedic lounge chair and each being about 1&#xbd; inches in width to come up and around the towel <b>210</b> once rolled and attach to a top bar of the orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b> to secure for storage or ease of transport. In a preferred embodiment, the straps come around the towels <b>210</b>, <b>211</b> and pass through a hinged opening 12 inches from the top of the lounge chair <b>100</b> and attach securely to a fastener, e.g., VELCRO.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">When ready to use, the user can simply detach the straps holding the towels <b>210</b>, <b>211</b> on the spool <b>212</b> and then pull one of the towels <b>210</b>, <b>211</b> over the top of the orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b> (and bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b>, if desired). The spool <b>212</b> enables the towel <b>210</b> to roll out easily over the orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b> to a desired length. The user can easily roll the towel <b>210</b> back up to the spool <b>212</b> and attach it with the straps when done using it. The other end of the towel <b>210</b> can be attached to the spool <b>212</b> on the inside with clips, hook-and-loop fasteners, or the like for easy removal. The user can use one of the towels <b>210</b>, <b>211</b> to wrap around their body, lay on the sand, wash, or replace. The other one of the towels <b>210</b>, <b>211</b> can function as an additional bolster for the neck. In other words, one of the towels <b>210</b>, <b>211</b> is an elongated towel sized sufficiently to allow the user to cover the orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b> and the user can roll or fold the other of the towels <b>210</b>, <b>211</b>, which can be provided in a varied size (thickness) and shape (rolled or flat folded pillow) for personalized neck support.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective top view depiction of the exemplary orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b> showing the folding aspect that provides tri-fold positioning. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows two fold lines F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> and shows the direction the legs <b>131</b>, <b>138</b>, and <b>139</b> fold. The orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b> enabled by the hinges <b>137</b><i>a</i>, and <b>137</b><i>b </i>that fold together at folds F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> provide ease of transport and additional functionality. Fold F<b>1</b> moves upwards towards the chair base (chair center) in varying degrees, and flat against and atop the chair base. Fold F<b>2</b> folds down in varying degrees towards the underside of the chair base and ultimately lies flat against the chair base in opposing position to the chair back. This folding feature enables the user to switch between an open configuration, so it is suitable for sitting in, and a folded configuration suited for transporting the orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b>. The user can fold the chair from a 90&#xb0; sitting position, frame legs extended for lounge position, flat 180&#xb0; laying down position, and flat on the ground with an upright back and the leg sections extended.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective top view depiction of the exemplary orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b> with the bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> deployed on top of the support surface <b>109</b>, according to an example aspect. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows four bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> deployed from their storage area <b>800</b> (show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>), any number of bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> can be used. In accordance with one embodiment, the bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> are each D-shaped, i.e., flat bottom and tubular top shape. An exemplary dimension is 18 inches long and 5.5 inches in diameter. When a user lays on the orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b> with one or more of the bolster supports <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> deployed, specific support is applied to an area(s) of the user's body, thereby providing therapeutic support, relief, and benefits.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a depiction of the back side <b>500</b> of an exemplary orthopedic lounge chair <b>100</b> when in the folded position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts the towel <b>210</b> and lumbar bolster support <b>204</b> in a stowed placement on the back side <b>500</b> in a backpack carrying position.
