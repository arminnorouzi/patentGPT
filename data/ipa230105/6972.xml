Originally developed as a technology to privately send and receive data across public networks, VPNs are now used broadly as a privacy-preserving technology that allows Internet users to obscure not only the communicated data but also personal information such as, for example, web browsing history from third parties including Internet service providers (ISPs), Spywares, or the like. A VPN service provider may offer a secure private networking environment within a publicly shared, insecure infrastructure through encapsulation and encryption of the data communicated between a VPN client application (or VPN application) installed on a user device and a remote VPN server.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Most VPN providers rely on a tunneling protocol to create the secure private networking environment, which adds a layer of security to protect each IP packet of the communicated data during communication over the Internet. Tunneling may be associated with enclosing an entire IP packet within an outer IP packet to form an encapsulated IP packet, and transporting the enclosed IP packet over the Internet. The outer IP packet may protect contents of the enclosed IP packet from public view by ensuring that the enclosed IP packet is transmitted over the Internet within a virtual tunnel. Such a virtual tunnel may be a point-to-point tunnel established between the user device and the VPN server. The process of enclosing the entire IP packet within the outer IP packet may be referred to as encapsulation. Computers, servers, or other network devices at ends of the virtual tunnel may be referred to as tunnel interfaces and may be capable of encapsulating outgoing IP packets and of unwrapping incoming encapsulated IP packets.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Encryption may be associated with changing the data from being in a transparently readable format to being in an encoded, unreadable format with help of an encryption algorithm. Decryption may be associated with changing the data from being in the encoded, unreadable format to being in the transparently readable format with help of a decryption algorithm. In an example, encoded/encrypted data may be decoded/decrypted with only a correct decryption key. In a VPN, encryption may render the communicated data unreadable or indecipherable to any third party. At a basic level, when the user launches the installed VPN application and connects to the VPN server, the VPN application may encrypt all contents of the data before transmission over the Internet to the VPN server. Upon receipt, the VPN server may decrypt the encrypted data and forward the decrypted data to an intended target via the Internet. Similarly, the VPN server may encrypt all contents of the data before transmission over the Internet to the user device. Upon receipt, the VPN application on the user device may decrypt the encrypted data and provide the decrypted data to the user.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">VPNs generally use different types of encryption and decryption algorithms to encrypt and decrypt the communicated data. Symmetric encryption may utilize encryption and decryption algorithms that rely on a single private key for encryption and decryption of data. Symmetric encryption is considered to be relatively speedy. One example of an encryption and decryption algorithm utilized by symmetric encryption may be an AES encryption cipher. Asymmetric encryption, on the other hand, may utilize encryption and decryption algorithms that rely on two separate but mathematically-related keys for encryption and decryption of data. In one example, data encrypted using a public key may be decrypted using a separate but mathematically-related private key. The public key may be publicly available through a directory, while the private key may remain confidential and accessible by only an owner of the private key. Asymmetric encryption may also be referred to as public key cryptography. One example of an encryption and decryption algorithm utilized by asymmetric encryption may be Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) protocol.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a VPN, keys for encryption and decryption may be randomly generated strings of bits. Each key may be generated to be unique. A length of an encryption key may be given by a number of the randomly generated string bits, and the longer the length of the encryption key, the stronger is the encryption.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">VPNs may employ user authentication, which may involve verification of credentials required to confirm authenticity/identity of the user. For instance, when a user launches the VPN application to request a VPN connection, the VPN service provider may authenticate the user device prior to providing the user device with access to VPN services. In this way, user authentication may provide a form of access control. Typically, user authentication may include verification of a unique combination of a user ID and password. To provide improved security in the VPN, user authentication may include additional factors such as knowledge, possession, inheritance, or the like. Knowledge factors may include items (e.g., pin numbers) that an authentic user may be expected to know. Possession factors may include items (e.g., one-time password (OTP) tokens) that an authentic user may be expected to possess at a time associated with the authentication. Inherent factors may include biometric items (e.g., fingerprint scans, retina scans, iris scans, or the like) that may be inherent traits of an authentic user.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A VPN may be associated with a network of VPN servers, typically deployed in various geographic locations. A VPN server may be a physical server or a virtual server configured to host and/or globally deliver VPN services to the user. A server may be a combination of hardware and software, and may include logical and physical communication ports. When launched, the VPN application may connect with a selected VPN server for secure communication of data via the virtual tunnel.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The VPN application, installed on the user device, may utilize software-based technology to establish a secure connection between the user device and a VPN server. Some VPN applications may automatically work in the background on the user device while other VPN applications may include front-end interfaces to allow the user to interact with and configure the VPN applications. VPN applications may often be installed on a computer (e.g., user device), though some entities may provide a purpose-built VPN application as a hardware device that is pre-installed with software to enable the VPN. Typically, a VPN application may utilize one or more VPN protocols to encrypt and decrypt the communicated data. Some commonly used VPN protocols may include OpenVPN, SSTP, PPTP, L2TP/IPsec, SSL/TLS, Wireguard, IKEv2, and SoftEther.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect, the present disclosure contemplates a method for rotating internet protocol (IP) addresses in a virtual private network (VPN), the method comprising receiving, at a first VPN server, a first data request and a second data request during an established VPN connection between a user device and a second VPN server; retrieving, during the established VPN connection, first data associated with the first data request using a first exit IP address; and retrieving, during the established VPN connection, second data associated with the second data request using a second exit IP address, different from the first exit IP address.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect, the present disclosure contemplates a device associated with a virtual private network (VPN), the device comprising a memory; and a processor communicatively coupled to the memory, the processor being configured to: receive, at a first VPN server, a first data request and a second data request during an established VPN connection between a user device and a second VPN server; retrieve, during the established VPN connection, first data associated with the first data request using a first exit IP address; and retrieve, during the established VPN connection, second data associated with the second data request using a second exit IP address, different from the first exit IP address.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, the present disclosure contemplates a non-transitory computer readable medium storing instructions, which when executed by a processor cause the processor to: receive, at a first VPN server, a first data request and a second data request during an established VPN connection between a user device and a second VPN server; retrieve, during the established VPN connection, first data associated with the first data request using a first exit IP address; and retrieve, during the established VPN connection, second data associated with the second data request using a second exit IP address, different from the first exit IP address.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory in nature and are intended to provide an understanding of the present disclosure without limiting the scope thereof.

Example <b>100</b> shows an architectural depiction of components included in system <b>100</b>. In some aspects, the components may include a user device <b>102</b> capable of communicating with one or more VPN servers <b>120</b> and with a VPN service provider (VSP) control infrastructure <b>104</b> over a network <b>122</b>. The VSP control infrastructure <b>104</b> may be controlled by a VPN service provider and may include an application programming interface (API) <b>106</b>, a user database <b>108</b>, processing unit <b>110</b>, a server database <b>116</b>, and the one or more VPN servers <b>120</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the API <b>106</b> may be capable of communicating with the user database <b>108</b> and with the processing unit <b>110</b>. Additionally, the processing unit <b>110</b> may be capable of communicating with the server database, which may be capable of communicating with a testing module (not shown). The testing module may be capable of communicating with the one or more VPN servers <b>120</b> over the network <b>122</b>. The processing unit <b>110</b> may be capable of controlling operation of the one or more VPN servers <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The user device <b>102</b> may be a physical computing device capable of hosting a VPN application and of connecting to the network <b>122</b>. The user device <b>102</b> may be, for example, a laptop, a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a desktop computer, a smart device, a router, or the like. In some aspects, the user device <b>102</b> may include, for example, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices such as VSP smart home appliances, smart home security systems, autonomous vehicles, smart health monitors, smart factory equipment, wireless inventory trackers, biometric cyber security scanners, or the like. The network <b>122</b> may be any digital telecommunication network that permits several nodes to share and access resources. In some aspects, the network <b>122</b> may include one or more of, for example, a local-area network (LAN), a wide-area network (WAN), a campus-area network (CAN), a metropolitan-area network (MAN), a home-area network (HAN), Internet, Intranet, Extranet, and Internetwork.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The VSP control infrastructure <b>104</b> may include a combination of hardware and software components that enable provision of VPN services to the user device <b>102</b>. The VSP control infrastructure <b>104</b> may interface with (the VPN application on) the user device <b>102</b> via the API <b>106</b>, which may include one or more endpoints to a defined request-response message system. In some aspects, the API <b>106</b> may be configured to receive, via the network <b>122</b>, a connection request from the user device <b>102</b> to establish a VPN connection with a VPN server <b>120</b>. The connection request may include an authentication request to authenticate the user device <b>102</b> and/or a request for an IP address of an optimal VPN server for establishment of the VPN connection therewith. In some aspects, an optimal VPN server may be a single VPN server <b>120</b> or a combination of one or more VPN servers <b>120</b>. The API <b>106</b> may receive the authentication request and the request for an IP address of an optimal VPN server in a single connection request. In some aspects, the API <b>106</b> may receive the authentication request and the request for an IP address of an optimal VPN server in separate connection requests.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The API <b>106</b> may further be configured to handle the connection request by mediating the authentication request. For instance, the API <b>106</b> may receive from the user device <b>102</b> credentials including, for example, a unique combination of a user ID and password for purposes of authenticating the user device <b>102</b>. In another example, the credentials may include a unique validation code known to an authentic user. The API <b>106</b> may provide the received credentials to the user database <b>108</b> for verification.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The user database <b>108</b> may include a structured repository of valid credentials belonging to authentic users. In one example, the structured repository may include one or more tables containing valid unique combinations of user IDs and passwords belonging to authentic users. In another example, the structured repository may include one or more tables containing valid unique validation codes associated with authentic users. The VPN service provider may add or delete such valid unique combinations of user IDs and passwords from the structured repository at any time. Based at least in part on receiving the credentials from the API <b>106</b>, the user database <b>108</b> and a processor (e.g., the processing unit <b>110</b> or another local or remote processor) may verify the received credentials by matching the received credentials with the valid credentials stored in the structured repository. In some aspects, the user database <b>108</b> and the processor may authenticate the user device <b>102</b> when the received credentials match at least one of the valid credentials.
