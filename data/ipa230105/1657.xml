id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for building belt assemblies for tyres for vehicle wheels is described. The method includes building a crossed belt structure on a forming drum. Depending on the type of tyre to be produced, the method selects whether to build a belt assembly having a cylindrical shaping or a belt assembly having a toroidal shaping. In order to build a belt assembly having a cylindrical shaping, zero degrees belt layer is deposited on the forming drum in a radially outer position with respect to the crossed belt structure. In order to build a belt assembly having a toroidal shaping, the crossed belt structure is picked up from the forming drum. The crossed belt structure is then toroidally shaped and transferred onto another forming drum. A zero degrees belt layer is then deposited on the other forming drum in a radially outer position with respect to the toroidally shaped crossed belt structure.</p></abstract><drawings

method for building belt assemblies for tyres for vehicle wheels.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A tyre for vehicle wheels generally comprises a carcass structure, a crown structure arranged in radially outer position with respect to the carcass structure and a pair of sidewalls that are the axially outer surfaces of the tyre, with respect to a mid-plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the same tyre.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The carcass structure comprises at least one carcass ply formed of reinforcing cords incorporated in a matrix of elastomeric material. The carcass ply has opposite end edges respectively engaged with annular anchoring structures. The latter are arranged in the areas of the tyre usually identified by the name &#x201c;beads&#x201d; and each of them is usually formed of a substantially circumferential annular insert, or &#x201c;bead core&#x201d;, on which at least one filling insert is applied, in a radially outer position, the latter being radially tapered moving away from the rotation axis.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Specific reinforcing inserts having the function of improving the transmission of torque to the tyre can be provided at the beads.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the case of &#x201c;tubeless&#x201d; tyres, i.e. without air chamber, a layer of elastomeric material, generally known as &#x201c;liner&#x201d;, can also be provided in a radially inner position with respect to the carcass structure to provide the necessary impermeability to the inflation air of the tyre. Generally, the liner extends from one bead to the other.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The crown structure comprises a belt structure and, in a radially outer position with respect to the belt structure, a tread band made of elastomeric material.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The belt structure comprises a belt layer, or more belt layers arranged in radial juxtaposition with respect to one another, comprising reinforcing cords having an orientation substantially parallel to the direction of circumferential extension of the tyre (zero degrees belt layer) or, in the case of more belt layers, a crossed orientation. In this last case, said zero degrees belt layer can be provided in a radially outer position with respect to the belt layers having a crossed orientation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Longitudinal and transversal grooves are typically formed on the tread band, and they are arranged to define a desired tread pattern. Between the tread band and the belt structure a so-called &#x201c;under-layer of the tread band&#x201d; can be arranged, made of an elastomeric material having suitable properties for obtaining a stable union of the belt structure with the tread band itself.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The sidewalls are made of elastomeric material and define the axially outer surfaces of the tyre, i.e. the surfaces arranged in the axially outermost position with respect to the annular anchoring structures, the carcass ply(ies), the belt layer(s) and possibly at least one portion of tread band. For example, each sidewall extends from one of the lateral edges of the tread band up to the respective bead annular anchoring structure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Throughout this description and in the claims, any numerical value is deemed to be preceded by the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; to also indicate any numerical value that differs slightly from the one indicated, for example to take into account the dimensional tolerances typical of the field of reference.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The term &#x201c;elastomeric material&#x201d; is used to indicate a composition comprising at least one elastomeric polymer and at least one reinforcing filler. Such a composition can also comprise additives like, for example, a cross-linking agent and/or a plasticizer. Thanks to the presence of the cross-linking agent, such a material can be cross-linked by heating, so as to form the final manufactured product.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The term &#x201c;green tyre&#x201d; is used to indicate a tyre obtained from the building process and not yet molded and vulcanized.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The term &#x201c;finished tyre&#x201d; is used to indicate a tyre obtained by subjecting a green tyre to a molding and vulcanization process.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The term &#x201c;tyre&#x201d; is used to indicate a finished tyre or a green tyre.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The terms &#x201c;axial&#x201d;, &#x201c;axially&#x201d;, &#x201c;radial&#x201d;, &#x201c;radially&#x201d;, &#x201c;circumferential&#x201d; and &#x201c;circumferentially&#x201d; are used with reference to the tyre or to a forming drum used in the production process of the tyre.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In particular, the terms &#x201c;axial&#x201d; and &#x201c;axially&#x201d; are used to indicate references/parameters arranged/measured or extending in a direction substantially parallel to the rotation axis of the tyre or of the forming drum.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The terms &#x201c;radial&#x201d; and &#x201c;radially&#x201d; are used to indicate references/parameters arranged/measured or extending in a direction substantially perpendicular to the rotation axis of the tyre or of the forming drum and lying in a plane comprising such a rotation axis.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The terms &#x201c;circumferential&#x201d; and &#x201c;circumferentially&#x201d; are used to indicate references/parameters arranged/measured or extending along a circumference that extends around the rotation axis of the tyre or of the forming drum.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The term &#x201c;structural component&#x201d; of a tyre is used to indicate any portion of the tyre capable of performing its function or a part thereof. Examples of structural components of the tyre are the following components: the carcass structure, the crown structure, or parts thereof, like liner, under-liner, anti-abrasion inserts, bead core, filling inserts in the area of the bead (and therefore the annular anchoring structures defined by bead cores and respective filling inserts), carcass ply(ies), belt layer(s), belt under-layer, under-layer of the tread band, sidewalls, sidewall inserts, tread band, reinforcing inserts made of textile or metallic material, reinforcing inserts made of elastomeric material etc., or a part thereof.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The term &#x201c;crossed belt structure&#x201d; is used to indicate a belt structure comprising at least two belt layers arranged in radial juxtaposition over one another and each including a plurality of textile and/or metallic and/or hybrid parallel reinforcing cords, tilted with respect to the direction of circumferential extension of the tyre (and therefore to an axial mid-plane of the tyre), wherein the reinforcing cords of one belt layer are tilted with respect to said axial mid-plane of the tyre by the same angle and on the opposite side to the reinforcing cords of another belt layer.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The term &#x201c;belt assembly&#x201d; is used to indicate an annular assembly comprising a crossed belt structure and a zero degrees belt layer arranged in a radially outer position with respect to the crossed belt structure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The term &#x201c;cylindrical shaping&#x201d; of a belt assembly is used to indicate a building cycle aimed at obtaining a belt assembly having a substantially cylindrical shape.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The term &#x201c;toroidal shaping&#x201d; of a belt assembly is used to indicate a building cycle aimed at obtaining a belt assembly having a substantially toroidal shape and a profile in a radial section close to the profile in a radial section of the corresponding finished tyre.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term &#x201c;substantially toroidal forming drum&#x201d; is used to indicate a forming drum the outer surface of which has a profile in a radial section such that, whatever semi-finished product is deposited thereon during the building of a tyre being processed, the semi-finished product takes a shape close to the shape taken in the finished tyre.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The term &#x201c;tyre being processed&#x201d; is used to indicate a tyre at any stage of the relative production process that goes from building at least one structural component up to obtaining the finished tyre.
