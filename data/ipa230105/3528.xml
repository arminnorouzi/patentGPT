level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electronic devices provide various functions or services based on convergence of various kinds of information/communication technologies, also referred to as digital convergence. For example, an electronic device may track the position of the electronic device (or user holding the electronic device) with regard to an indoor space, and may provide an event related to the corresponding position, thereby supporting a position-based service.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In connection with position tracking regarding an indoor space, an electronic device may use radio signals (for example, cellular signals, Wi-Fi signals, or Bluetooth signals) received in the indoor space. For example, the electronic device may divide the indoor space into multiple cells, may record characteristics of radio signals received in respective cells as feature points related to the corresponding cells, and may determine the degree of similarity between characteristics of radio signals received in a specific cell and feature points recorded with regard to the corresponding cell, thereby tracking the position of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Based thereon, construction of a radio map reflecting radio signals characteristics regarding the multiple cells is a prerequisite for a radio signal-based position tracking scheme, and construction of such a radio map may involve survey (or calibration) costs for collecting radio signals. In addition, if a base station or an access point related to radio signals undergoes a change (for example, replacement or displacement), maintenance/repair costs for updating the radio map, for example, may be incurred.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various example embodiments disclosed herein may provide a position determination method and an
