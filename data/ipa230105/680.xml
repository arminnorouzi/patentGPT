The corresponding technics is referred to as laser surgery.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A class of ophthalmologic surgical procedures is based on implementing well-defined incisions into the corneal tissue, classically with a scalpel (also named keratome). The incisions serve as relief cuts and result, under influence of the intraocular pressure, in a desired deformation of the cornea, thereby modifying its refractive power. Corresponding surgical technics are known, for example, as radial keratotomy RK or, for example, as arcuate keratotomy AK (also referred to as arcuate incisions, arcuate cuts or astigmatic keratotomy) or limbal relaxing incisions, LRI.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">US 2012/0296321 A1 discloses a method for correcting astigmatism by implementing paired arcuate laser generated incisions into the corneal tissue. U.S. Pat. No. 5,531,753 discloses a surgical astigmatism correction using a mechanical instrument.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A drawback of implementing relief cuts into the conical tissue according to the state of the art is the fact that the required cuts are comparatively deep, generally having an incision depth of 70% to 90% of the cornea thickness (thickness of the conical tissue), which is accordingly severely weakened.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an overall objective of the present disclosure to improve the state of the art regarding refractive surgery by modifying of the cornea surface. Favorably, apparatuses and methods are provided that allow to achieve the desired optical effect with less weakening of the cornea structure and to provide a new parameter of adjustment. Further favorably, apparatuses and methods are provided that allow to modify the cornea surface, that are flexible and allow an adaption to a large variety of medical situations and required cornea surface modifications.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a general way, the overall objective is achieved by way of the subject matter of the independent claims. Exemplary and particularly favorable embodiments are further defined by way of the dependent claims as well as the overall disclosure of the present document.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an aspect, the overall objective is achieved by an ophthalmological treatment apparatus for modifying a shape of a cornea surface of a human eye. The ophthalmologic treatment apparatus includes a surgical laser device for implementing tissue cuts. The ophthalmologic treatment apparatus further includes a computerized control device in operative coupling with the surgical laser device. The control device is designed to control the laser device to implement tissue cuts according to a cut geometry with a primary tissue cut and a secondary tissue cut. The primary tissue cut is a relief cut and extends into the depth of the tissue. The secondary tissue cut lies within the tissue, such that the secondary tissue cut adds to the relieving effect of the primary tissue cut. The primary tissue cut and the secondary tissue cut are each defined by a corresponding spatial cut surface along which the tissue is separated.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Implementing the primary tissue cut and the secondary tissue cut may be carried out in combination and in a common surgical procedure. They may, however, also implemented separately and in separate surgical procedures.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The tissue into which the primary tissue cut and the secondary tissue cut are implemented is eye tissue, in particular corneal tissue, limbal tissue or a combination thereof. For exemplary purposes, the description in the document mainly deals with cuts into the corneal tissue, without, however, excluding limbal tissue.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present disclosure is based on biomechanical considerations regarding the eye tissue. Without any tissue cuts being implemented, the tissue is tensioned by the intraocular pressure. The intraocular pressure is associated with outward directed forces that are directed from the aqueous humor towards the periphery, thereby straining and stressing the tissue with additional deformation. If a tissue cut is implemented that extends, for example, from the anterior tissue surface into the corneal tissue and has an orientation with a component perpendicular to the stresses mentioned before, such tissue cut results in a stress peak respectively an area of increased stress at the ground of the tissue cut inside the tissue, the stress peak causing an additional deformation. These considerations form the basis for corneal or limbal incision procedures, such as arcuate keratotomy, as known per se and classically carried out using a scalpel.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with the present disclosure, the primary tissue cut is a tissue cut of the before-mentioned type. According to a basic embodiment of the present disclosure, a secondary tissue cute is implemented that extends traverse to the primary tissue cut and inside the tissue. If such traverse secondary tissue cut meets with the ground of the primary tissue cut or is, alternatively, sufficiently close to the primary tissue cut, it is found that the area of increased stress is enlarged, thereby favorably enlarging the deformation resulting from the primary tissue cut. In embodiment, the secondary tissue cut is arranged such that it extends in the tissue an area of increased mechanical stress which results from the primary tissue cut, thereby increasing a conical tissue deformation resulting from the primary-tissue cut. To achieve this effect, some width (measured as tangential distance between the inner edge and the outer edge) is required for the secondary tissue cut. Typically, the width is at least 10% of the uncut stroma of the primary tissue cut, respectively at least 10% of the distance from the ground of the primary tissue cut to the posterior corneal surface.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">For a refractive surgery based on known corneal incision procedures, the depth of the cut or incision (primary tissue cut in context of the present disclosure), an incision depth of at least 70% of the corneal tissue thickness is typically required in order to achieve a significant effect at all, with up to 90% being typically required. For a cut geometry in accordance with the present disclosure, in contrast, the depth of the primary tissue cut may be in a range of 50% to 70% of the tissue thickness as a maximum. Thereby, the undesired weakening that inevitably results from the tissue cuts, is reduced. Further, by enlarging the area of increased stress, the absolute stress and stress gradients are reduced. As a consequence, the stress-strain relation is linear or at least close-to-linear, resulting in a generally less critical behavior of the tissue and in particular a less critical adjustment of the cut geometry parameters as compared to known corneal incision procedures, e. g. classical arcuate keratotomy.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The secondary tissue cut may be implemented as a continuous single cut. This type of embodiment is generally assumed in the following. Alternatively, it may be split along its length into two or more secondary sub cuts that are separated by tissue bridges.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The surgical laser device may, for example, have a base device with a laser light source for generating laser pulses and an application head with a projection lens which is coupled to the patient eye for treatment purposes and in particular implementing tissue cuts into the eye tissue. The application head can be movably connected to the base device, for example by way of an articulated arm, wherein the articulated arm may simultaneously serve for optical beam guidance from the laser light source to the application head. By way of example, a corresponding arrangement is disclosed in EP 1731120. Moreover, there are devices in which the application head is integrated into the base device or in which other device arrangements are provided and which may be used as well. Integrations into microscopes or attachments to microscopes are also proposed.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The computerized control device may be designed based on general-purpose computing equipment, such as one or more personal computers (PCs) or workstations, and includes components such as one or more microcontrollers and/or microprocessors, volatile and non-volatile memory, a user interface with components such monitors, a keyboard, mouse, trackball, or the like. Operation of the ophthalmologic treatment apparatus and in particular of the surgical laser device is favorably controlled via corresponding software code that runs on the one or more microcontrollers and/or microcomputers and is stored in volatile and/or non-volatile memory. The control device further includes interface circuitry for operative coupling with the surgical laser device and may further include interface circuitry for coupling with external devices, such as external computing devices, a local area network (LAN), the internet, or the like. The control device may, fully or partly, be integral with the base device of a surgical laser device as explained before.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment, the surgical laser device includes a femtosecond laser source. A femtosecond lase is particularly favorable in that it allows to implement the tissue cut with high precision and reproducibility. Nano or picosecond laser in the UV range may be used in alternative embodiments.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment, the primary tissue cut is an arcuate cut. The arc of the arcuate cut is typically centered with respect to a symmetry axis of the eye. The radial distance from a symmetry axis (e.g. geometrical axis, optical axis, visual axis), the incision depth and the arc length may be selected patient-specific in dependence of the required tissue deformation to be achieved. For this type of embodiment, the primary tissue cut is generally similar to the incision of arcuate keratotomy.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For the primary tissue cut being an arcuate cut of circumferential angle and diameter (as measured from the cornea center respectively the optical axis), the secondary tissue cut may, for example, have an inner arcuate limitation and an outer arcuate limitation that are symmetric to the arc of the primary tissue cut, with the arc of the inner arcuate limitation having a smaller diameter and the arc of the outer arcuate limitation having a larger diameter than the arc of the arcuate primary tissue cut. The secondary tissue cut may be flush with the primary tissue cut, with the arc of the outer arcuate limitation, the arc of the inner arcuate limitation, and the arc of the primary tissue cut having identical circumferential angles. Alternatively, the primary tissue cut may project beyond the secondary tissue cut, or vice versa.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In variants, the secondary tissue cut is unsymmetrical with respect to the primary tissue cut. In further variants, arcuate tissue cuts are replaced respectively approximated by a planar tissue cut or a number of planar adjacent planar tissue cuts. For planar tissue cuts, the arcs are replaced by straight lines respectively polygonal lines.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment, the primary tissue cut extends to an outer tissue surface. For this type of embodiment, the primary tissue cut is an incision that extends from the outer or anterior tissue surface (anterior cornea surface and/or limbal surface) into the eye tissue. In contrast to the primary tissue cut, the secondary tissue cut is generally surface incision-free and fully extends within the eye tissue and not to the outer surface. In contrast to an incision that may in principle&#x2014;however with reduced accuracy and reproducibility&#x2014;also be implemented using a scalpel, laser surgery is required for incision-free cuts.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an alternative embodiment, also the primary tissue cut extends fully within the tissue without extending to the surface. Since the epithelium is not cut, the inherent infection risk is significantly reduced for this type of embodiment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an embodiment, the primary tissue cut and the secondary tissue cut are spatially curved. The primary tissue cut may especially be arcuate as mentioned before in a top view, i. e. in a viewing direction parallel to the symmetry axis of the eye. The depth of first tissue cut may be constant or vary along its lengths.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The width of the secondary tissue cut (measured as radial distance between the inner edge and the outer edge) may further be constant or vary along the length of the secondary tissue cut continuously or discretely.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an embodiment, the primary tissue cut and the secondary tissue cut meet or intersect along a joint line. This type of embodiment generally results in a maximum combined effect of the primary and secondary tissue cut and in particular a maximum adding of the secondary tissue cut to the relieving effect to the primary tissue cut. The joint line lies within the eye tissue.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The primary tissue cut and the secondary tissue cut meeting along the joint line means that the primary tissue cut and the secondary tissue cut touch each other along the joint line, but the primary tissue cut does not extend beyond the secondary tissue cut in the depth direction of the tissue. With other words, the ground of the primary tissue cut lies in the surface of the secondary tissue cut. Such cut geometry is generally favorable for achieving the desired relieving effect with minimum tissue weakening. There is, however, some risk of undesired tissue bridges remaining between the primary tissue cut and the secondary tissue cut.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The primary tissue cut and the secondary tissue cut alternatively intersecting align the joint line (intersection line) means that the primary tissue cut extends beyond the secondary tissue cut into the depth of the conical tissue. With other words, the ground of the primary tissue cut lies deeper in the tissue as compared to the joint line. Such cut geometry may be chosen in order to avoid undesired tissue bridges. If a cut geometry with meeting respectively touching primary and secondary tissue cut is initially chosen, it may also be modified into a cut geometry with intersecting primary and secondary tissue cut in a subsequent laser surgical procedure if undesired tissue bridges are found to be remaining.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an embodiment, the primary tissue cut and the secondary tissue cut are separated by a tissue bridge. For such alternative type of embodiment, the primary tissue cut and the secondary tissue cut are purposely separated from each other by the tissue bridge. The tissue bridge, however, is sufficiently narrow to allow the secondary tissue cut to add to the relieving effect as explained before. If, subsequent to the surgical procedure, the obtained tissue deformation is found to be insufficient, the tissue bridge may be fully or partly removed by way of a subsequent manual or laser surgical procedure, thereby increasing the conical tissue deformation. The secondary tissue cut may be radially symmetrical or unsymmetrical to the primary tissue cut and may radially extend from the primary tissue cut towards the center and the symmetry axis, and/or towards the periphery.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment, the secondary tissue cut extends in a constant distance from a posterior corneal surface. Typically, the secondary tissue cut extends in a constant depth of the tissue. In a modification, the secondary tissue cut includes a central region that extends in a constant distance from the posterior corneal tissue surface, and an adjoining peripheral region that extends from the central region towards the outer cornea surface. The peripheral region may especially extend in an area of the edges of the secondary tissue cut. Such latter type of embodiment favorably avoids stress peaks along the periphery of the secondary tissue cuts, which result in a largely non-linear material behavior, in particular stress-strain relation.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In embodiment, the primary tissue cut and the secondary tissue cut are perpendicular with respect to each other. More specifically, a reference plane exists for this type of embodiment such that an angle that can be determined between the primary tissue cut and the secondary tissue cut in the reference plane is or is close to a right angle. Alternatively, the primary tissue cut and the secondary tissue cut may be inclined with respect to each other which is favorable in order to avoid a gaping wound.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment, the cut geometry includes, in addition to the primary tissue cut, a further primary tissue cut, wherein the further primary tissue cut extends into the depth of the tissue. The primary tissue cut and the further primary tissue cut may especially be symmetric relative to the secondary tissue cut. Such type of embodiment with a further primary tissue cut is favorable regarding wound closure, respectively in order to avoid gaping wounds.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an embodiment, the cut geometry includes, in addition to the secondary tissue cut, a further secondary tissue cut. The further secondary tissue cut lies within the tissue. The secondary tissue cut and the further secondary tissue cut are spaced apart from each other along the corneal tissue depth. The primary tissue cut may especially extend between the secondary tissue cut and the further secondary tissue cut. For this type of embodiment, the inherent infection risk is reduced, while the tissue deformation is increased.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an embodiment, the control device is designed to control the surgical laser device to implement the secondary tissue cut prior to implementing the primary tissue cut. The secondary tissue cut does, as such, not result in a substantial tissue deformation, but only combination with the primary tissue cut. This type of embodiment accordingly allows to implement the secondary tissue cut in the original state of the tissue without needing to consider the deformation resulting from the cuts.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an embodiment, the control device is designed to control the surgical laser device to start implementing the primary tissue cut at a starting position within the tissue and advance towards the outer corneal tissue surface. The maximum tissue deformation occurs when the primary tissue cut meets the outer or anterior surface. Starting with implementing the primary tissue cut within the tissue&#x2014;typically in the greatest depth that forms the ground of the primary tissue cut&#x2014;accordingly allows to implement most of the primary tissue without or little tissue deformation.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an embodiment, the control device includes or is operatively coupled to a cut geometry template storage, the cut geometry template storage storing a number of predefined cut geometry templates, and is designed to select the cut geometry as one of the cut geometry templates.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The cut geometry template storage in particular stores cut geometries in accordance with the present disclosure in a volatile and/or non-volatile memory and a user-selection by an operator of a suited cut geometry is made via a user interface.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an embodiment, the control device is designed to receive at least one patient-specific cut geometry parameter and to compute the cut geometry by applying the at least one patient-specific cut geometry parameter to a stored generic cut geometry template.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The generic cut geometry template may, for example, be a cut geometry template that is selected from a number of stored cut geometry templates as explained before. Typical patient-specific cut geometry parameters in a basic cut geometry are the arc length and/or the radius and/or the depth of the primary tissue cut, and the width of the secondary tissue cut, and an axis (e.g. geometrical axis, optical axis, visual axis) with respect to which the tissue cuts are centered.

This three-dimensional real world situation may be approximated with good accuracy by a two-dimensional membrane strain model. Since the main effect of the tension is tangential to the cornea surface and perpendicular to the tissue cut projection, it may, in particular for illustrative purposes, be further simplified to a one-dimensional model.
