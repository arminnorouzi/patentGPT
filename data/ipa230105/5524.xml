In the following detailed description of embodiments of the present systems and methods, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the described systems and methods may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice presently disclosed systems and methods, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural and logical changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Moreover, for the purpose of clarity, detailed descriptions of certain features will not be discussed when they would be apparent to those with skill in the art so as not to obscure the description of embodiments of the disclosure. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the disclosure is defined only by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Information in a volatile memory device may be stored in memory cells (e.g., as a charge on a capacitive element), and may decay over time. The memory cells may be organized into rows (word lines) and columns (bit lines). In order to prevent information from being lost or corrupted due to this decay, the memory may carry out refresh operations. During a refresh operation, information may be rewritten to memory cells of word line to restore its initial state. The memory cells may be refreshed on a row-by-row (word line-by-word line basis). Auto refresh operations may be performed on the word lines of the memory in a sequence such that over time each of the word lines of the memory are refreshed at a rate faster than the expected rate of data degradation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Repeated access to a particular row of memory (e.g., an aggressor row) may cause an increased rate of decay in rows (e.g., victim rows) which are close to the aggressor row. These repeated accesses may be part of a deliberate attack against the memory and/or may be due to &#x2018;natural&#x2019; access patterns of the memory. The increased rate of decay in the victim rows may require that they may be refreshed as part of a targeted refresh operation. The victim rows may be rows directly adjacent to the aggressor row (+/&#x2212;I) or more distant, for example, adjacent to the rows directly adjacent to the aggressor row (+/&#x2212;2).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Once an aggressor row has been identified, the row address for each victim row is determined. The victim row addresses for the victim rows may then be used to perform a refresh operation on the victim rows. Due to space limitations, layout restrictions, and other factors in the memory, the physical row address may not correspond to the logical row address, sometimes referred to as address scrambling. Accordingly, when an aggressor row is identified, conversions (e.g., scrambling) between the physical addresses of the rows and the logical addresses of the rows is performed to determine the row addresses of the neighboring victim rows. This may require complex circuitry including counters with latches or other components that require significant layout space. Additionally or alternatively, it may require time-consuming scrambling operations, such as comparing physical and/or logical addresses to look-up tables.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">U.S. Pat. No. 10,580,475, which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose, describes techniques for calculating victim row addresses for victim rows directly adjacent (+/&#x2212;1) to an aggressor row. However, as memory cell sizes and physical spaces between rows continue to be reduced in memory arrays, if a row hammer attack occurs, more distant rows (e.g., +/&#x2212;2, +/&#x2212;3, +/&#x2212;4, +/&#x2212;8) from the aggressor rows may become victim rows. Thus, additional rows may need to be refreshed during targeted refresh operations. Accordingly, techniques for calculating row addresses for more distant victim rows may be desirable.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present disclosure is drawn to apparatuses, systems, and methods for calculating victim row addresses for victim rows having a variety of spatial relationships to an aggressor row. The spatial relationship of the victim row to the aggressor row for which the victim row address is calculated may be based, at least in part, on one or more control signals. In some embodiments, the same circuitry may be used to calculate the different victim row addresses by changing the states of the control signals. The apparatuses and methods disclosed herein may reduce or eliminate the need for scrambling circuits with latches and/or other complex circuitry that may require more layout area. The apparatuses and methods disclosed herein may reduce or eliminate the need for lookup tables and/or other scrambling operations that may require more computation time.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of a semiconductor device according an embodiment of the disclosure. The semiconductor device <b>100</b> may be a semiconductor memory device, such as a DRAM device integrated on a single semiconductor chip.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The semiconductor device <b>100</b> includes a memory array <b>118</b>. The memory array <b>118</b> is shown as including a plurality of memory banks. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the memory array <b>118</b> is shown as including sixteen memory banks BANKO-BANK <b>15</b>. More or fewer banks may be included in the memory array <b>118</b> of other embodiments. Each memory bank includes a plurality of word lines WL, a plurality of bit lines BL and/BL, and a plurality of memory cells MC arranged at intersections of the plurality of word lines WL and the plurality of bit lines BL and/BL. The selection of the word line WL is performed by a row decoder circuit <b>108</b> and the selection of the bit lines BL and/BL is performed by a column decoder circuit <b>110</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the row decoder circuit <b>108</b> includes a respective row decoder circuit for each memory bank and the column decoder circuit <b>110</b> includes a respective column decoder for each memory bank. The bit lines BL and/BL are coupled to a respective sense amplifier (SAMP). Read data from the bit line BL or/BL is amplified by the sense amplifier SAMP, and transferred to read/write amplifiers <b>120</b> over complementary local data lines (LIOT/B), transfer gate (TG), and complementary main data lines (MIOT/B). Conversely, write data outputted from the read/write amplifiers <b>120</b> is transferred to the sense amplifier SAMP over the complementary main data lines MIOT/B, the transfer gate TG, and the complementary local data lines LIOT/B, and written in the memory cell MC coupled to the bit line BL or/BL.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The semiconductor device <b>100</b> may employ a plurality of external terminals that include command and address (C/A) terminals coupled to a command and address bus to receive commands and addresses, and a CS signal, clock terminals to receive clocks CK_t and CK_c, data terminals DQ to provide data, and power supply terminals to receive power supply potentials VDD, VSS, VDDQ, and VSSQ.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The clock terminals are supplied with external clocks CK_t and CK_c that are provided to an input circuit <b>112</b>. The external clocks may be complementary. The input circuit <b>112</b> generates an internal clock ICLK based on the CK_t and CK_c clocks. The ICLK clock is provided to the command decoder circuit <b>110</b> and to an internal clock generator <b>114</b>. The internal clock generator <b>114</b> provides various internal clocks LCLK based on the ICLK clock. The LCLK clocks may be used for timing operation of various internal circuits. The internal data clocks LCLK are provided to the input/output circuit <b>122</b> to time operation of circuits included in the input/output circuit <b>122</b>, for example, to data receivers to time the receipt of write data.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The C/A terminals may be supplied with memory addresses. The memory addresses supplied to the C/A terminals are transferred, via a command/address input circuit <b>102</b>, to an address decoder <b>104</b>. The address decoder <b>104</b> receives the address and supplies a decoded row address XADD to the row decoder circuit <b>108</b> and supplies a decoded column address YADD to the column decoder circuit <b>110</b>. The address decoder <b>104</b> may also supply a decoded bank address BADD, which may indicate the bank of the memory array <b>118</b> containing the decoded row address XADD and column address YADD. The C/A terminals may be supplied with commands. Examples of commands include access commands for accessing the memory, such as commands for performing read operations and commands for performing write operations. The access commands may be associated with one or more of a row address XADD, column address YADD, and/or bank address BADD to indicate the memory cell(s) to be accessed. In some embodiments, the commands and/or addresses may be provided by a component external to the device <b>100</b>, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a memory controller <b>101</b> in communication with the device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The commands may be provided as internal command signals to a command decoder circuit <b>106</b> via the command/address input circuit <b>102</b>. The command decoder circuit <b>106</b> includes circuits to decode the internal command signals to generate various internal signals and commands for performing operations. For example, the command decoder circuit <b>106</b> may provide a row command signal to select a word line and a column command signal to select a bit line.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The device <b>100</b> may receive access commands for performing read operations. When the commands are received, and a bank address, a row address and a column address are timely supplied with the commands, read data is read from memory cells in the memory array <b>118</b> corresponding to the row address and column address. The commands are received by the command decoder circuit <b>106</b>, which provides internal commands so that read data from the memory array <b>118</b> is provided to the read/write amplifiers <b>120</b>. The read data is output to outside from the data terminals DQ via the input/output circuit <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The device <b>100</b> may receive access commands for performing write operations. When the commands are received, and a bank address, a row address and a column address are timely supplied with the commands, write data supplied to the data terminals DQ is written to a memory cells in the memory array <b>118</b> corresponding to the row address and column address. The commands are received by the command decoder circuit <b>106</b>, which provides internal commands so that the write data is received by data receivers in the input/output circuit <b>122</b>. Write clocks may also be provided to the external clock terminals for timing the receipt of the write data by the data receivers of the input/output circuit <b>122</b>. The write data is supplied via the input/output circuit <b>122</b> to the read/write amplifiers <b>120</b>, and by the read/write amplifiers <b>120</b> to the memory array <b>118</b> to be written into the memory cell MC.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The device <b>100</b> may also receive commands causing it to carry out one or more refresh operations as part of a self-refresh mode. The device <b>100</b> may be periodically placed in a refresh mode. Thus, refresh operations may be performed periodically each time the memory device is in the refresh mode. In some embodiments, the refresh mode command may be externally issued to the memory device <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the refresh mode command may be periodically generated by a component of the device. In some embodiments, when an external signal indicates a refresh mode entry command (e.g., an external refresh command), the refresh signal AREF may also be activated. The refresh signal AREF may be a pulse signal which is activated when the command decoder circuit <b>106</b> receives a signal which indicates entry to the self-refresh mode. The refresh signal AREF may be activated once immediately after command input, and thereafter may be cyclically activated at desired internal timing. In some embodiments, the refresh signal AREF may cause more than one refresh operation to be performed, which may be referred to as a &#x201c;multi pump&#x201d; refresh. In some embodiments, the refresh signal AREF may be active during the refresh mode. In some embodiments, the refresh signal AREF may be active during the multiple refresh operations. The refresh signal AREF may be used to control the timing of refresh operations during the refresh mode. A self-refresh exit command may cause the automatic activation of the refresh signal AREF to stop and may cause the device <b>100</b> to return to an idle state and/or resume other operations.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As used herein, an activation of a signal may refer to any portion of a signal's waveform to which that a circuit responds. For example, if a circuit responds to a rising edge, then a signal switching from a low level to a high level may be an activation. One example type of activation is a pulse, where a signal switches from a low level to a high level for a period of time, and then back to the low level. This may trigger circuits which respond to rising edges, falling edges, and/or signals being at a high logical level.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The refresh signal AREF is supplied to the refresh control circuit <b>116</b>. The refresh control circuit <b>116</b> supplies a refresh row address RXADD to the row decoder circuit <b>108</b>, which may refresh one or more word lines WL indicated by the refresh row address RXADD. In some embodiments, the refresh address RXADD may represent a single word line. In some embodiments, the refresh address RXADD may represent multiple word lines, which may be refreshed sequentially or simultaneously by the row decoder circuit <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, the number of word lines represented by the refresh address RXADD may vary from one refresh address to another. The refresh control circuit <b>116</b> may control a timing of the refresh operation, and may generate and provide the refresh address RXADD. The refresh control circuit <b>116</b> may be controlled to change details of the refreshing address RXADD (e.g., how the refresh address is calculated, the timing of the refresh addresses, the number of word lines represented by the address), for example, by control signals provided by command decoder circuit <b>106</b>, or may operate based on internal logic.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The refresh control circuit <b>116</b> may selectively output a targeted refresh address (e.g., which specifies one or more victim address based on an aggressor) or an automatic refresh address (e.g., from a sequence of auto refresh addresses) as the refresh address RXADD. Based on the type of refresh address RXADD, the row decoder circuit <b>108</b> may perform a targeted refresh or auto refresh operation. The automatic refresh addresses may be from a sequence of addresses which are provided based on activations of the refresh signal AREF and/or pumps generated responsive to AREF. The refresh control circuit <b>116</b> may cycle through the sequence of auto refresh addresses at a rate determined by AREF. In some embodiments, the auto refresh operations may generally occur with a timing such that the sequence of auto refresh addresses is cycled such that no information is expected to degrade in the time between auto refresh operations for a given word line. In other words, auto refresh operations may be performed such that each word line is refreshed at a rate faster than the expected rate of information decay.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The refresh control circuit <b>116</b> may also determine targeted refresh addresses which are addresses that require refreshing (e.g., victim addresses corresponding to victim rows) based on the access pattern of nearby addresses (e.g., aggressor addresses corresponding to aggressor rows) in the memory array <b>118</b>. The refresh control circuit <b>116</b> may use one or more signals of the device <b>100</b> to calculate the targeted refresh address. For example, the refresh address RXADD may be a calculated based on the row addresses XADD provided by the address decoder <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to embodiments of the present disclosure, the refresh control circuit <b>116</b> may calculate one or more victim addresses. The victim addresses may correspond to victim rows have varying spatial relationships to the aggressor row. For example, the victim addresses may correspond to victim rows directly adjacent to the aggressor row (+/&#x2212;1) or victim rows more spatially distant from the aggressor row (e.g., +/&#x2212;2, +/&#x2212;3, +/&#x2212;4, etc.). Which victim row addresses are calculated for the aggressor row may be based, at least in part, on the state of one or more control signals. The control signals may be generated internally by the refresh control circuit <b>116</b> or another component of device <b>100</b> (e.g., command decoder circuit <b>106</b>), and/or externally (e.g., memory controller <b>101</b>). In some embodiments, the circuitry used to calculate the victim addresses for the victim rows may be the same for all of the victim rows, regardless of the spatial relationship of the victim rows. In some embodiments, the states of the one or more control signals may determine the spatial relationship of the victim rows for which the victim row addresses are calculated. For example, the control signals may have one or more states to calculate the +/&#x2212;2 victim row addresses and another one or more states to calculate the +/&#x2212;4 victim row addresses. The calculated victim row addresses may be used as targeted refresh addresses provided as RXADD during targeted refresh operations. In some applications, using same circuitry for calculating all of the victim row addresses may reduce the layout space necessary for the address calculation circuitry.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the refresh control circuit <b>116</b> may sample the current value of the row address XADD provided by the address decoder <b>104</b> along a row address bus, and determine a targeted refresh address based on one or more of the sampled addresses. The sampled addresses may be stored in a data storage unit of the refresh control circuit. When a row address XADD is sampled, it may be compared to the stored addresses in the data storage unit. In some embodiments, the aggressor address may be determined based on the sampled and/or stored addresses. For example, the comparison between the sampled address and the stored addresses may be used to update a count value (e.g., an access count) associated with the stored addresses and the aggressor address may be calculated based on the count values. The refresh addresses RXADD may then be used based on the aggressor addresses. In other embodiments, other techniques for determining the aggressor addresses.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">While in general the present disclosure refers to determining aggressor and victim word lines and addresses, it should be understood that as used herein, an aggressor word line does not necessarily need to cause data degradation in neighboring word lines, and a victim word line does not necessarily need to be subject to such degradation. The refresh control circuit <b>116</b> may use some criteria to judge whether an address is an aggressor address, which may capture potential aggressor addresses rather than definitively determining which addresses are causing data degradation in nearby victims. For example, the refresh control circuit <b>116</b> may determine potential aggressor addresses based on a pattern of accesses to the addresses and this criteria may include some addresses which are not aggressors, and miss some addresses which are. Similar victim addresses maybe determined based on which word lines are expected to be effected by aggressors, rather than a definitive determination of which word lines are undergoing an increased rate of data decay.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The refresh address RXADD may be provided with a timing based on a timing of the refresh signal AREF. During the periodic refresh operations of a refresh mode, the refresh control circuit <b>116</b> may have time slots corresponding to the timing of AREF, and may provide one or more refresh addresses RXADD during each time slot. In some embodiments, the targeted refresh address may be issued in (e.g., &#x201c;steal&#x201d;) a time slot which would otherwise have been assigned to an auto refresh address. In some embodiments, certain time slots may be reserved for targeted refresh addresses, and the refresh control circuit <b>116</b> may determine whether to provide a targeted refresh address, not provide an address during that time slot, or provide an auto refresh address instead during the time slot.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The refresh control circuit <b>116</b> may use multiple methods to determine the timing of targeted refresh operations.

For example, after entering a refresh mode, the refresh control circuit <b>116</b> may perform a certain number of auto refresh operations, and then perform (e.g., steal) a certain number of targeted refresh operations. For multi pump refresh operations, each time the active refresh signal AREF is received, the refresh control circuit <b>116</b> may perform M different refresh operations, by providing M different refresh addresses RXADD. The refresh control circuit <b>116</b> may have a fixed pattern where some pumps are assigned to auto refresh operation and some pumps are assigned to targeted refresh operations.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The power supply terminals are supplied with power supply potentials VDD and VSS.

The current value of XADD may be compared to previously recorded addresses in the aggressor detector circuit <b>232</b> (e.g., the addresses stored in the latch/register), to determine access patterns overtime of the sampled addresses. If the aggressor detector circuit <b>232</b> determines that an address (which, in some embodiments, may be either the current address or a previously stored address) is an aggressor address, then the identified aggressor may be provided as a match address HitXADD. In some embodiments, the match address HitXADD may be provided responsive to the signal ArmSample.

The RHR state control circuit <b>236</b> may use internal logic to provide the RHR signal. In some embodiments, the RHR state control circuit <b>236</b> may provide the RHR signal based on certain number of activations of AREF (e.g., every 4th activation of AREF, every 1st or 2nd pump of a double pump refresh operation). The RHR state control circuit <b>236</b> may also provide an internal refresh signal IREF, which may indicate that an auto refresh operation should take place.

For example, in some embodiments, for a double pump refresh operations, the RHR state control circuit <b>236</b> may activate the row hammer refresh signal RHR for a first pump and activate the internal refresh signal IREF for the second pump. Thus, in some embodiments, RHR and/or IREF may be referred to as pump signals for a multi pump refresh operation.

For example, targeted refresh addresses corresponding to HitXADD+/&#x2212;1 may be calculated more frequently than HitXADD+/&#x2212;2, which may in turn be calculated more frequently than HitXADD+/&#x2212;3. These examples are merely provided for illustration and the disclosure is not limited to these examples. Alternatively, the states of P<b>1</b>-P<b>3</b> may be set based, at least in part, by signals provided by another component (not shown), for example, a command decoder, such as command decoder <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, the states of P<b>1</b>-P<b>3</b> may indicate whether to calculate a first targeted refresh address or a second targeted refresh address.

In some embodiments, when AO=0 (e.g., HitXADD is an even address), P<b>1</b>-P<b>3</b> may indicate that HitXADD+Y is calculated first and HitXADD-Y is calculated second (where Y is a natural number). That is, the +Y address is the first address and the &#x2212;Y is the second address. When A0=1 (e.g., HitXADD is an odd address), P<b>1</b>-P<b>3</b> may indicate that HitXADD-Y is calculated first and HitXADD+Y is calculated second.
