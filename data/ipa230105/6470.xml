Users simply need to put an electronic product with a receiving coil on a wireless charger with a transmitting coil for wireless charging without requiring any cable connection. Charging can be performed anytime and anywhere, which is very convenient.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the wireless charging technology, magnetic resonance is used to achieve the effect of wireless charging. A magnetic resonance type wireless charging uses resonant devices (including inductors and capacitors) to drive a transmitting end and a receiving end to reach a specific frequency, so as to generate magnetic field resonance and energy.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although the magnetic resonance type wireless charging has the advantage of high transmission efficiency and becomes a focus of the development of the related industry, surrounding rings of a coil cannot be arranged side by side with one another when the magnetic resonance principle is used to achieve the wireless charging effect, and the substrate for accommodating the coil must requires a plurality of grooves for the surrounding rings. Moreover, the process of forming many grooves on the same substrate has certain technical issues, and it is necessary to overcome a large barrier to integrate the wireless charging function into a mouse pad because the process of forming many grooves on the same substrate is very difficult.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, it is a primary objective to provide a rigid wireless charging mouse pad that adopts the principle of electromagnetic induction together with a coil module formed by arranging a plurality of surrounding rings side by side with one another to overcome the technical issue of forming many grooves on the same rigid board layer of the related-art wireless charging mouse pad, and this disclosure only requires to set or form one single-ring groove on the rigid board layer.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To achieve the aforementioned and other objectives, this disclosure discloses a rigid wireless charging mouse pad, including: a rigid board layer with an underside and having a single-ring groove concavely formed on the underside in a longitudinal direction, and an inner top groove wall being formed on a concave end point of the single-ring groove; a double-sided adhesive plate adhered to the inner top groove wall; and a coil having a plurality of surrounding rings arranged side by side with one another in a lateral direction, and each of the surrounding rings of the coil being stacked and coupled to the double-sided adhesive plate in the longitudinal direction inside the single-ring groove and adhered by the double-sided adhesive plate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Compared with the related art, this disclosure has the following effect. Only one single-ring groove is set or formed on the rigid board layer to achieve the wireless charging of a mouse by the mouse pad. This disclosure has the advantages of reducing manufacturing difficulty, lowering manufacturing cost, and improving market competitiveness.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded view of a mouse pad of this disclosure, viewing from the bottom;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic view of an assembled mouse pad of this disclosure mouse pad, viewing from the bottom; and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an assembled mouse pad of this disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The technical contents of this disclosure will become apparent with the detailed description of embodiments accompanied with the illustration of related drawings as follows. It is intended that the embodiments and drawings disclosed herein are to be considered illustrative rather than restrictive.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref> for a rigid wireless charging mouse pad of this disclosure (hereinafter referred to as the &#x201c;mouse pad&#x201d;), the mouse pad is a rigid mouse pad with a wireless charging function. The mouse pad of this disclosure includes a rigid board layer <b>1</b>, a double-sided adhesive plate <b>5</b> and a coil <b>6</b>. In some embodiments, the mouse pad further includes an anti-slip layer <b>2</b>, a contact layer <b>3</b> and a support material layer <b>4</b> as described below.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The rigid board layer <b>1</b> may be any rigid board, as long as the rigid board is capable of setting or forming a groove as described below. In this embodiment, the rigid board layer <b>1</b> is a rigid plastic board, but this disclosure is not limited to such arrangement only. The rigid board layer <b>1</b> has a topside <b>11</b> and an underside <b>12</b> opposite to each other, and only one single-ring groove <b>13</b> is set or formed on the underside <b>12</b> of the rigid board layer <b>1</b>. In some embodiments, a communicating slot <b>14</b> is set or formed, and the communicating slot <b>14</b> communicates between the single-ring groove <b>13</b> and the outside. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the rigid board layer <b>1</b> has a length and a width extending along respectively a lateral direction D<b>2</b> and the other lateral direction (not labeled and perpendicular to D<b>2</b> and D<b>1</b>), and a thickness extending along a longitudinal direction D<b>1</b>, so that the aforementioned single-ring groove <b>13</b> is concavely formed on the underside <b>12</b> along the longitudinal direction D<b>1</b>, and an inner top groove wall <b>131</b> is formed on a concave end point of the single-ring groove <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The single-ring groove <b>13</b> may be set or formed openly, that is, the required single-ring groove <b>13</b> may be directly formed on the underside <b>12</b>. In other words, the required single-ring groove <b>13</b> may be directly evacuated from the underside <b>13</b>. The aforementioned method may be in a stacking form in which the rigid board layer <b>1</b> is stacked and combined to form the required single-ring groove <b>13</b>. For example, two bottom plates are stacked under a large top plate, and the two bottom plates are separated from each other, so that the required single-ring groove <b>13</b> is formed between the top plate and the two bottom plates. In other words, the single-ring groove <b>13</b> is sunken into the underside <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The double-sided adhesive plate <b>5</b> has a side attached or adhered to the inner top groove wall <b>131</b> and the other side adhered or fixed to the coil <b>6</b>. The double-sided adhesive plate <b>5</b> may be a surrounding plate in a shape corresponding to the single-ring groove <b>13</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, or a combination structure (not shown in the figures) formed by a plurality of double-sided tape units adjacently arranged with a space from each other. This disclosure is not limited to the aforementioned arrangement only, and it operates well as long as one or more double-sided tape units are attached or adhered to the inner top groove wall <b>131</b> to adhere and fix the coil <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The coil <b>6</b> has a plurality of surrounding rings <b>61</b>. In particular, the surrounding rings <b>61</b> are arranged side by side with one another to form a coil module (which is not labeled with a numeral and is formed by connecting a plurality of wires (or the surrounding rings <b>61</b>)) side by side with one another in the lateral direction D<b>2</b>, and the coil module is installed into the single-ring groove <b>13</b> in the longitudinal direction D<b>1</b> and stacked and coupled to the double-sided adhesive plate <b>5</b>, so that the coil module may be adhered and fixed into the single-ring groove <b>13</b> by the other side of the double-sided adhesive plate <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Both the head and tail of the coil <b>6</b> are arranged to form an overhang <b>611</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), and the overhang <b>611</b> is disposed in the communicating slot <b>14</b>, so that the coil <b>6</b> may be connected to an external power supply through the overhang <b>611</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">After the mouse pad of this disclosure is electrically connected with a power, a user may put a mouse (not shown in the figures) with the wireless charging function in a corresponding position or on the topside <b>11</b> of the rigid board layer <b>1</b> to charge the mouse on the mouse pad by the principle of electromagnetic induction. Since the rigid board layer <b>1</b> only has one single-ring groove <b>13</b>, therefore this disclosure may overcome the difficulty of forming a number of grooves in the same rigid board layer <b>1</b> of related art, and has the effects of reducing the manufacturing difficulty, lowering the manufacturing cost, and improving the market competitiveness.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Although the rigid board layer <b>1</b> has slight anti-slip effect, the mouse pad of this disclosure further includes an anti-slip layer <b>2</b> to improve the anti-slip effect. The anti-slip layer <b>2</b> is directly or indirectly stacked and fixed to the underside <b>12</b> of the rigid board layer <b>1</b> in the longitudinal direction D<b>1</b>. The anti-slip layer <b>2</b> may be stacked on the underside <b>12</b> of the rigid board layer <b>1</b> directly (not shown in the figures) or indirectly (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>). In this embodiment, the anti-slip layer <b>2</b> is stacked on the underside <b>12</b> of the rigid board layer <b>1</b> indirectly, and the anti-slip layer <b>2</b> is made of an anti-slip material and may be a rubber anti-slip pad or a silicone anti-slip pad.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The mouse pad of this disclosure further includes a support material layer <b>4</b> stacked and coupled to the support material layer <b>4</b> in the longitudinal direction D<b>1</b> and fixed between the anti-slip layer <b>2</b> and the underside <b>12</b> of the rigid board layer <b>1</b> to form the aforementioned status of the anti-slip layer <b>2</b> being indirectly stacked and coupled to the underside <b>12</b>. The support material layer <b>4</b> may be a plastic sheet or a film. Therefore, the coil module of the coil <b>6</b> may be stacked and coupled between the double-sided adhesive plate <b>5</b> and the support material layer <b>4</b> inside the single-ring groove <b>13</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In other words, the double-sided adhesive plate <b>5</b>, the coil module of the coil <b>6</b>, the support material layer <b>4</b> and the anti-slip layer <b>2</b> are stacked on top of one another in the longitudinal direction D<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition, the surrounding rings <b>61</b> used to form the aforementioned coil module are partly coplanar with the underside as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In other words, the underside of the surrounding rings <b>61</b> are coplanar with the underside of the rigid board layer <b>1</b> in order to prevent the anti-slip layer <b>2</b> and/or the support material layer <b>4</b> from being uneven when the mouse pad is in use.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Although the rigid board layer <b>1</b> has some effects of contacting the mouse for use, the mouse pad of this disclosure further includes a contact layer <b>3</b> stacked and fixed to the topside <b>11</b> of the rigid board layer <b>1</b> in the longitudinal direction D<b>1</b> to further improve the contact effect.
