Unfortunately, many people forget and/or overlook flossing as part of their teeth cleaning. Flossing is an equally important activity to maintain proper oral health.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Part of the problem in people overlooking flossing is the need to purchase a separate accessory. Specifically, a floss dispenser is typically required to obtain and/or use floss.
