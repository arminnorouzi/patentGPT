No. 63/156,039, filed Mar. 3, 2021, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to an air purifier apparatus. More specifically, the present invention is directed to an air purifier apparatus incorporating machine learning or neural networks to implement improved airflow, energy usage, and filtering properties.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Devices for respiratory protection are readily available for medical applications. The most common devices are negative pressure respirators, which typically take the form of either a mask, or a half mask respirator. In either case, the mask covers the nose and mouth while air is drawn through the filter by the negative pressure of inhalation. These types of masks increase respiratory stress because the user must overcome the air restriction presented by the air filter. A tight fit is essential to prevent unfiltered air from entering around the mask instead of through the filter. These types of masks also interfere with normal conversation because they cover both the nose and mouth.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also available, are Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) which use small battery operated motor and fan assemblies to draw air through the filter and supply it at a positive pressure to the user's face mask. These units eliminate respiratory stress and are not dependent on a tight fit between the face and mask. However, they also interfere with normal conversation because they are supplied with full or half masks that cover both the nose and mouth.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The problem with both these types of respirators is that they are not cosmetically appealing and are therefore seldom worn outside an industrial workplace. For example, those devices in the prior art, are not portable or unobtrusive enough to be suitable. U.S. patent to Her-Mou (U.S. Pat. No. 5,267,557) herein incorporated by reference, is directed to providing a nose mask with a filtering device and nose clamp. The mask has been adapted to have an inlet pipe, an exhaust pipe, and the air supply driven by a dc current motor. U.S. patent to Hauff (U.S. Pat. No. 4,233,972) herein incorporated by reference, teaches providing a battery operated filter blower unit supported by the person. The mask has a filter unit and blower unit that can be adapted to different types of face masks. The filtered blower also has an ejection space for the diffusion of blown air. U.S. patent to Pokhis (U.S. Pat. No. 4,331,141); Vrabel (U.S. Pat. No. 5,009,225); Sibley (U.S. Pat. No. 5,848,592); Piesinger (U.S. Pat. No. 6,772,762), all of which are herein incorporated by reference, provides a head and upper torso covering devices wherein upon inhalation, air from the ambient surroundings are drawn in through a filter and passed to the user. Additionally, the inventions optionally provide for an electric motor to impel air into the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, there are many non-industrial situations in which respiratory protection would be highly beneficial. Allergy sufferers would greatly benefit from a pollen filter when outside during the allergy season as would people bothered by air pollution on high pollution days. Airline travelers would benefit from a cabin air ozone and germicidal filter, especially on long flights. Hospital workers and patients would benefit from germicidal filters. Finally, industrial workers would benefit from a less obtrusive respirator in non-toxic environments such as woodworking.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Although negative respirators are worn in everyday non-industrial environments, they are seldom worn for long periods of time because of their obtrusiveness, respiratory discomfort, and difficulty in engaging in conversation. Currently available positive pressure PAPRs are large, noisy, and typically are supplied with full face masks. It would be extremely rare to see one of these units worn outside the workplace.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In summary, there are currently no acceptable devices for respiratory protection that are practical and cosmetically acceptable for use outside the industrial environment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Figuereo, et al in U.S. Pat. No. 5,878,742, herein incorporated by reference, attempts to make a PAPR more appealing by disclosing a plenum go arrangement near the forehead of the wearer along with a baffle for distributing the air from the plenum downward over the wearer's mouth, nose, and face. However, this device is still very large and obtrusive and would not appeal to users outside the workplace.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The primary problem with current portable PAPRs is that they are powered by fans or blowers. Fans and blowers can only supply very low static air pressures. This requires that large diameter hoses and large surface area air filters be used so as to not overly constrict the airflow from the blower. Typical hose diameters between a belt mounted blower and the facemask are one inch or larger.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another problem with current negative respirators and PAPRs is that they are designed to cover both the nose and mouth. However, covering only the nose would be perfectly acceptable in many non-toxic environments. For example, an allergy sufferer breathing filtered air through the nose would not be bothered by an occasional breath of unfiltered air through the mouth.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Yet another problem with both negative respirators and PAPRs is that they are only designed to filter the air and not to sterilize or condition it.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, it is the object of the present invention to provide a new personal positive pressure powered respiratory protection system having a cosmetically acceptable configuration and a streamlined profile.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additional technologies, invented by the inventor, are descried U.S. patent application Ser.

In one particular implementation, the apparatus is further directed to a modular filter system for use in connection with the personal air purifier system. In an alternative implementation, a filter of the air purification apparatus uses a cross-flow filter membrane that is portable and discrete. In one or more further implementations, an air purification device is provided that can be worn on the face and includes one or more integrated sensors to detect biometric data from the wearer. The detected biometric data is incorporated, in one or more further implementations, as part of a neural network that controls the opening or closing of input and outlet valves. In yet a further arrangement, an air purification apparatus incorporating one or more sensor devices is provided, where the one or more sensor devices are configured to evaluate the prescience of one or more contaminants within the filtered or unfiltered air. For instance, based on measurements of the ambient environment, one or more pre-trained neural networks are configured to generate values that correspond to instructions to activate one or more selectively activable filter devices. By way of example, where the neural network is configured to receive sensor data from one or more temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and particulate sensors, the air purifier is configured to active one or more selectable state activation filters based on an assessment of the neural network. Such conditions can be correlated to one or more adverse atmospheric conditions such that the neural network is able to dynamically respond to changing atmospheric conditions based on such predictions.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one or more particular implementations, the portable air purifier apparatus includes filter module interchangeability, such that new filters and functionality are provided in one or further implementations. Additionally, the apparatus makes use of one or more filtering elements using a cross flow filtering system. The cross-flow membrane system of the described apparatus is resistant to clogs. Additionally, due to the nature of air flow through the filtering modules, the filter modules have self-cleaning properties though the rejection, rather than absorption, of contaminants. In a further implementation, the air purification apparatus also includes one or more remote pressure monitoring sensors and associated control circuitry. For example, the air purifier apparatus of the present invention includes functionality that alerts the user to when the filtering module has accumulated a pre-determined threshold of concentrated contaminants and needs to be changed.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the apparatus described is a modular, portable, powered air purifier unit capable of supplying filtered or otherwise conditioned airflow to an individual on demand.

For example, the power supply <b>106</b> is a battery pack, fuel cell, or wireless charging device. Here, the power supply is one or more rechargeable or non-rechargeable battery cells. Alternatively, the power supply <b>106</b> is one or more wireless power devices, such as a collection of solar cells or photovoltaic materials. It should be appreciated that various combinations of power elements are combinable as the power supply <b>106</b>. For instance, where a solar cell is used, a collection of rechargeable batteries are also employed to provide supplemental power.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In still a further embodiment, AC/DC, 5V, airplane or automobile converters or charger interfaces are provided so that the power supply <b>106</b> is configured to access or obtain electrical power from an electrical grid, a transport power plant, or a generator. The power supply <b>106</b> provides and distributes power to the airflow generator <b>108</b> and to the control device <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one particular implementation, the control device <b>104</b> is one or more processors or computers configured to directly or wirelessly connect and control the operations of one or more devices suitable to be controlled thereby. By way of non-limiting example only, a processor of the control device <b>104</b> is configured by code executing therein to exchange data with one or more airflow sensors, biological or toxin detection sensors, or environmental sensors, selectable valves, control surfaces, display systems, remote computers, and integrated transmitters. Likewise, the control device <b>104</b> is configured to control the operation of the air flow generator <b>108</b>. As provided in more detail herein, the control device <b>104</b> can be any computer, processor, or collection thereof, suitably configured to execute the control operations described herein.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The airflow generator <b>108</b> includes electrical, and optionally, data connections to the control device <b>104</b> and power supply <b>106</b>. The airflow generator <b>108</b> is configured to extract ambient air from the surrounding environment via one or more air intake vents or ports (not shown) and direct extracted air to the user by way of the air supply conduit <b>107</b>. In one or more implementations, the airflow generator <b>108</b> is an air compressor. Building this particular example, the air compressor of the described apparatus is designed to function utilizing the low current and voltage supplies of batteries and other direct current power sources. The air compressor may be a custom or commercially available compressor suitable for the functions described herein. It will be appreciated by those possessing an ordinary level of skill in the requisite art that the airflow generator <b>108</b> includes all necessary gearing, valves, and other air movement elements necessary for a functioning air compressor so as to be fully described.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The electrical connections that provide linkages to the power module are provided within the body of the housing and are configured to direct electricity towards the internal mechanism of the airflow generator <b>108</b>. For example, in one or more implementations, the airflow generator <b>108</b> is a brushless motor.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another implementation, the air compression module <b>103</b> is configured to use a standard fan-bladed compressor to compress air. Here, the air is extracted through vent openings. For instance, vents integral to the form factor of the air compression module <b>103</b> or source device <b>102</b> provide inlets for ambient air to enter the system described. In an alternative implementation, the air compression module <b>103</b> uses blade-less fans or air compression devices, such as impellers. In a still further embodiment of the device, the air compression module <b>103</b> implements a bladed intake fan along with induced effects from an impeller using the Coanda effect. For example, the air compressor is configured to generate low-pressure zones around a vent and induce air flow that lacks buffeting. Therefore, in those embodiments incorporating this type of air compressor, the resulting air stream is less volatile and provides for a gentler inhalation experience. Those skilled in the art would rapidly recognize those materials and housing elements that would suitably allow for the durable construction of an air compressor, such as steel, plastics, composites and synthetic materials.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a still further embodiment of the air purification device described herein, air supplied to the filtering elements described herein may be supplied by a compressed air source, or air supply. For example, the air compression module, in one arrangement provides an inlet port for connection of a compressed air hose or supply line. Here the compressed air hose or supply line is connected to one or more mechanical ventilators or other devices that provide a flow of air to the apparatus described herein. In a particular implementation, an air pressure or air flow sensor is used to detect the presence of compressed air being provided to the inlet port. Based on the measurements obtained by the air pressure or air flow sensors, a processor of the control unit <b>104</b> causes the air compression module <b>103</b> to activate, deactivate, or vary the amount of air supplied to the air purification device. For example, where the processor of the control unit <b>104</b> determines, based on measurements made by the air pressure or air flow sensor, that the inlet port is supplying sufficient air to the user, then the processor causes the air compression module <b>103</b> to deactivate. However, where the flow provided to the inlet decreases below a pre-determined threshold, the processor of the control unit <b>104</b> causes the air compression module <b>103</b> to generate sufficient airflow by compressing ambient air to raise the flow of air provided to the user above the pre-determined threshold. For instance, where a separate compressed air supply (such as an air tank) is connected to the air purification device described herein, the air compression module can operate more efficiently by throttling its operation. Once the air supply is disconnected or exhausted, the air compression module then operates to supply the user with the desired air flow.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Turning back to the configurations described herein, the air supply conduit <b>107</b> is arranged to receive the compressed air generated by the air compression module <b>103</b>. In a particular embodiment, the air supply conduit <b>107</b> is a hose or conduit of flexible constructions and is designed to allow the mask <b>109</b>, the air supply conduit <b>107</b>, and the source device <b>102</b> to each have a relatively high degree of freedom of movement relative to one another. For example, the air conduit is one or more layers of flexible plastic or synthetic material that are air impermeable or semi-impermeable.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one particular implementation of the present apparatus, the air supply conduit <b>107</b> incorporates one or more filtering devices <b>120</b> positioned in line with the conduit or connectable between portions of the conduit <b>107</b> and configured to filter the ambient compressed air prior to delivering the air to the mask <b>109</b>. With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the air supply conduit <b>107</b> incorporates one or more crossflow filtration membranes.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">For ease of discussion, but without limitation to the particular mechanisms of action described herein, crossflow filtration refers to a type of filtration processes where feed flow (such as a fluid in need of filtering) travels tangentially across the surface of the filter, rather than into the filter. One advantage of the crossflow filtering (also known as tangential flow filtration TFF) approach this is that the filter cake (e.g. the accumulated particulates on the filter) is substantially cleaned away during the filtration process, increasing the length of time that a filter unit can be operational. Another benefit relative to air purification is that the crossflow filtration in certain implementations is a continuous process. In contrast, typical air purifiers use dead-end filtration in which the feed is passed through a membrane or bed, trapping the solids in the filter and releasing the filtrate at the other end.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Generally, crossflow is used in processes for extracting small particle sized permeate from complex component feed stocks. In crossflow filtration, the feed is passed across the filter membrane (tangentially) at positive pressure relative to the permeate side. A portion of the material, which is smaller than the membrane pore size, passes through the membrane as permeate or filtrate. All other materials, such as toxic compounds or other elements, are retained on the feed side of the membrane as retentate. With crossflow filtration, the tangential motion of the bulk of the fluid across the membrane causes trapped particles on the filter surface to be rubbed off. This means that a crossflow filter can operate continuously at relatively high solids loads without blinding and forms the basis of the described self-cleaning functionality.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the air supply conduit <b>107</b> contains one or more filter modules <b>120</b>. In a particular implementation, the filter modules <b>120</b> contain one or more filter elements <b>112</b>. In a particular example, the filter modules <b>120</b> have a flexible exterior sheath or encasement <b>122</b> that permits a degree of flexibility. In one or more particular implementations, the flexible exterior sheath is impermeable to gas. For example, when the filter modules are connected to one another, a gas impervious conduit is formed such that only air that has entered from the inlet is passed though the filtering elements. In this configuration successive filters can be placed in series so as to allow for successive filtering of a single source of air.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The filter elements <b>112</b> are a collection of hollow filter fibers which form a fiber membrane. Each filter fiber <b>112</b> is formed of a porous filter material and has a central lumen running its length. In one specific implementation, the filter fiber <b>112</b> has a length of between 30 to 110 cm and lumen diameters of 0.5 to 1.75 mm. In one specific implementation, the lumen has a circular cross section. Alternatively, the cross section of the lumen is rectangular, oblong, or oval. While the provided illustration depicts the fibers and roughly cylindrical in shape, it will be appreciated that the filter fibers can assume any shape so long as they possess a central lumen.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The body of the filter fiber is equipped with pores to filter a fluid flow passing tangentially across the interior surface defined by the central lumen. In one particular implementation, the range of pore sizes in a given filter fiber determines the selectivity of the filter. For example, the filter fibers <b>112</b> are microfiltration filters with pore sizes of 0.1 &#x3bc;m and larger. In another implementation, the pore size of the filter fibers <b>112</b> are within the range of 0.1 to 1 &#x3bc;m, as these pore sizes are suitable for separation of cellular organisms of a certain size. In a further implementation the filter fibers use ultrafiltration pores. Ultrafiltration filter fibers have pore sizes in the range 20 to 100 nm, and are generally characterized in terms of the nominal molecular weight cutoff (NMWC), which is the molecular weight of the largest globular protein that can pass through the membrane. NMWC values range from 1 to 100 kD (kiloDalton). These filters are used for concentrating and fractionating protein streams, virus concentration, desalting, and buffer exchange. The objective of most ultrafiltration processes is to retain airborne macromolecules such as bacteria, spores, toxins, viruses, contaminants and impurities above a certain size, while allowing the air to pass through the filter fibers.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Thus, in one or more implementations, successive filters can be arranged in series with filtering elements. Each filtering element in the series provides increasing small pore sizes.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one particular implementation, both ends of the filter fibers <b>112</b> are connected to an air intake interface <b>110</b>A incorporated into the filter module <b>120</b>. The air out flow interface <b>110</b>B is configured to connect one filter module to another, or to connect the filter module <b>120</b> to the mask <b>109</b>. In a particular implementation, the air intake interface <b>110</b>A includes one or more flow restriction baffles or conduits that direct all of the compressed air from the air compressor to the lumens of the filter fibers <b>112</b>. However, in an alternative configuration, the filter fibers <b>112</b> are closed at one end such that only one end is connected to the air intake interface <b>110</b>A.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">When a fluid stream (such as compressed air) is passed with positive pressure through the lumen of the fibers, the permeate (filtered air) passes (shown as dashed arrows) through the porous material and exits into the collection area <b>114</b>. It should be understood that the pressure difference caused by the air compressor drives components that are smaller than the pores through the filter. Furthermore, once passed through the filter, the filtered air is directed out through an air outflow interface <b>110</b>B and to the mask <b>109</b> or to a second or subsequent filter module <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one or more implementations, the interfaces (<b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B) include a check valve that opens or closes depending on whether the filter element is connected to the air supply control and source device <b>102</b> and/or the mask <b>109</b> or another filter module <b>120</b>. In a particular implementation, the check valves permit the removal of the filter element for inspection of contained or trapped contaminants or for refurbishment.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In an alternative implementation of the filter module <b>120</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the filter members <b>112</b> are each composed of large hollow fibers. In this arrangement, each fiber is connected at both ends to the air intake interface <b>110</b>A. According to the provided implementation, the fibers are capable of moving and flexing along with the flexible material sheath <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In an alternative configuration, the filter module <b>120</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, uses a single filtering material <b>112</b> having a central lumen. A cross-section of the filtering material <b>112</b> is provided in dashed lines. Here, a continuous stream of air (solid arrow) is passed tangentially across of the interior surface of the filter element and exits through a venting port <b>116</b>. In one particular implementation, the air exiting the venting port <b>116</b> is recycled and sent via a secondary conduit (not shown) back to the air compressor. Alternatively, in one or more implementations, the air exiting the venting port <b>116</b> is vented to the ambient surroundings.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the provided configuration, particles having a size smaller than the pores of the filtering material <b>112</b> are able to pass through the filter material (shown as dashed arrows). The filtered air exits the filtering module through the outflow port <b>110</b>B. In a particular arrangement, a secondary air conduit (not shown) connects the outflow ports of each filtering module <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and provides the collected air of each filtering module to a purified air conduit (not shown) that is coupled to the mask <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one of more further implementations, each filtering module <b>120</b> is formed of flexible construction, thus allowing the series of interconnected or singular filter modules to function as a conduit between the mask and the air compression module <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">While the modules herein described are an embodiment of the device as depicted in the Figures, those skilled in the art would recognize the additional modules that could be stacked on the device in question. For example, in a non-depicted embodiment, an additional UV filter is added to the filtering stage. A humidifier module can be added in addition or in alternative to the modules already provided. In both these embodiments, one or more electrical connections (such as those described in relation to the module power implementations provided herein) supply power sufficient to enable proper functioning of the modules <b>120</b>. In an alternative arrangement, such additional functionality is implemented within each of the filter modules. For example, a filter module includes one more UV filtering elements in addition to the physical filtering media.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in one or more implementations the filter modules <b>120</b> are communicatively coupled to one another such that the entire length of the air supply conduit <b>107</b> is comprised of filter modules <b>120</b>. Here, each filter module is equipped with a flexible outer surface encasing one or more filter elements <b>112</b>. Such configuration permits the air supply conduit <b>107</b> to function both as the filtering device as well as the conduit device that delivers filtered air to the mask <b>109</b>. In one or more implementations, the filtering modules <b>120</b> include different filter materials. For example, the total length of the air supply conduit <b>107</b> can comprise filter modules <b>120</b>, each having progressively smaller pore sizes. Alternatively, in one or more implementations, each filter module <b>120</b> comprising the air supply conduit <b>107</b> is utilized to filter a particular particulate or atmospheric agent. Here, one or more air borne pathogens, toxins, agents, or particulates are filtered by a specific filter, such that an additive effect of such filtering is provided.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a further arrangement one or more of the filter modules incorporate sensors or other devices to permit the measurement of conditions, such as internal pressure, number and nature of airborne contaminants. In one or more implementations, the filter modules are configurable with one or more electrical or electronic components as provided herein.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Turning to an alternative embodiment of an air purifier device, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, provides a modular air purifier. The air purifier apparatus is configured to have a series of discrete physical modules that are configured to fit to one another (<b>101</b>-<b>105</b>) so as to provide all the necessary functions of a portable air purifier. In one embodiment of the device, the power module <b>101</b> is secured to an air compression module <b>103</b>.

Where the processor is integral to the mask, in one arrangement the processor is configured to communicate with a wireless communication device (such as a smartphone) and provide an application executing on the wireless communication device with the data gathered by the sensors of the mask. For instance, the one or more processors are configured to receive and evaluate the sensor data transmitting such information to a mobile computing device. Here, the mobile computing device is configured to display an alert on the display portion of the device (such as a screen on the smartphone, or on the screen of a smartwatch).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In a further implementation, a plurality of masks can communicate with one another to determine or map the contaminants present in a pre-defined geographic location. For example, where a plurality of air purification devices are present in a location, the air purification devices are equipped with packet radio, RF, Wi-Fi, or other low power data transmission capabilities. Once an individual air purification device determines the presence of a contaminant, this data can be broadcast to the other air purification devices. In one implementation, the other air purification devices log this information or selectively activate one or more filtering devices or elements to counteract the presence of the discovered contaminant. Such data sharing can be implemented in real-time, as during a natural disaster where unknown toxins may be released and carried to different locations (such as by wind, etc.).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In another arrangement, the mask is configured to communicate with a database, data storage device, or appliance to record and update a central repository with information about the ambient air quality in the location provided by the user. Alternatively, a GPS unit, in one arrangement, is also incorporated or integral to the mask and communicates with one or more processors to provide location data and to transmit location data to a user display or to a remote database. In one particular arrangement, the processor of the control unit <b>103</b> is configured to access a database of present contaminants based on location data. For instance, where a database of atmospheric contaminants is maintained, which includes location data, the processor is configured to implement one or more activable filters based on the database of contaminants. By way of non-limiting example, where the database determines that the present location includes high levels of an atmospheric toxin, the processor is configured to selectively engage or active a filter element designed to filter such a toxin.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In a further embodiment, the sensors are integral to the filter modules and are designed to communicate via RF frequencies with one or more processors, such as either the remote computing devices, databases, servers, or other air purifications devices.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In a particular embodiment, the mask <b>202</b> worn by the user is equipped with one or more outlet valves configured to expel inhaled air back to the surroundings. In a particular embodiment, the outlet valves are operable by positive or negative pressure valves, such as spring or diaphragm actuated devices such that upon exhalation the valves open and allow air back into the environment. In another arrangement one or more sensors are connected to an electronically activated valve and cause the valve to open in response to measured biometric conditions, such as chest movement or detected exhalation.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In a further arrangement, biometric sensors, used to measure biometric conditions, are integrated into a wearable measurement platform, such as a smartwatch. In one arrangement, one or more pre-trained neural networks are used to control the opening and closing of the outlet valves. For example, an artificial neural network is trained on the breathing rate and air pressure of a user during normal operation. The neural network can be trained, based on a training data set of normal and abnormal breathing as well as exhalation patterns correlated to biometric data. For example, shallow breathing may be correlated to one or more biometric measurements, such as blood pressure, blood oxygen levels, or pulse. Based on the biometric measurements obtained by one or more biometric measurement devices, the neural network outputs a signal determining the amount of time that the outlet valves should be opened. For example, where the artificial neural network determines that the user is taking shallow breaths, the valves will open for short durations. In circumstances where the valves opened in response to internal pressure, the pressure generated by shallow breathing may be insufficient to trigger the valve operation. Thus, the neural network controls the opening of the valves to ensure that the exhaled air is vented from the mask <b>209</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In one or more embodiments, the air purifier device described is configured to generate a positive pressure within the mask so as to prevent the infiltration of biological, chemical or radiological elements into the interior space of the mask <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The outlet valve in one or more configurations directs the expelled air to a filtering attachment <b>203</b>. In a particular configuration, the filtering attachment is directly affixed to the mask <b>202</b> worn by the user as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The filtering attachment includes one or more filtering elements (not shown). One filtering element is a HEPA filter designed to filter out microorganisms from the air expelled by the user. In a further arrangement, the filtering elements are connectable or stackable such that air that passes through a first filter is then passed through a second filter, and subsequent filters. In one arrangement, a filtering element is a UV filter element, or other radiation delivering filter that is designed to deliver radiation to the air that has been expelled by the user.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In a particular arrangement, the air filter element includes an electro-static humidifier, dehumidifier, or other filtering technology to process air that has been expelled by the user. For example, one or more filter elements are negative ion generators, such as those described in pending Chinese Patent Application Nos. CN201510320872, and CN201510320874 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Furthermore, prior to exiting to the ambient air, the expelled air (including air that has been filtered) is analyzed by one or more sensors arranged to analyze the air expelled.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The outlet vent is, in one arrangement, connected to the expelled air filters via a conduit or hose. In this configuration the wearer can pipe or direct the expelled air to a series of filters that are affixed to the wearer or are otherwise remote to the wearer.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The mask <b>209</b> or <b>109</b> can include or incorporate a pair of detachable goggles that are configured to fit over the eyes of the user. In one or more arrangements, the goggles are contoured so as to form a tight seal with the mask <b>209</b> or <b>109</b> but not exchange air between the volume enclosed by the goggles and the volume of air enclosed by the mask. In yet a further arrangement, the goggles include one or more visual display elements, such as a heads-up display, transparent display, monocle, or other display device that is configured to provide visual information to the user. In one particular configuration, the display is configured to provide visual indications as to the ambient air quality or presence of specific or general contamination levels. For example, the goggles are equipped with one or more processors configured to receive data from the processor integral to the mask <b>202</b>, or from the sensors integral to the mask.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Furthermore, the sensors referenced throughout are configured to analyze the expelled air are further configured to provide information to the processor(s), such as the processor of the goggles, and indicate the presence of contaminates within the expelled air of the user.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In one or more arrangements, the sensors located both within and exterior to the air purification device are configured to evaluate the presence of chemicals, microorganisms, radiological or radioactive products or compounds, or other indicators of the health of the wearer. For example, one or more sensors are configured to sense the CO2 or other levels in the environment. Additionally, one or more sensors are configured to identify bacterial, viral or chemical agent, such as viral pathogens.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In a particular embodiment, each of the modules connected to the common power interface generate a signal or signature receivable by the processor <b>104</b>. In one or more arrangements, the processor <b>104</b> is also connected to the common power interface and is integral to the air purifier device. Here, each module connected to the common power interface broadcasts a signature (such as through a DC based powerline communication, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or near field RF communication) that is received by the processor <b>104</b>. The signals generated by each module include at least a standardized functionality (e.g. filter, humidifier). Additional information can be sent detailing the make, model number, specific purpose, or other elements of interest regarding the module. In a further arrangement, the processor <b>104</b> stores the module signature data in one or more local or remote storage locations.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In a particular embodiment, the processor <b>104</b> is configured to evaluate through the one or more connectable sensors and filter modules if the present ambient environment is toxic or contaminated. When toxins are detected, the processor <b>104</b> is configured by one or more software modules to use the signature of each filter to determine if one or more filters are sufficient to purify the ambient air. By way of non-limiting example, where one or more sensors detect a hazard (e.g. airborne toxin), the processor <b>104</b> evaluates the toxin against a stored or accessible list (stored locally or accessible on or through a network) of agents that can be filtered by the one or more filters or conditioning modules. Where the present filters are unsuited to filtering the specific toxin, an alert or alarm is raised indicating that the level of protection is inadequate.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">As described above, the modules of the present device are configured to fit together with one another. Specifically, each module can be combined with other modules so that the electrical and air flow connections can be passed from one module to the next depending on the arrangement of the modules. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the power module <b>101</b> connects to the air purifier <b>103</b> module by connection sockets or plugs <b>303</b>. The connection sockets <b>303</b> are equipped with electrical connectors configured to mate with sockets (not shown) located on one end of the air purifier <b>103</b>. These sockets provide both electrical connections, but also physically connect the modules into a single piece. Additionally, electricity as well as compressed air can be passed to the next module through similarly designed connection sockets <b>303</b>. In the depicted device the filtering module is connected. In the event that a filtering module is not necessary, the compression cone and hose <b>107</b> is fitted to the topmost module and is designed to ground the electrical connection and direct the compressed air. In those embodiments where the one or more filtering modules are present, the compression cone and hose <b>107</b> are simply secured to the output of the last filter.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the device described can be secured to the user <b>500</b> by means of a harness or belt <b>302</b>. The belt or harness <b>302</b> can be used to secure the device when in operation, and also function as a storage unit for when the device is not in use but is being carried. Additionally, the belt has portions or pouches for the storage of additional filter modules, additional power modules, or other elements not herein described.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">While the modules herein described are an embodiment of the device as depicted in the Figures, those skilled in the art would recognize the additional modules that could be stacked on the device in question. For example, in a non-depicted embodiment, an additional UV filter is added to the filtering stage. A humidifier module can be added in addition or in alternative to the modules already provided. In both these embodiments, the power module provides sufficient electrical power to provide proper functioning of the modules.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the alternative arrangement of elements, the portable air purification apparatus is equipped with a second air compression module, wherein the second air compression module provides an accelerated and pressurized air stream to the first air compression module.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In an additional alternative arrangement of elements the portable air purification apparatus is also equipped with an oral cavity mask configured to connect to the filtering module, this could be a separate filtering device from those envisioned as part of the apparatus. In this arrangement the oral cavity mask is configured to connect to an exhaust outlet. In an alternative arrangement, the power module is a battery pack, alternating current power supply or direct current power supply. The power supply can be computer controlled so as to be on a timer or respond to environmental conditions and factors.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The filter module can be selectively engageable, that is the filtering functions themselves can be selectively engaged by a user manually, or via a pre-programmed routine stored within the memory of a computer. For example, ionizing radiation inserts integral to a filter module are selectively engaged for specific events or situations. Other inserts for the filter modules are envisioned.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In a further embodiment, the air purifier described eliminates the need of a mask and instead direct air to the face of the user. In this arrangement, as provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the purifier filters ambient air using the power module, the compressor, and at least one filtering module. The air is sent to an accelerator <b>501</b> to accelerate the air to the face of the user. The accelerator can be a fan or other device configured to compress and send the filtered air to the user. Alternatively, the accelerator can use laminar flow, such as through the use of, planes, foils or other structures to generate an air curtain between the air purifier and the user to prevent the intrusion of contaminates into the user's air stream. In one or more embodiments, the mask-less configuration is secured to a user through a strap, lanyard, harness, or other device that allows the accelerator to be positioned so as to direct the purified air stream to the face of the user. For example, the angle and orientation of the accelerator <b>501</b> is changeable based on the user's anatomy and physical characteristics.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In a further embodiment of the air purification apparatus described, an oxygen generation module is provided. The air or oxygenation module provides a source of clean air or oxygen to the user independent of filters or other mechanisms used to purify air. For example, in instances where the ambient air cannot be filtered, or the filters currently equipped with the air filter apparatus are not sufficient to purify the air to an acceptable level, the oxygenation module provides a source of purified air for use by the wearer. In one configuration, the oxygenation module is a container of pressurized oxygen or air that is equipped with one or more control valves that selectively permit or restrict the flow of air to the air compressor module.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">For example, in an arrangement where one or more sensors detect the presence of an airborne toxin that the engaged filters are incapable of filtering, the processor <b>104</b> causes the one or more control valves to operate and provide stored oxygen to the user. In one or more further arrangements, the one or more sensors are configured to detect the level of oxygen in the ambient environment. In this arrangement, the air compression module is also configured with a selectively engageable inlet. Thus, the mask becomes an environment where air or oxygen is provided from only a stored source and the exhaled air is permitted to exit the mask due to positive pressure. Alternatively, the stored oxygen can be used to supplement the ambient environment. In such a configuration, the oxygen content of ambient environment is below a pre-determined threshold. Upon detecting that the oxygen level of the ambient environment has decreased below this threshold, the stored oxygen is mixed with the ambient environment air provided to the wearer. For example, one or more processors are configured to release sufficient stored oxygen to cause the oxygen level in the air provided to the user to be above a pre-determined threshold.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In one particular arrangement, the air or oxygen is supplied via a pressurized air or oxygen canister. The oxygen canister is, in one configuration, a standard sized oxygen tank equipped with one or more hoses or conduits to connect or transfer air or oxygen to the air compressor module <b>103</b>. In this arrangement, a tank interface module (not shown) is connectable to the air compressor so as to supply contaminate free air to the user.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In an alternative arrangement, an oxygen repository module is connectable to the air purifier apparatus. In one non-limiting arrangement, the oxygen repository module contains an amount of an oxygen sequestration compound. For example, in one arrangement the oxygen sequestration compound is 2-aminoterephthalato-linked deoxy system, [{(bpbp)Co2II(NO3)}2(NH2bdc)](NO3)2.2H2O (bpbp-=2,6-bis(N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)aminomethyl)-4-tert-butylphenolato, NH2bdc2-=2-amino-1,4-benzenedicarboxylato or a nitrate salt thereof as provided in Sundberg, Jonas; Cameron, Lisa J.; Southon, Peter D.; Kepert, Cameron J.; McKenzie, Christine J.

Sci., 2014, 5, 4017-4025; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In an alternative arrangement the sequestration compound is Tetramethylammonium ozonide ((CH3)4NO3).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In a particular configuration, one or more oxygen releasing devices are configured to induce the oxygen sequestration compound to release oxygen. For instance, the air purifier device includes one or more addressable or controllable heating elements configured to heat the oxygen sequestration compound until oxygen is released from the compound. In a particular configuration, the oxygen sequestration is connectable to the common power and air interface. Here, the processor <b>104</b> mediates the functioning of the heating elements to maintain a steady stream of generated uncontaminated oxygen. For example, the oxygen repository module also includes temperature sensors, backup power supplies, oxygen sensors, and one or more integrated control processors configured to communicate with the processor <b>105</b>. In one arrangement, the oxygen sensor is configured to evaluate the amount of oxygen provided to the wearer. The sensed amount is compared to a pre-determined threshold oxygen for a given user. Where the amount of oxygen in provided to the wearer falls below the pre-set amount, the oxygen repository module is configured to generate oxygen for introduction into the air flow provided to the user. In this arrangement, the user is provided with sufficient oxygen even if the ambient oxygen levels are below a pre-set threshold.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In another arrangement, the oxygen repository module includes a selectable charging port that permits ambient air to come in contact with the oxygen sequestration compound when the compound has been depleted of oxygen. In this arrangement, the oxygen repository module is configured to both store and release oxygen into the air compressor for further use by the air purifier device.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In one arrangement, the oxygen sequestration module includes between 0.1 and 10 liters of sequestration compound.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In a further arrangement, the oxygen repository module utilizes a pressure swing absorption device, chemical oxygen generators, oxygen candles, or the components of self-contained self-rescue devices, such as those using potassium superoxide.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In one or more arrangements, the air purifier is a portable device or collection of devices designed to provide clean, filtered, or otherwise processed air to users requiring protection from air pollution, including chemical, radioactive, airborne bacteria, molds, fungus, and virus particulates and particles.
