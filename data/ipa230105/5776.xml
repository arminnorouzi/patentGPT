However, it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without the specific details presented herein. Furthermore, well known features may have been omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the present invention. With specific reference to the drawings, it is stressed that the particulars shown are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the present invention only, and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the invention. In this regard, no attempt is made to show structural details of the invention in more detail than is necessary for a fundamental understanding of the invention, the description taken with the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how the several forms of the invention may be embodied in practice.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Before at least one embodiment of the invention is explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is applicable to other embodiments that may be practiced or carried out in various ways as well as to combinations of the disclosed embodiments. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Unless specifically stated otherwise, as apparent from the following discussions, it is appreciated that throughout the specification discussions utilizing terms such as &#x201c;processing&#x201d;, &#x201c;computing&#x201d;, &#x201c;calculating&#x201d;, &#x201c;determining&#x201d;, &#x201c;enhancing&#x201d;, &#x201c;deriving&#x201d; or the like, refer to the action and/or processes of a computer or computing system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and/or transforms data represented as physical, such as electronic, quantities within the computing system's registers and/or memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computing system's memories, registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices. In certain embodiments, illumination technology may comprise, electromagnetic radiation in the visual range, ultraviolet or even shorter wave radiation such as x rays, and possibly even particle beams.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments of the present invention provide efficient and economical methods and mechanism for designing metrology targets and for carrying out metrology measurements and thereby provide improvements to the technological field of semiconductor metrology. Metrology targets and methods are provided, which comprise at least two overlapping structures configured to be measurable in a mutually exclusive manner at least at two different corresponding optical conditions. The targets may be single cell targets which are measured at different optical conditions which enable independent measurements of the different layers of the target. Accordingly, the targets may be designed to be very small, and be located in-die for providing accurate metrology measured of complex devices.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Disclosed targets may be designed to implement a broad range of metrology target types, such as imaging targets (both optical and SEM&#x2014; scanning electron microscopy) and scatterometry targets (both &#x201c;grating-over-grating&#x201d; and &#x201c;side-by-side&#x201d; types)&#x2014;reducing the required real estate by at least a factor of four for these targets (from typical prior art 10 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;10 &#x3bc;m to disclosed target dimensions under 5 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;5 &#x3bc;m). Disclosed targets may improve metrology performance with respect to SEM/eOVL (electron-beam overlay) targets, and reduce imaging target real estate by removing the typical requirement of a lateral separation between features representing current and previous layers (as in imaging target types BiB&#x2014;box-in-box, AIM&#x2014;advanced imaging metrology, BLOSSOM, AIMid, etc.).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Advantageously, disclosed targets may be reduced in size down to 1.5 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;1.5 &#x3bc;m, enabling in-die overlay measurements and/or scribe line real estate reduction.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> are high-level schematic illustrations of metrology targets <b>100</b>, according to some embodiments of the invention. Metrology target <b>100</b> comprises at least two overlapping structures <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> configured to be measurable in a mutually exclusive manner at least at two different corresponding optical conditions. Overlapping structures <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> may be designed in any pair of corresponding layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> are shown separately and combined (overlapping), in top view. In the combined view, structures <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> are illustrated in a partly transparent manner to show the overlap between them.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In various embodiments, illustrated e.g., in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, at least one of overlapping structures <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> may be periodic with a specified pitch P, e.g., in the order of magnitude of such as e.g., in illustrated structure <b>115</b> (P=1 &#x3bc;m) and/or as in illustrated structure <b>125</b> (P=2 &#x3bc;m). In certain embodiments, metrology targets <b>100</b> may comprise a single target cell, with overlapping layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, that is smaller than 5 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;5 &#x3bc;m, as presented e.g., in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Structures <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> may be rotationally symmetric with coinciding centers of symmetry, and targets <b>100</b> may replace e.g., prior art AIMid targets.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> may be discriminated by optical conditions (for example: wavelength, focus, etc.) to make them measurable despite sharing the same real estate. For example, layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> (and/or structures <b>115</b>, <b>125</b>) may be designed to have mutual exclusive visibility at different optical conditions, e.g., layer <b>110</b> visible/measurable at a first set of optical parameters or conditions in which layer <b>120</b> is less or not visible/measurable; and layer <b>120</b> visible/measurable at a second set of optical parameters or conditions in which layer <b>110</b> is less or not visible/measurable. For example, layer <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be measurable in long wavelengths (e.g., between 420-1000 nm) while layer <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be measurable in short wavelengths (e.g., between 380-420 nm). In particular, lower, previous layer <b>120</b> may be measured at wavelength to which top, current layer <b>110</b> is at least partly transparent. In certain embodiments, top, current layer <b>110</b> may be measured at short wavelengths (e.g., between 380-420 nm) and made of materials which are transparent at longer wavelengths (e.g., between 420-1000 nm), such as oxy-nitrides, poly-silicon and some organic layers as used for the resist layer, ARC (anti-reflective coatings), etc. It is noted that targets <b>100</b> may be multi-layered, with different layers measured using different sets of optical conditions.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In certain embodiments, the layer which is measured at shorter wavelengths may also comprise correspondingly smaller structures&#x2014;leading to smaller area use and/or more features in a given area.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In certain embodiments, targets <b>100</b> used for thick stacks (e.g., as in V-NAND-Vertical NAND (NOT-AND)) may be measured using circularly polarized laser light (CPL), especially in short wavelengths, to separately resolve top layer <b>110</b> from bottom layer <b>120</b>&#x2014;using any of polarization, focus and/or wavelength as the different optical parameters.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Certain embodiments comprise in-die targets <b>100</b> for VNAND semiconductor devices and wafers, which are at most 4 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;4 &#x3bc;m, fitting into the maximal room available in VNAND to accommodate overlay target <b>100</b>. Advantageously, targets <b>110</b> are presently the only feasible solution for this case.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Certain embodiments comprise in-die targets <b>100</b> for DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) semiconductor devices and wafers, which are much smaller than 5 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;5 &#x3bc;m, e.g., 4 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;4 &#x3bc;m or smaller&#x2014;fitting into the maximal room available in DRAM to accommodate overlay target <b>110</b>. Advantageously, targets <b>100</b> are presently the only feasible solution for this case.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In certain embodiments, targets <b>100</b> may be positioned on scribe lines, reducing the required real estate therefore.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In certain embodiments, intermediate layers in the area of targets <b>100</b> may comprise assist or dummy elements, which may be used to minimize interference of radiation diffracted from bottom layer <b>120</b> with radiation diffracted from top layer <b>110</b> which is being measured. In certain embodiments, dummy structures may be designed according the first set of optical parameters and may be introduced to intermediate target layers. In certain embodiments, pattern on intermediate layer(s) may be designed to attenuate and/or block signals from lower, previous layer(s) for specified hardware configurations. For example, finely segmented intermediate layer structures may be configured to disperse radiation characterized by specific polarization (or any other optical) parameters stronger than radiation characterized by different optical parameters, which are used to measure the lower layers. In certain embodiments, even without specifically designed patterns, the intermediate layer(s) may exhibit some wavelength-dependent absorption (e.g., as do amorphous carbon and/or amorphous Si) which attenuate and/or block signals from previous layer at specified wavelengths that may be used to measure the top layer(s).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Targets <b>100</b> may be designed in MTD (Metrology Target Design) simulations to reach the condition of layer <b>110</b> being visible in a first set of optical conditions, and layer <b>120</b> being visible in a second and different set of optical conditions. Practically, the mutual exclusive visibility at different optical conditions requires, e.g., that the visibility of layer <b>110</b> under the first set of optical conditions is much better than the visibility of layer <b>120</b> under the first set of optical conditions&#x2014;to the extent that independent measurement of layer <b>110</b> is possible and/or that a good-enough overlay measurement is derived; and that the visibility of layer <b>120</b> under the second set of optical conditions is much better than the visibility of layer <b>110</b> under the second set of optical conditions&#x2014;to the extent that independent measurement of layer <b>120</b> is possible and/or that a good-enough overlay measurement is derived. The &#x201c;good-enough&#x201d; requirement may be selected as increasing information content of one of the measured layers, possibly supported by modifying its design, such as adding features or making them larger that can also be analyzed in simulations. While a certain increase in target element size may be required, targets <b>100</b> are still significantly smaller than prior art targets <b>90</b>. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it is noted that layer <b>110</b> includes three elements in structure <b>115</b>, while layer <b>120</b> includes only two elements in structure <b>125</b>. Thus, for equal contrast of the elements, the information content of layer <b>110</b> is higher than the information content of layer <b>120</b>. When the contrast of layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> is not equal, more elements and/or larger information content may be assigned to the layer for which a lower contrast is anticipated, to improve the overall target performance. Correspondingly, the information content of the target layers may be adjusted with respect to their expected or actual optical performance.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In various embodiments, illustrated e.g., in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, overlapping structures <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> may be mutually orthogonal. In certain embodiments, metrology targets <b>100</b> may comprise a single target cell that is smaller than 1.5 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;1.5 &#x3bc;m, as presented e.g., in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Structures <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> represent further reduction in size in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> with respect to FIG. <b>1</b>, to a single centrally symmetric feature in each layer <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, respectively. Certain embodiments comprise combinations of single-element structure(s) and periodic structure(s), e.g., at different layers.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Metrology targets <b>100</b> may be configured to be set in-die due to its small size and/or be positioned on scribe lines, reducing the required real estate therefore.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a prior art AIMid target <b>90</b> and its image <b>95</b> by a metrology tool. Typical AIMid targets <b>90</b> comprise current layer <b>91</b> and previous layer <b>92</b> having non-overlapping and separated features (structures) that have the same center of symmetry, e.g., each layer <b>91</b>, <b>92</b> comprises two features. Overall, target <b>90</b> comprises four features, which accommodate wafer real estate. In resulting image <b>95</b>, regions of interest (ROIs) are 96, 97 denoted with respect to target features in layers <b>91</b>, <b>92</b>, respectively. For example, in the illustrated example, each feature is 2 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;2 &#x3bc;m and some separation <b>93</b> is left between the features (e.g., 0.5-1 &#x3bc;m) to allow separating information coming from one layer from information coming from the other layer, yielding 5 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;5 &#x3bc;m for the features, plus an additional required exclusion area <b>94</b> surrounding target <b>90</b> to ensure separation between overlay information from target <b>90</b> and information resulting from surrounding structures, leading to prior art AIMid targets <b>90</b> larger than 5 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;5&#x3bc;m. The inventors note that not only are prior art AIMid targets <b>90</b> larger, a significant portion of their area (real estate) is dedicated to spacing between features rather than to measured structures. For example, in the illustrated prior art example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the total feature area is 4&#xb7;2&#xd7;2 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>=16 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>while the spacing includes ca. 9 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>separation <b>93</b> and 12-24 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>exclusion area <b>94</b> (assuming it is 0.5-1 &#x3bc;m wide, respectively)&#x2014;leading to 16/37=43% to 16/49=33% (respectively) target area occupied by the target features.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In contrast to prior art targets <b>90</b>, disclosed targets <b>100</b> use the target area more efficiently, and the ratio between the utilized target area and the required unused target perimeter is smaller as well as better scalable with shrinking target size. It is noted that prior art targets <b>90</b> require two types of unused area (which may potentially lead to signal contamination): (i) internal intervals <b>93</b> (e.g., strips) separating between features belonging to different layers <b>91</b>, <b>92</b>, and (ii) external intervals <b>94</b> (e.g., strips), which typically surround the target, separating between the measured features and the target exterior with features that potentially surround the target. Disclosed targets <b>100</b> remove the need for internal intervals <b>93</b> between target features in different layers, as the signals from layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> are distinguished by their optical properties rather than by prior art spatial separation. As the different optical conditions reduce or eliminate the cross-talk between the target layers, layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> are not captured on the same image (as in the prior art see image <b>95</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In this way, targets <b>100</b> are more efficient in their ability to use the internal area which in the prior art must be used for internal intervals <b>93</b>&#x2014;practically most or all of the overlapping feature area between layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> is used twice in disclosed targets <b>100</b>. With respect to prior art external intervals <b>94</b>, while targets <b>100</b> do not eliminate the need to design an unused target periphery, the part they take in the target real estate is smaller than in prior art targets <b>90</b> and therefore smaller targets <b>100</b> are enabled.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a high-level flowchart illustrating a method <b>200</b>, according to some embodiments of the invention. The method stages may be carried out with respect to targets <b>100</b> described above, which may optionally be configured to implement method <b>200</b>. Method <b>200</b> may be at least partially implemented by at least one computer processor, e.g., in a target design and/or in a metrology measurement module. Certain embodiments comprise computer program products comprising a computer readable storage medium having computer readable program embodied therewith and configured to carry out the relevant stages of method <b>200</b>. Certain embodiments comprise target design files of respective targets designed by embodiments of method <b>200</b>. Certain embodiments comprise metrology measurements of targets designed by method <b>200</b>. Method <b>200</b> may comprise the following stages, irrespective of their order.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Method <b>200</b> may comprise a metrology target design method comprising designing very small (1-5 &#x3bc;m), in-die-set metrology targets having overlapping structures that are distinguishable by the measurement conditions (stage <b>205</b>). Method <b>200</b> may comprise using, within a single target cell, at least two overlapping structures configured to be measurable in a mutually exclusive manner at least at two different corresponding optical conditions (stage <b>210</b>) and/or a measurement method comprising measuring the target at different optical conditions, e.g., at different wavelengths (stage <b>230</b>) and deriving a metrology metric from the measurements. In various embodiments, measurements may be carried out in several shots, switching between optical conditions between the shots, or simultaneously by multiple sensors, e.g., using two or more cameras designed to register signals at different optical conditions such as wavelengths, foci, etc. Corresponding optical architectures may be any which are used to measure imaging targets and used in imaging metrology.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Method <b>200</b> may further comprise configuring the structures to be rotationally symmetric and have coinciding centers of symmetry (stage <b>215</b>). Method <b>200</b> may further comprise designing the at least two overlapping structures to be mutually orthogonal and possibly designing at least one of the at least two overlapping structures to be periodic (stage <b>220</b>).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In certain embodiments, method <b>200</b> may comprise introducing dummy structures designed according to the first set of optical parameters into intermediate target layers (stage <b>240</b>)&#x2014;to enhance measurements of the top layer while attenuating interference of radiation diffracted from the bottom layer(s).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In certain embodiments, method <b>200</b> may comprise designing the single target cell to be smaller than 5 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;5 &#x3bc;m and possibly smaller than 1.5 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;1.5 &#x3bc;m, to be set in-die, e.g., further comprising configuring the target as an in-die overlay target 4 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;4 &#x3bc;m or smaller, for VNAND or DRAM metrology measurements (stage <b>250</b>).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In certain embodiments, method <b>200</b> may further comprise adjusting the information content of the target layers with respect to their expected or actual optical performance (stage <b>260</b>).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Elements from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref> may be combined in any operable combination, and the illustration of certain elements in certain figures and not in others merely serves an explanatory purpose and is non-limiting.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Advantageously, disclosed targets <b>100</b> and methods <b>200</b> shrink the real estate required for metrology measurements significantly, potentially enabling in-die overlay metrology that potentially provides more accurate and robust overlay control. In certain embodiments, targets <b>100</b> may be used particularly in critical layers of the design to enhance the accuracy of their metrology measurements.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Aspects of the present invention are described above with reference to flowchart illustrations and/or portion diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention.
