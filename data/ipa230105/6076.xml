It is becoming more and more common to produce electrical energy by such clean, renewable, non-fossil source. In recent years, photovoltaic technology has become cheaper as a result of the increase in efficiency and the reduction in costs linked to the increase in production volumes, which has also been stimulated by government incentives. Meanwhile, electrification of cars is proceeding at an increasingly fast rate. In this context, the use of solar energy for at least partially powering electric or hybrid cars is gaining attention. In order to apply a photovoltaic module to a car in a satisfactory manner, both in terms of functionality and aesthetics, it is necessary to consider that the surfaces of such cars almost always have a double curvature, i.e. a biaxial curvature. This problem, described herein using the automotive field of application as an example, is in fact a widespread problem since photovoltaic modules are usually produced by lamination, and are generally flat structures. The most common photovoltaic modules consist of a flat pane of glass and an aluminum frame, and are therefore intrinsically rigid; moreover, even flexible photovoltaic modules where a polymer replaces glass may not be adapted to double curvature surfaces for topological reasons.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Though it is obviously possible to construct photovoltaic modules having a double curvature, using typical techniques for curving glass or by injecting resins into molds, such solutions are more expensive than the ordinary production of photovoltaic modules in flat laminating machines. These techniques, being based on creation of molds, are also limited in the freedom of varying the final result, since a new mold is required for every new surface to be covered with a photovoltaic module.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One example of a solar roof for passenger cars is the Ford C-Max Energi, presented in 2014, in which a support for the photovoltaic module is placed on the roof of the car, and is designed to transform the double curvature of the roof into a single curvature. In so doing, flexible photovoltaic modules may be easily applied, but both the weight and the aerodynamics of the car are substantially modified. Examples where the roof of the car is replaced with a rigid photovoltaic module shaped to have a double curvature for example, are proposed by the company a2Solar GmbH or installed by Toyota and Hyundai on some of their models. The latest announcement in this field comes from the Japanese company Teijin Ltd, who have developed a curved roof using polycarbonate instead of glass. This is also a product produced by means of thermoforming, in suitable curved molds. Notably, all of the cases relate to products intended for original equipment, and are not to be applied to the roofs of cars that are already in circulation, i.e. in the aftermarket.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 4,717,790A describes how to produce a curved photovoltaic module starting from a glass surface which is already curved to the shape and size of the roof to be replaced. US20170141253A1 further improves this module by teaching how to reduce the stress of connections between one cell and another, by arranging the cells in groups which follow one curvature or the other.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Methods which do not use glass or other pre-curved transparent material are described in EP3712964A1, in which the curvature of at least one of the two surfaces of the panel is obtained by a resin injection molding process, and NL2021711B1, which uses the idea of dividing the cells into groups so as to start with single lamination steps which take into consideration a single curvature and then combine everything in a final process which results in a surface having a biaxial curvature. These two methods are also based on the use of molds and lamination techniques that are slower and more complex than those used in the construction of standard photovoltaic modules, i.e. they are based on the use of flat vacuum laminating machines. This makes the process for producing solar roofs more costly. Again, all of these techniques are suitable for producing original equipment solar roofs, and not for the market of vehicles that are already in circulation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">US20140130848A1 describes how a flexible photovoltaic module may be adapted to a double curvature surface if longitudinal cuts are made in the polymer material of the panel. In this way, the panel may partially deform to adapt to the convex double curvature of the roof. Disadvantages of this technique include the fact that the cuts follow the geometry of the cells and not the geometry of the roof, and therefore may not be effective for every possible curvature. Another disadvantage is that, by widening the cuts to allow deformation, the cells move away from each other, and the final result is therefore that of the cells on the surface of the roof having a density that is less than could be obtained by minimizing the spacing therebetween. Lastly, the process described finishes with the adhesion of the cut panel to a pre-curved, concave, transparent surface that forms the integral external surface of the roof. This again highlights the need to use different molds for each individual roof model.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The object of the present invention is to provide a technique for producing flexible photovoltaic modules that may be adapted to surfaces having a biaxial curvature, such technique being based on conventional methods for producing photovoltaic modules in flat laminating machines.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, a method is provided for manufacturing a flexible photovoltaic panel to be fixed to a double curvature support surface, the method comprising:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">generating a numerical model of a flat structure which is curved to conform to the double curvature support surface,</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">identifying, in said flat structure, compression zones subject to formation of creases or lifting as a result of the curvature imposed by the double curvature support surface,</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">determining a pattern of photovoltaic cells to be arranged on said flat structure, said pattern comprising a plurality of blocks of photovoltaic cells separated from each other by said compression zones, wherein neighboring photovoltaic cells of a single block of photovoltaic cells have smaller mutual distances than neighboring photovoltaic cells separated by one of said compression zones,</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">producing a flat photovoltaic panel on the basis of said pattern of photovoltaic cells, wherein said photovoltaic panel comprises</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">a plurality of photovoltaic cells arranged according to said pattern of photovoltaic cells,</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">an encapsulating layer configured to contain said plurality of photovoltaic cells,</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">at least one front layer made of flexible plastics material, the at least one front layer being joined to the encapsulating layer and overlapping the encapsulating layer on a first surface thereof, the at least one front layer being exposed in use to sunlight, and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">forming cut-outs in said compression zones, wherein said cut-outs pass through said encapsulating layer and the at least one front layer, said cut-outs being configured to close as a result of the curvature imposed by the double curvature support surface.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention is based on the observation that adapting a flat surface to a double curvature surface creates deformations of the first surface, with compression zones and dilation zones. Since the material with which a photovoltaic module is formed is not very deformable, it is in particular the compression zones which create problems, such as folds and lifting which prevent the photovoltaic module from adhering to the double curvature surface. The present invention is therefore based on suitably shaping the profile of the photovoltaic module in order to alleviate or even eliminate the compression zones when the module/panel is applied to the double curvature surface. The photovoltaic module shaped in this manner folds onto this surface with little effort and covers the curved surface as completely as possible. Notably, such photovoltaic module may also be applied to existing surfaces, such as roofs of cars in circulation, and is therefore also designed as a product for the aftermarket.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A further object of the invention is a flexible photovoltaic panel to be fixed to a double curvature support surface, wherein said photovoltaic panel comprises</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">a plurality of photovoltaic cells arranged according to a pattern of photovoltaic cells, said pattern comprising a plurality of blocks of photovoltaic cells separated from each other by compression zones, wherein neighboring photovoltaic cells of a single block of photovoltaic cells have smaller mutual distances than neighboring photovoltaic cells separated by one of said compression zones,</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">an encapsulating layer configured to contain said photovoltaic cells, said encapsulating layer being formed by a first layer and by a second layer which are arranged on opposite sides of said plurality of photovoltaic cells and fused around said photovoltaic cells,</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">at least one front layer made of flexible plastics material, the at least one front layer being joined to the encapsulating layer and overlapping the encapsulating layer on a first surface thereof, the at least one front layer being exposed in use to sunlight, and</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">optionally at least one back layer made of flexible material, the at least one back layer being joined to the encapsulating layer and overlapping the encapsulating layer on a second surface thereof which is opposite said first surface,</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">wherein cut-outs that pass through the encapsulating layer, the at least one front layer and the at least one back layer are formed in the compression zones, the cut-outs being configured to close as a result of the curvature imposed by the double curvature support surface.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention will be better described by some preferred embodiments, which are provided by way of non-limiting example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a portion of a photovoltaic panel according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a variant of the photovoltaic panel in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram which shows the main steps of a method for producing a photovoltaic panel according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a flat structure model showing the complete shape of a photovoltaic panel;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the model of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> to which an arrangement of photovoltaic cells is applied; and</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> show a portion of the photovoltaic panel at a cut-out, respectively with the photovoltaic panel in a flat configuration and applied to a double curvature support surface.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a diagram of the layers that make up a flexible photovoltaic panel according to the present invention.

With the variant shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the production process does not include the creation of the strings of welded cells, since the single cells are directly connected to the conductive backsheet <b>7</b> which creates the complete electrical contact of the photovoltaic module. The other steps of the process described above remain the same. The variant shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> makes it possible to more easily obtain freer arrangements of the photovoltaic cells, in which the linear geometry of the rows (strings) is replaced by a greater freedom of arrangement. The use of back-contact cells makes this easier to achieve.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, a method is described for manufacturing the flexible photovoltaic panel <b>1</b> that may be fixed to a double curvature support surface, such as the roof of a car. The support surface is denoted by reference sign R in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. The support surface may be convex, as shown in the example. However, the present invention also encompasses concave or saddle-shaped support surfaces. The photovoltaic panel <b>1</b> is made to adhere to the support surface R by means of the back layer <b>6</b> thereof or, if the back layer is absent, by means of the encapsulating layer <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Firstly, a numerical model of a flat structure which is curved to conform to the support surface is generated (step <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The modelled flat structure is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and denoted by reference sign <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Considering the double curvature surface R along which the photovoltaic module <b>1</b> is intended to be curved, it is necessary to study the deformations required to adapt the module <b>1</b> to the surface R. This may be done theoretically, using three-dimensional modelling systems such as the Rhinoceros&#xae; software developed by Robert McNeel &#x26; Associates, which makes it possible to study the compression and expansion zones of a flat structure which is curved in order to adhere to a surface having a bidimensional curvature.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Then, in the modelled flat structure <b>101</b>, compression zones are identified that are subject to formation of creases or lifting as a result of the curvature imposed by the support surface R (step <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The compression zones are shown approximately using dashed lines and denoted by reference signs <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. It is therefore possible to shape the edge of the photovoltaic module so as to remove the excess parts of the surface, i.e. those parts which, after curving, would form folds or other deformations, as will be described below.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A pattern of photovoltaic cells to be arranged on the flat structure <b>101</b> is then determined. The pattern comprises a plurality of blocks of photovoltaic cells (numbered <b>111</b> to <b>118</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) which are separated from each other by the compression zones <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> determined in the preceding step, wherein neighboring cells of a single block of cells (for example in the single block <b>111</b> or <b>112</b>) have smaller mutual distances than neighboring cells separated by one of the compression zones <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> (for example neighboring cells of the block <b>111</b> and of the block <b>112</b> which are separated by the compression zone to the top left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, which compression zone is denoted by reference sign <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The photovoltaic panel is then produced according to the lamination process described above, with the photovoltaic cells <b>2</b> arranged on the basis of the pattern of photovoltaic cells determined in step <b>30</b> (step <b>40</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Cut-outs <b>104</b>, <b>105</b> are then formed in the compression zones <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> in order to remove the excess material as stated above (step <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In so doing, it is possible to optimize the initial shape of the photovoltaic module by creating empty spaces (the cut-outs <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>; see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) which tend to close once the double curvature starts (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). This makes it possible to obtain the maximum coverage of the final surface R, even though starting from a flat photovoltaic module. In fact, the original photovoltaic module has a greater surface area than the curved surface to be covered. It is noted that the cut-outs <b>104</b>, <b>105</b> are formed starting from the edge of the photovoltaic panel <b>1</b>, and are oriented in mutually orthogonal directions.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The freedom to shape the edge of the photovoltaic module clearly depends on the presence or absence of cells that have the correct shape and that cannot be recut. To this end, it is necessary to start by finding a compromise between the arrangement of the cells and the requirements for shaping that depend on the particular curvature to be obtained. It is therefore understood how the described method for producing photovoltaic modules according to the variant in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be more suitable for the purposes of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The photovoltaic panel <b>1</b> described above may be fixed to the support surface R in a manner known per se, for example using mechanical means or adhesive materials, such that the back layer <b>6</b> or, if the back layer is absent, the encapsulating layer <b>3</b> adheres to the support surface R. According to one embodiment, the back layer <b>6</b> may comprise a magnetic material, in particular a permanent magnet, in order to facilitate the application of the photovoltaic panel <b>1</b> to a support surface R made of iron, or more generally a ferromagnetic support surface.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The advantage of the present invention for the purposes of industrial production is clear. There is no longer any need to create molds for each type of surface, for the purpose of using hot-forming or injection-molding methods. The best shaping of the photovoltaic module may be studied numerically, and it is possible to produce the photovoltaic module using the efficient, fast and economic method described hereinabove, in order to then shape the edges thereof simply by using a numerically-controlled cutter. Last but not least, the present invention makes it possible to create photovoltaic modules that may be applied to cars that are already in circulation, by making the module adhere to existing roofs.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A further development is that of using the cut-outs <b>104</b>, <b>105</b> to apply adhesive seals for sealing off the cuts from the upper side which is exposed to the hydrodynamic friction of air, and at the same time may be used to mechanically fix the module to the roof of the car if intended for the aftermarket. These seals may be pre-formed so as to have the shape of the cut or may be created at the time using adhesive resins.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The application of the photovoltaic module may be facilitated by using vacuum techniques, i.e. by applying a vacuum bag above the module so as to compress it and make it adhere homogenously to the double curvature surface. In this process, heat may also be applied (for example by radiating lamps) such that, if thermosetting resins are used, the adhesion of the module to the surface is facilitated.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
