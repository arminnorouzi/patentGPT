LITT uses collimated light with a diffusing tip to deliver heat to cells. Blood vessels dilate with temperatures of up to 40&#xb0; C., which result in an increased blood flow. Temperatures in the range of 40&#xb0; C. to 60&#xb0; C. cause denaturation of DNA and irreversible cell damage. Temperatures above 60&#xb0; C. cause/induce substantially instant cell death. Temperatures greater than 100&#xb0; C. vaporize water and cause carbonization of surrounding tissue. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is used to create thermal images of the ablated tissue and to monitor the laser-tissue interaction during the LITT procedure. Known clinical centers perform additional structural MRI at the end of a LITT procedure to visually verify the amount of ablated tissue. However, post-operative qualitative data may under or over-estimate the actual ablation due to changes in local tissue contrast.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional clinical workflow may not detect and/or may not accurately be able to monitor the actual effect of ablation on target regions and surrounding healthy brain tissue. Accurate monitoring/determination of ablated volume as well as functional integrity/connectivity of ablated regions can be important for the efficacy of LITT and may be able to provide better patient outcomes.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present invention are directed to systems, methods and computer program products configured to provide quantitative evaluation of thermally treated tissue during image-guided thermal surgical procedures such as during LITT procedures.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the present invention can provide systems, methods and computer program products that can improve thermal procedures such as ablation and/or LITT procedures to avoid non-target brain tissue damage, risk of complications, and/or reduce or avoid unintended neurologic deficits.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present invention provide methods, systems and computer program products that can facilitate reproducible thermal therapies of the brain (optionally ablations) to thereby facilitate therapies with the goal of improved, if not optimal, functional/neurological outcome.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the present invention can improve the efficacy of LITT and may also eliminate the need for subsequent (repeat) visits/ablations.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the present invention employ patient-specific, shape-constrained segmentation of a brain of a patient and mesh geometry/models to brain structures to define safety points and/or zones to facilitate thermal evaluation of thermal exposure information inside and outside a target treatment region.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present invention are directed to image-guided surgical systems.

The computer system can comprise software and hardware and can reside at least partially on a workstation of a surgical planning and/or image-guided surgical system.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The term &#x201c;brain atlas&#x201d; refers to a digital model of features of a brain, human brain for human uses and animal brains for respective animal uses. The planning system can be independent of any particular atlas. One example brain atlas is the WayPoint&#x2122; Navigator Software (manufacturer: FHC) which has an integrated brain atlas to assist with surgical planning and predictive modelling for DBS, LITT and epilepsy procedures. See, https://www.fh-co.com/product/waypoint-navigator-software. Another example is the NeuroQuant&#xae; Software (manufacturer: Cortech Labs) which has an integrated brain atlas to automatically detect 3D anatomical structures from MR scans for purposes of planning and neurological assessment.

The contents of the noted websites are hereby incorporated by reference as if recited in full herein. The brain atlas can be linked or referenced rather than included in an onboard library of the surgical planning system.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The term &#x201c;ACPC coordinate space&#x201d; refers to a right-handed coordinate system defined by anterior and posterior commissures (AC, PC) and Mid-Sagittal plane points, with positive directions corresponding to a patient's anatomical Right, Anterior and Head directions with origin at the mid-commissure point.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The term &#x201c;thermal&#x201d; with respect to the medical procedure and/or surgical therapy device includes, but is not limited to, an ablation device such as a laser, a hyperthermia device and a hypothermia device.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The term &#x201c;grid&#x201d; refers to a pattern of crossed lines or shapes used as a reference for locating points or small spaces, e.g., a series of rows and intersecting columns, such as horizontal rows and vertical columns (but orientations other than vertical and horizontal can also be used). The grid can include associated visual indicia such as alphabetical markings (e.g., A-Z and the like) for rows and numbers for columns (e.g., 1-10) or the reverse. Other marking indicia may also be used. The grid can be provided as a flexible patch that can be releasably attached to the skull or scalp of a patient. For additional description of suitable grid devices, see co-pending, co-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/236,621, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if recited in full herein.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The term &#x201c;fiducial marker&#x201d; refers to a marker that can be electronically identified using image recognition and/or electronic interrogation of image data. The fiducial marker can be provided in any suitable manner, such as, but not limited to, a geometric shape of a portion of the tool, a component on or in the tool, a coating or fluid-filled component or feature (or combinations of different types of fiducial markers) that, for MRI/CT uses, makes the fiducial marker(s) visible in a respective imaging modality with sufficient signal intensity (brightness) for identifying location and/or orientation information for the tool and/or components thereof in space.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The terms &#x201c;RF safe&#x201d; and &#x201c;MM compatible&#x201d; means that the so-called component(s) is safe for use in an MM environment and as such is typically made of a non-ferromagnetic MRI compatible material(s) suitable to reside and/or operate in a high magnetic field environment, without inducing unplanned current that inadvertently unduly heats local tissue or otherwise interferes with the planned therapy.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The term &#x201c;high-magnetic field&#x201d; refers to field strengths above about 0.5 T, typically above 1.0 T, and more typically between about 1.5 T and 10 T, including 3 T systems. MRI Scanners are well known and include high-field closed bore and open bore systems.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The term &#x201c;near real time&#x201d; means that (MR) image data is obtained during a thermal treatment (e.g., concurrent imaging and ablating) without requiring contrast enhancements and a corresponding image and/or visualization using the obtained (MR) image data is presented on a display within between about 1 millisecond to less than about 10 seconds from the time of the data acquisition. Typically, the image data is obtained while the thermal treatment is ongoing and a corresponding rendered image and/or visualization(s) is generated and displayed in a range of about 1-7 seconds. The imaging and visualizations can be sequentially generated during the thermal treatment with minimal latent time between serial image acquisitions.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Generally stated, embodiments of the present invention provide systems, methods and computer program products that can be configured to leverage geometry of defined, adjacent brain structures segmented with a shape-constrained deformable brain model in a high resolution pre-operative image volume. Embodiments of the present invention can employ patient-specific anatomical structures as boundary conditions, that can be defined and/or set by a clinician operator and used for controlling energy delivery during a thermal treatment such as an ablation. Thermal treatments occur in three dimensions not two dimensions, so setting safety zones/temperature guards or other boundary conditions in three dimensions provides for an advanced safety feature and for selective thermal treatments.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As is well known to those of skill in the art, the term &#x201c;segmented&#x201d; means partitioning an image into various subgroups of pixels to define image objects/brain structures of interest. The segmentation can identify boundaries, draw lines, and separate target structures or objects in an image from less relevant structures or objects.

The mesh models <b>100</b><i>m </i>can be surface conformable mesh models <b>100</b><i>m </i>of respective segmented brain structures <b>101</b>. The mesh models <b>100</b><i>m </i>can have contiguous sets of mesh elements <b>10</b><i>e</i>. Each of the mesh models <b>100</b><i>m </i>of a respective segmented brain structure <b>101</b> can be shown with a different color perimeter line <b>101</b><i>p </i>and/or corresponding color volume. Different mesh representations <b>101</b> of brain structures within the mesh model <b>100</b><i>m </i>can be encoded with a baseline and/or target thermal treatment temperature T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>. The target thermal treatment temperature can be a maximum and/or a minimum temperature or other defined temperature. The term &#x201c;encoded&#x201d; means that a temperature(s) is defined and attached to a particular mesh model <b>100</b><i>m </i>and/or locations of mesh elements <b>10</b><i>e </i>of a respective mesh model <b>100</b><i>m. </i></p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref> illustrate a prophetic example of patient-specific segmented brain structures <b>101</b> that can be used for guiding thermal treatment (e.g., ablation) of the amygdala <b>101</b><i>a </i>as a first one of the segmented brain structures <b>101</b>, shown with the red &#x201c;sun&#x201d; with white circle perimeter outline with sun spikes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>C and <b>3</b>D</figref>. A second three-dimensional-segmented mesh represented structure <b>101</b>, shown as corresponding to the hippocampus (blue outline) <b>101</b><i>h </i>can be identified as a &#x201c;safety zone&#x201d; <b>103</b> and used to inform when to cease thermal energy delivery when a perimeter boundary of the hippocampus <b>101</b><i>h </i>reaches a defined temperature. This allows for selective thermal treatment, e.g., ablation of only the amygdala <b>101</b><i>a </i>in this example.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">It can be important to control the delivery of energy/therapy, such that the treatment region, e.g., forming a lesion or ablation, by way of example, can be contoured according to the desire of the clinician/operator. This may be facilitated by informing and/or automatically ceasing energy delivery when operator-defined or otherwise identified patient-specific anatomical &#x201c;safety zone&#x201d; <b>103</b> (e.g., a tissue boundary) exceeds a baseline temperature and/or a defined temperature threshold.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The term &#x201c;safety zone&#x201d; <b>103</b> is used broadly herein to refer to one or more points, lines, curves, regions, shells, areas, volumes and the like in a patient that is not the target thermal treatment region but that may be relevant for sensitive tissue or nerve areas or for its proximity to the target thermal treatment region of trajectory path thereto. A safety zone <b>103</b> can be contoured to patient-specific anatomy and/or a specific thermal treatment. Anatomical structures <b>101</b> used for setting or defining a safety zone <b>103</b> may be clinician/operator-defined using a region- or volume-of-interest (ROI or VOI) software tool or otherwise identified and defined, for example automatic anatomical segmentation. Safety zones <b>103</b> may also be identified and/or defined through the use of multi-modal integration (e.g., one or more of MRI, CT, DTI, SEEG, MEG, MR spectroscopy, etc.) information. For example, identifying where fiber tracts pass through a brain structure exist, safety zones <b>103</b> can be set or defined for a particular patient, particularly where such a sensitive brain structure may reside adjacent or in close proximity to a thermal treatment trajectory line. The term &#x201c;safety zone&#x201d; refers to non-target tissue and/or sensitive tissue that is to be avoided during a thermal treatment by the treatment device and/or its thermal output, e.g., &#x201c;no-go&#x201d; regions in the brain.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Pre-defined, automatically (non-clinician/operator) identified structures <b>101</b> may be recommended to the operator as ROIs or VOIs for safety zones <b>103</b>. The perimeters, borders and/or interfaces with other identified structures <b>101</b> of these patient-specific anatomical structures <b>101</b> may then be chosen or removed as a safety zone(s) <b>103</b>, where the clinician/operator wishes to cease thermal (energy) delivery or by &#x201c;standard of care&#x201d; default for a defined medical procedure when a respective safety zone <b>103</b> approaches, exceeds, or falls below specified temperatures.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, a clinician/operator can select or pre-set one or more patient-specific segmented anatomical structures <b>101</b>, shown as a mesh model in 2D and/or 3D, during a pre-plan operation using a User Interface (UI) <b>301</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>) to define a safety zone <b>103</b> as a boundary outside the target treatment region when performing a thermal treatment such as an ablation or lesion and/or either hyper- or hypothermal treatments.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Additionally, having identified where the safety zone(s) <b>103</b> is/are in relation to the intended lesion/ablation target(s), the systems, methods and processing circuits (e.g., comprising software) can provide patient-specific imaging planes to best monitor the thermal treatment during treatment, e.g., allowing near real time visualizations of the lesion or ablation progress using, for example, MR thermometry. Near-real time MRI imaging for showing/monitoring thermal treatment progress may occur in 2D plane(s) and/or 3D volume(s) capturing both the safety zone(s) <b>103</b> and target treatment region such as a lesion/ablation target(s).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Using patient-specific anatomical structures <b>101</b> as boundary conditions, especially those segmented and in 3D, may be a leap forward from known current technology where only 2D ROIs, set by the operator, are used for controlling energy delivery during an ablation. Ablations occur in 3D, not 2D, so setting safety zones/temperature guards or other boundary conditions in 2D can be problematic. Setting boundary conditions in 3D can provide for an advanced safety feature and for selective thermal treatments such as ablations or lesions to be created.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">As the operator changes perspectives on imaging planes, especially in oblique 2D acquisitions of anatomy, it is easy to lose track of where the target is relative to the ablation. Tracking and utilizing, in 3D, patient-specific anatomy aids in the safe delivery of energy to create an ablation. More specifically, aids the operator in preventing too large of an ablation.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Multi-modal integration can allow for more-precise thermal treatments such as ablations to take place. In neurosurgery, specifically, the use of DTI for example may allow the operator to identify specific fiber tracks to safeguard.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Tracking, in 3D, how the thermal treatment is proceeding by monitoring how the temperature is approaching the &#x201c;safety zone&#x201d; <b>103</b> may allow for the proactive cessation of energy delivery, as opposed to reactive.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Although primarily described herein with respect to the brain, it is contemplated that embodiments of the invention are also useful for other medical treatments and associated anatomy (e.g., cardiac, neuro, prostate, pancreas, liver, etc.). Also, other imaging modalities may be used alone or in combination with Mill to carry out the thermal treatment(s).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Image data obtained in near-real time can provide be used to provide &#x201c;live&#x201d; or successive &#x201c;near-real time&#x201d; updates during an intra-brain surgical-guided MRI procedure whereby visualization of the thermal treatment, such as, for example, an ablation, in both regions with temperatures of each differentiated to correspond to actual temporally present temperatures can be shown concurrently in a patient being treated for a medical condition such as, by way of example only, Epilepsy.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Quantitative indices can be determined and/or measured within an anatomical structure and/or at one or more 3-D locations of respective mesh vertices <b>10</b><i>v </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) (e.g., the temporally current intrabrain temperature) and this information can be used to assess the procedure in near-real time, as a respective thermal treatment progresses during the procedure such as an actual ablation.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Embodiments of the present invention can be configured to provide calculated, quantitative indices of temperature and/or thermal treatment coverage of one or more of the brain structures <b>101</b> in near real-time and/or provide near real-time visual and quantitative feedback to a clinician operator during a respective active thermal procedure, such as during an LITT MRI-guided surgical procedure of the brain.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Embodiments of the present invention are configured to provide methods for quantitative assessment of a thermal procedure, such as a LITT procedure, using a correlation of a pre-planned ablation volume of one or more target brain structures <b>101</b> and defined planned ablation temperature(s) to corresponding volumes of the target brain structures and temperature measurements during the thermal treatment within the targeted brain structures <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Thermally treated volumes can be estimated within segmented brain structures <b>101</b> by detecting phase data and/or intensity changes of pixels/voxels of MRI image data within those regions with respect to the baseline values of those pixels/voxels in the pre-operative brain MM <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the mesh model <b>100</b><i>m </i>can be a mesh brain model with mesh elements <b>10</b><i>e</i>.

In other embodiments, a dynamic or active communication protocol between the circuit <b>300</b><i>c</i>/workstation <b>300</b> and the scanner <b>1500</b> may be used to acquire image data and initiate or request particular scans and/or scan volumes. Also, in some embodiments, pre-DICOM, but reconstructed image data, can be sent to the circuit <b>300</b><i>c</i>/workstation <b>300</b> for processing or display. In other embodiments, pre-reconstruction image data (e.g., substantially &#x201c;raw&#x201d; image data) can be sent to the circuit <b>300</b><i>c</i>/workstation <b>300</b> for Fourier Transform and reconstruction.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">Embodiments of the invention are particularly useful for neurosurgeries such as deep brain surgeries. An end user, such as a neurosurgeon, can prepare, review and finalize inputs using a defined workflow. Once the inputs are provided (and also typically prepared and reviewed by a user), a defined set of rules can automatically determine orientation of a directional medical device to confirm no twisting or deviation and that data can be presented to the user, typically via a display of a computer system such as a clinician workstation.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">The system <b>1000</b> can be configured to register CT image data and MM image data by initiating automatic fusion of scans and allow/prompt a user to visually review image fusion results. Fusion tools can be used to allow a user to manually correct each incorrect fusion result. Automatic registration of a digital brain atlas to an MM scan, such as a T1W scan, can be initiated and a user can be allowed/prompted to visually review registration results.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">For identifying the potential entry points, all safety zones/no-go regions in the brain (at least those within any proximity to entry sites and target treatment volumes) can be segmented or otherwise identified. The outer surface of the head can be virtually divided into defined sub-areas, optionally with maximal outer perimeter sides in a range of 0.1 mm-2 mm, such as about 1 mm square sub-areas. Entry can be defined by a grid applied to the head of a subject. See, co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

This is a common target for laser ablation, but the treated region can be any other brain structure or a lesion/tumor. In this example, the segmentation of the treated region shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B</figref> the hippocampus can be represented with a mesh surface of triangles. Instead of visualizing the mesh of the hippocampus in one color (blue in this case) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>.

The corners of each face are the mesh vertices as discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In this example, each triangle has three vertices, which are three points in 3-D space. Texture mapping can assign different colors to vertices <b>10</b><i>v </i>and faces <b>10</b><i>f</i>, and visualizations can provide measured temperature on the outer surface of the mesh elements. For example, the temperature can change from green (normal temperature) to red (ablated tissue) for different triangles on the mesh representing the treated region.
