transmits the signal, and electric coupling of the two transmission lines may increase.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In light of this problem, an object of the present disclosure is to provide an

connector includes the electrically conductive first partition wall that partitions the first contact and the second contact, and the second connector includes the electrically conductive second

When the first connector and the second connector are fitted together, the first partition wall partitions the portion of boundary between the third holder and the fourth holder where the second partition wall is not formed, such that first contact and the third contact cannot be seen from second contact and the fourth contact. With such a configuration, the first partition wall and the second partition wall complement each other and, thereby, can block electromagnetic waves that radiate from the second and fourth contacts or the first and third contacts. As a result, the noise that is introduced into the transmission lines of the signal can be reduced.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"
