This however puts an unreasonable limit on the number of connections that can be made. To facilitate an increased number of connections, so-called ball grid array packaging (BGA) technologies were introduced. In a typical BGA application, the entire lower surface (often referred as the &#x201c;front face&#x201d;) of a device is used to accommodate pads to which solder balls are attached. The pads are coupled to the IC whilst the solder balls in turn allow the device to be secured to, for example, a printed circuit board (PCB) with a matching pattern of copper pads.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to further increase the density of interconnection pins, a technology known as Embedded (or Extended) Wafer Level Ball Grid Array (eWLB) has more recently been introduced. eWLB takes advantage of wafer-level packaging (WLP) technology which allows packaging of an integrated circuit whilst still part of the wafer. Unlike WLP however, eWLB, does not create the package on a silicon wafer. Rather, it creates an artificial wafer. A front-end processed silicon wafer is diced and the singulated chips placed on a carrier. In some cases, a mix of singulated chip types are placed together on a carrier. The gaps between the singulated chips on the carrier are filled with a casting compound such that the entire structure forms single artificial wafer containing the multiple singulated chips. By subsequently removing the carrier leaving the encased singulated chips, electrical connections from the chip pads on the front face to the interconnects can be made using, for example, thin-film technology. Connections to interconnect chips to one another can also be provided. The completed artificial wafer can then be diced to provide individual devices. This approach allows for the &#x201c;fan-out&#x201d; of connections to a ball grid array, increasing the number of interconnects that can be made between a chip and external circuitry.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Whilst these eWLB technologies work well with many chip types, challenges arise where chips comprise electrical contact pads on a top or &#x201c;rear&#x201d; face the chip, either in addition to the pads on the front face or instead of these front face pads. Such rear face pads are often present in the case of optoelectronics chips including chips designed to operate as optical sensors. Chips of this type require so-called two-sided access (TSA) eWLB. U.S. Pat. No. 9,177,884 describes such an access solution and involves growing out metal &#x201c;stamps&#x201d; from electrical conductors on the rear faces of the chips prior to singulation. After the chips have been singulated and attached to the carrier, the chips are encapsulated within a polymer mold material. The material is then ground back to expose the various metal stamps which are now all at the same level. Thin film technology is used as with the known eWLB process to extend out the pads on the front face and to interconnect different chips. Holes are drilled through the mold material and the holes filled with a conductive material to electrically connect the extended pads on the front face to the rear face with conductive vias. Solder balls are attached to the tops of the conductive vias (at the rear face) and to the exposed metal stamps, thus creating ball array on the rear face. The artificial wafer can then be diced to provide singulated artificial chips. Chips of this type are referred to as Through Substrate Via (TSV) chips.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Singulated TSV chips may require further packaging, for example in order to incorporate passive optical components such as lenses and light guiding channels. The paper &#x201c;Selective over-molding of a CMOS TSV wafer with the flexible 3D integration of components and sensors&#x201d;, Johan Hamelink et al, 2017, 19th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference, describes a process referred to as &#x201c;film assisted molding and dynamic insert technology&#x201d; which involves locating a chip between upper and lower molds, whilst using a tool to apply selective pressure to an upper surface zone of the chip which must remain open following molding. With pressure applied by the tool, molten polymer is injected into the space between the two molds and cured to encapsulate the chip whilst leaving the upper surface zone clear of polymer. The process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is not however well suited to wafer-level production where over-molding is performed on the wafer prior to singulation of the wafer into individual optoelectronic devices.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of fabricating one or more optoelectronic devices each comprising at least one passive optical component, for example lenses.

In this state, the lens forming compound <b>17</b><i>a </i>will flow to conform to the surfaces of the optoelectronic components with which they contact. The compound <b>17</b><i>a </i>is then cured using UV radiation such that the compound forms a plurality of lenses <b>18</b>.
