No. 63/218,087, entitled &#x201c;Vascular Access Device to Reduce Buckling of a Probe&#x201d;, filed Jul. 2, 2021, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Catheters are commonly used for a variety of infusion therapies. For example, catheters may be used for infusing fluids, such as normal saline solution, various medicaments, and total parenteral nutrition, into a patient. Catheters may also be used for withdrawing blood from the patient.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A common type of catheter device includes a catheter that is over-the-needle. As its name implies, the catheter that is over-the-needle may be mounted over an introducer needle having a sharp distal tip. A catheter assembly may include a catheter adapter, the catheter extending distally from the catheter adapter, and the introducer needle extending through the catheter. The catheter and the introducer needle may be assembled so that the distal tip of the introducer needle extends beyond the distal tip of the catheter with the bevel of the needle facing up away from skin of the patient. The catheter and introducer needle are generally inserted at a shallow angle through the skin into vasculature of the patient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to verify proper placement of the introducer needle and/or the catheter in the blood vessel, a clinician generally confirms that there is &#x201c;flashback&#x201d; of blood in a flashback chamber of the catheter assembly. Once placement of the needle has been confirmed, the clinician may temporarily occlude flow in the vasculature and remove the needle, leaving the catheter in place for future blood withdrawal or fluid infusion.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Infusion and blood withdrawal using the catheter may be difficult for several reasons, particularly when an indwelling time of the catheter increase. A fibrin sheath or thrombus may form on an internal surface of the catheter assembly, an external surface of the catheter assembly, or within the vasculature near the distal tip of the catheter. The fibrin sheath or thrombus may block or narrow a fluid pathway through the catheter, which may impair infusion and/or collection of a high-quality blood sample.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The subject matter claimed herein is not limited to embodiments that solve any disadvantages or that operate only in environments such as those described above. Rather, this background is only provided to illustrate one example technology area where some implementations described herein may be practiced.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure relates generally to vascular access devices and related systems and methods.

In some embodiments, the probe <b>12</b> may be advanced through the catheter to push past any occlusions in the catheter or vasculature (e.g., thrombus or fibrin sheath at a tip of the catheter, vein collapse, valves, etc.) to create a clear pathway for fluid flow. In some embodiments, the probe <b>12</b> may reduce or remove occlusions, improving patency of the catheter for medication and fluid delivery, as well as blood acquisition, during a dwell time of the catheter.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the probe <b>12</b> may include a guidewire or a tube. Additionally or alternatively, the probe <b>12</b> may include one or more sensors.

In some embodiments, the housing <b>14</b> may include a proximal end <b>16</b>, a distal end <b>18</b>, and a slot <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, the slot <b>20</b> may extend parallel to a longitudinal axis of the housing <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the vascular access device <b>10</b> may include an advancement element <b>22</b>, which may extend through the slot <b>20</b> and may be configured to move linearly along the slot <b>20</b> between a retracted position illustrated, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, and an advanced position. In some embodiments, the retracted position may correspond to a fully retracted position in which the advancement element is at a proximal end of the slot <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, the advanced position may correspond to a fully advanced position in which the advancement element is at a distal end of the slot <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, the clinician may pinch or grasp the advancement element <b>22</b> to move the advancement element <b>22</b> between the retracted position and the advanced position.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the distal end <b>18</b> of the housing <b>14</b> may include a connector <b>24</b>. In some embodiments, the connector <b>24</b> may include opposing lever arms <b>26</b><i>a, </i><b>26</b><i>b. </i>In some embodiments, distal ends of the opposing lever arms <b>26</b><i>a, </i><b>26</b><i>b </i>may be configured to move apart from each other in response to pressure applied to proximal ends of the opposing lever arms <b>26</b><i>a, </i><b>26</b><i>b. </i>In some embodiments, in response to removal of the pressure applied to the proximal ends of the opposing lever arms <b>26</b><i>a, </i><b>26</b><i>b, </i>the distal ends may move closer to each other and clasp a portion of the catheter assembly, such as a needleless connector, another connector, or a proximal end of a catheter adapter, for example. In some embodiments, the connector <b>24</b> may include a blunt cannula or male luer configured to insert into the portion of the catheter assembly.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the connector <b>24</b> may include any suitable connector.

In some embodiments, the first groove <b>44</b> and/or the second groove <b>46</b> may be linear and/or configured to guide the probe <b>12</b> as the probe <b>12</b> is advanced distally and/or retracted proximally.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the advancement element <b>22</b> may include an arc-shaped channel <b>54</b>, which may be U-shaped. In some embodiments, the probe <b>12</b> may extend and move through the arc-shaped channel <b>54</b>. In some embodiments, the first end <b>28</b> of the probe <b>12</b> may be fixed. In some embodiments, the first end <b>28</b> of the probe may be fixed within the housing <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, in response to movement of the advancement element <b>22</b> a first distance, the second end of the probe <b>12</b> may be configured to advance distally a second distance. In some embodiments, the second distance may be twice the first distance. In these embodiments, the advancement element <b>22</b> and the probe <b>12</b> may have a 1:2 advancement ratio such that for a particular distance the advancement element <b>22</b> is moved along the slot <b>20</b>, the second end <b>28</b> of the probe <b>12</b> is moved twice the particular distance. In some embodiments, the second distance may be more than twice the first distance. In these and other embodiments, the probe <b>12</b> may extend through multiple U-shapes or other arc-shapes.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">It is understood that in some embodiments, the vascular access device <b>10</b> may not include the arc-shaped channel <b>54</b>, and the first end <b>28</b> of the probe <b>12</b> may be attached to the advancement element <b>22</b>.
