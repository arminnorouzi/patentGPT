For example, ligament reconstruction requires the alignment of a drill with an axis to form a tunnel in a bone to receive a ligament therein; biopsies require the alignment of a needle with an axis to reach a targeted location of tissue to be biopsied; spinal reconstruction requires the use of pedicle screws inserted with an axis in the pedicles of the vertebrae; and radiation treatments require the alignment of photon beams with an axis to reach a targeted tissue location for cancer therapy. These types of medical procedures all rely on the precise and accurate alignment of the tool to ensure a successful outcome.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One particular medical application requiring the alignment of a tool with an axis is the drilling of tunnels in bone for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction procedures. Rupture of the ACL is one of the most frequent injuries to the knee joint. ACL reconstruction is a common orthopedic procedure performed to repair the knee joint. Early stabilization of the knee joint by ACL reconstruction also decreases the risk of injury to other important structures.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The goal of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction procedures (as well as other similar ligament and tendon repairs used to repair other joints, including the elbow) is to replace a ruptured ligament or tendon with a graft that provides mechanical stability similar to the mechanical stability of the native anatomy while preserving the range of motion of the knee (or other) joint. However, the native cruciate ligature of the knee is highly complex, and presents several challenges for successful reconstruction procedures.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">During ACL reconstruction procedures a graft is placed into roughly the same location that the native ACL occupied prior to rupture. To achieve this &#x201c;colocation&#x201d; with a graft, holes (i.e., bone tunnels) are drilled along an axis in the femur and tibia in order to approximate the &#x201c;footprint&#x201d; of the native ACL. A graft is placed in these tunnels, and fixated by some means (e.g., anchors, cross-pins, etc.) to the bone on both ends. The graft is intended to restore stability to the injured knee, while maintaining range of motion.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the most significant challenge in ACL reconstruction is typically achieving the exact, correct placement of drilled bone tunnels (i.e., the holes drilled in the femur and tibia to receive the graft). When the holes are incorrectly placed (i.e., not drilled in the bone in the precise, correct location), the outcome of surgery is significantly affected. By way of example but not limitation, poor bone tunnel placement can result in restricted range of motion, knee joint instability, reaction of the synovium in the knee, and/or knee joint pain. Furthermore, impingement of the graft (e.g., in the femoral notch during movement of the joint) and/or improper graft tension may result in potential graft failure with lesion development. A study entitled &#x201c;Tunnel position and graft orientation in failed anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a clinical and imaging analysis&#x201d; (Ali Hosseini et al., International Orthopaedics 2012 April; 36(4): 845-852) confirmed that technical errors in the positioning of graft tunnels is the most common problem arising in ACL reconstruction. The study quantitatively evaluated femoral and tibial tunnel positions and intra-articular graft orientation of primary ACL reconstruction in patients who had undergone revision ACL reconstruction, and found that non-anatomically correct (i.e., incorrectly positioned) tunnel and graft orientation was a primary cause of graft failure. It was further determined that the sagittal elevation angle for failed ACL reconstruction grafts (69.6&#xb0;&#xb1;13.4&#xb0;) was significantly greater (p&#x3c;0.05) than that of the native anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundles of the ACL (AM 56.2&#xb0;&#xb1;6.1&#xb0;, PL 55.5&#xb0;&#xb1;8.1&#xb0;). In the transverse plane, the deviation angle of the failed graft (37.3&#xb0;&#xb1;21.0&#xb0;) was significantly greater than native ACL bundles.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Precisely placed bone tunnels are difficult to achieve through current surgical methods. Conventional techniques for ACL reconstruction include the use of hand-held instrumentation (e.g., drill guides) to align a hand-held drill in the desired tunnel placement, such as the tools described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,257,411; 4,739,751; and 7,972,341. Alignment of the hand-held instruments and the drill is particularly difficult because ACL reconstruction surgery is predominantly performed arthroscopically, and hence access to (and visualization of) both the femur and the tibia is typically limited by the surrounding anatomy. Arthroscopy provides a limited view of the anatomical structures and does not allow the surgeon to gain a complete <b>3</b>D view of important anatomical structures. During bone tunnel drilling, changes in bone density and/or uneven and/or slippery surfaces of the boney surfaces make hand-held drilling difficult. Furthermore, ACL reconstructions generally require surgical skills that present a high learning curve, and mastery is generally attainable only from high volumes of surgery and extensive experience. ACL reconstructions are therefore most often performed by experienced orthopedic surgeons. It is estimated that up to 20% of ACL grafts fail due to impingement, improper graft tension, or poor tunnel placement.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition to ACL reconstruction, there are several other medical procedures that require the alignment of a tool with one or more axes. Notable examples include: a) aligning a biopsy needle with an axis to reach a targeted tissue location for bone biopsies, brain biopsies, lung biopsies, etc.; b) aligning a syringe needle with an axis to reach a targeted tissue location for the delivery of medication, markers, or other injectables to a targeted tissue location in the brain, spine, lung, etc.; b) inserting fixation devices, for example, pins, nails, or screws, with an axis for spinal applications, fracture plates, bone reconstruction, etc.; c) laser, carbon dioxide, radiation, ablation, or radiofrequency treatment of tissues along one or more axes or to reach one or more targeted tissue locations along the axes; and d) any other procedure requiring the alignment of a tool with one or more axes to perform a medical procedure. For any of these procedures, accuracy and precision is paramount to a successful outcome, where computer-assisted medical systems can play a key role to ensure that success.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, there exists a need for a new and improved system and method to facilitate accurate alignment of a tool with an axis to perform a medical procedure. There is a more specific need for aligning a tool with an axis for the drilling of tunnels in a bone along the axis for ligament and/or tendon reconstruction surgery which improves clinical outcomes.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention comprises the provision and use of a system and method for aligning a tool with an axis to perform a medical procedure on tissue.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one preferred form of the invention, there is provided a method for aligning a tool with a targeted axis to perform a medical procedure on tissue, the method comprising:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">registering a medical plan to the location of the tissue using a computer-assisted medical system, wherein the medical plan includes a planned position for the targeted axis based on pre-procedure data;

Pre-procedure data is typically acquired and/or generated from medical image data derived from, for example, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, X-ray, or fluoroscopy. Virtual tissue models may be generated from the medical image data in the planning software using techniques known in the art (e.g., segmentation, marching cubes). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a schematic view illustrating a tissue representation &#x2018;TR&#x2019;, where the representation may be in the form of an image data set or a 3-D model of the tissue.

The user is afforded both accuracy and time efficiency to perform the medical procedure. The systems and methods are particularly advantageous for a hand-held device, and more specifically a 2-DoF hand-held device. A hand-held device is easy to maneuver and can quickly be brought into alignment with an axis. In addition, a hand-held device operating in two-degrees-of-freedom with one translational degree-of-freedom and one rotational degree-of-freedom may be especially suited for aligning a tool coincident with a plane, in which the present system and method exploit the use of intersecting planes to further align the tool with an axis. This allows a user to perform a variety of different medical procedures that go beyond the alignment of a tool with a plane only. The use of planes further provides flexibility for the user to place the reference markers in the tissue anywhere coincident with the targeted plane. Therefore, a user can choose the specific location to insert a reference marker in the tissue as long as the reference marker remains coincident with the plane.

As a result of the procedure discussed above, the longitudinal axis of the third bone pin <b>320</b> is now aligned with the central longitudinal axis of the bone tunnel <b>307</b> (i.e., the targeted axis) as planned.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">After the third bone pin <b>320</b> has been inserted into the tibial bone T using the 2-DoF device <b>102</b>, a tunnel may be formed in the bone using the third bone pin <b>320</b> as a guide. The guide clamp <b>312</b>, first bone pin <b>308</b>, and second bone pin <b>310</b> may be removed from the tibial bone T, leaving only the third bone pin <b>320</b> in the tibial bone T as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. Alternatively, the guide clamp <b>312</b>, first bone pin <b>308</b>, and second bone pin <b>310</b> may remain on the bone during the formation of the tunnel. In order to form the tunnel a surgical drill <b>322</b> operating a hollow drill bit <b>324</b> uses the third bone pin <b>320</b> as a guide to drill the tunnel. The hollow drill bit <b>324</b> slides onto or over the third bone pin <b>320</b> and the user drills the tunnel into the bone. Upon retracting the hollow drill bit <b>324</b>, the third bone pin <b>320</b> (and any other components) may be removed in the process.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In a specific embodiment, the tunnel may be formed without the use of a third bone pin <b>320</b>. After the guide clamp <b>312</b> is assembled to the first bone pin <b>308</b> and the second bone pin <b>310</b>, a tool <b>206</b> coupled to the 2-DoF device <b>102</b> may be used to directly drill the tunnel into the bone. A tool <b>206</b>, such as a drill bit or other bone removing instrument, may be coupled to the 2-DoF device <b>102</b> and once the tool <b>206</b> is coincident with the first virtual plane <b>304</b> (using the guide slot <b>318</b>) and the second virtual plane <b>306</b> (by way of the actuation of the working portion <b>204</b> of the 2-DoF device <b>102</b>), thereby aligning the tool <b>206</b> with the central longitudinal axis <b>307</b> of the tunnel, the user may directly drill the tunnel in the bone with the tool <b>206</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The above procedure may be repeated for a second bone (e.g., a femur bone). In ACL procedures, a first tunnel is created in the tibial bone &#x2018;TB&#x2019;, and a second tunnel is created in a femoral bone. After the two tunnels are created, the user can insert a replacement (i.e., graft) ligament into the two tunnels (i.e., the first bone tunnel formed in the tibial bone &#x2018;TB&#x2019; and the second bone tunnel formed in the femoral bone), and the graft ligament is then secured to the bone in ways well known in the art (e.g., by anchors, cross-pins, etc.) to finish the ACL reconstruction procedure.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 2</heading><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Brain Biopsy with 2-DoF Device</heading><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The following is an example of the inventive system and method for retrieving tissue for a biopsy, which may be particularly useful for brain biopsies, bone biopsies, and the like. In this example, the aforementioned tissue is brain tissue, the tissue representation is a virtual model of the skull and the brain, the reference markers are tacks, an alignment guide assembles to the tacks, a biopsy needle is used as a tool, and the targeted axis is an axis extending from the tissue to be biopsied (i.e., a specific target location) and out through the skull where the brain will be exposed.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">A medical plan may be generated as previously described. Planning software is used to define a targeted axis relative to a virtual model of the brain. The location of the tissue to be biopsied is also defined along the axis. A first virtual plane and a second virtual plane are then defined, where the planes intersect at the targeted axis. The medical plan is saved and transferred/uploaded to a computer-assisted medical system in the procedure room.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">A tracking array is fixed to the skull, and the medical plan is registered to the actual location of the patient's skull in the procedure room using registration techniques known in the art.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">After the medical plan is registered to the skull, the 2-DoF device <b>102</b> assembles a first tack and a second tack to the skull and coincident with the first virtual plane as previously described. An alignment guide (e.g., guide clamp <b>312</b>) is then clamped onto the first tack and second tack, thereby forming a slot between the first tack and the second tack.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">A biopsy needle actuated by the 2-DoF device <b>102</b> is then aligned with the targeted axis in the following manner. The user may first signal to the computing system <b>104</b> to change the plane that the 2-DoF device targets (i.e., change from the first virtual plane to the second virtual plane) using an input mechanism such as a trigger, button, or foot pedal. The user then moves the 2-DoF device <b>102</b> to align the biopsy needle in the slot formed by the alignment guide, and the control system actuates the working portion <b>204</b> of the 2-DoF device <b>102</b> relative to the hand-held portion <b>202</b> so as to align the biopsy needle coincident with the second virtual plane. The biopsy needle is then aligned with the targeted axis when the biopsy needle is coincident with the second virtual plane (by way of the actuation of the working portion <b>204</b> relative to the hand-held portion <b>202</b>) and the first virtual plane (by way of the slot formed by the alignment guide). With the biopsy needle aligned with the targeted axis, the biopsy needle is advanced into the brain. A graphical user interface (GUI) may be used to display the location of the needle in the brain in real-time. The GUI may also display the specific tissue location to be biopsied relative to the biopsy needle. Once the biopsy needle reaches the location, the tissue is retrieved through the needle.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">It should be appreciated that the above procedure to retrieve tissue for a biopsy may likewise be used to administer medications or other injectables to tissues in the brain and other areas of the body such as the spine, eye, heart, etc.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the event two tissue locations need to be biopsied in the brain, three planes may be defined to permit the 2-DoF device <b>102</b> to target each location. For example, with reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the user may define a first targeted axis <b>307</b><i>a </i>to reach a first tissue location along the first targeted axis <b>307</b><i>a</i>, and a second targeted axis <b>307</b><i>b </i>to reach a second tissue location along the second targeted axis <b>307</b><i>b</i>.
