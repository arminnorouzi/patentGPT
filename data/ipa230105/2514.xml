polymerization catalyst systems and processes, and, more specifically, the synthesis heterocyclic ligands, such as five-membered nitrogen-containing heterocycles like pyrrole or indole. The heterocyclic ligand can complex to group IV transition metal to form catalysts for olefin polymerization.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Olefin-based polymers such as polyethylene, ethylene-based polymers, polypropylene, and propylene-based polymers are produced via various catalyst systems. Selection of such catalyst systems used in the polymerization process of the olefin-based polymers is an important factor contributing to the characteristics and properties of such olefin based polymers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Ethylene-based polymers and propylene-based are manufactured for a wide variety of articles. The polyethylene and polypropylene polymerization process can be varied in a number of respects to produce a wide variety of resultant polyethylene resins having different physical properties that render the various resins suitable for use in different applications. The ethylene monomers and, optionally, one or more co-monomers are present in liquid diluents (such as solvents), such as an alkane or isoalkane, for example isobutane. Hydrogen may also be added to the reactor. The catalyst systems for producing ethylene-based polymers may typically comprise a chromium-based catalyst system, a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system, and/or a molecular (either metallocene or non-metallocene (molecular)) catalyst system. The reactants in the diluent and the catalyst system are circulated at an elevated polymerization temperature around the reactor, thereby producing ethylene-based homopolymer or copolymer. Either periodically or continuously, part of the reaction mixture, including the polyethylene product dissolved in the diluent, together with unreacted ethylene and one or more optional co-monomers, is removed from the reactor. The reaction mixture, when removed from the reactor, may be processed to remove the polyethylene product from the diluent and the unreacted reactants, with the diluent and unreacted reactants typically being recycled back into the reactor. Alternatively, the reaction mixture may be sent to a second reactor, serially connected to the first reactor, where a second polyethylene fraction may be produced. Despite the research efforts in developing catalyst systems suitable for olefin polymerization, such as polyethylene or polypropylene polymerization, there is still a need to increase the efficiencies of catalyst systems that are capable of producing polymer with high molecular weights and a narrow molecular weight distribution.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of this disclosure includes a catalyst system comprising a metal-ligand complex according to formula (I):</p><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="34.21mm" wi="58.76mm" file="US20230002515A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">In formula (I), M is a metal chosen from titanium, zirconium, or hafnium, the metal having a formal oxidation state of +2, +3, or +4.

For example, a (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>50</sub>)alkyl is an alkyl group having from 1 to 50 carbon atoms in its unsubstituted form. In some embodiments and general structures, certain chemical groups may be substituted by one or more substituents such as R<sup>S </sup>wherein R<sup>S </sup>generically represents any substituent defined in this application. An R<sup>S </sup>substituted version of a chemical group defined using the &#x201c;(C<sub>x</sub>-C<sub>y</sub>)&#x201d; parenthetical may contain more than y carbon atoms depending on the identity of any groups R<sup>S</sup>. For example, a &#x201c;(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>50</sub>)alkyl substituted with exactly one group R<sup>S</sup>, where R<sup>S </sup>is phenyl (&#x2014;C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)&#x201d; may contain from 7 to 56 carbon atoms. Thus, in general when a chemical group defined using the &#x201c;(C<sub>x</sub>-C<sub>y</sub>)&#x201d; parenthetical is substituted by one or more carbon atom-containing substituents R<sup>S</sup>, the minimum and maximum total numbers of carbon atoms of the chemical group are determined by adding to both x and y, respectively, the combined sum of the number of carbon atoms from all of the carbon atom-containing substituents R<sup>S</sup>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">The term &#x201c;substitution&#x201d; means that at least one hydrogen atom (&#x2014;H) bonded to a carbon atom or heteroatom of a corresponding unsubstituted compound or functional group is replaced by a substituent (e.g., R<sup>S</sup>). The prefix &#x201c;per&#x201d; has its usual meaning of &#x201c;thoroughly&#x201d; or &#x201c;utterly&#x201d;, for example, the term &#x201c;persubstitution&#x201d; or &#x201c;persubstituted&#x201d;, means that every hydrogen atom (H) bonded to a carbon atom or heteroatom of a corresponding unsubstituted compound or functional group is replaced by a substituent (e.g., R<sup>S</sup>), as in &#x201c;perfluorinated alkyl&#x201d; means every hydrogen in an alkyl group is replaced by a fluorine atom. The term &#x201c;polysubstitution&#x201d; means that at least two, but fewer than all, hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms or heteroatoms of a corresponding unsubstituted compound or functional group are replaced by a substituent. The term &#x201c;&#x2014;H&#x201d; means a hydrogen or hydrogen radical that is covalently bonded to another atom. &#x201c;Hydrogen&#x201d; and &#x201c;&#x2014;H&#x201d; are interchangeable, and unless clearly specified have identical meanings.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">The term &#x201c;(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>50</sub>)hydrocarbyl&#x201d; means a hydrocarbon radical of from 1 to 50 carbon atoms and the term &#x201c;(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>50</sub>)hydrocarbylene&#x201d; means a hydrocarbon diradical of from 1 to 50 carbon atoms, in which each hydrocarbon radical and each hydrocarbon diradical is aromatic or non-aromatic, saturated or unsaturated, straight chain or branched chain, cyclic (having three carbons or more, and including mono- and poly-cyclic, fused and non-fused polycyclic, and bicyclic) or acyclic, and substituted by one or more R<sup>S </sup>or unsubstituted.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">In this disclosure, a (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>50</sub>)hydrocarbyl may be an unsubstituted or substituted (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>50</sub>)alkyl, (C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>50</sub>)cycloalkyl, (C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>20</sub>)cycloalkyl-(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>20</sub>)alkylene, (C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>40</sub>)aryl, or (C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>20</sub>)aryl-(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>20</sub>)alkylene (such as benzyl (&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">The terms &#x201c;(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>50</sub>)alkyl&#x201d; and &#x201c;(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>18</sub>)alkyl&#x201d; mean a saturated straight or branched hydrocarbon radical of from 1 to 50 carbon atoms and a saturated straight or branched hydrocarbon radical of from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, respectively, that is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more R<sup>S</sup>.

Each cell is equipped with a glass insert with an internal working liquid volume of approximately 5 mL. Each cell has independent controls for pressure, and the liquid in the cell is continuously stirred at 800 rpm. Catalyst solutions, unless otherwise noted, are prepared by dissolving an appropriate amount of a procatalyst in toluene. All liquids (for example, solvent, 1-octene, scavenger solutions as appropriate to the experiment, and catalyst solutions) are added to the single-cell reactors via robotic syringes. Gaseous reagents (i.e. ethylene, H<sub>2</sub>) are added to the single-cell reactors via a gas injection port.

The pressure (within approximately 2-6 psig) is maintained by the supplemental addition of ethylene gas by opening the valve at the set point minus 1 psi and closing it when the pressure reached 2 psi higher. All drops in pressure are cumulatively recorded as &#x201c;Uptake&#x201d; or &#x201c;Conversion&#x201d; of the ethylene for the duration of the run or until the uptake or conversion requested value is reached, whichever occurs first. Each reaction is quenched with the addition of 10% carbon monoxide in argon for 4 minutes at 40-50 psi higher than the reactor pressure. A shorter &#x201c;Quench Time&#x201d; means that the catalyst is more active. In order to prevent the formation of too much polymer in any given cell, the reaction is quenched upon reaching a predetermined uptake level (50 psig for 120&#xb0; C. runs, 75 psig for 150&#xb0; C. runs).

The flask was attached to an aluminum heating block to act as a heat sink. Anhydrous ZnCl2 (19.9 g, 146 mmol, 4 equiv.) was added slowly. However, even with slow addition, the THF suddenly began to reflux, and therefore an air-cooled coil reflux condenser was attached. The slurry was stirred at room temperature for 15 min. Subsequently, the reflux condenser was removed and CyJohnPhos (0.511 g, 1.46 mmol, 4 mol %), Pd<sub>2</sub>dba<sub>3 </sub>(0.667 mg, 0.7283 mmol, 2 mol %), and 1-bromo-2,6-diisopropylbenzene (7.5 mL, 36.4 mmol, 1 equiv.) were added sequentially. The reflux condenser was reattached, and the black solution was stirred at 100&#xb0; C. for 42 h. The reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature, capped, and transferred to a fume hood. Water (10 mL) was added to quench any remaining sodium pyrrol-1-ide, and all volatiles were removed in vacuo. The black material was dissolved in water (200 mL) and ether (150 mL). A thick emulsion formed which would not separate. A large amount of black slimy solid was present, presumably zinc salts. The water/ether emulsion was filtered through a short pad of celite. During the filtration, the top of the celite had to be continuously scraped to allow the liquid to pass through. The remaining solid filter cake was further washed with ether (4&#xd7;50 mL). Now, a clear, yellow aqueous phase and black organic phase were sufficiently separated to allow for extraction. The aqueous phase was further washed with ether (3&#xd7;50 mL).
