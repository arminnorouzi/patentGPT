Description of Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 37 CFR 1.98</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In today's world part of computing devices, e.g. smartphone or tablet computer provides the functions of the electronic reading or editing features apart from communication with other people. These mobile computing devices are easily portable and have large storage facility for providing a great benefit to the user. When a user employs the above-mentioned computing device to read a variety of electronic books or text information, there is a need to extract some important or interested text paragraph from the text information and to store the uniformly extracted text paragraph in a predetermined document.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some examples, a screen size of a display of the computing device may be limited and more than one application may not be displayed at the same time. In such examples, pasting data selected from a source application into a destination application may include exiting or minimizing the source application to launch or maximize the destination application. However, minimizing or exiting the source application may not be convenient if the user seeks to continue using the source application. Even if more than one application may be displayed at the same time on the computing device, switching between a source application and a destination application to perform the paste function may cumbersome and time consuming.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Based on the aforementioned operation procedures, the user needs to change different interfaces of the application programs, which is a complicated implement procedure. Further, when the user selects different text paragraphs, the user does not stop switching operation interfaces, which downgrades the user experiences.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Users have been using multiple mobile apps with various features to achieve one common objective of content (information) management. No single product gives all the features required to be a complete solution for information management from start to end, to be able to save, search, share, manage and control access to content across multiple electronic devices, that is available online and offline and can be used anytime, on any machine.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, a need remains to provide an application which can run on a computing device and provide a single platform for the user to save content which the user is reading with one click, share the saved content with other users and collaborate with other users for conversing through an instant messaging application built in the platform so that the user need not leave the screen on the computing device to perform the above tasks.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">One or more shortcomings of the prior art are overcome and additional advantages are provided through the present disclosure.
