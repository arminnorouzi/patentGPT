Injection-molded trays are used to restrict the movement of semiconductor components during transport to various testing and manufacturing facilities. The injection-molded trays may be designed specifically to contain and protect, for example, semiconductor wafers, which are generally thin and circular.

For example, conventional injection-molded trays may inadvertently damage a semiconductor component due to an external force that is applied to part(s) of the injection-molded tray in contact with the semiconductor component. The injection-molded trays may also fail to properly dissipate static electricity, which may lead to damage to the semiconductor component due to electrostatic discharge (ESD).

Examples of semiconductors components include semiconductor wafers, semiconductor dies (e.g., bumped die or bare die), and other electronic components used in the fabrication of integrated circuits (ICs). Certain embodiments have been described in the context of semiconductor wafers for the purpose of illustration only. Those skilled in the art will recognize the separators introduced here could be used in the handling, transport, and/or storage of any type of semiconductor component.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Semiconductor wafer separators may be utilized to transport semiconductor wafers between multiple facilities during the semiconductor manufacturing and testing processes. Moreover, semiconductor wafer separators may be utilized to store semiconductor wafers within a storage facility before, during, or after such processes. Semiconductor wafer separators prevent semiconductor wafers from coming into contact with one another, thereby preventing damage to the semiconductor wafers.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Semiconductor wafer separators may be used to present the semiconductor wafer to a manual placement tool or an automatic placement tool (also referred to as a &#x201c;pick-and-place machine&#x201d;) for testing, wafer dicing, etc. Wafer dicing may dice the semiconductor wafer, and utilize a portion of the semiconductor wafer in the fabrication of an integrated circuit.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Semiconductor wafer separators can be used in the semiconductor industry in the transport of semiconductor wafers because semiconductor wafer separators reliably protect the semiconductor wafers from damage during transport. However, conventional semiconductor wafer separators suffer from several drawbacks. For example, many designs place the separator in direct contact with a large portion of the semiconductor wafer, which increases the risks of damage to the semiconductor wafer from physical contact and electrostatic discharge.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Introduced here, therefore, are semiconductor wafer separators that improve reliability in protecting the semiconductor wafers during handling, transport, and storage throughout various manufacturing and/or testing processes. The semiconductor wafer separator may include a first right-angled recess to receive a semiconductor wafer. The first right-angled recess is designed such that it has a specified width/depth that limits the portion of the semiconductor wafer in contact with the separator. The semiconductor wafer separator may also include a second right-angled recess to maintain a gap beneath the semiconductor wafer and prevent physical damage to the underside of the semiconductor wafer.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Terminology</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">References in this description to &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; means that the particular feature, function, structure, or characteristic being described is included in at least one embodiment.

As further described below, the semiconductor wafer separator <b>100</b> may be configured to handle semiconductor wafers of different sizes (e.g., wafers having a variety of diameters from 25.4 mm (1 inch) to 300 mm (11.8 inches)) to accommodate different semiconductor fabrication plants (also referred to as &#x201c;fabs&#x201d;), processes, etc. The semiconductor wafer separator <b>100</b> may be configured to maintain minimal contact with the semiconductor wafer to prevent damage to the semiconductor wafer.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the wafer separator <b>100</b> includes a circular body <b>110</b> whose shape is substantially similar to that of the semiconductor wafer. The shape and/or size of the circular body <b>110</b> may correspond to the conventional circular shape of many semiconductor wafers. In other embodiments, the wafer separator <b>100</b> includes a noncircular body (though the cavity within which the semiconductor wafer is set may still be circular). The size and/or shape of the structural body of the wafer separator <b>100</b> may be based on the design of the container within which the wafer separator <b>100</b> is to be placed. For example, circular bodies may be used in combination with a cylindrical container, while noncircular bodies may be used in combination with a non-cylindrical container (e.g., a cuboid or a triangular prism).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the circular body <b>110</b> takes the form of an annulus having an outer edge <b>112</b> defining the periphery of the circular body <b>110</b> and an inner edge <b>114</b> defining a central opening <b>116</b> of the circular body. The outer edge <b>112</b> may extend along the entire outer periphery of the circular body <b>110</b> in an uninterrupted manner. The inner edge <b>114</b>, meanwhile, may be substantially parallel to the outer edge <b>112</b>. Accordingly, when the semiconductor wafer is set within the circular body <b>110</b>, the inner edge <b>114</b> may be substantially perpendicular to the bottom surface of the semiconductor wafer and substantially parallel to the outer edge of the semiconductor wafer. In some embodiments the sidewalls forming the inner edge <b>114</b> are substantially orthogonal to the undersign of the circular body <b>110</b>, while in other embodiments the sidewalls forming the inner edge are pitched (i.e., angled). The central opening <b>116</b> may be arranged such that it is centered at the center of the semiconductor wafer separator <b>100</b> and/or the center of the semiconductor wafer.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The circular body <b>110</b> may include a top surface <b>118</b> and a bottom surface <b>120</b>. The top surface <b>118</b> and the bottom surface <b>120</b> may be substantially parallel to one another, as well as substantially perpendicular to the outer edge <b>112</b>. The top surface <b>118</b> may define the uppermost point (i.e., the greatest height of any surface) of the circular body <b>110</b>. In some embodiments the bottom surface <b>120</b> defines the lowermost point of the circular body <b>110</b>, while in other embodiments one or more interlock components disposed along the bottom surface <b>120</b> define the lowermost point(s).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A first right-angled recess <b>122</b> formed in the circular body <b>110</b> may be adapted to receive the semiconductor wafer. The first right-angled recess <b>122</b> may extend downward from the top surface <b>118</b>. In some embodiments, the first right-angled recess <b>122</b> forms an angle that measures substantially 90 degrees and complements the form of the semiconductor wafer. Accordingly, the first right-angled recess <b>122</b> may comprise a first vertical surface <b>124</b> and a first horizontal surface <b>126</b> that are orthogonal to one another. The first vertical surface <b>124</b> may be substantially parallel with the outer edge <b>112</b>, while the first horizontal surface <b>126</b> may be substantially parallel with the top surface <b>118</b>. A semiconductor wafer may be in contact with the first horizontal surface <b>126</b> and/or the first vertical surface <b>124</b> when the semiconductor wafer is placed in the first right-angled recess <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Those skilled in the art will recognize that the first right-angled recess <b>122</b> could also form some other angle (i.e., other than substantially 90 degrees). For example, the first right-angled recess <b>122</b> may instead include a first horizontal surface <b>24</b> and/or a first vertical surface <b>126</b> that is curved. Curving the first vertical surface <b>24</b> of the first right-angled recess <b>122</b> may allow for less surface area of the first vertical surface <b>124</b> to be in contact with a semiconductor component. Additionally or alternatively, the first vertical surface <b>124</b> may include a pocket or a slot that allows the outer portion of the semiconductor wafer to fit into the first right-angled recess <b>122</b> and prevents vertical movement of the semiconductor wafer.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The circular body <b>110</b> may also include a second right-angled recess <b>128</b> that extends downward from the first horizontal surface <b>126</b> of the first right-angled recess <b>122</b>. However, the second right-angled recess <b>128</b> may not come into contact with the semiconductor wafer. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the second right-angled recess <b>128</b> may cause a gap to be formed beneath the semiconductor wafer. More specifically, a second vertical surface <b>144</b> may ensure that a gap of a specific height is formed between the semiconductor wafer and the second horizontal surface <b>142</b> of the second right-angled recess <b>128</b>. The second right-angled recess <b>128</b> may include an angle substantially similar to that of the first right-angled recess <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A first interlock component <b>132</b> may be located on the circular body <b>110</b> of the semiconductor wafer separator <b>100</b>. Here, for example, the first interlock component <b>132</b> is disposed along the top surface <b>118</b> of the circular body <b>110</b>. The first interlock component <b>132</b> may be designed to engage with another interlock component.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A second interlock component <b>134</b> may also be located on the circular body <b>110</b> of the semiconductor wafer separator <b>100</b>. Here, for example, the second interlock component <b>134</b> is disposed along the bottom surface <b>120</b> of the circular body <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The interlock components may be of various interlock types (e.g., complementary interlock types). For instance, one of the interlock components may comprise a first interlock component type, such as a notch, slot, recess, or another known form/component capable of receive an interlock component. Meanwhile, the other interlock component may comprise a second interlock component type, such as a protrusion, projection, or another known form/component capable of being received by an interlock component of the first interlock component type. The first component type and the second component type may be disposed at an angle relative to the outer edge <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The second interlock component <b>134</b> may comprise a different interlock component type than the first interlock component <b>132</b>. Here, for example, the first interlock component <b>132</b> comprises a first interlock component type (e.g., a notch) and the second interlock component <b>134</b> comprises a second interlock component type (e.g., a protrusion). Accordingly, the first interlock component <b>132</b> can engage a corresponding interlock component of the second type on an upwardly-adjacent wafer separator, while the second interlock component <b>134</b> can engage a corresponding interlock component of the first type on a downwardly-adjacent wafer separator. The interlock components <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> could be of the same interlock component type or different interlock component types.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">While the interlock components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> extend around the entirety of the top and bottom surfaces <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, those skilled in the art will recognize that other designs are also possible. More specifically, the top and bottom surfaces <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> may each include a specified number (e.g., two, three, four, or eight) of interlock components. For example, the circular body <b>110</b> could include two interlock components on opposite sides of the top surface <b>118</b> and two interlock components on opposite sides of the bottom surface <b>120</b>.
