Adhesives and fasteners should withstand chemical, thermal, and physical conditions experienced by the vehicle. Adhesives offer greater performance, better design efficiency, and lower weight as compared to fasteners used for connecting the vehicle/aircraft components to one another. In particular, thermosets chemically or physically join vehicle/aircraft components.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">High temperature adhesives and elastomers are provided in a green state, or prepolymer form, with a specified application method and curing procedure. These procedures often involve specialized equipment and strict protocols to apply and cure the resins safely and effectively. The variety of high temperature adhesives and elastomers is limited by the chemical diversity of precursor elements with sufficiently high temperature resistant bonds as well as processing and manufacturing hurdles. Three issues that arise when manufacturing and processing high temperature polymers include:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">1.

Curing of the polymer proceeds at high temperatures, requiring either the polymer to be pre-cured and then adhered, or the entire part to undergo the heating cycle.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0007" num="0008">2.

Adhesives are typically thermosets or thermoplastics, such as poly ether ketone ketone (PEKK) or poly ether ether ketone (PEEK). However, thermoplastics are inherently more difficult for adhesive bonding applications in comparison to thermosets due to the chemical nature of poly aryl ether ketone matrix, and their associated processing temperatures and in-service temperature limitations when used in structural applications.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0014">Phenolic thermosetting resin products provide some advantages, such as low flammability, low smoke generation, and good thermal and electrical properties. However, phenolic thermosetting resin products involve the use of strong reagents (acids for novolac and bases for resole resins), and they release water during the curing process, generating voids in the deposited layer. Furthermore, brittleness and a limited shelf life restrict the applicability of phenolic-based materials.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0015">Thermosetting polybenzoxazines have the potential to compete with phenolic resins. The advantages of polybenzoxazines are their mechanical strength, good thermal properties, low water absorption, high glass transition temperatures, and high char yields. Additionally, they polymerize without the need for initiators, do not release byproducts, and display near-zero shrinkage. However, conventional polybenzoxazines do not possess enough temperature stability for use as adhesives under very high temperature conditions (&#x3e;550&#xb0; F.), which is increasingly necessary for adhesives used in aerospace applications.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0016">There is a continuing need for improved adhesives with improved stability at high temperatures, as compared to conventional adhesives.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0017">In an aspect, a compound represented by Formula (I):</p><p id="p-0014" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="43.18mm" wi="117.60mm" file="US20230002557A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0015" num="0000">wherein:<br/>each instance of R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>5</sup>, and R<sup>6 </sup>is independently hydrogen, unsubstituted C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alkyl, substituted C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alkyl, unsubstituted C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alkoxy, or substituted C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alkoxy;<br/>each instance of R<sup>3 </sup>and R<sup>4 </sup>is independently hydrogen, unsubstituted C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alkyl, substituted C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alkyl, or fluorine, wherein at least one instance of R<sup>3 </sup>or R<sup>4 </sup>is fluorine;<br/>each instance of R<sup>7</sup>, R<sup>8</sup>, R<sup>7&#x2032;</sup>, R<sup>8&#x2032;</sup>, R<sup>7&#x2033;</sup>, R<sup>8&#x2033;</sup>, R<sup>7&#x2032;&#x2033;</sup>, and R<sup>8&#x2032;&#x2033;</sup> is independently hydrogen, unsubstituted C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alkyl, or substituted C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alkyl;<br/>each instance of R<sup>9</sup>, R<sup>10</sup>, R<sup>11</sup>, R<sup>9&#x2032;</sup>, R<sup>10&#x2032;</sup>, and R<sup>11&#x2032;</sup> is independently hydrogen, unsubstituted C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alkyl, or substituted C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alkyl;<br/>R<sup>16 </sup>is hydrogen or hydroxyl;<br/>each instance of Q<sup>1 </sup>and Q<sup>2 </sup>is independently oxygen or sulfur;<br/>Q<sup>3 </sup>and Q<sup>3&#x2032;

The polyimides can be synthesized by a two-step procedure: first by forming poly(amic acid) (PAA) precursors, followed by thermal or chemical imidization. A diamine (and/or triamine) monomer is added to a round-bottomed flask and dissolved in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc). Then a dianhydride (and/or monoanhydride) is added to the multifunctional amine solution in one portion until reaching a solid content of approximately 10 wt %. Note&#x2014;the amine monomer(s) may be fluorinated, and/or the anhydride monomer(s) may be fluorinated, and/or both the amine and anhydride monomer(s) may be fluorinated. Also, the ratio of mono:di:tri functional monomers will influence the reaction time/conditions and final imidization. Functionality&#x3e;2 can result in a crosslinked final product. Functionality of 1 can act as an endcapping agent to modify/control molecular weight of the product. The mixture can be stirred at, for example, room temperature for about 3 h to yield a viscous fluorinated PAA solution. The fluorinated PAA solution may be stored for future imidization. Once the fluorinated PAA is ready for use it can be manipulated onto the substrate of interest and converted to a fluorinated polyimide by successive heating at elevated temperatures (150&#xb0; C., 250&#xb0; C., 300&#xb0; C.) under vacuum. Alternatively, acetic anhydride and pyridine can be added to the fluorinated PAA solution, and the fluorinated PAA solution is manipulated onto the substrate of interest, and finally heated to a modest temperature (100&#xb0; C.) to complete imidization.

Pressure regulated nitrogen or dry air is injected through line <b>405</b> to pressurize the pot and force material into the pickup tube and line. The pressure pot has pressure relief valves to prevent over pressurization and to bleed pressure from the pot for removing or adding the material. A regulator is located near the gun <b>406</b> to control the fluid pressure being delivered. Controlling the fluid pressure at the gun controls the volumetric flow rate through the gun's spray nozzle. Installing the regulator near the gun eliminates any pressure drop influence from hose length, hose diameter, or robot arm height. Nozzle control is also desired to control flow rates. Slight manufacturing variances in the nozzle orifice can result in different liquid flow rates. Nozzle control and fluid pressure regulation at the gun work in conjunction to give consistent and repeatable volumetric flow rates through the nozzle.

Heating the surface while depositing the composition onto the surface can provide additional uniform composition layers to achieve an overall thicker coating (e.g., 20 mil to 60 mil) with reduced or eliminated voids caused by trapped solvent because some or all of the solvent has been removed.
