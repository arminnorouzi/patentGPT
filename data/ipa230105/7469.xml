In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. However, the various embodiments can be practiced without these specific details (and without applying to any particular networked environment or standard).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Described herein are systems, methods, articles of manufacture, and other embodiments or implementations that can facilitate securely conveying location and other information in advanced networks. In one embodiment, described herein is a system that can comprise a processor and a memory that stores executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, facilitate performance of operations. The operations can comprise transforming, at a chipset level of the device, information indicative of a location of the device into a binary representation of the information indicative of the location of the device. The operations can also comprise embedding the binary representation of the information indicative of the location of the device into a message. Further, the operations can comprise facilitating a transmission of the message and the binary representation of the information indicative of the location of the device to a network device of a communications network.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an implementation, the operations can comprise selecting the message from a group of messages based on an occurrence frequency of the transmission of the message being determined to satisfy a defined occurrence frequency level. Further to this implementation, embedding the binary representation can comprise embedding the binary representation in least significant bits of the message. In an additional, or alternative, implementation, the defined occurrence frequency level can be selected to retain a defined radio link performance level of a radio link of the communications network.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to some implementations, the operations can comprise receiving the information indicative of the location of the device from a radio beacon within a vicinity of the device during a defined time period. Further to these implementations, the information indicative of the location of the device comprises proxy information that is related to the location of the device, and that is indirectly converted into location information. In an example, the radio beacon can be received from a Wi-Fi enabled device via a Wi-Fi communications link of the communications network. In another example, the radio beacon can be received from a Bluetooth enabled device via a Bluetooth communications link of the communications network. According to another example, the radio beacon can be received from a near field communication enabled device via a near field communications link of the communications network.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with some implementations, the operations can comprise prior to the facilitating the transmission of the message, facilitating a conveyance of a preamble that indicates a start of the binary representation of the information indicative of the location of the device. According to some implementations, embedding the binary representation can comprise using steganography to embed the binary representation in the message.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another embodiment relates to a method that can comprise receiving, by a device of a communications network, information indicative of a location of the device from a radio beacon within a vicinity of the device during a defined time period. The device can comprise a processor. The method can also comprise embedding, by the device, a preamble and a binary representation of the information indicative of the location into a message directed to a network device of the communications network. The preamble can provide an indication of a start of the binary representation of the information indicative of the location of the device. Further, the method can comprise communicating, by the device, the message that comprises the preamble and the binary representation to the network device.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an example, embedding the binary representation can comprise embedding the binary representation in a group of least significant bits of the message. In another example, the preamble can comprise a synchronization signal of bits. In a further example, the information indicative of the location of the device can be proxy information that is related to the location of the device, and the proxy information does not comprise global positioning system information.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Yet another embodiment relates to a method that can comprise receiving, by a network device of a communications network, a transmission from a mobile device. The transmission can comprise a first message embedded in a second message. The first message can comprise information indicative of a location of the mobile device. The network device can comprise a processor. Further, the method can comprise separating, by the network device, a first group of bits in the first message from a second group of bits in the first message. In addition, the method can comprise determining, by the network device, the location of the mobile device based on a determination that the second group of bits in the first message comprise a synchronization signal.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to an implementation, the first group of bits in the first message can be least significant bits of the first message. Further, the method can comprise determining, by the network device, that the least significant bits of the first message constitute a preamble that indicates the information indicative of the location of the mobile device is included in the second group of bits of the first message.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some implementations, determining the location of the mobile device can comprise translating the information indicative of the location of the mobile device to a geographic location of the mobile device. In another example, the first message and the second message can be received signal code power messages.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The various aspects discussed herein can allow a communication device (e.g., a mobile device, a user equipment (UE) and the like) to convey location or other information from radio chipset vendors in a secure way to network operators without the need for any standards, handset vendor, and/or new message changes.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The various aspects also provide multiple levels of security, which only allows viewing of such information based on permissions (e.g., decoding keys) from the chipset provider, handset owner, and what accuracy level and frequency is permitted. While the disclosed aspects describe conveying &#x201c;location information,&#x201d; it is equally applicable to any information that is known and desired to be transmitted from the radio chipset on the device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Collecting knowledge of accurate location of devices can be important for several reasons. For example, accurate location information helps in network planning, network optimization, can be useful for user knowledge of their location, can be useful to location based advertising, and so on. Knowing precise device location is particularly important in network planning and optimization as wireless networks become mature, since capacity can only be added by using small cells, nano cells, or pico cells, each having a very small coverage radius of 10-50 meters. If the small cells are not placed where the traffic actually is coming from, the small cells will not serve as many calls/data sessions as might be needed, and the capacity problem would, therefore, not be solved.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although precise location can be important, it cannot be collected due to several challenges. For example, accurate location using methods such as &#x201c;Global Positioning System (GPS) are not available since the handset could be &#x201c;indoors.&#x201d; Further, the handset vendor might not allow the phone to &#x201c;report GPS location&#x201d; via a layer 3 message, unless the message is related to a 911 call. In another example, the phone may &#x201c;know critical information related to location, which can be turned into location when combined with data in the cloud&#x201d; but it has no way to send this information to the network via existing layer 2 messages. The disclosed aspects solve these and related issues.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, illustrated is an example, non-limiting, system <b>100</b> for securely conveying location and other information in advanced networks in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein. Aspects of systems (e.g., the system <b>100</b> and the like), apparatuses, or processes explained in this disclosure can constitute machine-executable component(s) embodied within machine(s), e.g., embodied in one or more computer readable mediums (or media) associated with one or more machines. Such component(s), when executed by the one or more machines, e.g., computer(s), computing device(s), virtual machine(s), etc. can cause the machine(s) to perform the operations described.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In various embodiments, the system <b>100</b> can be any type of component, machine, device, facility, apparatus, and/or instrument that comprises a processor and/or can be capable of effective and/or operative communication with a wired and/or wireless network. Components, machines, apparatuses, devices, facilities, and/or instrumentalities that can comprise the system <b>100</b> can include tablet computing devices, handheld devices, server class computing machines and/or databases, laptop computers, notebook computers, desktop computers, cell phones, smart phones, consumer appliances and/or instrumentation, industrial and/or commercial devices, hand-held devices, digital assistants, multimedia Internet enabled phones, multimedia players, and the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the system <b>100</b> can include a communication device <b>102</b> and a network device <b>104</b>. The network device <b>104</b> can be included in a group of network devices of a wireless network. Although only a single communication device and a single network device are shown and described, the various aspects are not limited to this implementation. Instead, multiple communication devices and/or multiple network devices can be included in a communications system.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The communication device <b>102</b> can include a transition component <b>106</b>, an insertion component <b>108</b>, a transmitter/receiver <b>110</b>, at least one memory <b>112</b>, at least one processor <b>114</b>, and at least one data store <b>116</b>. The network device <b>104</b> can include a communication component <b>118</b>, a parse component <b>120</b>, a determination component <b>122</b>, at least one memory <b>124</b>, at least one processor <b>126</b>, and at least one data store <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The transmitter/receiver <b>110</b> can obtain information about a location of the device, which can be direct information and/or indirect information. Direct location information can be, for example, GPS information from a GPS chipset on the handset. Examples of indirect information can include, a Wi-Fi access point ID, a MAC address. To utilize the indirect information, at the network carrier (e.g., the network device <b>104</b>), the indirect information can be associated (e.g., in a data structure contained in the at least one data store <b>128</b>). For example, if there is a record (e.g., data structure, data store, and so on) of where wireless access points are located and the communication device conveys that information to the network device <b>104</b> (as will be discussed in further detail below), the location of the communication device <b>102</b> can be determined. In an example of the indirect location information, the communication device <b>102</b> might only know that it can see a device (e.g., can receive a signal from the device), which can be any communication-enable device within the vicinity of the communication device <b>102</b>. Therefore, the communication device <b>102</b> can simply indicate that it can detect a beacon from one or more communication-enable devices. Since the network device <b>104</b> has a data structure that maps the communication-enable device to its location, a determination can be made as to the location of the communication device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The transition component <b>106</b> can be configured to transform information indicative of a location of the communication device <b>102</b> into a binary representation of the information indicative of the location of the communication device <b>102</b>. According to some implementations, the transformation by the transition component <b>106</b> can be performed at a chipset level <b>130</b> of the communication device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The insertion component <b>108</b> can be configured to embed binary representation of the information indicative of the location of the device into a message. Further, the transmitter/receiver <b>110</b> can be configured to facilitate a transmission of the message and the binary representation of the information indicative of the location of the device to the network device <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, the disclosed aspects can allow a radio chipset (e.g., the chipset level <b>130</b>), that has knowledge of location and/or derived location information, to send the information to the network (e.g., the network device <b>104</b>). According to some implementations, the insertion component <b>108</b> can apply a concept of steganography to embed the binary representation of the information indicative of the location of the device into a message. The application of steganography can facilitate concealing a message within another message. An example of the use of steganography is to embed a message within an image. For instance, this can easily be performed by encoding the message in every defined number pixel (e.g., every one hundredth pixel) of an image by making the least significant bit(s) equal to the digits of a letters of the message. As applied to the radio chipset example, a similar approach can be performed by embedding the location information into the least significant bit(s) of existing radio measurements that the chipset sends to the network, which can also be captured in log files on the network.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In order to describe the various aspects, a simplified version, not including the security aspects, will be described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which illustrates a flow chart of an example, non-limiting, method <b>200</b> for chipset encoding of information in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein. Repetitive description of like elements employed in other embodiments described herein is omitted for sake of brevity.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">At <b>202</b>, the radio chipset (e.g., the chipset level <b>130</b>) on the mobile device (e.g., the communication device <b>102</b>) can collect information to be transmitted. In some implementations, the radio chipset can have knowledge of location related information. For example, the location related information can be information that is related to location but cannot be directly turned into location at the device level without further processing. Such processing can occur in a cloud computing environment, for example. In some cases, the location information can be collected from an associated GPS measurement on the device. According to some cases, the location information can be collected using more sophisticated range finding approaches (e.g., possibly with multipath mitigation).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, at <b>202</b>, the radio chipset (e.g., the transition component <b>106</b>) can translate the information to be embedded into a binary representation. For example, assuming the information is related to location information (e.g. Location_info1=100101011001010010, Location_info2=1000100xxx . . . 1). It is noted that this location information can represent relative timing offsets as seen from a given cell site.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Using the concept of steganography, at <b>204</b>, a message can be chosen into which the location information can be embedded. The chosen message can be a message that is transmitted more than a defined threshold level. For example, the message could be a message that is transmitted often (periodically) in a manner such that the integrity of the message will not cause any significant impairment to the radio link performance if the location information is embedded in the least significant bits of the message.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, in LTE the RSRP (signal strength measurement) could be used as the host for the location information. The RSRP can span from &#x2212;44 dBm to &#x2212;140 dBm and can be represented by one of 100 values (e.g., having 1 dB resolution), and can be sent periodically. Since modifying the least significant bit only results in a 1 dB change up or down on any given RSRP reported measurement, there will not be a significant radio channel performance impact.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Nevertheless, since the location information data is a certain length of bits (e.g., 25 &#x201c;bits&#x201d; in length), it will take 25 Received Signal Code Power (RSCP) measurements to transmit each one entirely. This could be performed by embedding in sequential RSCP measurements according to some implementations. Alternatively, or additionally, since these measurements often come from multiple cell sites, they could be embedded across the different measurements in a given report (e.g. if there are 25 RSCP measurements in a given report, the entire latitude could be embedded in those measurements).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Since the embedded information may not need to be sent all the time, according to some implementations, sending a synchronization signal of bits could be sent, such that the start of the embedded information can be detected (for example before <b>206</b>).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is noted that although discussed with respect to RSCP, the disclosed aspects can be related to control plane messages. In order to control the UE (e.g., the communication device <b>102</b>) at a radio level (e.g., start call, stop call, hands off, power up, power down, and so on), these can be pursuant to controlling radio of the phone as opposed to applications on the phone. Control plane messages are fundamental to controlling the UE as a device (e.g., as a communication device), as opposed to higher level functions. Thus, the disclosed aspects relate to transmitting information from the communication device <b>102</b> to the network device <b>104</b> using this lowest layer of operation of the UE and encoding information in the least significant digits in the control plane messages. The communication device <b>102</b> (e.g., via the transmitter/receiver <b>110</b>) can send location, a proxy for location (e.g., proxy data received from an Internet of Things (IOT) device and/or other communication-enabled devices), and/or any other information appropriate for the communication device <b>102</b> to send at this lowest level, wherein such data or information otherwise might be blocked at a higher level. For example, a device manufacturer or other entity might not allow the communication device <b>102</b> to send accurate GPS information. Accordingly, the information can be blocked at a high level. However, with the disclosed aspects, the information is not blocked at the chipset level, and, thus, the chipset on the communication device <b>102</b> can convey the information to the network device <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a flow chart of an example, non-limiting, method <b>300</b> for decoding of information at a network device in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein. Repetitive description of like elements employed in other embodiments described herein is omitted for sake of brevity.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">At <b>302</b>, the network device (e.g., the network device <b>104</b>) can separate out the least significant bits of the RSCP messages (or other messages). Upon or after separating the least significant bits, a determination can be made whether there is a synchronization signal present. According to some implementations, the determination can be made based on match.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">If a synchronization signal is present (e.g., detected), at <b>304</b>, it can be assumed that the location information is included in the next subsequent bits, which can be a defined number of bits. For example, it can be assumed that the location information (Loc_info) is in the subsequent eighteen bits (Loc_info1=1001010110010100100). At <b>306</b>, the location information can be translated into appropriate location information for the mobile device.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Additionally, provided security of the data can be an issue, therefore, the information to be sent could be &#x201c;encrypted beforehand&#x201d; and then sent. The encryption could be a multi-fold encryption requiring a key from the user, handset and operator to decode. In the flow diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, this amounts to encrypting the non-synchronization data field which is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a non-limiting example of Received Signal Code Power coding <b>400</b> in Long Term Evolution in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein. It is noted that the values reported can also be represented in binary format, as shown. In an example, the binary value of 87 is 01010111.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The disclosed aspects solve various challenges in collecting information from chipsets. For example, a challenge can be that accurate location using methods such as &#x201c;GPS&#x201d; are not available since the handset is &#x201c;indoors.&#x201d; To address this challenge, the disclosed aspects can use other location related data. The related data can include relative timing offset data collected from the mobile of the cell sites. This data can be sent to the network which is combined into the cloud with other data to estimate the mobile location.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Another challenge can be that the handset vendor will not allow the phone to &#x201c;report GPS location&#x201d; via a layer <b>3</b> message unless its related to a 911 call. To address this challenge, the disclosed aspects can send location related data via the layer 2 embedded message instead.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, another challenge can be that the phone may &#x201c;know critical information related to location, which can be turned into location when combined with data in the cloud&#x201d; but it has no way to send this information to the network via existing layer 2 messages. Therefore, to address this challenge the disclosed aspects can send location related data via layer 2 embedded message instead.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The one or more embodiments can provide a mechanism to arbitrarily send information, that the chipset knows, to the network by embedding such information in existing message data, in a minimal performance impacting way using steganography so that it can be extracted on the network side. An application of important information described herein is the ability to send &#x201c;location related information&#x201d; that the chipset may be able to measure, such as the &#x201c;ranging information&#x201d; (timing offsets of cell sites) as measured, which can be converted to location if sent to the network. While there are many messages this could be embedded into, an example of embedding such information into the least significant bits of the RSCP values in LTE was provided as an example.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Finding accurate locations of mobile traffic can be important in network applications where one wants to place the cell sites as close as possible to the traffic, since a cell site placed twice the distance away will require four times the amount of power to serve the same traffic (this equates to needing four times the number of cell sites to serve the same level traffic). Thus, having errors into where an estimation of the real traffic to be could result in hundreds of millions of dollars of cost for additional cell sites for a large-scale operator deploying tens of thousands of cell sites (e.g. small cells).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The applicability of the disclosed aspects can be effective worldwide, since wireless mobile devices are everywhere in the world. The various aspects provide benefits that can be significant and timely given that it can be important to collect accurate location data for cell site location placement of the ever-growing small cell deployments around the world. Accurate location of a devices is also very important for advertising and other location based services and could be used with the right privacy and legal permissions.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the transmitter/receiver <b>110</b> (and/or the communication component <b>118</b>) can be configured to transmit to, and/or receive data from, the network device <b>104</b> (or the communication device <b>102</b>), other network devices, and/or other communication devices.

Inference can be employed to identify a specific context or information, or can generate a probability distribution over states, for example. The inference can be probabilistic. For example, computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and/or conditions. The inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher-level information from a set of conditions and/or data. Such inference can result in the construction of new conditions and/or actions from a set of observed conditions and/or stored conditions data, whether or not the conditions are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the conditions and/or data come from one or several conditions and/or data sources. Various classification procedures and/or systems (e.g., support vector machines, neural networks, logic-centric production systems, Bayesian belief networks, fuzzy logic, data fusion engines, and so on) can be employed in connection with performing automatic and/or inferred action in connection with the disclosed aspects.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The various aspects (e.g., in connection with the selection of a message from a set of messages, embedding information in the message, selecting a preamble, decoding a message, and so forth) can employ various artificial intelligence-based procedures for carrying out various aspects thereof.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector, x=(x1, x2, x3, x4, xn), to a confidence that the input belongs to a class. In other words, f(x)=confidence(class). Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to provide a prognosis and/or infer one or more actions that should be employed to determine what information should be automatically included in a message at a particular moment in time (e.g., at about the same time as a request is received from the network device <b>104</b>, at about the same time as information indicative of a location is received at the communication device <b>102</b>, and so on).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs, which hypersurface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that can be similar, but not necessarily identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches (e.g., na&#xef;ve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models) providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein, can be inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">One or more aspects can employ classifiers that are explicitly trained (e.g., through a generic training data) as well as classifiers that are implicitly trained (e.g., by observing proxy information, by receiving extrinsic information about device location, by converting information of a location into binary data, and so on). For example, SVM's can be configured through a learning or training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module. Thus, a classifier(s) can be used to automatically learn and perform a number of functions, including, but not limited to, determining according to a predetermined criteria which messages to select from a group of messages, when to include information, when to exclude information, and so forth. The criteria can include, but is not limited to, similar requests, historical information, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Additionally, or alternatively, an implementation procedure (e.g., a rule, a policy, and so on) can be applied to control and/or regulate information in order to mitigate an amount of unnecessary overhead, and so forth.
