or &#x201c;rack&#x201d;, comprises a plurality of adjacent housings each capable of receiving a nuclear fuel assembly.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This storage device, intended to be housed in a cavity of a container, is designed to be able to simultaneously fulfil three essential functions, which will be briefly described hereinafter.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This consists firstly of the function of thermal transfer of the heat released by the fuel assemblies. Generally, aluminium or one of the alloys thereof is used, due to the good thermal conduction properties thereof.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The second function relates to neutron absorption, and the concern of maintaining the subcriticality of the storage device when the latter is loaded with fuel assemblies. This is carried out using neutron-absorbing materials, such as boron.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Finally, the third essential function relates to the mechanical strength of the device. It is noted that the overall mechanical strength of the device must be compatible with regulatory safety requirements for the transport/storage of nuclear materials, particularly in respect of so-called &#x201c;free fall&#x201d; tests.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">From the prior art, forming the basket by superimposing stages produced using stacked and interlocked structural assemblies with notches, is known. These assemblies are also produced using the same aluminium-based material, comprising a certain boron density in order to fulfil the neutron absorption functions, and achieve the sought effective multiplication factor &#x201c;Keff&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the embodiment of such structural assemblies with notches with boron proves to be particularly costly, strongly impacting the overall production cost of the storage device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The aim of the invention is therefore that of remedying the drawback mentioned above, in relation to the embodiments of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For this purpose, the invention relates to a storage device for transporting and/or storing nuclear fuel assemblies, the storage device being intended to be housed in the cavity of a container for transporting and/or storing nuclear fuel assemblies, and including a number N of adjacent housings, each intended to receive a nuclear fuel assembly, and at least some of the N adjacent housings being produced using flat bars with notches, interlocked and stacked in a stacking direction parallel with a central longitudinal axis of the storage device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the invention, in at least one transverse plane of the storage device passing through the N adjacent housings, at least one of these adjacent housings, and preferably each of a plurality of housings from these N adjacent housings, has an inner housing delimiting surface formed in part by:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0012">a first surface of a first flat bar with notches produced with boron, and of which a second surface opposite the first surface contributes to the formation of the inner housing delimiting surface of at least one or more others of the N adjacent housings; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0013">a first surface of a second flat bar with notches produced without boron, and of which a second surface opposite the first surface contributes to the formation of the inner housing delimiting surface of at least one or more others of the N adjacent housings.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">The originality of the invention thus lies in the heterogeneity of the flat bars forming a single housing intended to receive a nuclear fuel assembly, in particular by providing at least a second flat bar with notches produced without boron. This principle results from an unexpected observation. Indeed, the manufacturing cost proves to be greatly reduced when the housing is produced with non-borated flat bars and with other flat bars having a certain boron content, compared to a conventional solution resulting in the same effective multiplication factor, and where all the flat bars contain boron in a content less than said certain boron content cited above. In other words, the invention provides for associating non-borated flat bars and borated flat bars with a boron content greater than the homogeneous content provided in a solution with equivalent performances of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0015">This principle advantageously helps reduce the production costs of the storage devices, while having high performances in terms of criticality.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0016">The invention also provides at least any one of the following optional features, taken in isolation or in combination.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0017">Preferably, each of a plurality of transverse planes of the storage device passing through each of the N adjacent housings, at least one of these adjacent housings, and preferably each of a plurality of housings from these N adjacent housings, has an inner housing delimiting surface formed in part by:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0018">a first surface of a first flat bar with notches produced with boron, and of which a second surface opposite the first surface contributes to the formation of the inner housing delimiting surface of at least one or more others of the N adjacent housings;

In the transverse direction, each separating partition <b>9</b>, <b>11</b> also extends locally along the entire width of the basket <b>1</b>, and the same applies for each flat bar <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>forming these partitions. The first and second flat bars <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>are thus stacked along a stacking direction <b>20</b> corresponding to the direction of the height of the basket <b>1</b>, parallel with the axis <b>3</b>. Preferably, all the first flat bars <b>14</b><i>a </i>are made of a single material, in the same way as all the second flat bars <b>14</b><i>b </i>are made of a single material different from that of the first flat bars.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0066">In the case of the first flat bars <b>14</b><i>a</i>, they comprise boron. They are preferably made of one piece, from an aluminium alloy including boron. Boron can then be distributed homogeneously in the flat bar <b>14</b><i>a</i>, or heterogeneously. The boron content in the alloy is adapted according to several criteria such as the sought effective multiplication factor &#x201c;Keff&#x201d;, the ratio between the number of first flat bars <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the number of second flat bars <b>14</b><i>b</i>, the position of the first flat bars <b>14</b><i>a </i>inside the basket, etc. By way of indicative example, the mass boron content can attain 16% or more in the alloy, but this value can also be reduced to merely a few percent.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0067">Alternatively, instead of being one-piece, each first flat bar <b>14</b><i>a </i>could be a one-piece flat bar provided with a surface coating comprising boron. In this scenario, the one-piece flat bar could be made of aluminium alloy, and the coating could be deposited according to any known techniques, such as for example hot or cold sputtering of boron carbide particles.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0068">Preferably, the boron content is identical or substantially identical for all the first flat bars <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the basket <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0069">In the case of the second flat bars <b>14</b><i>a</i>, they are devoid of boron. They are also devoid of any other neutron-absorbing element, i.e. free from neutron-absorbing elements. The term &#x201c;neutron-absorbing elements&#x201d; denotes elements which have an effective cross-section greater than 100 barns for thermal neutrons. By way of indicative examples, this consists of aluminium alloy devoid of boron, gadolinium, hafnium, cadmium, indium, etc.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0070">For the second flat bars <b>14</b><i>b</i>, they are preferably made of an aluminium alloy, but therefore devoid of boron.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0071">In this regard, it is noted that &#x201c;flat bar&#x201d; denotes an element of planar general shape, the thickness of which between the opposite surfaces thereof is of a dimension less than each of the dimensions in the two other directions orthogonal to the thickness direction, and orthogonal to each other. Furthermore, for each flat bar, it may consist of a single flat element, or of an overlay of several flat elements, in the direction of the thickness. According to another alternative, it can consist of a tubular element containing a flat bar of complementary cross-section. Each flat bar is preferably solid or substantially solid, apart from the hollowed zones forming the notches.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0072">One of the specificities of the invention lies in making a judicious choice between the first and the second flat bars <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>to produce each of the partitions <b>9</b>, <b>11</b> of the basket <b>1</b>. As a general rule, the density of partitions produced from the first flat bars <b>14</b><i>a </i>comprising boron is higher at the centre of the basket, than at the periphery thereof. Also, some inner <b>4</b> and peripheral <b>4</b>&#x2032; housings are produced by combining first flat bars <b>14</b><i>a </i>comprising boron, and second flat bars <b>14</b><i>b </i>devoid of boron.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0073">More specifically, in at least one transverse plane of the basket <b>1</b> such as the cutting plane P in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and preferably in all these transverse planes or substantially all these transverse planes of the basket <b>1</b>, the inner housing delimiting surface <b>10</b> of at least one of the N<b>2</b> inner housings <b>4</b> is formed in part by a first flat bar <b>14</b><i>a</i>, and a second flat bar <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0057" num="0074">To explain the design more specifically, reference will be made to the housing <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, wherein the fuel assembly <b>2</b> has been represented. For this housing <b>4</b>, in the transverse plane of the basket, the inner housing delimiting surface <b>10</b> thereof is formed by four sides <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>10</b><i>c</i>, <b>10</b><i>d </i>respectively formed by a second flat bar <b>14</b><i>b </i>and three flat bars <b>14</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0058" num="0075">More specifically, again in the transverse plane, the first side <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the inner housing delimiting surface <b>10</b> is produced by a first surface <b>14</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; of the second flat bar <b>14</b><i>b</i>. It should be noted that the second surface <b>14</b><i>b</i>&#x2033; of said second flat bar <b>14</b><i>b</i>, opposite the first surface <b>14</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;, also contributes to the formation of the inner housing delimiting surface <b>10</b> of one or more other adjacent housings <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; of the basket. Similarly, the second, third and fourth sides <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>10</b><i>c</i>, <b>10</b><i>d </i>of the inner housing delimiting surface <b>10</b> are respectively produced by a first surface <b>14</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; of three first flat bars <b>14</b><i>a</i>. The second surface <b>14</b><i>a</i>&#x2033; of each of these first flat bars <b>14</b><i>a</i>, opposite the first surface <b>14</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;, also contributes to the formation of the inner housing delimiting surface <b>10</b> of one or more other adjacent housings <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; of the basket.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0076">Thus, even if some housings <b>4</b> arranged near or on the centre of the basket <b>1</b> can be produced solely from first flat bars <b>14</b><i>a</i>, those located more towards the periphery can result from a combination between one or more partitions produced from first flat bars <b>14</b><i>a</i>, and one or more partitions produced from second flat bars <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0060" num="0077">In the example of the loaded housing <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, it consists therefore of a single separating partition <b>9</b> produced from second flat bars <b>14</b><i>b </i>devoid of boron, and of three separating partitions <b>9</b>, <b>11</b> produced from first flat bars <b>14</b><i>a </i>comprising boron. Alternatively, for these inner housings <b>4</b> resulting from a combination between partitions of different types, it could consist of two separating partitions <b>9</b>, <b>11</b> produced from second flat bars <b>14</b><i>b </i>devoid of boron, and of two separating partitions <b>9</b>, <b>11</b> produced from first flat bars <b>14</b><i>a </i>comprising boron. In the latter case, the partitions of the same types could be directly consecutive and orthogonal in pairs, or parallel in pairs.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0078">As seen above, in a transverse cross-section such as those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the inner delimiting surface <b>10</b> of several housings <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; takes the form of four line segments <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>d</i>, corresponding respectively to the relevant surfaces <b>14</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;, <b>14</b><i>a</i>&#x2033;, <b>14</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;, <b>14</b><i>b</i>&#x2033; of the flat bars <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0062" num="0079">Preferably, combining separating partitions <b>9</b>, <b>11</b> of different types relates to at least 50% of the N housings <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; of the basket, and at least 50% of the peripheral housings <b>4</b>&#x2032;. It is moreover noted that some of these housings <b>4</b>&#x2032; are also closed by peripheral partitions <b>13</b>, for example made of aluminium alloy.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0080">Thanks to this combination of separating partitions <b>9</b>, <b>11</b>, some of which contain boron and others not, the manufacturing costs are reduced while obtaining high performances in terms of maintaining subcriticality.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0081">According to a second embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and still complying with the general principle of the invention, the separating partitions are not all necessarily produced with the same type of flat bars <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>.
