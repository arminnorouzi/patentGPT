Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources. Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, and time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">These multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different wireless devices to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. An example telecommunication standard is 5G New Radio (NR). 5G NR is part of a continuous mobile broadband evolution promulgated by Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to meet new requirements associated with latency, reliability, security, scalability (e.g., with Internet of Things (IoT)), and other requirements. 5G NR includes services associated with enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications (mMTC), and ultra reliable low latency communications (URLLC). Some aspects of 5G NR may be based on the 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard. There exists a need for further improvements in 5G NR technology. These improvements may also be applicable to other multi-access technologies and the telecommunication standards that employ these technologies.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some wireless communication networks include vehicle-based communication devices that can communicate from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) (e.g., from the vehicle-based communication device to road infrastructure nodes), vehicle-to-network (V2N) (e.g., from the vehicle-based communication device to one or more network nodes, such as a base station), a combination thereof and/or with other devices, which can be collectively referred to as vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communications. In such systems, the synchronization mechanism (e.g., timing and/or frequency synchronization) for a user equipment (UE) may be based on a connection to a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) or a cellular base station. Alternatively, in absence of a connection with a GNSS or base station, the synchronization for a UE may require sidelink synchronization with another UE that is already synchronized to a GNSS or base station.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects.

The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of various concepts. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring such concepts. Although the following description may be focused on 5G NR, the concepts described herein may be applicable to other similar areas, such as LTE, LTE-A, CDMA, GSM, and other wireless technologies.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present aspects generally relate to efficiently communicating sidelink synchronization signal blocks (S-SSBs) including sidelink primary synchronization signal (S-PSSS) symbols and sidelink secondary synchronization signal (S-SSS) symbols.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">An S-SSB for communication over a sidelink channel in fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) vehicle-to-anything (V2X) may include S-PSS and S-SSS symbols with different peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), leading to different maximum power reduction (MPR) values associated with and used for transmission/reception of such symbols. This may result in a transient period where a transmission power changes and a transmitting and/or receiving user equipment (UE) needs to perform automatic gain control (AGC) to adapt, thereby adversely affecting spectral efficiency and performance.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">However, some present aspects provide S-SSBs that minimize the impact of the transient period, while some other aspects remove or at least substantially reduce/mitigate the need for a transient period without compromising performance.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Generally, D2D communication may include vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications (e.g., from a vehicle-based communication device to road infrastructure nodes), vehicle-to-network (V2N) communications (e.g., from a vehicle-based communication device to a network node such as a base station), a combination thereof, and/or with other devices, which may be collectively referred to as V2X communications. Generally, support for synchronization using SSBs within synchronization signal bursts is provided in 5G NR communication technologies over the Uu interface (e.g., from a gNodeB (gNB) to a user equipment (UE)), for example, as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref>. Similar synchronization as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref> may also be implemented in V2X communication over a sidelink channel. For example, in V2X or other D2D communications, a UE that has received a synchronization signal from a gNB or global navigation satellite system (GNSS) may transmit a sidelink synchronization signal that is consistent with the gNB or GNSS timing and/or frequency, so that other UEs that are out of range of the gNB and/or GNSS may also be able to synchronize to such timing and/or frequency. Further, a UE that has received no synchronization signal from a gNB or GNSS may also transmit a sidelink synchronization signal to synchronize with other UEs and send data to other UEs.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Several aspects of telecommunication systems will now be presented with reference to various apparatus and methods. These apparatus and methods will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks, components, circuits, processes, algorithms, etc. (collectively referred to as &#x201c;elements&#x201d;). These elements may be implemented using electronic hardware, computer software, or any combination thereof. Whether such elements are implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">By way of example, an element, or any portion of an element, or any combination of elements may be implemented as a &#x201c;processing system&#x201d; that includes one or more processors. Examples of processors include microprocessors, microcontrollers, graphics processing units (GPUs), central processing units (CPUs), application processors, digital signal processors (DSPs), reduced instruction set computing (RISC) processors, systems on a chip (SoC), baseband processors, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), state machines, gated logic, discrete hardware circuits, and other suitable hardware configured to perform the various functionality described throughout this disclosure. One or more processors in the processing system may execute software. Software may be construed broadly to mean instructions, instruction sets, code, code segments, program code, programs, subprograms, software components, applications, software applications, software packages, routines, subroutines, objects, executables, threads of execution, procedures, functions, etc., whether referred to as software, firmware, middleware, microcode, hardware description language, or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Accordingly, in one or more example aspects, the functions described may be implemented in hardware, software, or any combination thereof.

In the examples provided by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>C</figref>, the 5G/NR frame structure is assumed to be TDD, with subframe 4 being configured with slot format 28 (with mostly DL), where D is DL, U is UL, and X is flexible for use between DL/UL, and subframe 3 being configured with slot format 34 (with mostly UL). While subframes 3, 4 are shown with slot formats 34, 8, respectively, any particular subframe may be configured with any of the various available slot formats 0-61. Slot formats 0, 1 are all DL, UL, respectively. Other slot formats 2-61 include a mix of DL, UL, and flexible symbols.

Note that the description infra applies also to a 5G/NR frame structure that is TDD.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Other wireless communication technologies may have a different frame structure and/or different channels. A frame (10 ms) may be divided into 10 equally sized subframes (1 ms). Each subframe may include one or more time slots. Subframes may also include mini-slots, which may include 7, 4, or 2 symbols. Each slot may include 7 or 14 symbols, depending on the slot configuration. For slot configuration 0, each slot may include 14 symbols, and for slot configuration 1, each slot may include 7 symbols. The symbols on DL may be cyclic prefix (CP) OFDM (CP-OFDM) symbols. The symbols on UL may be CP-OFDM symbols (for high throughput scenarios) or discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) symbols (also referred to as single carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) symbols) (for power limited scenarios; limited to a single stream transmission). The number of slots within a subframe is based on the slot configuration and the numerology. For slot configuration 0, different numerologies &#x3bc;. 0 to 5 allow for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 slots, respectively, per subframe. For slot configuration 1, different numerologies 0 to 2 allow for 2, 4, and 8 slots, respectively, per subframe.

The first S-SSB <b>300</b> further includes transient periods <b>310</b> before and after S-SSS <b>304</b>, due to the S-SSS sequences which are associated with higher MPR for S-SSS <b>304</b> as compared to other components of the first S-SSB <b>300</b>. The MPR value is the amount of power reduction at the output of the power amplifier, and is a function of the PAPR of a symbol/sequence. The transition from one MPR to a different MPR (e.g., from an MPR used for S-PSS <b>302</b> to another MPR used for another component of S-SSB <b>300</b>) requires some transient period <b>310</b> (e.g., 30 microseconds) for the transmitter to adapt to the change in power. More specifically, for example, in an aspect, the S-PSS sequence may be chosen from two sequences that have very good correlation properties and have equal amplitude sequences, while the S-SSS sequences may be chosen from a much larger number of sequences (e.g., 168) such as Gold sequences that have very good cross-correlation properties such that one S-SSS sequence may be distinguished from another.

Due to the high MPR associated with and used for S-SSS <b>304</b>, transient periods <b>310</b> are needed between neighboring S-SSS <b>304</b> and PSBCH <b>312</b>, but at least some of the transient periods <b>310</b> are hidden as much as possible into the gap symbol <b>314</b> (a symbol with no transmission) so as to not affect PSBCH <b>312</b>.

As compared to the third S-SSB <b>500</b>, the fourth S-SSB <b>600</b> provides good performance by configuring only one symbol of PSBCH <b>312</b> between S-PSS <b>302</b> and S-SSS <b>304</b> (less channel variation), but has more transient periods <b>310</b> impacting PSBCH <b>312</b> which may cause performance issues for PSBCH <b>312</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some alternative aspects, NR V2X S-SSB transmissions may be configured to reduce/mitigate transient periods, for example, by selecting the same MPR for the entire S-SSB. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a fifth S-SSB <b>700</b> for NR V2X may implement S-PSS <b>302</b> and S-SSS <b>304</b> with substantially the same MPR values (e.g., within 10%) and may thus eliminate or at least substantially reduce transient periods. More specifically, the fifth S-SSB <b>700</b> may include one symbol of PSBCH <b>312</b>, followed by one symbol of S-SSS <b>304</b>, followed by two symbols of S-PSS <b>302</b>, followed by one symbol of S-SSS <b>304</b>, followed by multiple symbols of PSBCH <b>312</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Alternatively, as another example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a sixth S-SSB <b>800</b> for NR V2X may implement S-PSS <b>302</b> and S-SSS <b>304</b> with substantially the same MPR values and may thus reduce/mitigate transient periods. More specifically, the sixth S-SSB <b>800</b> may include one symbol of PSBCH <b>312</b>, followed by two symbols of S-PSS <b>302</b>, followed by two symbols of S-SSS <b>304</b>, followed by multiple symbols of PSBCH <b>312</b>. In an aspect, as compared to the sixth S-SSB <b>800</b>, the fifth S-SSB <b>700</b> may have better CFO detection performance due to separating the two symbols of S-SSS <b>304</b>. More specifically, very good channel estimation may be achieved by detecting the S-PSS <b>302</b> and then using that to detect the S-SSS <b>304</b> which are next to the S-PSS <b>302</b>. Further, such configuration may result in more accurate determination of the residual CFO.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">On the other hand, in some rare aspects, the rotation between the two separated symbols of S-SSS <b>304</b> in the fifth S-SSB <b>700</b> may be so high (e.g., 2&#x3c0;) that the two separated symbols of S-SSS <b>304</b> look the same, thus not allowing for CFO determination. In this case, the sixth S-SSB <b>800</b> may be advantageous over the fifth S-SSB <b>700</b> for CFO determination.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In both the fifth S-SSB <b>700</b> and the sixth S-SSB <b>800</b>, one symbol of PSBCH <b>312</b> is configured as the first symbol in order to allow for automatic gain control (AGC). Generally, AGC is required for every frame to adapt to the range of the signal. At the beginning of each frame, if the gain state has not changed since the previous frame, then the first symbol of the new frame can be received. However, if the gain state has changed since the previous frame, the gain state needs to be adjusted by performing AGC. As such, the first symbol of a frame may be opportunistically/occasionally punctured or not punctured depending on whether the gain state has changed or not. However, the first symbol in the fifth S-SSB <b>700</b> and the sixth S-SSB <b>800</b> is a PSBCH <b>312</b>, and the coding of the PSBCH <b>312</b> may be selected such that PSBCH <b>312</b> may be decoded accurately even if the first symbol is punctured. For example, in an aspect, the code rate of PSBCH <b>312</b> may be set low to avoid missing data even if the first symbol is punctured. That is, PSBCH <b>312</b> may be configured to afford to have one or more symbols punctured. However, such configuration is not possible for S-PSS <b>302</b> or S-SSS <b>304</b> which are sequences, unlike PSBCH <b>312</b> which carries data.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one non-limiting aspect, for example, an S-SSB for NR V2X may be configured to use the same MPR for the entire S-SSB by re-designing and selecting from a new set of S-SSS sequences that are associated with similar MPR as the S-PSS sequences. For example, in an aspect, instead of Gold sequences, M-sequences may be used for S-SSS.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In another non-limiting aspect, for example, the MPR associated with an S-SSS may vary based on the respective S-SSS identifier (ID), and a subset of S-SSS sequences with very low MPR (comparable to S-PSS) may be used for configuring V2X S-SSBs. For example, in an aspect, S-SSBs for NR V2X may be configured such that the S-SSS IDs with relatively low MPR sequences are used most of the time (e.g., when UEs have coverage by a gNB or GNSS).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">More specifically, there are two possible S-PSS sequences: a first sequence for indicating that a UE is in a coverage area of a gNB, and a second sequence for indicating that a UE is out of coverage with no connection to a gNB. However, many more S-SSS sequences (e.g., 168, 336, or 672 S-SSS sequences) are used to allow for autonomous timing in V2X. In an aspect, for example, a number of UEs with no connection to a gNB or GNSS (e.g., vehicles traveling in an underground tunnel) may still synchronize to an autonomous/independent timing to enable V2X communication among each other. In an aspect, S-SSS IDs 0, 1, 2, 168, 169 are sequences selected for their low MPR properties, while other S-SSS IDs (3&#x2dc;167 and IDs above 169) are regular S-SSS sequences associated with high MPR. As such, in an aspect, special S-SSS IDs including 0, 1, and 2 are used to distinguish gNB timing, GNSS timing, and all timings derived from gNB or GNSS timing, while other S-SSS IDs (e.g., 3&#x2dc;168) are randomly selected by the UEs for synchronization in autonomous timing. As a result, most S-SSB transmissions include a small number of common S-SSS IDs associated with low MPR, while S-SSB transmissions with uncommon S-SSS IDs associated with high MPR are used for UEs with autonomous timing. That is, S-SSS IDs 0, 1, and 2 that are used more often are assigned to S-SSS sequences associated with lower MPR (e.g., use MPR similar to S-PSS sequences), while other S-SSS sequences associated with higher MPR are assigned to other S-SSS IDs (e.g., 3&#x2dc;167 and 169+). In an aspect, the MPR for an entire V2X S-SSB is selected based on the S-SSS ID in the S-SSB. Specifically, a low MPR is selected for the entire S-SSB when S-SSS IDs are associated with low MPR (e.g., for S-SSS IDs 0, 1, 2, 168, 169) and a high MPR is selected for the entire S-SSB when S-SSS IDs are associated with high MPR. Therefore, since there is no change in MPR during the entire S-SSB transmission, there are no transient periods in the S-SSB.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In an aspect, in autonomous driving, using a high MPR for the entire S-SSB (including S-SSS and PSBCH symbols) may reduce coverage. However, coverage impact in autonomous timing (i.e., not associated with either the gNB/eNB or GNSS timing) is not a significant design criterion as compared to removing the transient periods.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one non-limiting alternative and/or additional aspect, for example, an extra S-PSS symbol may be added between the S-PSS and S-SSS symbols to compensate for S-PSS power reduction. For example, referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> where the S-SSB <b>800</b> includes two symbols of S-PSS <b>302</b> and two symbols of S-SSS <b>304</b>, the high MPR associated with the S-SSS <b>302</b> may be used for the entire S-SSB <b>800</b>, causing power reduction on the S-PSS <b>302</b> and loss of coverage. However, adding a third symbol of S-PSS <b>302</b> before the two symbols of S-SSS <b>304</b> may provide a signal to noise ratio (SNR) gain to make up for such power reduction and loss of coverage. For example, the S-PSS detection probability may be boosted by 3 dB due to the extra S-PSS symbol, and loss of coverage due to MPR reduction is compensated by the additional S-PSS symbol.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In a further non-limiting alternative and/or additional aspect, when the same MPR is used for S-PSS, S-SSS, and PSBCH, additional symbols of PSBCH may be used to ensure no coverage impact to PSBCH. Alternatively and/or additionally, PSBCH code rate may be adjusted to improve/maintain coverage when the same MPR is used for PSBCH and S-SSS.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Accordingly, since the same MPR is used for the entire S-SSB, transient periods are reduced/mitigated in S-SSB, while coverage for S-SSB is not compromised.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In a further non-limiting alternative and/or additional aspect, for example, instead of or in addition to including additional S-PSS, other symbols may be added, e.g., demodulation reference signal (DMRS) sequence of PSBCH, or PSBCH symbols. For example, referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a DMRS or PSBCH symbol may be placed before and/or after S-SSS where a transient period is expected, so that the additional symbol is punctured if needed.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>11</b></figref> illustrate flow charts of example methods <b>900</b>, <b>1000</b>, <b>1100</b> for transmitting an S-SSB for wireless communications.

Layer 3 includes a radio resource control (RRC) layer, and layer 2 includes a service data adaptation protocol (SDAP) layer, a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer, and a medium access control (MAC) layer. The controller/processor <b>1375</b> provides RRC layer functionality associated with broadcasting of system information (e.g., MIB, SIBs), RRC connection control (e.g., RRC connection paging, RRC connection establishment, RRC connection modification, and RRC connection release), inter radio access technology (RAT) mobility, and measurement configuration for UE measurement reporting; PDCP layer functionality associated with header compression/decompression, security (ciphering, deciphering, integrity protection, integrity verification), and handover support functions; RLC layer functionality associated with the transfer of upper layer packet data units (PDUs), error correction through ARQ, concatenation, segmentation, and reassembly of RLC service data units (SDUs), re-segmentation of RLC data PDUs, and reordering of RLC data PDUs; and MAC layer functionality associated with mapping between logical channels and transport channels, multiplexing of MAC SDUs onto transport blocks (TBs), demultiplexing of MAC SDUs from TBs, scheduling information reporting, error correction through HARQ, priority handling, and logical channel prioritization.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The transmit (TX) processor <b>1316</b> and the receive (RX) processor <b>1370</b> implement layer 1 functionality associated with various signal processing functions. Layer 1, which includes a physical (PHY) layer, may include error detection on the transport channels, forward error correction (FEC) coding/decoding of the transport channels, interleaving, rate matching, mapping onto physical channels, modulation/demodulation of physical channels, and MIMO antenna processing. The TX processor <b>1316</b> handles mapping to signal constellations based on various modulation schemes (e.g., binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), M-phase-shift keying (M-PSK), M-quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM)). The coded and modulated symbols may then be split into parallel streams. Each stream may then be mapped to an OFDM subcarrier, multiplexed with a reference signal (e.g., pilot) in the time and/or frequency domain, and then combined together using an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) to produce a physical channel carrying a time domain OFDM symbol stream. The OFDM stream is spatially precoded to produce multiple spatial streams. Channel estimates from a channel estimator <b>1374</b> may be used to determine the coding and modulation scheme, as well as for spatial processing. The channel estimate may be derived from a reference signal and/or channel condition feedback transmitted by the UE <b>1350</b>.
