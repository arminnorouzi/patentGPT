invention relates to superconducting flux barrier electric machines and, more particularly, superconducting axial or radial-flux electric machines using superconducting pellets to modulate the magnetic field created by the inductor of the electric machine.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A particularly interesting application of the invention relates to turbomachines intended for supplying to aircraft on-board networks with electrical energy.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Propulsion systems for electric or hybrid aircrafts require the use of electric motors capable of competing with, and even exceeding, the performances of heat engines.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electric machines intended for the propulsion of electric aircraft need to be capable of outputting electric power densities higher than about 20 kW per kg.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this context, the use of superconducting machines is advantageous to be able to reach these power density levels.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Indeed, when cooled down to a temperature lower than their critical temperature, superconducting materials have zero resistivity, which allows direct currents to flow without losses. At this temperature, they also feature a diamagnetic response to any variation in the magnetic field.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The absence of resistivity of superconducting materials at a temperature lower than their critical temperature allows increasing the current density flowing in the conductors.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Indeed, the absence of Joule losses in superconducting conductors allows avoiding a linear increase in cooling needs with the increase of the power of superconducting electric motors. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to cool them down to temperatures lower than their critical temperature, typically below 100 K.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In general, electric machines comprise one or several induced element(s) and one or several inductor(s). In general, the induced element includes an arrangement of electromagnetic coils and a yoke provided with an iron crown. In the case of an axial-flux machine, the inductor may include a superconducting coil coaxial with the arrangement of the electromagnetic coils of the induced element and pellets arranged radially inside the superconducting coil.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The absence of Joule losses, due to the zero resistivity of superconducting materials at temperatures lower than their critical temperature, is true only for the direct component of the excitation current.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In alternating current, the losses in the superconducting conductors are no longer negligible and, if the rotational speed of the machine is too high, the losses could be very high and the efficiency of the machine might be considerably reduced.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The superconducting flux barrier generators according to the prior art include, in particular for applications at high rotational speed, typically higher than 1,000 revolutions per minute, a partially superconducting structure, with one or several induced element(s) formed of electromagnetic coils made based on conductors made of non-superconductive materials, such as copper or aluminium.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Although such a structure allows placing the induced element outside the cryogenic chamber of the machine, and therefore limiting the energy used for cooling, such a structure, which comprises an alternation of superconducting regions and non-superconducting regions complicates the implementation of the machine.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In any event, such a structure features a limitation of the current density flowing in the conductors and, consequently, the power density of the machine.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In view of the foregoing, an objective of the present invention is to provide a superconducting flux barrier electric machine capable of improving the supplied electrical power density and that being so, within a reduced size and with a simple construction.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Hence, an object of the invention is a superconducting flux barrier electric machine, comprising an induced element and an inductor, one of the induced element or the inductor housing a rotor and a superconducting induction coil, and the other comprising an arrangement of electromagnetic coils coaxial with the superconducting induction coil, the rotor comprising superconducting pellets mounted radially inside the superconducting coil on an axis of rotation of the machine.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The electromagnetic coils are made of a superconducting material, the induced element and the inductor being arranged in an assembly forming a cooling chamber provided with cooling means specific to the superconducting elements of the induced element and the inductor.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Thus, the induced element and the inductor are made of a superconducting material, allowing for an increase in the power of the machine.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, it is no longer necessary to provide the machine with a yoke made of a ferromagnetic material conventionally used to guide the flux to loop back the magnetic field lines, thereby allowing for a reduction in the mass of the machine.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Nonetheless, in one embodiment, the machine may include a stator yoke provided with at least one iron crown.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">For example, the electromagnetic coils of the induced element include twisted filaments comprising MgB2 in a titanium matrix.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, the induced element and the inductor are arranged in a common cryogenic cooling chamber.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Thus, cooling of the induced element and the inductor could be shared, a single cryogenic cooling system could be used, thus allowing simplifying making of the machine.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Alternatively, the assembly forming a cooling chamber comprises a first cryogenic chamber in which the superconducting induction coil is placed and a second cryogenic chamber in which said at least one inductor and said at least one induced element are placed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to still another embodiment, the assembly forming a cooling chamber includes a first cryogenic chamber in which the superconducting coil is placed and cryogenic chambers in which the rotor of said at least one inductor and said at least one induced element are respectively placed.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the various considered embodiments, said assembly forming a cooling chamber may comprise at least one vacuum chamber.

In various embodiments and implementations, the machine <b>1</b> may be an axial-flux or radial-flux barrier electric machine and could operate in motor mode, in which it is supplied with electricity to provide a motive rotary force, or in generator mode, in which it is driven in rotation to supply electrical energy. In the embodiment described in the following the description, the electric machine <b>1</b> is an axial-flux electric machine, and operates in generator mode. The induced element <b>2</b> is formed by the stator of the electric machine and the rotary portion of the inductor <b>3</b> forms the rotor of the electric machine.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be noted that the machine <b>1</b> may include several stators, for example two in number, only one of the stators being illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The induced element <b>2</b> includes an annular arrangement <b>4</b> of several fixed electromagnetic coils <b>5</b> defining an axial direction DA, a circumferential direction D<sub>C </sub>and a radial direction D<sub>R</sub>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The inductor <b>3</b> includes a fixed superconducting coil <b>6</b> coaxial with the arrangement of the electromagnetic coils <b>4</b> of the induced element and rotor superconducting pellets <b>7</b> arranged in the same plane orthogonal to the axial direction D<sub>A </sub>and radially inside the superconducting coil <b>6</b>, and is closed by an optional stator yoke including an iron crown <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Each of the superconducting pellets <b>7</b> is mounted on a support <b>9</b> linked to a rotary shaft <b>10</b> of the machine, extending according to an axis X-X&#x2032; parallel to the axial direction D<sub>A</sub>. In the illustrated example, the superconducting pellets <b>7</b> have a circular disk shape, but they could have other shapes such as a ring sector shape and the invention covers all of these embodiments of the pellets.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The superconducting pellets are configured to form flux barriers or permanent magnets made of a superconducting material. Advantageously, they are distributed in the orthoradial direction of the superconducting machine, which allows a spatial variation of the electromagnetic field in the air gap. Advantageously, these pellets may be spaced apart so that the opening angle of the pellets represents between 60 and 70% of the total opening angle of a pair of poles, allowing for an optimisation of the flux modulation. Each pair of poles consists of a superconducting pellet <b>7</b> and the space between this superconducting pellet and the next one.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The superconducting coil <b>6</b> of the inductor <b>3</b> is a static superconducting coil powered with direct current and the stator yoke ensures mechanical strength of the coils.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Nonetheless, this yoke may be omitted in order to reduce the mass of the machine.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>, such a superconducting flux barrier electric machine operates as follows.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Firstly, powering the superconducting coil <b>6</b> with direct current causes the apparition of an intense magnetic field B. The rotary superconducting pellets <b>7</b> cause a variation of the magnetic field, the magnetic field being stopped by the pellets due to their diamagnetic response (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The electromagnetic coils of the coil arrangement are exposed to this variable magnetic field B created by the rotation of the rotor. An electromotive force is then generated.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The variation of the axial component of the magnetic induction in the machine as a function of the angular position of the rotor is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The coils of the coil arrangement of the induced element are made of a superconducting material. Thus, the inductor and the induced element of the machine are both made of a superconducting material.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, for example, the coils of the coil arrangement of the induced element are made from a multifilament conductor comprising for example several filaments within an adequate resistive matrix to reduce eddy currents. For example, the number of filaments may vary between 20 and 100, the resistive matrix being for example made of titanium. Advantageously, the filaments are made of twisted MgB2.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">It has been noticed that such a multifilament conductor allows reducing losses in alternating current applications (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Indeed, it has been noticed that the use of such a multifilament conductor allows obtaining hysteresis losses of 55, 35 and 25 watts for wires including strands of 20 filaments (curve I), 50 filaments (curve II) and 100 filaments (curve III), respectively.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Moreover, the machine according to the invention, comprising superconducting inductor and induced element, allows for a reduction of the air gap.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As indicated before, thanks to making of the inductor and the induced element in a superconducting material, the inductor and the induced element can be placed in a common cryogenic chamber equipped with cooling means specific to each of the superconducting elements.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Placing the inductor and the induced element in the same chamber allows reducing the thickness of the air gap to a thickness corresponding to conventional machines. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, which illustrates the evolution of the power of a superconducting machine as a function of the thickness of the air gap, the reduction of the air gap allows for an increase in the power of the machine in the range of 15%. By increasing the current density, the increase in the power of the machine could then exceed 100%.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">An embodiment of a superconducting electric machine is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>7</b></figref><i>a </i>comprising a common cryogenic cooling chamber <b>11</b>, respectively in profile and front views.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this embodiment, the electric machine <b>1</b> includes a single stator S and two rotors R placed on either side of the stator.
