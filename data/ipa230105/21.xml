Plants photosynthesize using a light in a visible light wavelength band and gain energy through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis of plants does not occur to the same extent in all wavelength bands. The light in a specific wavelength band that the plants use for photosynthesis in sunlight is called Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR), occupies a portion of solar spectrum, and corresponds to a band from about 400 nanometers to about 700 nanometers. The light source for plant cultivation according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure includes the light in the PAR wavelength band to provide an appropriate light for plant photosynthesis, and the light source for plant cultivation provides a light in a wavelength band to increase the content of ingredients (hereinafter, referred to as an &#x201c;active ingredients&#x201d;) that positively affect the health of humans or the plants upon ingestion. In this case, the active ingredients are substances known to be necessary for humans, such as chlorophylls, flavonols, anthocyanins and glucosinolates.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Chlorophylls are known as a photosynthetic pigment of green vegetables and help to prevent bad breath and constipation. Flavonols are antioxidants and include quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin as its representative substances. Quercetin is an antioxidant with high antioxidant capacity, Kaempferol is known to prevent cancer cell proliferation by enhancing immunity, and Myricetin is known to inhibit the accumulation of fat to prevent cardiovascular disease. Anthocyanins are one of the representative antioxidants and have the effect of preventing aging by removing reactive oxygen species in human body. Anthocyanins also help re-synthesis of a pigment called rhodopsin in the eye's retina to prevent eye strain, decreased visual acuity, cataract.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">When the glucosinolates are absorbed into human intestines, the glucosinolates may be degraded by intestinal microorganisms and converted to isothiocyanate. The glucosinolates are known to be effective against cancer and is effective for bladder cancer, breast cancer, and liver cancer. In particular, the glucosinolates have a superior ability to regulate leukocyte and cytokine and have an enzyme that inhibits tumor growth in breast, liver, colon, lung, stomach, and esophagus. In addition, it is known that indole-3-carbinol produced by the glucosinolates also has an anticancer activity.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The glucosinolates may be a substance represented by the following chemical formula 1, and R may be various functional groups. R may be, for example, substituted or unsubstituted allyl, benzyl, or 2-phenylethyl group with from 1 to 10 carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="28.36mm" wi="72.81mm" file="US20230000022A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">In the exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, depending on the type of R, the glucosinolates may be glucoerucin, glucoraphenin, gluconapin, progoitrin, glucoraphanin, sinigrin, neoglucobrassicin, gluconasturtiin, glucoiberin, glucobrassicanapin, and the like.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">The types of plants to which the light source according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure is applied may vary. However, there may be differences in the photosynthetic efficiency of the light emitted from the light source or the degree of increase in the content of the active ingredients depending on the types of plants. The light source according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may be applied to a plant of the Brassicaceae family. In addition, the light source according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may be applied to a red radish, a red sango radish, a turnip, a cabbage, a broccoli, a rocket, an oilseed rape, a kohlrabi, a bok choy (Chinese cabbage), a red mustard, a tatsoi (Asia vitamin), a kale, and a red cabbage, which belongs to the Brassicaceae family. The types of plants according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure should not be limited thereto or thereby, and the light source may be applied to other types of plants.

At least one of the first and second light sources <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> has the spectrum peak in a visible light wavelength band. Hereinafter, the first light source <b>31</b> having the spectrum peak in the visible light wavelength band will be described as a representative example.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">The first light source <b>31</b> may emit the light in the visible light wavelength band. The light emitted from the first light source <b>31</b> may be a light having a wavelength band, which is mainly used in the process of plant photosynthesis, e.g., a light in the PAR spectral range.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">In the present exemplary embodiment, the first light source <b>31</b> is shown as one component; however, the first light source <b>31</b> may be implemented as one or more light emitting diodes as long as the light emitting diodes emit the light in the visible light wavelength band that plants are able to use for photosynthesis. Alternatively, the first light source <b>31</b> may be implemented as one or more light emitting diodes as long as they emit the light having a predetermined spectrum described later. For example, the first light source <b>31</b> may include a light emitting diode that substantially simultaneously emits a blue color and a red color, or may include a light emitting diode emitting a light in a blue wavelength band and a plurality of light emitting diodes emitting a light in a red wavelength band.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">The second light source <b>33</b> may emit a light having a wavelength band different from the first light source <b>31</b>. For example, the second light source <b>33</b> may emit a light in an ultraviolet wavelength band, particularly, a light in ultraviolet-B wavelength band. The second light source <b>33</b> provides a light for the purpose of increasing the active ingredients in the plants. In addition, the second light source <b>33</b> may also include one or more light emitting diodes as needed.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">The first light source <b>31</b> and the second light source <b>33</b> may be individually operated.

In some embodiments, the first light source <b>31</b> and the second light source <b>33</b> may be individually turned on/off and may provide the light having the predetermined spectrum to the plants. The plants receive the light in various forms from the light source, i.e., the first and second light sources <b>31</b> and <b>33</b>, depending on their growth stage, depending on whether it is a light period or a dark period, or depending on their harvesting time. The spectrum of the light emitted from the light source including the first and second light sources <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> will be described later.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">The first light source <b>31</b> and the second light source <b>33</b> may be disposed on a substrate <b>20</b>. The substrate <b>20</b> may be a printed circuit board on which wirings and circuits are formed to allow the first light source <b>31</b> and the second light source <b>33</b> to be directly mounted thereon, however, the substrate <b>20</b> should not be limited to the printed circuit board.

The second conductive-type dopant may be a n-type dopant, and the second conductive-type dopant may include, for example, Si, Ge, Se, Te, O, or C.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">In some embodiments, the second semiconductor layer <b>227</b> may include a nitride based semiconductor material. In other embodiments, the semiconductor material having the composition formula may include GaN, AlN, AlGaN, InGaN, InN, InAlGaN, or AlInN.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">In some embodiments, the first electrode <b>221</b> and the second electrode <b>229</b> are provided in various shapes to connect with the first semiconductor layer <b>223</b> and the second semiconductor layer <b>227</b>, respectively. The first electrode <b>221</b> is provided under the first semiconductor layer <b>223</b> and the second electrode <b>229</b> is provided on the second semiconductor layer, but the light emitting structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is not limited thereto.

The first and second electrodes <b>221</b> and <b>229</b> are formed of a single layer structure, or a multi-layer structure.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">In some embodiments, a vertical type light emitting diode is explained, but it is not limited thereto. The light emitting diode does not necessarily have to be a vertical type and other types are available.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">According to some embodiments, the following effects may be obtained by using a light emitting diode instead of an existing typical lamp as a light source to apply light to a test sample.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">In some embodiments, when the light emitting diode is used as the light source, light having a specific wavelength may be provided to an irradiation target, as compared to light emitted from the existing typical lamp (for example, an existing UV lamp). The light emitted from the existing lamp has a broader spectrum in a wider area as compared to the light emitted from the light emitting diode. Accordingly, in the case of the existing UV lamp, it is not easy to separate only light having some band of the wavelength band of the emitted light. In contrast, the light emitted from the light emitting diode has a sharp peak at a specific wavelength and provides light of a specific wavelength having a very small half-width as comparison to light from an existing lamp. Accordingly, it is easy to select light of a specific wavelength and only the selected light of the specific wavelength may be provided to the target sample.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">In addition, in the case of the existing lamp, although light is provided to the test sample, it may be difficult to precisely limit an amount of light. However, in the case of the light emitting diode, light may be provided by exactly limiting the amount of light. Further, in the case of the existing lamp, since it may be difficult to precisely limit the amount of light, the irradiation time may also be set in a wide range. However, in the case of the light emitting diode, light necessary for the test sample may be provided within a definite time for a relatively short time.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">As described above, in the case of the conventional lamp, it is difficult to clearly determine the light irradiation amount due to the relatively wide range of wavelengths, the wide range of light quantity, and the wide range of irradiation time. To the contrary, the light emitting diode can provide a clear light irradiation amount due to a relatively narrow range of wavelengths, a narrow amount of light, and a narrow range of irradiation time.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">In addition, in the case of the existing lamp, it takes longer time to arrive at the maximum amount of light after power is turned on. To the contrary, when the light emitting diode is used, an amount of light instantly arrives at the maximum amount of light since warming-up time is hardly taken after the power is turned on. Therefore, in the case of a light source employing the light emitting diode, the irradiation time of the light may be clearly controlled when irradiating light of a specific wavelength to an optical element target.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0096">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the controller <b>40</b> is connected to the first light source <b>31</b> and the second light source <b>33</b> to control whether to operate or not the first light source <b>31</b> and the second light source <b>33</b>.
