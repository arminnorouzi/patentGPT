id="h-0002" level="1">1. Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a lens optical system for photographing and a photographing apparatus including the same. In particular, it relates to a lens optical system which guarantees a high resolution and a fast focusing with one inner lens in a quasi-telephoto lens optical system with a large aperture.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recently, miniaturization of photographing apparatuses, power saving functions, or the like have been required, and miniaturization of photographing devices using solid-state imaging devices such as CCD (charge-coupled devices) type image sensors or CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) type image sensors have been required. Such photographing apparatuses include digital still cameras, video cameras, interchangeable lens cameras, or the like.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, since the photographing apparatuses using the solid-state imaging devices are suitable for miniaturization, it is also applied to small information terminals such as mobile phones. Users have demands for high performance such as high resolution, a wide angle, or the like. In addition, as consumer expertise in cameras continues to increase, demand for short focal length lens systems such as wide-angle lens systems and telephoto lens systems is increasing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In particular, a camera of the same type as a CSC (compact system camera) is a form that removes a pentaprism or a reflection mirror from tan existing DSLR (digital single lens reflex). Therefore, it has the benefit of being relatively small in volume and light, so it has good mobility and is easy to carry. However, in such a CSC, interchangeable lenses using a full-frame imaging device are required to obtain high-quality photographs. The larger the size of the imaging device, the larger the interchangeable lens and the larger the volume. When the interchangeable lens coupled to the CSC becomes heavy, it decreases portability and convenience. Therefore, even if a full-frame imaging device is used, it is necessary to reduce an overall length of a product to some extent. To this end, an inner focus type can be used, in which the overall length is fixed during the focusing operation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, it is necessary to move a particular lens group in the lens optical system in order to correct the change of imaging point according to the change of the object position. The conventional interchangeable lenses use various types for moving lens groups, such as a front type for moving a front lens group, a rear type for moving a rear lens group, an inner lens type for moving only an inner lens group, and a focusing type for moving a plurality of lens groups.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A typical type among them is known as a floating type for moving all the lenses in the optical system or for moving two or three lens groups at the same time. In this type, the weight of lens groups that should be moved is considerably heavy and thus it causes a high load of a driving source such as a motor and consumes more power accordingly.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Specifically, it needs to implement a focusing for a video capture, by moving continuously a particular lens group related to an autofocus (AF) in small quantity to capture images and determining a contrast of the images. In this case, the stepping motor is preferable as a driving source, but it is not suitable for moving heavy lens groups because of its low torque from the driving source.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this regard, it is necessary to implement a focusing by moving the least number of lenses in the lens optical system in order to minimize the weight of lens groups in motion.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An aspect of the present invention provides a lens optical system for enabling a high-speed autofocus with a sufficient performance, using only a single focusing lens.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect of the present invention provides a lens optical system in which high refractive and low dispersive lenses are properly arranged in order to correct various aberrations occurred in the lens optical system with a large aperture.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, aspects of the present invention are not restricted to those set forth herein.

In focusing, the first lens group G<b>11</b> and the third lens group G<b>31</b> are fixed to maintain a constant length of the overall length, and the second lens group G<b>21</b> which is comprised of one lens in the middle may be moved.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0034">Hereinafter, the image side I may indicate a direction where an image plane IMG is positioned, in which an image is formed on the image plane IMG, and the object side O may indicate a direction in which a subject is positioned. In addition, the &#x201c;object side&#x201d; of a lens means, for example, the left side of the drawing toward a lens surface where the subject is positioned. &#x201c;back side of the image I&#x201d; may indicate the right side of the drawing toward a lens surface where the image plane is positioned. The image plane IMG may be, for example, an imaging device surface or an image sensor surface. The image sensor may include, for example, a sensor such as a CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) image sensor or a CCD (charge coupled device). The image sensor is not limited thereto, and may be, for example, a device that converts an image of a subject into an electrical image signal.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0035">In the lens optical system according to various embodiments, the first lens group G<b>11</b> may embody a wide angle by emitting light with a positive refractive power. In addition, an aperture ST may be arranged between the first lens group G<b>11</b> and the second lens group G<b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0036">When focusing from infinity to the nearest distance, the first lens group G<b>11</b> and the third lens group G<b>31</b> are fixed, the second lens group G<b>21</b> may move independently and moves from the image side I to the object side O. When the first lens group G<b>11</b> and the third lens group G<b>31</b> are fixed in focusing, damage or impairment to the lens due to the protrusion of the first lens group G<b>11</b> may be reduced, and it may contribute to miniaturization of the lens optical system by preventing an increase in length of the overall length.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0037">In a general wide-angle lens optical system, a diameter of a lens positioned closest to the object side O increases, and an aspheric surface may be employed inside the first lens group positioned closest to the object side O so as to minimize aberration changes due to focusing. Further, in the present invention, an aspheric lens may be provided in the third lens group having a relatively small aperture. In a bright lens optical system having a small F number Fno, the aspheric lens must be employed to achieve sufficient resolution performance and small distortion. Therefore, the aspheric surface is employed, in which the aspheric surface is employed in the third lens group G<b>31</b> positioned at the rear of the small aperture so that the maximum resolution performance may be obtained at a small cost. Preferably, the aspheric surface may be employed on the object side O surface of the lens positioned on the image side I immediately behind the aperture ST in order to increase the center resolution performance. In addition, the aspheric lens may be arranged on the uppermost side I of the third lens group G<b>31</b> for correction of astigmatism and distortion.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first lens group G<b>11</b> may include a first lens L<b>11</b> having a positive refractive power, a second lens L<b>21</b> having a positive refractive power, a third lens L<b>31</b> having a negative refractive power, and a fourth lens L<b>41</b> having a positive refraction power. Among them, the second lens L<b>21</b> and the third lens L<b>31</b> may be double-junction lenses bonded to each other.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0039">Each lens L<b>11</b> to L<b>41</b> may have a meniscus shape convex toward the object side O, the first lens L<b>11</b>, the second lens L<b>21</b> and the fourth lens L<b>41</b> may be a convex lens, and the third lens L<b>31</b> may be a concave lens.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0040">The second lens group G<b>21</b> may be comprised of a fifth lens L<b>51</b> having a negative refractive power. The fifth lens L<b>51</b> may be a concave lens and have the meniscus shape convex toward the object side O.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0041">The third lens group G<b>31</b> may include a sixth lens L<b>61</b> having a negative refractive power, a seventh lens L<b>71</b> having a positive refractive power, an eighth lens L<b>81</b> having a negative refractive power, a ninth lens L<b>91</b> having a negative refractive power and a tenth lens L<b>01</b> having a negative refractive power. The sixth lens L<b>61</b> and the seventh lens L<b>71</b> may have the meniscus shape convex toward the image side I and may be double-junction lenses bonded to each other. In addition, the eighth lens L<b>81</b> and the tenth lens L<b>01</b> may have the meniscus shape convex toward the image side I and the ninth lens L<b>91</b> may be a biconvex lens.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0042">The lens optical system according to the first embodiment has the following characteristic values as a whole by a combination of individual lenses.

It is characterized that since it is a short focus optical system, focusing is required to correct a position of an image point that changes depending on a position of a subject, in which the overall length of the optical system is fixed using the inner focusing in order to shorten the length of the overall length of the optical system, and it has a focusing group that is light-weight to realize high-speed auto-focusing (AF).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0084">The lens optical system <b>100</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>100</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>100</b>-<b>3</b> described above is characterized by having a light-weight focusing group in order to implement a high-speed autofocus (AF) in a quasi-telephoto lens optical system with a large aperture which has 13&#x2dc;18&#xb0; and F/1.8 as a half field of view. Generally, a quasi-telephoto lens optical system has a slow AF speed because the focusing group has as long travel as the focal length of the optical system. In addition, the long travel of the focusing group limits the selection of a driving source.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0085">In this regard, this invention proposes conditions in which you can implement a high-speed AF and freely select the driving source by minimizing the travel of the focusing group according to the object distance.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0086">According to the conditions, the lens optical system <b>100</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>100</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>100</b>-<b>3</b> is comprised of three lens groups.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0087">The first lens in the first lens group has a meniscus shape and a positive refractive power, and the first lens group also has a positive refractive power. In addition, the first lens group further includes double-junction lenses which have a negative refractive power.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0088">The second lens group is comprised of a single focusing lens having a negative refractive power, and the third lens group is comprised of a plurality of lenses and has a positive refractive power. The lenses in the lens optical system may be a spherical or aspherical lens.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0089">Specifically, the second lens group is a focusing group for compensating the change in the image distance according to the change in the object distance, and the overall length of the lens optical system is maintained since the first and the third lens group does not move while focusing.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0090">Specifically, the lens groups in the lens optical system <b>100</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>100</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>100</b>-<b>3</b> satisfies the following condition described in the equation 1.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00009" num="00009"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mn>3.8</mn>     <mo>&#x2264;</mo>     <mfrac>      <mi>FL</mi>      <mi>BFL</mi>     </mfrac>     <mo>&#x2264;</mo>     <mn>4.5</mn>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>[</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>Equation</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mn>1</mn>     </mrow>     <mo>]</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0108" num="0091">Here, BFL is a distance from the last lens surface of the third lens group to the imaging device surface (IMG) and FL is a distance from the first lens surface of the first lens group to the imaging device surface.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0092">Further, the field of view of the lens optical system (w) satisfies the following equation 2.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>0.5&#x2264;tan <i>w&#x2264;</i>0.7&#x2003;&#x2003;[Equation 2]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0111" num="0093">The above equations 1 and 2 provide a basic arrangement for the designed refraction power to establish a quasi-telephoto lens optical system whose overall length does not change even during the auto-focusing. This feature contributes to lightening the focusing group because the aperture of the second lens group can be reduced when the first lens group has a positive refraction power.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0094">On the other hand, it is difficult to lighten a lens optical system in which many lenses are used even though the aperture of the focusing group is reduced. Accordingly, the equations 1 and 2 means conditions for lightening the focusing group without changing the overall length of the lens optical system while focusing.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0095">As described above, the first lens group has a positive refraction power. This is not only a condition for the light-weight of the focusing group (the second lens group) but also a characteristic of a telephoto lens optical system which has a narrow-angle field of view. The telephoto lens optical system includes a combination of a lens group having a positive refraction powers and another lens group having a negative refraction power, which is called a telephoto type.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0096">Generally, aspherical lenses are used for enhancing the performance of the lens optical system with a large aperture, but the overall cost rises due to the high unit price of the aspherical lens. Accordingly, a combination of a single aspherical lens and spherical lenses for each lens group can contribute to a price competitiveness.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0097">More preferably, the lens optical system according to the present invention satisfies the following equation 3.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00010" num="00010"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mn>9</mn>     <mo>&#x2264;</mo>     <mfrac>      <mrow>       <msub>        <mi>L</mi>        <mn>1</mn>       </msub>       <mo>+</mo>       <msub>        <mi>L</mi>        <mn>3</mn>       </msub>      </mrow>      <mrow>       <mn>2</mn>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>fd</mi>      </mrow>     </mfrac>     <mo>&#x2264;</mo>     <mn>17</mn>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>[</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>Equation</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mn>3</mn>     </mrow>     <mo>]</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0117" num="0098">Here, L<sub>1 </sub>is a distance from the first lens to the last lens in the first lens group, L<sub>3 </sub>is a distance from the first lens to the last lens in the third lens group, and 2fd is a travel range of the single lens in the second lens group when focusing from infinity to the nearest distance.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0099">The equation 3 is a condition for limiting a focus movement and the overall length of the lens optical system. It is difficult to shorten the overall length of the lens optical system if it is over the upper limit of the equation 3. On the other hand, the lower limit guarantees a proper overall length of the lens optical system so that the focus movement is not too small. If the focus movement is too small, the change in the performance according to the focusing is too sensitive, and thus the driving source should be accurate that much.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0100">As described above, the third lens group in the lens optical system is used as a field flattener to compensate the Petzval curvature.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0101">In addition, the lenses except for the last lens in the third lens group has cumulatively a positive refraction power, and the first lens group has a positive refraction power as well. Further, a light convergence and chromatic aberration can be properly compensated because the first lens group includes double-junction lenses which have a negative refractive power.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0102">Further, the focusing group (the second lens group) is comprised of a single lens which is a concave lens and has a negative refraction power. Preferably, the single lens can be a uni-concave lens or biconcave lens to provide a strong negative refraction power for minimizing the movement of the single lens during the focusing. To this end, it is possible to satisfy an aplanatic condition in which a spherical aberration and a coma are compensated at the same time, by positioning the lens surface having a smaller curvature radius in the single lens to the vicinity of the image side I.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0103">The curvature radius of the lens surface has a positive value according to a sign rule in an optical design software and preferably satisfies the following equation 4.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00011" num="00011"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <mo>-</mo>      <mn>0.69</mn>     </mrow>     <mo>&#x2264;</mo>     <mfrac>      <mrow>       <mi>R</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <msub>        <mn>2</mn>        <mi>rear</mi>       </msub>      </mrow>      <mrow>       <mi>f</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mn>2</mn>      </mrow>     </mfrac>     <mo>&#x2264;</mo>     <mrow>      <mo>-</mo>      <mn>0.55</mn>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>[</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>Equation</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mn>4</mn>     </mrow>     <mo>]</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0124" num="0104">Here, R2<sub>rear </sub>is a curvature radius of the last lens surface of the single lens in the second lens group and f2 is a focal length of the second lens group.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0105">The upper limit of the equation 4 is a condition for increasing the refraction power due to its small curvature radius, and the lower limit of the equation 4 is a condition for decreasing the refraction power due to its large curvature radius close to the flat plane.
