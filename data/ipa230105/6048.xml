Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates generally to semiconductors and transistor structures, and more particularly, to a silicon carbide (SiC) power device with enhanced junction field effect transistor (JFET) region.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">2. Related Art</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) is a foundational component of modern electronics, and variants specific to different application requirements have been developed. One such variant is the power MOSFET, which is capable of handling the high power levels necessary for switching and rectification in power circuits, among other applications. Power MOSFETs most commonly have a vertical structure that is comprised of a semiconductor substrate with the source and gate contacts disposed above the substrate and the drain contact disposed beneath the substrate. Silicon carbide (SiC) is utilized for the substrate as well as the epitaxial layer in power MOSFETs because of its superior properties, including wide-bandgap, high electric breakdown field, high thermal conductivity, higher saturation electron drift velocity, and radiation immunity. The resultant semiconductor devices can operate at higher temperatures, voltages, and frequencies.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The structure of the power MOSFET is further defined by a drift layer that is formed over the substrate, which has one doping type, e.g., an N-type. Furthermore, in a multiple implantation process, one or more wells of the opposite doping type, e.g., a P-type or P-well is implanted into the substrate, along with an N-region that is further implanted into the P-well. The P-well and the N-region, which may also be more generally referred to as the source region, are spaced apart from each other, with the area between each being referred to as a junction field effect transistor (JFET) region. Source contacts are formed over the source regions, while a gate oxide layer is formed on the drift layer between the source regions. A gate electrode is then added on to the gate oxide layer, which spans only a portion thereof.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Each of the foregoing elements of the vertical MOSFET structure have associated resistances that contribute to the overall resistance between the drain and source contacts, some of which are desirable and some of which are parasitic. It is understood that in a conventional 1200V silicon carbide device, channel resistance (R<sub>ch</sub>) accounts for approximately 43% of the overall resistance, while the JFET resistance (R<sub>JFET</sub>) accounts for approximately 24% of the overall resistance. Additionally, there may be a source resistance (R<sub>source</sub>), contact resistance (R<sub>contact</sub>), and substrate resistance (R<sub>sub</sub>), which account for approximately 5%, 2%, and 10%, respectively. The overall resistance also includes a drift region resistance R<sub>drift</sub>, which is non-parasitic and sets the blocking voltage of the power MOSFET.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">With the JFET resistance representing a substantial proportion of the overall resistance and second only to the channel resistance, there is a need in the art for its reduction for improved performance and reliability. One approach that has been taken to reduce channel resistance is increasing the size of the JFET region, that is, increasing the separation distance between the adjacent p-wells. There are understood to be certain tradeoffs with this approach, however. For instance, the larger JFET gap may increase the unit cell pitch, and thus reduces the packing density of the device. Furthermore, a larger electric field may be present at the center of the JFET region, thereby placing additional stress on the gate oxide. Although silicon carbide can support electric fields in excess of 2 MV/cm, conventional practice sets limits of under 1.6 MV/cm so that the corresponding gate oxide electric field is maintained below 4 MV/cm. The SiO<sub>2 </sub>gate oxide may begin to break down at 10 MV/cm, but in order to ensure device longevity, the electric field is maintained at such lower levels. Accordingly, there are practical limits to the width of the JFET region.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another known approach for reducing channel resistance involves increasing the doping of the JFET region. This is understood to reduce the depletion effects of the adjacent P-wells, and result in a reduced JFET resistance. Like the first approach of increasing the size of the JFET region discussed above, tradeoffs are associated with this second approach. The increased JFET doping causes a substantial increase in the substrate (SiC) electric field, and a corresponding increase in the gate oxide electric field. Again, conventionally, the gate oxide electric field is limited to less than 4 MV/cm, which results in the SiC electric field being less than 1.6 MV/cm. This may be counteracted to a certain extent with a thicker gate oxide, but which results in the resistance in the channel region, that is, the surface of the P-well.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is thus a need in the art for a simplified method for fabricating an improved silicon carbide power MOSFET with an enhanced JFET region with reduced resistance.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The embodiments of the present disclosure contemplate improvements over conventional metal oxide semiconductor field effect devices that mitigate oxide electric field limitations. This may be achieved by selectively increasing the thickness of the oxide layer within the junction field effect transistor (JFET) region to suppress the oxide electric field, while retaining reduced thickness in the channel region to maintain low channel resistance.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One embodiment is a power metal oxide semiconductor field effect device that may include a first semiconductor type body that is defined by a drift region, one or more second semiconductor type implants, and one or more first semiconductor type implant implants within corresponding ones of the one or more second semiconductor type implants. There may be a junction field effect region that is defined between a given set of the first semiconductor type implant and the second semiconductor type implant and another set of the first semiconductor type implant and the second semiconductor type implant. The device may also include a gate oxide layer that spans a top surface of the semiconductor body across one set of the first and second semiconductor type implants and another set of the first and second semiconductor type implants. Channel regions may be defined at interfaces of the gate oxide layer and the sets of the first and second semiconductor type implants. The gate oxide layer may further define a central expansion region between the sets of the first and second semiconductor type implants. The gate oxide layer may also extend into the junction field effect region. The device may further include a gate electrode disposed on the gate oxide layer, a source electrode at least partially overlapping the first semiconductor type implants and the second semiconductor type implants, and a drain electrode that is disposed underneath the semiconductor body.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another embodiment of the present disclosure is a semiconductor device with at least a body, a gate oxide layer, and a gate electrode. The body may be defined by a drift region and one or more implant regions. Further, there may be a junction field effect region that is defined between one of the implant regions and another one of the implant regions. The gate oxide layer may be grown as a single, unitary structure extending across the semiconductor body and at least partially overlapping the implant regions. The gate oxide layer may further define a central expansion region between the implant regions and extend into the junction field effect region. The device may additionally include a gate electrode that is disposed on the gate oxide layer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure also contemplates a method for fabricating a power metal oxide semiconductor field effect device. The method may begin with a precursor step of fabricating a semiconductor substrate with a body defined by a drift region, one or more implant regions, and a junction field effect region between one of the implant regions and another one of the implant regions. Next, the method may proceed to a step of patterning a central expansion region into a center of the junction field effect region. There may also be a step of implanting an ionic species into the central expansion region. The method may further include forming a gate oxide layer above a top layer of the semiconductor substrate by thermal oxidation. This may be a single formation step without annealing the implanted ionic species. The gate oxide layer may extend into the junction field effect region and define the central expansion region and channel regions peripheral thereto. The method may also include forming a gate electrode over the gate oxide layer.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present disclosure will be best understood accompanying by reference to the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">These and other features and advantages of the various embodiments disclosed herein will be better understood with respect to the following description and drawings, in which like numbers refer to like parts throughout, and in which:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a conventional power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET);</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a power MOSFET in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a power MOSFET in accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is another cross-sectional view of the power MOSFET of the present disclosure illustrating the dimensional specifics thereof;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref> show cross-sectional views at various fabrication steps of the power MOSFET according to the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart describing the fabrication steps of the power MOSFET.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of the several presently contemplated embodiments of a silicon carbide power device with an enhanced junction field effect region and is not intended to represent the only form in which such embodiments may be developed or utilized.

As is preferred for high powered devices, the semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> is a silicon carbide (SiC) material. Numerous polytypes of SiC are known in the art and have varying properties that make one polytype more suitable for certain applications than others. One common polytype selected for high powered semiconductor applications is 4H, though any other polytype may be selected.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> may be defined as a body <b>14</b> with a body top surface <b>16</b> and an opposed body bottom surface <b>18</b>. The depicted MOSFET is an N-type device, and thus the semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> is doped with an N-type doping impurity. Certain embodiments of the present disclosure may generally refer to this as a first type doping impurity, though it is not intended to explicitly associate the first type dopant as an N-type. To the extent an alternative implementation is a P-type device, the first type dopant may be a P-type. Thus, reference to a first type doping impurity or a second type doping impurity is not to be limiting.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The body <b>14</b> may be generally characterized by a highly N<sup>+</sup> doped substrate region <b>20</b>, along with a lightly N<sup>&#x2212;</sup> doped drift region <b>22</b> or epitaxial layer over the substrate region <b>20</b>. As a vertically oriented semiconductor device, a drain electrode <b>24</b> is disposed underneath the semiconductor substrate <b>12</b>. The drain electrode <b>24</b> is defined by a drain electrode bottom surface <b>26</b> that coincides with the bottom surface of the MOSFET <b>10</b> overall, and an opposed drain electrode bottom surface <b>28</b> that faces and abuts against the body bottom surface <b>18</b>. The interface between the substrate region <b>20</b> and the drain electrode <b>24</b> has an associated contact resistance R<sub>c</sub>, while the substrate region <b>20</b> has an associated resistance R<sub>su</sub>b. Along these lines, the drift region <b>22</b> is understood to have a resistance R<sub>drift</sub>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is of a single cell of the MOSFET <b>10</b> bounded by a left side <b>30</b><i>a </i>and an opposed right side <b>30</b><i>b</i>, but such boundaries are arbitrary, and in a physical implementation, they may be characterized by any number of possible shapes. The straight side walls are thus presented by way of example only and not of limitation. On the left side <b>30</b><i>a</i>, the body <b>14</b> may include a P-well <b>32</b><i>a</i>, while the opposite right side <b>30</b><i>b </i>may include a P-well <b>32</b><i>b</i>. The P-wells <b>32</b> extend downwardly into the body <b>14</b> and specifically the drift region <b>22</b> thereof. The P-wells <b>32</b> are understood to be areas in the semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> that is implanted with a P-type doping impurity. In the context of the implementation in which the semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> is an N-type doping impurity and referred to as a first type doping impurity, the P-type doping impurity in the P-well <b>32</b> may be referred to as a second type doping impurity.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The P-well <b>32</b><i>a </i>on the left side <b>30</b><i>a </i>is separated from the P-well <b>32</b><i>b </i>on the right side <b>30</b><i>b </i>by a junction field effect (JFET) region <b>34</b>. The particular boundaries between where the P-type doping impurity is implanted and the areas generally constituting the drift region <b>22</b> and the JFET region <b>34</b> may be somewhat varied. As such, the JFET region <b>34</b> may be referred to broadly as the area between the P-wells <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b</i>. The upper boundary of the P-wells <b>32</b>, on the other hand, coincide with the body top surface <b>16</b>.

A given one of the P-wells <b>32</b> and the corresponding source implant <b>38</b> implanted therein may be collectively referred to as implant regions <b>39</b>.

There is the semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> characterized by the body <b>14</b>, which may be defined by the body top surface <b>16</b> and the opposed body bottom surface <b>18</b>. The semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> may be silicon carbide that is doped with an N-type doping impurity, more generally referenced herein as the first type doping impurity. The body <b>14</b> has a highly N<sup>+</sup> doped substrate region <b>20</b> and a lightly/moderately N<sup>&#x2212;</sup> doped drift region <b>22</b> above the substrate region <b>20</b>.

Again, the first implant region <b>39</b><i>a </i>is laterally separated from the second implant region <b>39</b><i>b </i>by a JFET region <b>34</b>. The gate oxide layer <b>46</b> is disposed above the body <b>14</b> while extending across the JFET region <b>34</b> between the first implant region <b>39</b><i>a </i>and the second implant region <b>39</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The gate oxide layer <b>46</b> may be comprised of multiple sections, though it is understood to be a single structure of unitary construction. In further detail, those portions of the gate oxide layer <b>46</b> that partially overlap the P-well <b>32</b> and the source implants <b>38</b> may be referred to as a channel region <b>62</b>. There is the bottom surface <b>44</b> that faces and abuts against the body top surface <b>16</b>, and the opposed top surface <b>48</b> that abuts against the inter-metal dielectric <b>54</b>. The lateral extension of the channel regions <b>62</b> are limited by the source electrode <b>42</b>, which is disposed on the body top surface <b>16</b> partially overlapping the P-wells <b>32</b> and the source implants <b>38</b>. Located towards the left side <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the structure is a left channel region <b>62</b><i>a </i>and located towards the right side <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the structure is a corresponding right channel region <b>62</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Generally centered between the left channel region <b>62</b><i>a </i>and the right channel region <b>62</b><i>b </i>is an expansion region <b>64</b> that extends into the JFET region <b>34</b>.

The expansion region <b>64</b> of the gate oxide layer <b>46</b> is understood to have a thicker dimension than that of the channel regions <b>62</b>. Between the channel regions <b>62</b> and the expansion region <b>64</b>, there may be transition region <b>66</b> that do not overlap with the P-wells <b>32</b> or the source implants <b>38</b>, while having the same thickness of the channel regions <b>62</b>. Located toward the left side <b>30</b><i>a </i>is a left transition region <b>66</b><i>a </i>and located toward the right side <b>30</b><i>b </i>is a right transition region <b>66</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the expansion region <b>64</b> may be referred to as being spaced apart from the implant regions <b>39</b>, as separated by the dimensions of the transition regions <b>66</b> lacking the additional thickness, though ultimately integral with the channel regions <b>62</b>. However, these transition regions <b>66</b> are optional, in that the expansion region <b>64</b> may extend to the P-wells <b>32</b>. The expansion region <b>64</b> defines a depth into the JFET region <b>34</b> and the bottom plane of the expansion region <b>64</b> is generally offset, e.g., deeper, than the bottom plane of either the channel regions <b>62</b> or the transition regions <b>66</b>. In some embodiments, the expansion region <b>64</b> may extend above the channel regions <b>62</b>, such that the entirety of the top surface <b>48</b> of the gate oxide layer <b>46</b> is not on a single plane. The expansion region <b>64</b> may therefore define a raised expansion surface <b>48</b>-<b>1</b> that has a planar structure above that of the top surface <b>48</b>.

That is, there is the semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> characterized by the body <b>14</b> that is defined by the body top surface <b>16</b> and the opposed body bottom surface <b>18</b>. The body <b>14</b> has the highly N<sup>+</sup> doped substrate region <b>20</b> and the light/moderately N<sup>&#x2212;</sup> doped drift region above the substrate region <b>20</b>.

Collectively, a given combination of the P-well <b>32</b> and the N<sup>+</sup> source implant <b>38</b> are referred to as the implant region <b>39</b>. With one implant region <b>39</b> being separated from another by the JFET region <b>34</b>, the gate oxide layer <b>46</b> is disposed above the body <b>14</b> and extend across the JFET region <b>34</b> between the same.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The gate oxide layer <b>46</b> is understood to be a single structure of unitary construction, though defined by various sections.

The expansion region <b>64</b> may therefore be referred to as being spaced apart from the implant regions <b>39</b>, as separated by the dimensions of the transition regions <b>66</b> without the additional thickness, though ultimately integral with the channel regions <b>62</b>. The expansion region <b>64</b> defines a depth into the JFET region <b>34</b> and the bottom plane of the expansion region <b>64</b> is generally offset, e.g., deeper, than the bottom plane of either the channel regions <b>62</b> or the transition regions <b>66</b>. Unlike the first embodiment, however, the expansion region <b>64</b> of the second embodiment does not rise above the top surface <b>48</b> of the channel region <b>62</b>. In other words, the top surface of the expansion region <b>64</b> is contiguous and coplanar with the top surface <b>48</b>, such that the top surface <b>48</b> of the channel region <b>62</b> is the top surface of the entirety of the gate oxide layer <b>46</b>, including the expansion region <b>64</b>. This may be achieved with a planarization process following the formation of the gate oxide layer <b>46</b> that expands both downwardly and upwardly. As was the case with the first embodiment, the gate electrode <b>52</b> is disposed on top of the gate oxide layer <b>46</b>, together with the inter-metal dielectric <b>54</b> and the source electrode <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The selectively increased thickness of the gate oxide layer <b>46</b> at the expansion region <b>64</b> is contemplated to suppress the oxide electric field, and the conventional thickness of the gate oxide layer <b>46</b> at the channel regions <b>62</b> is understood to maintain low channel resistance R<sub>CH</sub>.

The drain electrode <b>24</b> is disposed underneath the substrate region <b>20</b>. The P-type semiconductor base implant <b>68</b>, which corresponds to the aforementioned P-well <b>32</b>, extends a predetermined depth into the body <b>14</b> from the body top surface <b>16</b>. The P-type semiconductor base implant <b>68</b> may be contiguous with a more heavily doped P<sup>+</sup> implant <b>70</b> that is adjacent to an N<sup>+</sup> source implant <b>72</b> that generally corresponds to the aforementioned source implant <b>38</b>. The gate oxide layer <b>46</b> is disposed on the body top surface <b>16</b>, with the gate electrode <b>52</b> being disposed on the gate oxide layer <b>46</b>. The inter-metal dielectric <b>54</b> is disposed on the gate electrode <b>52</b> and directly over the source implant <b>72</b>.

An activation anneal is applied to the semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> with the implant regions <b>39</b>. The process of growing the semiconductor substrate <b>12</b>, etching the patterns for forming the drift region <b>22</b> and the implant regions <b>39</b>, and depositing the semiconductor impurities are known in the art, and therefore will not be described in detail.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Thereafter, in a step <b>102</b>, the expansion region <b>64</b> is patterned into the body top surface <b>16</b>, then in a step <b>104</b>, a shallow ionic species <b>69</b> is implanted therein. The resultant state of the semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> following these steps is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. According to one embodiment, the ionic material is a metal such as aluminum, though any other suitable material may be substituted without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Aluminum may be selected for its low penetration characteristics, such that the expansion region <b>64</b> remains relatively shallow without extending deeply into the JFET region <b>34</b>. However, any other ionic species that have similarly low penetration into the semiconductor body may be utilized. Although conventional processes for forming a gate oxide layer involve growth on a crystalline structure that has been annealed and the implant damage thereto repaired, the present disclosure specifically contemplates the avoidance of such annealing step. It is envisioned that not annealing the expansion region <b>64</b> after metal material implantation is for preserving implant damage, as the damaged surface is understood to oxidize at a faster rate.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">After the implantation step, the method continues to a step <b>106</b> of forming a gate oxide layer <b>46</b> on the semiconductor substrate <b>12</b>, and more generally the entirety of the wafer that is the semiconductor substrate <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> illustrates the fully formed gate oxide layer <b>46</b> being characterized by the expansion region <b>64</b> that extends into the JFET region <b>34</b>, and a thinner channel region <b>62</b> on the periphery thereof. As previously discussed, the channel region <b>62</b> is understood to be those parts of the gate oxide layer <b>46</b> that overlap the implant regions <b>39</b>, while those parts of the gate oxide layer <b>46</b> that have the same thickness as the channel region <b>62</b> but directly overlap the JFET region <b>34</b> may be referred to as the transition region <b>66</b>. It is expressly contemplated that the expansion region <b>64</b> extends vertically both upward and downward, as shown. However, in alternative embodiments in which the expansion region <b>64</b> extends only downward into the JFET region <b>34</b>, the process may include a step of planarizing the top surface of the expansion region in a manner that forms the contiguous top planar surface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> above. The damage remaining in the unannealed expansion region <b>64</b> may be fully consumed by the thermal oxidation process, leaving a thicker oxide layer over the JFET region <b>34</b> with good crystalline quality.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The expansion region <b>64</b> is defined by a top surface <b>74</b> and an opposed bottom surface <b>76</b>.
