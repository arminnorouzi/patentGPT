Examples include ceramic soot filters used to remove particulates from diesel engine exhaust gases; and gasoline particulate filters (GPF) used to remove particulates from gasoline engine exhaust gases. For wall flow filters, exhaust gas to be filtered enters inlet cells and passes through the cell walls to exit the filter via outlet channels, with the particulates being trapped on or within the inlet cell walls as the gas traverses and then exits the filter. The particulates may be comprised of soot and/or ash. Accumulations of ash and/or soot typically can occur inside the filter after extended exposure to engine exhaust gases.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aspects of the disclosure pertain to ceramic articles such as honeycomb bodies and particulate filters and methods for their manufacture and use. In some embodiments, the particulate filters comprise honeycomb bodies comprised of a porous ceramic honeycomb structure of porous walls comprising wall surfaces comprising filtration material deposits, the surfaces defining a plurality of inner channels (channels). The porous walls are comprised of porous base walls and filtration material deposits disposed on one or more of the base walls, wherein the porous walls form the channels. The filtration material deposits are comprised of one or more inorganic materials, such as one or more ceramic or refractory materials. The filtration material deposits are disposed on the walls to provide enhanced filtration efficiency by the honeycomb body. In some embodiments, filtration efficiency is enhanced at least in the use of the honeycomb body from a clean state, or from a regenerated state, for example when the honeycomb body has no, or substantially no, accumulation of ash or soot present inside the honeycomb body, such as when the honeycomb body is new or has undergone regeneration to remove all or substantially all ash and/or soot. Substantial accumulations of ash and/or soot typically can then occur inside the channels of the honeycomb body after extended exposure to engine exhaust gases, e.g. after extended use of the honeycomb body as a filter. In one or more embodiments, the filtration material deposits are durable, for example, possessing a durability such as resistance to a high gas or air flow through the particulate filter with little to no degradation in the filtration performance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one or more embodiments, the filtration material deposits are present substantially or even entirely at the surface of one or more of the walls of the honeycomb structure. Thus, in some embodiments, the outer surface of the walls, which face and therefore define the channels, comprise the deposits. In some embodiments, some portions of the surfaces of some of the walls are free of the deposits; thus some of the walls may comprise deposit-free surface portions.

Whenever possible, the same reference numerals will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. In embodiments, a honeycomb body comprises a porous ceramic honeycomb body comprising a first end, a second end, and a plurality of walls having wall surfaces defining a plurality of inner channels. A porous inorganic layer is disposed on one or more of the wall surfaces of the honeycomb body. The inorganic layer has a porosity greater than 90%, and the inorganic layer has an average thickness of greater than or equal to 0.5 &#x3bc;m and less than or equal to 10 &#x3bc;m. Various embodiments of honeycomb bodies and methods of making such honeycomb bodies will be described herein with specific reference to the appended drawings. In some embodiments, a particulate filter is provided, the particulate filter comprising a honeycomb body comprising a plugged porous ceramic honeycomb structure comprising a plurality of intersecting porous walls comprising porous wall surfaces that define a plurality of channels extending from an inlet end to an outlet end of the structure, the plurality of channels comprising inlet channels sealed at or near the outlet end and having a surface area, and outlet channels sealed at or near the inlet end and having a surface area, the inlet channels and the outlet channels defining filtration area, wherein one or more of the porous wall surfaces defining the inlet channels comprise a base wall portion and filtration material deposits disposed on the base wall portion, wherein the filtration material deposits are disposed on the base wall portions, and wherein the particulate filter exhibits a change in filtration efficiency of less than 5% after being exposed to a high flow condition of 850 Nm<sup>3</sup>/h of air for one minute at room temperature, and wherein the change in filtration efficiency is determined by measuring a difference between a number of soot particles that are introduced into the particulate filter and a number of soot particles that exit the particulate filter before and after exposure to the high flow condition, wherein the soot particles have a median particle size of 300 nm a soot particle concentration of 500,000 particles/cm<sup>3 </sup>in a stream of air flowed through the particulate filter at a flow rate of 51 Nm<sup>3</sup>/h, at room temperature, and at a velocity of 1.7 m/s as measured by a particle counter (for example, by using a Lighthouse Handheld 3016 0.1 CFM particle counter, available from Lighthouse Worldwide Solutions, for 30 seconds upstream from the particulate filter and 30 seconds downstream from the particulate filter). In some embodiments, the particulate filter exhibits a change in filtration efficiency of less than 20%, 15%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or even less than 1% after exposure to the high flow condition of 850 Nm<sup>3</sup>/h of air for one minute at room temperature.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the filtration material deposits are preferably mechanically stable, such as being resistant to dislodgement or rearrangement such as due to high gas flow through the plugged honeycomb structure of the particulate filter, and/or such as due to mechanical vibration. In one or more embodiments, the filtration material deposits are stable when exposed to water such that the deposits maintain their location or position on the cell walls. In other words, according to some embodiments, the filtration material deposits are bound to the porous ceramic base walls. In some embodiments, the deposits are chemically bound, not just bound by physical bonding. For example, in some embodiments, the flame pyrolysis filtration material deposits are fused or sintered to the porous ceramic base wall. In addition, in some embodiments, the flame pyrolysis filtration material deposits are fused or sintered to each other to form a layer of porous inorganic material.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the&#x201d; encompass embodiments having plural referents, unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.

The ceramic honeycomb structure may be formed, extruded, or molded, and may be of any shape or size. For example, a ceramic honeycomb structure may be formed from cordierite or other suitable ceramic material.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A honeycomb body, as referred to herein, may also be defined as a shaped ceramic honeycomb structure having at least one layer applied to wall surfaces of the honeycomb structure, configured to filter particulate matter from a gas stream. There may be more than one layer applied to the same location of the honeycomb structure. The layer may be inorganic or organic or both. For example, a honeycomb body may, in one or more embodiments, be formed from cordierite or other ceramic material and have a high porosity layer applied to surfaces of the cordierite honeycomb structure. The layer may be &#x201c;filtration material&#x201d; which is to provide enhanced filtration efficiency, both locally through and at the wall and globally through the honeycomb body. Filtration material is not considered to be catalytically active in that it does not react with components of a gaseous mixture of an exhaust stream.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As used herein, &#x201c;green&#x201d; or &#x201c;green ceramic&#x201d; are used interchangeably and refer to an unsintered material, unless otherwise specified.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">A honeycomb body of one or more embodiments may comprise a honeycomb structure and a layer disposed on one or more walls of the honeycomb structure. In some embodiments, the layer is applied to surfaces of walls present within honeycomb structure, where the walls have surfaces that define a plurality of inner channels. The inner channels, when present, may have various cross-sectional shapes, such as circles, ovals, triangles, squares, pentagons, hexagons, or tessellated combinations or any of these, for example, and may be arranged in any suitable geometric configuration. The inner channels, when present, may be discrete or intersecting and may extend through the honeycomb body from a first end thereof to a second end thereof, which is opposite the first end.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a honeycomb body <b>100</b> according to one or more embodiments shown and described herein is depicted.

In general, cordierite is a solid solution having a composition according to the formula (Mg,Fe)<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>3</sub>(Si<sub>5</sub>AlO<sub>18</sub>). In some embodiments, the pore size of the ceramic material may be controlled, the porosity of the ceramic material may be controlled, and the pore size distribution of the ceramic material may be controlled, for example by varying the particle sizes of the ceramic raw materials. In addition, pore formers may be included in ceramic batches used to form the honeycomb body.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, walls of the honeycomb body may have an average thickness from greater than or equal to 25 &#x3bc;m to less than or equal to 250 &#x3bc;m, such as from greater than or equal to 45 &#x3bc;m to less than or equal to 230 &#x3bc;m, greater than or equal to 65 &#x3bc;m to less than or equal to 210 &#x3bc;m, greater than or equal to 65 &#x3bc;m to less than or equal to 190 &#x3bc;m, or greater than or equal to 85 &#x3bc;m to less than or equal to 170 &#x3bc;m. The walls of the honeycomb body can be described to have a base wall portion comprised of a bulk portion (also referred to herein as the bulk), and surface portions (also referred to herein as the surface). The surface portion of the walls extends from a surface of a wall of the honeycomb body into the wall toward the bulk portion of the honeycomb body. The surface portion may extend from 0 (zero) to a depth of about 10 &#x3bc;m into the base wall portion of the wall of the honeycomb body. In some embodiments, the surface portion may extend about 5 &#x3bc;m, about 7 &#x3bc;m, or about 9 &#x3bc;m (i.e., a depth of 0 (zero)) into the base wall portion of the wall. The bulk portion of the honeycomb body constitutes the thickness of wall minus the surface portions. Thus, the bulk portion of the honeycomb body may be determined by the following equation:</p><p id="p-0055" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>t</i><sub>total</sub>&#x2212;2<i>t</i><sub>surface </sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0056" num="0000">where t<sub>total </sub>is the total thickness of the wall and t<sub>surface </sub>is the thickness of the wall surface.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">In one or more embodiments, the bulk of the honeycomb body has a bulk mean pore size from greater than or equal to 7 &#x3bc;m to less than or equal to 25 &#x3bc;m, such as from greater than or equal to 12 &#x3bc;m to less than or equal to 22 &#x3bc;m, or from greater than or equal to 12 &#x3bc;m to less than or equal to 18 &#x3bc;m. For example, in some embodiments, the bulk of the honeycomb body may have bulk mean pore sizes of about 10 &#x3bc;m, about 11 &#x3bc;m, about 12 &#x3bc;m, about 13 &#x3bc;m, about 14 &#x3bc;m, about 15 &#x3bc;m, about 16 &#x3bc;m, about 17 &#x3bc;m, about 18 &#x3bc;m, about 19 &#x3bc;m, or about 20 &#x3bc;m. Generally, pore sizes of any given material exist in a statistical distribution. Thus, the term &#x201c;median pore size&#x201d; or &#x201c;D<sub>50</sub>&#x201d; refers to which pore sizes of 50% of the pores lie and below and which the pore sizes of the remaining 50% of the pores lie, based on the statistical distribution of all the pores. Pores in ceramic bodies can be manufactured by at least one of: (1) inorganic batch material particle size and size distributions; (2) furnace/heat treatment firing time and temperature schedules; (3) furnace atmosphere (e.g., low or high oxygen and/or water content), as well as; (4) pore formers, such as, for example, polymers and polymer particles, starches, wood flour, hollow inorganic particles and/or graphite/carbon particles.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">In some embodiments, the bulk of the honeycomb body may have bulk porosities, not counting a coating, of from greater than or equal to 50% to less than or equal to 70% as measured by mercury intrusion porosimetry. A method for measuring surface porosity includes scanning electron microscopy (SEM), this method in particular is valuable for measuring surface porosity and bulk porosity independent from one another. In one or more embodiments, the bulk porosity of the honeycomb body may be less than 70%, less than 65%, 60%, less than 58%, less than 56%, less than 54%, or less than 52%, for example.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">In one or more embodiments, the surface portion of the honeycomb body has a surface median pore size from greater than or equal to 7 &#x3bc;m to less than or equal to 20 &#x3bc;m, such as from greater than or equal to 8 &#x3bc;m to less than or equal to 15 &#x3bc;m, or from greater than or equal to 10 &#x3bc;m to less than or equal to 14 &#x3bc;m. For example, in some embodiments, the surface of the honeycomb body may have surface median pore sizes of about 8 &#x3bc;m, about 9 &#x3bc;m, about 10 &#x3bc;m, about 11 &#x3bc;m, about 12 &#x3bc;m, about 13 &#x3bc;m, about 14 &#x3bc;m, or about 15 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">In some embodiments, the surface of the honeycomb body may have surface porosities, prior to application of a layer, of from greater than or equal to 35% to less than or equal to 50% as measured SEM.

Accordingly, the median pore size, porosity, geometry and other design aspects of both the bulk and the surface of the honeycomb body are selected taking into account these filtration requirements of the honeycomb body. As an example, and as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a wall <b>210</b> of the honeycomb body <b>200</b> has layer <b>220</b> disposed thereon, preferably sintered or otherwise bonded by heat treatment. The layer <b>220</b> may comprise particles <b>225</b> that are deposited on the wall <b>210</b> of the honeycomb body <b>200</b> and help prevent particulate matter from exiting the honeycomb body along with the gas stream <b>230</b>, such as, for example, soot and ash, and to help prevent the particulate matter from clogging the base wall portion of the walls <b>210</b> of the honeycomb body <b>200</b>. In this way, and according to embodiments, the layer <b>220</b> can serve as the primary filtration component while the base wall portion of the honeycomb body can be configured to otherwise minimize pressure drop for example as compared to conventional honeycomb bodies without such layer. Pressure drop, as used herein, is measured using a differential pressure sensor to measure the drop in pressure across the axial length of the filter. Because pore size of the layer <b>220</b> is smaller than that of the base wall portion, the layer will filter most of the smaller-sized particulate matter, but it is expected that the base wall portion of the walls of the honeycomb body filter is effective to filter some of the larger-sized particulate matter. As will be described in further detail herein, the honeycomb body may be formed by a suitable method&#x2014;such as, for example, a flame deposition method&#x2014;that allows for a thin, highly porous layer to be formed on at least some surfaces of the walls of the honeycomb body.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063">In one or more embodiments, the porosity of the layer disposed on the walls of the honeycomb body, as measured by SEM, is greater than or equal to 80%, such as greater than 90%.

In still other embodiments, the porosity of the layer disposed on the walls of the honeycomb body is greater than or equal to 95%, such as greater than or equal to 96%, or greater than or equal to 97%.

The high porosity of the layer on the walls of the honeycomb body allows for the layer to be applied to a honeycomb body without significantly affecting the pressure drop of the honeycomb body compared to the pressure drop of an identical honeycomb body that does not comprise a layer thereon. SEM and X-ray tomography are useful for measuring surface and bulk porosity independently of one another. Obtaining porosity by density calculation includes: measuring weight of the inorganic layer and its thickness to obtain a layer density and calculating porosity of the layer according to the equation: layer porosity=1&#x2014;layer density/inorganic material density. As an example, for a layer comprising mullite, the &#x201c;inorganic material density&#x201d; is the density of mullite.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">As mentioned above, the layer on walls of the honeycomb body is very thin compared to thickness of the base wall portion of the walls of the honeycomb body, and the layer also has very high porosity and permeability.

A schematic for a generic laboratory setup is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>. The generic laboratory setup comprises a gas supply, e.g. air, adjusted to a define flow rate, a particulate generator, for example one that generates soot particles at a certain rate and concentration, a filter sample to be tested, and two particulate analyzers at the inlet and the outlet of the filter samples.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0091">The experiment is performed at controlled temperature, for example, room temperature. As used herein, &#x201c;room temperature&#x201d; refers to a temperature of 20&#xb0; C.&#x2014;. During the experiment, the gas flow is adjusted to a constant flow rate. Then particulates are added to the gas. Across the filter sample, a certain portion of the particulates are removed by filtration, which is measured as difference between the inlet and the outlet particle concentration. An example of such an experiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, for two experimental samples A and B made in accordance with the embodiments described herein plotted against a conventional sample (Comparative). In the example shown, the particles were soot particles generated on a soot generator and the volumetric flow rate was 21 m<sup>3</sup>/h. The testing was conducted at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Plotted is the filtration efficiency calculated from the inlet and outlet concentration according to eqn.

The reason for this is that the accumulated particles themselves, soot in this case, act as a filtration medium, enhancing the overall efficiency. To illustrate this more effectively it is helpful to plot the filtration as function of the accumulated soot mass instead of the time. The soot mass is obtained as the difference between the soot entering the filter and the soot mass leaving the filter integrated over time.

In the example shown, the particles were soot particles generated on a soot generator and the volumetric flow rate was 21 m<sup>3</sup>/h at normal conditions.

The reason for this is that the accumulated particles themselves, soot in this case, act as a filtration medium, enhancing the overall efficiency. To illustrate this more effectively it is helpful to plot the filtration as function of the accumulated soot mass instead of the time. The soot mass is obtained as the difference between the soot entering the filter and the soot mass leaving the filter integrated over time.

Based on filtration theory the filtration process occurs based on different mechanism, primarily depending on the size of the particles. A common model to describe filtration media is the concept of an assembly of unit collectors. For the soot generated by the soot generator of the experiments described above, the dominating filtration mechanism is that based on Brownian motion of the small soot particles. The collection efficiency of a unit collector based on the Brownian motion mechanism &#x3b7;<sub>BM </sub>can be described by Eqn. (2).

For materials for which the effective porosity and median pore size are not known, this new parameter can be used to characterize the effective properties of the microstructure. This variable also allows consideration of in real microstructures, that the filtration does not necessarily occur along the entire length of the pore across the filter wall, but rather to a larger extent locally at locations where favorable conditions exist for the collection and deposition of particles, e.g. passages with a narrow opening (&#x201c;pore neck&#x201d;). As soon as some particles are collected they further narrow this pore neck, accelerating the filtration process further. Thus, the new parameter allows for consideration of microstructures which are non-homogeneous and do not have a random pore design.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0123">Analogous to what has been done for pressure drop, it is also useful to consider not only the new microstructure parameter EMF, but also normalize it for the properties of the base microstructure of the base wall portions of the as extruded filter body with random microstructure. For the latter the EMF is obtained as ratio of porosity &#x3b5;<sup>0.43 </sup>divided by the median pore size D<sub>50 </sub>to the power of 5/3.

Ceramic precursors of synthetic mullite were: aluminium chloride (AlCl<sub>3</sub>) in solid form, and silicon tetrachloride (SiCl<sub>4</sub>) in liquid form. Nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) was used as a carrier gas for AlCl<sub>3 </sub>at 2.0 L/minute and for SiCl<sub>4 </sub>at 0.3 L/minute. The solid AlCl<sub>3 </sub>and its carrier gas passed through a heated sublimator (165&#xb0; C.) to form gaseous AlCl<sub>3</sub>. The liquid SiCl<sub>4 </sub>and its carrier gas passed through a heated bubbler (35&#xb0; C.) to form gaseous SiCl<sub>4</sub>. The targeted Al/Si mass ratio was in the range of 2.9 to 3.8. All of the heated vessels and pipes were monitored by T-type thermocouples and insulated. T-type thermocouples are accurate with high sensitivity within temperature range &#x2212;270 to 400&#xb0; C. All the gas flow was managed by the calibrated mass flow controllers (MFCs) for flow precision. Process control of Al/Si mass ratio in the range of 2.9 to 3.8 A was achieved along with a stable yield of mullite composition during a long term operation (14-21.5 hours).</p><p id="p-0357" num="0354">A layer precursor comprising the gaseous AlCl<sub>3 </sub>and SiCl<sub>4</sub>, which were entrained in heated nitrogen, was transported into a burner. The burner had four functional gas lines inside. A methane/oxygen premixed flame with an optimal ratio of 1.25 provided a reaction zone for combustion of the layer precursor. An inner-shield O<sub>2 </sub>gas (190&#xb0; C. and 2.0 L/minute) was used to lift the combustion area and force as-formed particles away from the flame to keep the reaction zone clean. Supplementary O<sub>2 </sub>gas (1.5 L/minute) provided excess oxygen to complete combustion reactions and assisted to stabilize the flame. As needed, additional O<sub>2 </sub>gas (up to 8 L/minute) may be supplied. A central tube allowed the layer precursor to pass through and get into the flame to generate particles. Four different channels could cooperate with each other to control the flame with great flexibility. Typically, all components of the ceramic precursor vaporization equipment (e.g., vessels and pipes) and of the burner were insulated and preheated to above 120&#xb0; C.-190&#xb0; C. to avoid vapor condensation and channel block. Through control of heating temperature and carrier gas flow rate, the composition of the final product was controlled. The burner may operate in a range of about 175&#xb0; C. to 190&#xb0; C. to assist with avoiding condensation in the central tube and/or seal damage due to overheating.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0355">In the burner, the layer precursor was exposed to a flame formed by a mixture of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) (5.0 L/minute) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) (4.0 L/minute), which provided a high temperature reaction zone and moisture ambience owing to the CH<sub>4 </sub>combustion. Once the layer precursor contacted with H<sub>2</sub>O in the flame, the chlorides hydrolyzed and oxides particles formed to result in a decomposed layer precursor. The intense collision between the primary particles resulted in coagulation and coalescence under the high temperature. A portion of them grew into big particles, a large number of them were partially sintered together to form aggregates, and the rest particles became agglomerates relying on physical bonds. All the particle and particle groups escaped from the flame within several milliseconds because of the steep temperature gradient and high gas flow velocity of the flame. It is noted that the product morphology, especially the particle size, could be adjusted by the presence of another heated N<sub>2 </sub>gas to further dilute the ceramic precursor vapors before entering the flame.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0356">As-formed particles of the decomposed layer precursor were deposited on a stainless steel mesh (316 L, 2000 DPSI) and a ceramic coupon (cut off from a GPF honeycomb) placed on a cylinder mounted above the flame. For filtration efficiency and pressure drop analysis, as-formed particles were deposited on full-size ceramic honeycombs ((GC 4.055&#x2033;-200/8) in a wind tunnel, which was employed to enhance the deposition uniformity and collection efficiency. All the deposition processes were aided by use of a vacuum pump.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0357">Once the particles of the decomposed layer precursor were deposited onto a structure (e.g., stainless steel mesh, ceramic coupon, or full-size ceramic honeycomb) was completed, the structure was sintered in an oven set at 1150&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes. Upon sintering, a crystalline phase ceramic layer was formed.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0358"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B</figref> are scanning electron microscope images at differing magnifications of an amorphous phase decomposed layer precursor deposited on a honeycomb body.
