The headphone <b>1</b> includes a housing <b>10</b> with a first aperture <b>38</b>, a first driver unit <b>12</b> installed in the housing <b>10</b>, a partition wall <b>22</b> to divide an internal space of the housing <b>10</b> into a first space <b>30</b> and a second space <b>32</b>, where first space <b>30</b> has the first driver unit <b>12</b> installed therein and is connected to an external space through the first aperture <b>38</b>, and a second driver unit <b>26</b> attached to the partition wall <b>22</b>. The first driver unit <b>12</b> and the second driver unit <b>26</b> have a first diaphragm <b>14</b> and a second diaphragm <b>28</b>, respectively, that are asymmetric in shape, in a vibration direction, such as a dome shape convex on a front side or an almost circular trapezoidal shape (cone shape).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an overall view of the headphone. The headphone <b>1</b> is wired to or wirelessly connected to an unillustrated audio device (e.g., music player, sound mixer, smartphone). The headphone <b>1</b> has a headband <b>2</b> and a pair of housings <b>10</b>. The headphone <b>1</b> may have a noise cancelling function. An earphone shall be a kind of the headphone <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plan view of the housing <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a III-III cross-sectional perspective view of the housing <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The first driver unit <b>12</b> is attached to the housing <b>10</b>. The first driver unit <b>12</b> is configured to reproduce sound from electrical signals of original sound such as music. If it is a dynamic type, the sound is reproduced by passing an electric current through a coil based on the electric signals and vibrating the first diaphragm <b>14</b> by magnetic force. The first diaphragm <b>14</b> has a dome shape that is convex on a front side. In other words, a portion that is convex on a front surface is concave on a rear surface. Due to this asymmetry of the shape in the vibration direction, the sound reproduced by the first driver unit <b>12</b> have distortion (secondary distortion).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The housing <b>10</b> has a first opening <b>18</b> in an output surface <b>16</b> to be opposed to a user's ear. The first diaphragm <b>14</b> of the first driver unit <b>12</b> is attached to the output surface <b>16</b> to block the first opening <b>18</b>. An ear cup <b>20</b> is attached to the output surface <b>16</b>, surrounding the first opening <b>18</b> and the first driver unit <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A partition wall <b>22</b> is attached to the housing <b>10</b>. The partition wall <b>22</b> has a second opening <b>24</b>. A second diaphragm <b>28</b> of the second driver unit <b>26</b> is attached to the partition wall <b>22</b> to block the second opening <b>24</b>. The second driver unit <b>26</b> has the same structure (e.g., dynamic type) as the first driver unit <b>12</b>. The second diaphragm <b>28</b> has a dome shape that is convex on a front side.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The partition wall <b>22</b> divides an internal space of the housing <b>10</b> into the first space <b>30</b>, where the first driver unit <b>12</b> is installed, and the second space <b>32</b>. The first driver unit <b>12</b> faces the first space <b>30</b> and the external space. The first diaphragm <b>14</b> has a rear surface facing the first space <b>30</b>. The second driver unit <b>26</b> faces both the first space <b>30</b> and the second space <b>32</b>. The second diaphragm <b>28</b> has a rear surface facing the first space <b>30</b>. The first driver unit <b>12</b> and the second driver unit <b>26</b> are opposed to each other.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The first space <b>30</b> is a closed space since the first opening <b>18</b> and the second opening <b>24</b> are blocked by the first diaphragm <b>14</b> and the second diaphragm <b>28</b>, respectively. The first space <b>30</b> is behind the first diaphragm <b>14</b>, whereby sound quality of the first driver unit <b>12</b> is determined by an impact of air pressure in the first space <b>30</b> on the vibration of the first diaphragm <b>20</b>. On the other hand, the first space <b>30</b> is behind the second diaphragm <b>28</b>, whereby volume (capacity) of the first space increases or decreases due to vibration of the second diaphragm <b>28</b>, and air pressure in the first space <b>30</b> changes. An electrical board <b>34</b> is located in the housing <b>10</b>. The acoustic adjustment circuit <b>36</b> for driving the second driver unit <b>26</b> is included in the electrical board <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a circuit diagram of the acoustic adjustment circuit <b>36</b>. The first driver unit <b>12</b> is configured to have a first signal S<b>1</b> input thereto. The acoustic adjustment circuit <b>36</b> is configured to generate a second signal S<b>2</b> based on the first signal S<b>1</b>. The second driver unit <b>26</b> is configured to have the second signal S<b>2</b> input thereto. The second driver unit <b>26</b> enables change of the air pressure in the first space <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, the acoustic adjustment circuit <b>36</b> is configured to generate the second signal S<b>2</b> in an opposite phase to the first signal S<b>1</b> in a first band arbitrarily configurable. The reason for the opposite phase is that the first diaphragm <b>14</b> and the second diaphragm <b>28</b> have respective front surfaces opposite to each other (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). The first band may be a partial frequency band or an entire frequency band. By setting the second signal S<b>2</b> to the opposite phase to the first signal S<b>1</b> in the first band, the first diaphragm <b>14</b> and the second diaphragm <b>28</b> vibrate in the same direction with the same timing, whereby volume of the closed space (first space <b>30</b>) changes little. This mitigates an effect of an air spring and increases sound pressure sensitivity in a low frequency range. In addition, the distortion (secondary distortion) caused by the asymmetry of the diaphragm shapes in the vibration direction is reduced.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the housing <b>10</b> has the first aperture <b>38</b>. A surface with the first aperture <b>38</b> is different from a surface (output surface <b>16</b>) with the first driver unit <b>12</b>. The first space <b>30</b> is connected to the external space through the first aperture <b>38</b>, but the second space <b>32</b> is not connected to the external space. In detail, the partition wall <b>22</b> has an opening <b>40</b>, and both ends of a pipe <b>42</b> are connected to the opening <b>40</b> and the first aperture <b>38</b>, respectively. In the first space <b>30</b>, air vibration occurs near the opening <b>40</b> to excite Helmholtz resonance. This causes the first diaphragm <b>14</b> to vibrate very little in the resonant frequency range, and acoustic radiation on the front surface of the first diaphragm <b>14</b> is drastically reduced, resulting in a dip in frequency characteristics.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, by creating the dip in the frequency characteristics in a band from 300 Hz to 1000 Hz (midrange), it is possible to reduce the sound pressure in the midrange and relatively increase the sound pressure in the low and high ranges to form a sound with a good sense of separation. In a band lower than the resonance frequency, the second driver unit <b>26</b> (second diaphragm <b>28</b>) can vibrate the air in the first space <b>30</b> in the same phase as the first diaphragm <b>14</b>. Therefore, the effect of the air spring behind the first diaphragm <b>14</b> can be eliminated as much as possible, and as a result, the sound pressure level in the low frequency range can be increased.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">This embodiment can reproduce a high-quality sound with a good sense of separation between low and high frequencies, while ensuring low sound pressure compared to a conventional structure with the same chassis size.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic view of a structure in Comparative Example 1.
