As semiconductor technology advances, the market demands increasing smaller chips with increasingly more structures per unit area. One class of devices which has seen many advances in miniaturization are memory devices. As the demand for higher density increases, the typical approach in 3D NAND devices has been to stack more layers. Yet additional layers result in thicker stacks which are increasingly difficult to etch due to increasing aspect ratios.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, titanium nitride (TiN) is used as a liner in 3D NAND devices. In order to maintain F-barrier performance, however, the titanium nitride liner needs to be at least 25 &#x212b; in thickness. Such a thick liner reduces the space available for tungsten fill as memory structures become more dense and complex, adversely affecting the stack resistivity.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is a need for reducing stack resistivity while providing good barrier performance.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the disclosure are directed to a memory structure comprising: a plurality of alternating layers of a silicon material and a metal gate, the metal gate comprising a conformal barrier layer, a conformal &#x3b1;-tungsten (W) layer, and a bulk tungsten layer; and a memory hole channel formed through the plurality of alternating layers and having a conformal layer of a poly-silicon material deposited on a first surface, a second surface, a third surface of the memory hole channel.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the disclosure are directed to a method of forming a memory structure.

The disclosure is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the terms &#x201c;precursor&#x201d;, &#x201c;reactant&#x201d;, &#x201c;reactive gas&#x201d; and the like are used interchangeably to refer to any gaseous species that can react with the substrate surface.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; as used herein, refers to any substrate or material surface formed on a substrate upon which film processing is performed during a fabrication process. For example, a substrate surface on which processing can be performed include materials such as silicon, silicon oxide, strained silicon, silicon on insulator (SOI), carbon doped silicon oxides, amorphous silicon, doped silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, glass, sapphire, and any other materials such as metals, metal nitrides, metal alloys, and other conductive materials, depending on the application. Substrates include, without limitation, semiconductor wafers. Substrates may be exposed to a pretreatment process to polish, etch, reduce, oxidize, hydroxylate, anneal and/or bake the substrate surface. In addition to film processing directly on the surface of the substrate itself, in the present disclosure, any of the film processing steps disclosed may also be performed on an under-layer formed on the substrate as disclosed in more detail below, and the term &#x201c;substrate surface&#x201d; is intended to include such under-layer as the context indicates.

As used herein, &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; refers to the plane which extends from close to the substrate to a point or plane distant from the substrate. As illustrated in the attached figures, the vertical plane runs from the top of the 3D NAND device (top of the page) to the substrate (bottom of the page).

The term &#x201c;over&#x201d; used in this regard does not imply a physical orientation of one surface on top of another surface, rather a relationship of the thermodynamic or kinetic properties of the chemical reaction with one surface relative to the other surface. For example, selectively depositing a cobalt film onto a copper surface over a dielectric surface means that the cobalt film deposits on the copper surface and less or no cobalt film deposits on the dielectric surface; or that the formation of the cobalt film on the copper surface is thermodynamically or kinetically favorable relative to the formation of a cobalt film on the dielectric surface.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to the Figures, some embodiments of the disclosure relate to methods for forming memory structures or memory devices, for example 3D NAND devices. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a process flow diagram of a method of manufacturing a memory device according to one or more embodiments.

The substrate, or portion of the substrate, is exposed separately to the two or more reactive compounds which are introduced into a reaction zone of a processing chamber. In a time-domain ALD process, exposure to each reactive compound is separated by a time delay to allow each compound to adhere and/or react on the substrate surface and then be purged from the processing chamber. These reactive compounds are said to be exposed to the substrate sequentially. In a spatial ALD process, different portions of the substrate surface, or material on the substrate surface, are exposed simultaneously to the two or more reactive compounds so that any given point on the substrate is substantially not exposed to more than one reactive compound simultaneously.

Next, a second precursor or compound B (e.g. oxidant) is pulsed into the reaction zone followed by a second delay. During each time delay, a purge gas, such as argon, is introduced into the processing chamber to purge the reaction zone or otherwise remove any residual reactive compound or reaction by-products from the reaction zone. Alternatively, the purge gas may flow continuously throughout the deposition process so that only the purge gas flows during the time delay between pulses of reactive compounds. The reactive compounds are alternatively pulsed until a desired film or film thickness is formed on the substrate surface. In either scenario, the ALD process of pulsing compound A, purge gas, compound B and purge gas is a cycle. A cycle can start with either compound A or compound B and continue the respective order of the cycle until achieving a film with the predetermined thickness.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an embodiment of a spatial ALD process, a first reactive gas and second reactive gas (e.g., nitrogen gas) are delivered simultaneously to the reaction zone but are separated by an inert gas curtain and/or a vacuum curtain.

The TiXN or TaXN barrier layer/liners are deposited at about 450&#xb0; C. to about 500&#xb0; C., with thicknesses ranging from about 6 &#x212b; to about 15 &#x212b;. An &#x3b1;-tungsten (W) layer is then deposited at about 500&#xb0; C., followed by deposition of bulk tungsten (W) at thicknesses of about 100 &#x212b; to about 300 &#x212b; at temperatures of about 400&#xb0; C. to about 500&#xb0; C. Without intending to be bound by theory, films of TiXN or TaXN cause at least a 15% reduction in stack resistivity compared to a liner comprising TiN. Films of TiSiN reduce the amount of F penetration from the bulk W to the substrate by 10 times compared to a liner of TiN. Additionally, the thinner barrier layer of TiXN or TaXN, when compared to the standard TiN or TaN liner, leads to greater tungsten (W) fill for VNAND memory structures, which can result in a reduction in overall resistivity for VNAND applications.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, as understood by one of skill in the art, any overburden created depositing the high-&#x3ba; layer <b>119</b>, depositing the barrier layer <b>120</b>, depositing the &#x3b1;-tungsten layer <b>122</b>, and by filling the opening <b>117</b> with the metal material <b>124</b> may optionally then be removed to form a gate <b>126</b>.
