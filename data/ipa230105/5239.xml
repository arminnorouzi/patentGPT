After an IR cut-off filter layer is added to pixel units of three colors: red, green, and blue, an IR component may be filtered out from a light sensing result that is obtained by light sensing of visible light pixels (including the R pixel, the G pixel, and the B pixel).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the foregoing method, although IR signals in visible light pixels are filtered out, crosstalk of infrared light in an adjacent IR pixel still interferes with the visible light pixels, affecting a signal-to-noise ratio of the visible light pixels.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This application provides an image sensor and an image light sensing method, to reduce light crosstalk caused by a small pixel to a large pixel and improve a signal-to-noise ratio of the large pixel when color information is sufficient.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect, this application provides an image sensor. The image sensor includes a red pixel, a green pixel, a blue pixel, and an invisible light pixel. The red pixel, the green pixel, and the blue pixel are large pixels, the invisible light pixel is a small pixel, and a light sensing area of the large pixel is greater than that of the small pixel. The red pixel, the green pixel, and the blue pixel are arranged in a Bayer format.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The image sensor provided in this application uses a pixel array including the large pixel and the small pixel. The large pixel is in a Bayer RGB CFA format that is consistent with a conventional RGB sensor, and the light sensing area of the large pixel is greater than that of the small pixel, so that color information obtained based on the large pixel may not be reduced, resolution of a visible light image may not be decreased, and an existing Demosaic algorithm may be directly reused and seamlessly embedded into an existing image signal processor (Image Signal Processor, ISP). In addition, the light sensing area of the large pixel is greater than that of the small pixel. Correspondingly, light sensitivity of the large pixel is greater than that of the small pixel. Therefore, a light pixel may be designed as the large pixel, this improves imaging quality of visible light, to obtain more accurate color information. In addition, an area of the small pixel (the invisible light pixel) that is adjacent to the large pixel (a visible light pixel) is small. This greatly reduces a contact range between the invisible light pixel and the visible light pixel, reduces light crosstalk that is caused by the invisible light pixel to the visible light pixel, and reduces interference that is caused by a light sensing result of the invisible light pixel to color information obtained by the visible light pixel. Therefore, a signal-to-noise ratio of color information of the visible light image is further improved. Further, when an infrared pixel or a white pixel is designed as the small pixel, obtaining of detail information may not be affected, and when the invisible light pixel is the infrared pixel, infrared light may be supplemented in an infrared night vision scenario. Therefore, when the infrared pixel is designed as the small pixel, an infrared imaging result may not be affected, and when the invisible light pixel is the white pixel, a spectral response curve of a white light pixel is wide and a light sensing capability is strong. Therefore, when the white pixel is designed as the small pixel, an imaging result of the white light may not be affected. In this application, color information of an image may be obtained based on the visible light pixel, detail information of the image may be obtained based on the invisible light pixel, and the color information is fused with the detail information to obtain a final image. According to the image sensor provided in this application, more accurate color information may be obtained based on the large pixel, detail information that is obtained based on the small pixel may not be affected, so that details and color performance of the fused image are greatly improved. In addition, the visible light pixel is in a Bayer RGB CFA format that is consistent with the conventional RGB sensor. Therefore, the visible light image is a full-resolution image, and an invisible light pixel that is used as an IR pixel or a W pixel may be placed between a pixel row and a pixel column of the visible light pixel, to form a pixel array in which four visible light pixels surround one invisible light pixel and four invisible light pixels surround one visible light pixel. Therefore, the obtained invisible light image is also a full-resolution image, and design of the large pixel and the small pixel does not affect the color information of the visible light image and details of the invisible light image.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a possible implementation, the invisible light pixel includes an infrared pixel or a white pixel; the white pixel is used to sense white light; and the white light includes red light, green light, blue light, and infrared light.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a possible implementation, four large pixels surround the one small pixel, and four small pixels surround the one large pixel.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a possible implementation, areas of the large pixel and the small pixel are set based on crosstalk precision of the image sensor.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Generally, a distance between center points of adjacent pixels in the pixel array is fixed, and the distance depends on a size, a process, and the like of the image sensor. On this basis, the areas of the large pixel and the small pixel may be set based on the crosstalk precision of the image sensor. To reduce crosstalk, it is expected that a ratio of the area of the large pixel to that of the small pixel is as large as possible. To improve the light sensitivity, a larger area of the large pixel indicates obtained more accurate color information of the image, and a larger area of the small pixel indicates obtained more detail information of the image. Therefore, although maximum areas of the large pixel and the small pixel are limited, it is still expected that the areas of the large pixel and the small pixel are as large as possible. Further, the areas of the large pixel and the small pixel may be preset to achieve a balance between factors such as precision of the image sensor, a requirement of illuminance, and luminous intensity of an infrared illuminator. Optionally, setting the areas of the large pixel and the small pixel may alternatively be setting a spacing between adjacent sides of the large pixel and the small pixel. If the areas of the large pixel and the small pixel are large, the spacing between the adjacent sides is small. Because the foregoing factors are considered when the areas of the large pixel and the small pixel or the spacing between the adjacent sides of the large pixel and the small pixel is set, based on the large pixel and the small pixel that are set, not only color information with high resolution may be obtained, but also sufficient detail information may be supplemented. This improves imaging quality of a final image obtained by the image sensor.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a possible implementation, the large pixel and the small pixel are regular polygons or circles.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a possible implementation, the red pixel, the green pixel, and the blue pixel correspond to an infrared cut-off filter layer. The infrared cut-off filter layer is used to cut off an optical signal whose wavelength is greater than a first preset wavelength, and the optical signal whose wavelength is greater than the first preset wavelength includes the infrared light.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the image sensor provided in this application, the infrared cut-off filter layer is coated on a microlens corresponding to the R pixel, the G pixel, and the B pixel, to cut off the infrared light from reaching the R pixel, the G pixel, and the B pixel, and remove an IR signal from a light sensing result of the visible light pixel. Therefore, a color in the light sensing result is more accurate, and this improves light sensing effect of the sensor. Further, in this application, the infrared cut-off filter layer may be coated on the microlens by using a coating technology. Therefore, a complex mechanical structure does not need to be added. In addition, a structure of a pixel under the microlens is not changed. A comparatively simple and stable internal structure of the pixel helps control a problem, such as a chief ray angle (Chief Ray Angle, CRA), that affects imaging, thereby improving the light sensing effect of the image sensor while maintaining a stable structure of the pixel.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a possible implementation, the first preset wavelength is 650 nm. In this case, the infrared cut-off filter cuts off all light rays whose wavelengths fall outside a visible light range, to ensure that all infrared light falling inside the wavelength range cannot enter the red pixel, the green pixel, and the blue pixel.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a possible implementation, the sensor further includes a light filter layer, where the light filter layer includes a red filter layer, a green filter layer, and a blue filter layer. Each red pixel corresponds to one red filter layer, and the red filter layer is used to allow red light and infrared light in a first wavelength range to pass through. Each green pixel corresponds to one green filter layer, and the green filter layer is used to allow green light and infrared light in a second wavelength range to pass through. Each blue pixel corresponds to one blue filter layer, and the blue filter layer is used to allow blue light and infrared light in a third wavelength range to pass through. Wavelengths of the infrared light in the first wavelength range, the infrared light in the second wavelength range, and the infrared light in the third wavelength range are greater than the first preset wavelength. When the invisible light pixel is the infrared pixel, the light filter layer further includes an infrared filter layer. Each infrared pixel corresponds to one infrared filter layer, and the infrared filter layer is used to allow infrared light in a specific wavelength range to pass through. When the invisible light pixel is the white pixel, the light filter layer further includes an all-pass filter layer or a dual-pass filter layer. Each white pixel corresponds to one all-pass filter layer or one dual-pass filter layer, the all-pass filter layer is used to allow light in a full band range to pass through, and the dual-pass filter layer is used to allow red light, green light, blue light, and the infrared light in the specific wavelength range to pass through.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a possible implementation, the infrared cut-off filter layer and/or the light filter layer are/is coated on a microlens of a corresponding pixel.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the image sensor provided in this application, the red filter layer and the infrared cut-off filter layer are coated on the R pixel to filter out an IR component in a light sensing result of the R pixel, so that the R pixel may sense only the red light. Correspondingly, the green filter layer and the infrared cut-off filter layer are coated on the G pixel, and the blue filter layer and the infrared cut-off filter layer are coated on the B pixel to filter out an IR component in a light sensing result of the G pixel and the B pixel, so that the G pixel may sense only the green light, and B pixel may sense only the blue light. The infrared filter layer is coated on the IR pixel, so that the IR pixel may sense only the infrared light. Alternatively, the all-pass filter layer or the dual-pass filter layer is coated on the W pixel, so that the W pixel may sense only the white light. Therefore, color accuracy of a light sensing result obtained by the image sensor is greatly improved.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It should be understood that the red filter layer is located above or below the infrared cut-off filter layer, the green filter layer is located above or below the infrared cut-off filter layer, and the blue filter layer is located above or below the infrared cut-off filter layer. In this application, a sequence of coating the infrared cut-off filter layer, and the red filter layer, the green filter layer, or the blue filter layer on the microlens is not limited.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the image sensor provided in this application, the red filter layer and the infrared cut-off filter layer are coated on the microlens of the red pixel, the green filter layer and the infrared cut-off filter layer are coated on the microlens of the green pixel, the blue filter layer and the infrared cut-off filter layer are coated on the microlens of the blue pixel, and the infrared filter layer is coated on the microlens of the infrared pixel. A coating position relationship between the infrared cut-off filter layer and the red filter layer, the green filter layer, or the blue filter layer on the microlens is not limited. The red filter layer, the green filter layer, and the blue filter layer may be separately coated on the infrared cut-off filter layer. Alternatively, the infrared cut-off filter layer may be coated on the red filter layer, the green filter layer, or the blue filter layer provided that a light ray first passes through the infrared cut-off filter layer and a light filter layer of any visible light component before reaching the microlens.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a possible implementation, the infrared cut-off filter layer is coated on the microlens, and the red filter layer, the green filter layer, and the blue filter layer are coated on inner sides of the microlenses or are respectively disposed inside the red pixel, the green pixel, and the blue pixel.

For example, when the infrared light is excessively strong and the visible light is excessively weak, the exposure time of the large pixel may be increased, and the exposure time of the small pixel may be reduced, so that imaging brightness of the visible light and the infrared light (the infrared light or the white light) tends to be balanced. This resolves a problem of exposure imbalance that easily occurs when the infrared light or the visible light is dominant, improves a dynamic range of light sensing of the image sensor, and meets user requirements on indicators such as a definition and a signal-to-noise ratio.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a possible implementation, the logic control circuit includes a first control line and a second control line. The large pixel is coupled to the first control line, and the small pixel is coupled to the second control line.

When a first effective transition edge of the first control signal arrives, the large pixel starts to be exposed. When a second effective transition edge of the second control signal arrives, the small pixel starts to be exposed. Arrival moments of the first effective transition edge and the second effective transition edge are set, to enable the exposure time of the large pixel and the small pixel to meet the preset ratio.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the image sensor provided in this application, the arrival moments of the effective transition edges of the respective control signals of the large pixel and the small pixel may be set, to enable the exposure time of the large pixel and the small pixel to meet the preset ratio. For example, when a ratio of the exposure time of the large pixel to the exposure time of the small pixel is 2:1, an exposure result has a higher definition and a higher signal-to-noise ratio. In this way, the control signal of the large pixel transits first, and the control signal of the small pixel transits later, and it is ensured that a time difference between transition time points of the two pixels enables exposure time of a visible light signal and an infrared light signal to meet the preset ratio. Therefore, the light sensing effect of the image sensor may be more precisely controlled by precisely setting the ratio of the exposure time of the large pixel to the exposure time of the small pixel. For example, the effective transition edge may be a falling edge of a high-level signal, a rising edge of a low-level signal, a rising edge of a high-level signal, or a falling edge of a low-level signal.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a possible implementation, the sensor further includes a light filter, configured to filter out ultraviolet light and infrared light whose wavelength is greater than a second preset wavelength, where the second preset wavelength is greater than the first preset wavelength and any wavelength that is in the specific wavelength range.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the image sensor provided in this application, the light filter may filter out far-infrared light with a comparatively long wavelength and ultraviolet light with a comparatively short wavelength in natural light rays, to prevent the far-infrared light and the ultraviolet light from affecting a light sensing characteristic of a photosensitive component.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a possible implementation, the image sensor further includes a charge readout module, and each pixel in the pixel array includes a photosensitive component.

When some scenarios have a comparatively high requirement on light sensing results of the R pixel and the G pixel, and expect to reduce light sensing results of the B pixel and the IR pixel, the exposure time of the four pixels may be flexibly controlled, to enhance light sensing effects of the R pixel and the G pixel and weaken light sensing effects of the B pixel and the IR pixel, so that a final light sensing result better meets the scenario requirements.

Therefore, the large pixel is more sensitive to obtain more accurate color information. Further, an area of the small pixel (the IR pixel) that is adjacent to the large pixel (the visible light pixel) is small, so that a contact range between the IR pixel and the visible light pixel is greatly reduced, light crosstalk caused by the IR pixel to the visible light pixel is reduced, interference that is caused by a light sensing result of the IR pixel to color information obtained by the visible light pixel is reduced, and therefore, a signal-to-noise ratio of the color information of the visible light image is further improved.

However, at an edge position of the pixel array, if the large pixel is located on the outermost side, the four small pixels surrounding one large pixel may not be implemented at the position of the large pixel, and if the small pixel is located on the outermost side, the four large pixels surrounding one small pixel may not be implemented at the position of the small pixel. Settings of four pixels surrounding another pixel are not specifically limited in this application.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In this application, color information of an image may be obtained based on the visible light pixel, detail information of the image may be obtained based on the invisible light pixel, and a visible light image that is obtained by the visible light pixel is fused with an invisible light image that is obtained by the invisible light pixel to obtain a final image. In addition, the visible light pixel is in a Bayer RGB CFA format that is consistent with the conventional RGB sensor. Therefore, the visible light image is a full-resolution image, and an invisible light pixel that is used as the IR pixel or the W pixel may be placed between a pixel row and a pixel column of the visible light pixel, to form a pixel array in which four visible light pixels surround one invisible light pixel and four invisible light pixels surround one visible light pixel. Therefore, the obtained invisible light image is also a full-resolution image, and design of the large pixel and the small pixel does not affect the color information of the visible light image and details of the invisible light image.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Generally, a distance between center points of adjacent pixels in the pixel array is fixed, and the distance depends on a size, a process, and the like of an image sensor. On this basis, the areas of the large pixel and the small pixel may be set based on the crosstalk precision of the image sensor. To reduce crosstalk, it is expected that a ratio of the area of the large pixel to that of the small pixel is as large as possible. To improve the light sensitivity, a larger area of the large pixel indicates obtained more accurate color information of the image, and a larger area of the small pixel indicates obtained more detail information of the image. Therefore, although maximum areas of the large pixel and the small pixel are limited, it is still expected that the areas of the large pixel and the small pixel are as large as possible. Further, the areas of the large pixel and the small pixel may be preset to achieve a balance between factors such as precision of the image sensor, a requirement of illuminance, and luminous intensity of an infrared illuminator. Optionally, setting the areas of the large pixel and the small pixel may alternatively be setting a spacing between adjacent sides of the large pixel and the small pixel.

Therefore, a color in the light sensing result is more accurate, and this improves light sensing effect of the sensor. Further, in this application, the infrared cut-off filter layer may be coated on the microlens by using a coating technology. Therefore, a complex mechanical structure does not need to be added. In addition, a structure of a pixel under the microlens is not changed, and the pixel under the microlens has only a photosensitive component such as a photodiode. A comparatively simple and stable internal structure of the pixel helps control a problem, such as a chief ray angle (Chief Ray Angle, CRA), that affects imaging, and the filter layer is coated on the microlens, thereby improving the light sensing effect of the sensor while maintaining a stable structure of the pixel.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">An internal structure of a pixel is not a smooth inner wall, and there are some protrusions on the inner wall of the pixel. If an incident angle of a light ray deviates from a main optical path of the microlens, some light rays are blocked by the protrusions on the inner wall of the pixel, and the light sensing effect of the sensor deteriorates. A CRA of a pixel located in an optical center (optical center) of the sensor is 0 degrees, and a CRA angle of a pixel that is farther away from the optical center is larger. Generally, if a deviation distance between a pixel and a picture center is used as a horizontal coordinate and a CRA angle of the pixel is used as a vertical coordinate, a function between the deviation distance from the pixel to the center and the CRA angle of the pixel is a linear function. This rule is referred to as CRA performance consistency. To enable the sensor to comply with the rule of the CRA performance consistency, a position of a microlens of a pixel needs to be fine-tuned based on a position of the pixel. For example, a microlens of a pixel located in an optical center is located right above the pixel, and a microlens of a pixel that deviates from the optical center is not located right above the pixel. A microlens of a pixel farther away from the optical center deviates to a larger extent. If the internal structure of the pixel under the microlens is comparatively complex, the CRA performance may be likely to be inconsistent. In this case, the method of fine-tuning a position of a microlens on a pixel surface may be no longer applicable. However, the filter layer added to the sensor provided in this application is coated on the microlens. This does not change the internal structure of the pixel, and an internal result of the pixel is simple and stable, thereby improving the light sensing effect of the sensor without affecting the CRA performance consistency of the sensor.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Each pixel in the image sensor includes a photosensitive component.

This resolves a problem of exposure imbalance that easily occurs when the infrared light or the visible light is dominant, improves a dynamic range of light sensing of the sensor, and meets user requirements on indicators such as a definition and a signal-to-noise ratio.
