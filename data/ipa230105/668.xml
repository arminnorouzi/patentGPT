Visceral fat is an accumulation of intra-abdominal adipose tissue. It is stored within the abdominal cavity and within and around important internal organs such as the intestine, liver, kidneys, heart, stomach, and pancreas. Visceral fat is sometimes known as &#x201c;deep&#x201d; fat, and is highly active metabolically. Thus, visceral fat is especially dangerous because it can negatively change the way the body operates.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A person carrying an excess amount of visceral fat is at increased risk of coronary heart disease, hypertension, cancer, stroke, dementia, insulin resistance and diabetes, depression, arthritis, obesity, sexual dysfunction and various sleep disorders.

In fact, visceral fat acts like its very own organ because it can have a very large impact on body function as it continuously produces hormones and inflammatory substances. Storing excess fat around the organs increases the production of pro-inflammatory chemicals/substances, while decreasing the levels of protective substances ultimately leading to systemic and tissue inflammation while at the same time, interferes with hormones that regulate appetite, weight, mood, brain function, and other factors. Accordingly, embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to methods, systems and devices that use non-ablative cold temperatures to treat visceral fat and thus reduce or remove its deleterious effect on a patient's health.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Accumulating evidence suggests a connection between changes in the mesenteric fat (termed &#x201c;creeping fat&#x201d;) and inflammatory intestinal diseases including irritable bowel disease (IBD), and Crohn's disease (CD) [Desreumaux P, et al. Inflammatory alterations in mesenteric adipose tissue in Crohn's disease. Gastroenterology 1999; 117:73-81. Schaffler A, et al. Creeping fat in Crohn's disease: traveling in a creeper lane of research? Gut 2005:742-743]. Anatomically, the mesenteric fat is connected with the intestinal serosa and muscularis propria and is continuous along the axis of most of the small and large bowel. Mesenteric fat wrapping (also termed &#x201c;creeping fat&#x201d;) around the circumference of the intestine is pathognomonic of CD [Coffey J C, et al. The mesentery: structure, function, and role in disease. Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol 2016; 1:238-247]. It sometimes covers more than 50% of the bowel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates human intestine <b>90</b> in a healthy state. A first portion <b>91</b> of the intestine <b>90</b> and a second portion <b>92</b> of the intestine <b>90</b> are held together by mesenterium <b>93</b>, The mesenterium <b>93</b> can also hold the first portion <b>91</b> and/or second portion <b>92</b> to the dorsal wall of the abdominal cavity (not shown). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates human intestine <b>90</b> in a disease state. In addition to the mesenterium <b>93</b> providing its connection, creeping fat <b>94</b> has covered much of the first portion <b>91</b> and second portion <b>92</b> of the intestine <b>90</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Recently, the mesenteric and creeping fat in Crohn's disease has been implicated in its pathogenesis. It contains not only fat cells and their precursors, but also immune cells and non-immune cells, such as endothelial cells and fibroblasts [Mao R, et al. The Mesenteric Fat and Intestinal Muscle interface: Creeping Fat Influencing Stricture Formation in Crohn's Disease. Inflamm Bowel Dis 2019; 25(3):421-426]. These cell types are activated and creeping fat is now known to be an active participant in inflammation and immunity. Furthermore, creeping fat is associated with muscularis propria hyperplasia and stricturing disease [Borley N R, et al. The relationship between inflammatory and serosal connective tissue changes in Heal Crohn's disease: evidence for a possible causative link. J Pathol 2000; 190:196-202]. Accumulating evidence suggests that modulation of mesenteric fat mass may influence disease. In a retrospective study increased visceral fat area was associated with attenuated mucosal healing after anti-TNT therapy in biologically na&#xef;ve Crohn's disease patients [Shen W, et al. Visceral Fat Is Associated With Mucosal Healing of Infliximab Treatment in Crohn's Disease. Dis Colon Rectum 2018; 61:706-712]. Visceral adiposity as measured by visceral adipose tissue volume may influence the natural history of disease as shown by an association of increased fat with an increased risk of penetrating disease and surgery in CD [Van Der Sloot K W, et al. Visceral Adiposity, Genetic Susceptibility, and Risk of Complications Among Individuals with Crohn's Disease, Inflamm Bowel Dis 2017; 23:82-88]. Mesenteric fat may influence the perioperative setting as well. Visceral adiposity on cross sectional imaging was found to be an independent risk factor for endoscopic recurrence in post-operative Crohn's disease. A causative effect of visceral fat and CD was shown by Coffey et al, who examined surgical recurrence rates after ileocolonic resection for Crohn's disease. In patients with more extensive excision of the mesentery compared to patients with conventional ileocolic resection with limited mesenteric resection, the cumulative reoperation rates were 2.9% and 40% respectively whereas advanced mesenteric disease predicted increased surgical recurrence [Coffey C J, et al. Inclusion of the Mesentery in Ileocolic Resection for Crohn's Disease is Associated With Reduced Surgical Recurrence. J Crohns Colitis 2018; 12:1139-1150].</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The present disclosure includes ways to deliver non ablative cold temperatures to the creeping fat as a mean to treat IBD/CD patients, where clinical indications for excessive creeping fat exist. By decreasing the amount of creeping fat we will: reduce the inflammation associated with this tissue in IBD/CD patients; initiate healing of inflamed and ulcerative intestine; prevent the progression and formation of intestinal stenosis (intestinal stricture) and reduce pain associated with Crohn's and IBD. These treatments also refer to patients having Diabetes Mellitus (Type II Diabetes) or who are diagnosed as pre-diabetes status with high levels of visceral/mesenteric fat. Alternatively, these treatments may reduce the risk of developing a chronic disease associated with excess visceral fat.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The scientific premise relies on the fact that fat cells are sensitive to cold temperatures than any other cell type, and fat cell apoptosis can already be detected at temperatures of 10&#xb0; C. and lower [Manstein D, et al. Selective cryolysis: a novel method of non-invasive fat removal. Lasers Surg Med. 2008 November; 40(9):595-604]. The mechanism that explains fat cells increased sensitivity to cold is that due to their high lipid content, fat cells solidify at a higher temperature compared to other cell types. The freezing temperature of fat is higher than that of water, thus, while other cell types tolerate decreased temperatures, fat solidify and form needle-like crystals in the cell membrane promoting cell death. Inflammation and recruitment of immune cells to the treated site provides additional explanation for increased fat cell loss after exposure to cold, even days after the initial cold insult.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Embodiments of system disclosed herein employ an open thermodynamic cycle using a cryogen that is a high-density fluid with a freezing temperature below the treatment temperature. The fluid need not be hazardous (toxic, explosive, etc.) and can take advantage of its high density to serve as an efficient thermal agent. The fluid may also have a relatively low viscosity such that it can flow through small channels and small diameter lumens within the treatment device without a significant pressure gradient and/or viscous heating. Several representative high-density fluids for use in embodiments of the present system are included in Table 1.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Freezing</entry><entry>Equilibrium</entry><entry/><entry>Viscosity (&#x3bc;)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Chemical</entry><entry>Temperature</entry><entry>Pressure at</entry><entry>Density</entry><entry>at &#x2212;25&#xb0; C.</entry></row><row><entry>Fluid</entry><entry>Formula</entry><entry>(Celsius)</entry><entry>25&#xb0; C.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the X-axis represents temperature (T) and the Y-axis represents pressure (P). Initially, the working fluid is maintained at ambient temperature (T<sub>A</sub>) and an elevated pressure (P<sub>IN</sub>), as indicated by the word &#x201c;START.&#x201d; Under these conditions, the fluid would be well within a high-density phase. Some examples of a fluid's high-density phase include a liquid phase and/or a supercritical phase, in which the fluid has the properties of both a liquid and a gas, and which typically occurs above the liquid's critical point (i.e., above the liquid's critical temperature and critical pressure).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">An embodiment of a cryotherapy system <b>10</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. A thermal fluid/cryogen <b>12</b> is held in a container <b>14</b> that is maintained at ambient temperature (T<sub>A</sub>) (See also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). A pressure generator <b>16</b> is configured to maintain the system <b>10</b> at a working pressure. The pressure generator <b>16</b> can comprise any device that is capable of creating/generating the required working pressure within the thermal fluid, and capable of maintaining the required pressure for generating the flow rates that are necessary for the system to function. Non-limiting examples of pressure generators are described herein. For example, the pressure generator can be a mechanical piston system that includes a piston head <b>20</b>, a connecting rod/means <b>22</b> and at least one compression ring/gasket <b>24</b>. The piston head <b>20</b> and connecting rod <b>22</b> can be driven by, for example, an electrical (stepper) motor (not shown). The pressures necessary to run the system can also be generated and maintained with the use of a closed volume system that contains the working fluid.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, this type of closed volume system <b>26</b> includes a container/tank <b>28</b> to hold the working fluid <b>30</b>, an external gas pressure source <b>32</b> and a pressure line <b>34</b> that connects the external gas pressure source <b>32</b> to the container/tank <b>28</b>. In this system, pressurizing the external gas pressure source <b>32</b> to a certain gas pressure (P<sub>G</sub>) also causes the working fluid <b>30</b> within the container/tank <b>28</b> to pressurize to the gas pressure (P<sub>G</sub>). As will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, other devices and means can be used to generate the required operating pressures of the system.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">Because the system has a dual function of freezing and thawing, a dual fluid flow is utilized. This is achieved with the use of a three-way valve <b>36</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In use, during a freezing cycle, the three-way valve <b>36</b> is actuated to a first position to direct working fluid flow along the cooling/freezing flow path <b>38</b>, and during a thawing cycle, the three-way valve <b>36</b> is actuated to a second position to direct working fluid flow along the warming/thawing flow path <b>40</b>. Thus, the three-way valve is used to control the freeze and thaw cycles of the system.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">In an alternative embodiment of this system, the three-way valve can be replaced with a proportional valve, or a combination of proportional valves that enable mixing of (a) cold (or chilled) and (b) hot/warm (or heated) thermal fluids in a chosen proportion, thus achieving any predetermined temperature for the fluid that is to be delivered to a treatment probe.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, both the cooling flow path <b>38</b> and the warming flow path <b>40</b> include heat exchangers <b>42</b> to thermally connect the working fluid to either a cooler <b>44</b> (cooling flow path <b>38</b>) or a heater <b>46</b> (warming flow path <b>40</b>). The cooler <b>44</b> can be any type of cooling device capable of achieving and maintaining the required cooling/freezing temperatures. Example coolers <b>44</b> include, and are not limited to: thermoelectric coolers (TEC); cryocoolers such as the Pulse Tube (PT), Stirling or Free Piston Stirling Cooler (FPSC), Gifford-McMahon cooler, etc.; Joule-Thomson effect based coolers that use a gas or liquid supply; evaporative coolers such as refrigerators; and an immersion cooler for use with a cryogenic liquid. Another example of a cooler that can be used is an evaporative cooler that relies on cold temperatures that are generated by expansion of the high-density thermal working fluid used in the present system as a result of the pressure drop in the check valve (discussed below). The heater <b>46</b> can be any type of a heating device capable of achieving and maintaining the required heating/thawing temperatures. Example heaters <b>46</b> include, and are not limited to: a resistive electrical heating element or a thermoelectric heater.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">Also included with the system <b>10</b> is a treatment instrument <b>48</b>, or cooling probe, for insertion into the body. The treatment instrument <b>48</b> may be configured to be inserted through a trocar for laparoscopic use and may have a cooling tip, which may comprise an expandable endpiece. The treatment instrument <b>48</b> connects to the system <b>10</b> through a three-port hermetic connector that connects the cold fluid supply line, warm fluid supply line, and a return fluid line from the system <b>10</b> to the treatment instrument <b>48</b>. In some embodiments, multiple cold fluid supply lines and/or multiple warm fluid supply lines and/or multiple return fluid lines may be used. The high-density thermal fluid is configured to rapidly cool and rapidly thaw. Thus, the probe <b>48</b> may be removed from the patient quickly and safely after use.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">Depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an embodiment of a treatment instrument <b>48</b>. The treatment instrument <b>48</b> includes a shaft <b>50</b> extending from its distal end <b>52</b>. The shaft <b>50</b> has a distal end <b>55</b> with a flow chamber <b>53</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) to allow inflowing working fluid to flow through the treatment instrument <b>48</b>. The proximal end <b>54</b> of the treatment instrument <b>48</b> includes a connecting portion <b>56</b> for thermally connecting to a supply line/hose <b>58</b> from the system <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the treatment instrument <b>48</b> connects to the system <b>10</b> with a supply line/hose <b>58</b> that is thermally insulated, having at least two insulated lumens to deliver the high density working/thermal fluid to the treatment instrument <b>48</b>. A first lumen can be configured to deliver the cooling fluid and a second lumen can be configured to deliver the warming fluid. A third lumen can be configured as a conduit for the return flow, whether it be the return of the cooling fluid or the return of the warming fluid. In some embodiments, the thermal insulation can comprise Aerogel. In other embodiments, it can comprise vacuum insulation. The shaft <b>50</b> can comprise a diameter of between about 0.25 mm and about 3 mm and may have a length of between about 1 cm and about 10 cm length.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the treatment instrument <b>48</b> can have a proximal section <b>60</b> of a larger diameter in order to house the cooling/freeze channel/lumen <b>62</b>, the warming/thaw channel/lumen <b>64</b> and one or more fluid return channels/lumens <b>66</b>. The cooling/freeze channel/lumen <b>62</b> and the warming/thaw channel/lumen <b>64</b> converge distally and open into a single delivery channel/lumen <b>65</b> for delivery to the flow chamber <b>53</b>. Thus, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, inflowing working fluid <b>67</b> (cooling or heating fluid) flows through either of the cooling/freeze channel/lumen <b>62</b> or the warming/thaw channel/lumen <b>64</b> depending on the treatment cycle (freezing/thawing), into the delivery channel/lumen <b>65</b>, into to the flow chamber <b>53</b> and then exits the flow chamber <b>53</b> by flowing into the return channels/lumens <b>66</b>. In some embodiments, the proximal section <b>60</b> includes thermal insulation (vacuum, Aerogel, etc.) <b>68</b> to prevent heat loss and avoid moisture condensation and to prevent freezing/heating along this portion of the treatment instrument <b>48</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">In some embodiments, the shaft <b>50</b> extends from a handle portion <b>70</b> that, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, includes a disk-like section <b>72</b>. The disk-like section <b>72</b> is intended to limit the depth that the shaft <b>50</b> is inserted into the body of the patient or into the trocar that penetrates the body. The insertion depth can be adjusted using a knob, slider, or a dial <b>71</b> located on the handle <b>70</b>. That is, the knob, slider, or dial <b>71</b> can be used to either retract the shaft <b>50</b> within the handle <b>70</b> thereby changing the length of the shaft <b>50</b> that extends from the disk-like section <b>72</b>. In some embodiments, the knob, slider, or dial <b>71</b> can be used move the disk-like section <b>72</b> with respect to the shaft <b>50</b>, which also changes the length of the shaft <b>50</b> that extends from the disk-like section <b>72</b>. Although in the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the disk-like section <b>72</b> is shown in the form of a disk, the shape is not limited to a disk but can be any shape as long as it can prevent insertion of the shaft <b>50</b> past section <b>72</b>. In some embodiments, the system may include multiple treatment instruments, which may be operated independently of one another or which may be operated synchronously.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">Accordingly, in these embodiments, the system will include multiple connection ports/supply hoses.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the system includes a controller/computer <b>74</b> for controlling/managing operation of the system <b>10</b>. With the controller/computer <b>74</b>, a user can input the operating parameters for the system <b>10</b> such as, for example, freeze temperature (T<sub>FR</sub>), thaw temperature (T<sub>TH</sub>), operating pressures (P<sub>IN</sub>, P<sub>OUT</sub>), freeze and thaw cycle run times, treatment cycles (freezing/thawing), number of cycles, treatment instrument operation, etc. The controller/computer <b>74</b> can be programmed with the operating parameters for different treatment procedures (as discussed below in more detail). Therefore, depending on the treatment procedure that will be performed, a user can simply choose that procedure from a library of procedures that has been programmed into the controller/computer <b>74</b> and the system will operate with the operating parameters that are specific for the subject procedure. The controller/computer <b>74</b> also allows a user to modify any such pre-programmed operating parameters for a treatment procedure based on personal preference, experience, treatment area conditions, etc. These modifications or changes to the operating parameters can be performed before a procedure commences or during a procedure based on how the procedure is progressing. Also included is a display <b>76</b> for displaying information relating to operation of the system <b>10</b> and any additional information essential for the treatment being performed. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the treatment cycles of the system <b>10</b> comprise alternating periods of freezing (T<sub>FR</sub>) and thawing (T<sub>TH</sub>). Each period is characterized by its temperature (T), duration (t), and the number of duty cycles (N) (for example, a particular period may be described by T<sub>FR</sub>, T<sub>TH</sub>, t<sub>FR</sub>, t<sub>TH</sub>, N). Thus, one cycle may include one freezing (T<sub>FR</sub>) period for a set time (t<sub>FR</sub>) and one thawing (T<sub>TH</sub>) period for a set time (t<sub>TH</sub>). The treatment cycles within one treatment can be identical or they may vary in temperature and/or duration.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">In order to regulate the temperature for the freezing and thawing cycles, either of the following methods can be used. The freezing temperature (T<sub>FR</sub>) can be maintained by setting the set temperature for fluid in the cooler <b>44</b> to some constant value, &#x2212;25&#xb0; C., for example, and regulating the fluid flow by changing pressure P<sub>IN </sub>of the working fluid flowing from the container <b>14</b> to the cooler <b>44</b>. Similarly, the thawing temperature (Ti) can be maintained by setting the set temperature for fluid in the heater <b>46</b> to some constant value, 38&#xb0; C., for example, and regulating the fluid flow by changing pressure P<sub>IN </sub>of the working fluid flowing from the container <b>14</b> to the heater <b>46</b>. Alternatively, the freezing temperature (T<sub>FR</sub>) can be maintained by setting the pressure P<sub>IN </sub>of the working fluid flowing from the container <b>14</b> to the cooler <b>44</b> to a constant pressure and changing the temperature of the cooler <b>44</b>. Similarly, the thawing temperature (T<sub>TH</sub>) can be maintained by setting the pressure P<sub>IN </sub>of the working fluid flowing from the container <b>14</b> to the heater <b>46</b> to a constant pressure and changing the temperature of the heater <b>46</b>. Either of the above methods may be used or a combination of the above methods may be used to regulate T<sub>FR </sub>and T<sub>TH</sub>. The system <b>10</b> may also include a plurality of sensors such as pressure gauges <b>78</b> and thermistors <b>81</b> that are used to monitor operation of the system <b>10</b> and to control the operating parameters for treatment procedures. Information obtained from these sensors can be displayed on the display <b>76</b> so that a user has real-time operating data for the system. In some embodiments, the system <b>10</b> includes a flow meter in the working fluid cooling/freezing flow path <b>38</b> in order to measure fluid flow through the system and hence the system's cooling power.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">Operation of the system <b>10</b> will now be described. The working fluid <b>12</b> is first added to container <b>14</b>, where it is then pressurized by the pressure generator <b>16</b> to a predetermined pressure (P<sub>IN</sub>). Next, for a freeze cycle, the three-way valve <b>36</b> is actuated to open the flow path <b>38</b> to the cooler <b>44</b>. The working fluid <b>12</b> is then delivered to the heat exchanger <b>42</b> for the cooler <b>44</b> where the working fluid <b>12</b> is cooled to a pre-set treatment freeze temperature (T<sub>FR</sub>). Once the working fluid <b>12</b> is cooled to T<sub>FR</sub>, the working fluid <b>12</b> is delivered the thermally insulated hose <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) to the treatment instrument <b>48</b>, which is positioned such that the shaft <b>50</b> delivers the distal end <b>55</b> to the target tissue to be cooled/frozen. Because the distal end <b>55</b> is in contact with the target tissue, heat is removed from the target tissue by the flowing, cooled working fluid, thereby cooling/freezing the target tissue. Within the treatment instrument/device <b>48</b>, the working fluid <b>12</b> flows into freeze channel/lumen <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), into the delivery channel/lumen <b>65</b>, into to the flow chamber <b>53</b>, then exits the flow chamber <b>53</b> by flowing into the return channels/lumens <b>66</b> and then exits the treatment instrument <b>48</b> through the return channels/lumens <b>66</b>. Upon exiting the treatment instrument <b>48</b> through the return channels/lumens <b>66</b> and return lumen in the thermally insulated hose <b>58</b>, the return flow of working fluid, which is now at a higher temperature (T<sub>OUT</sub>) and lower pressure (P<sub>OUT</sub>) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) than it was before flowing through the treatment instrument <b>48</b>, is delivered back to the console, which houses many of the system's components, and discharged to the atmosphere via a check valve <b>80</b> that is pre-set to a certain release pressure (P<sub>C</sub>). Using a check valve with a pre-set release pressure is required in order to maintain the working fluid in its high-density state throughout the freeze cycle. The pre-set release pressure (P<sub>C</sub>) of the check valve <b>80</b> is determined by the choice of working fluid that is used in the system <b>10</b>. That is, different pressures are required to be maintained for different working fluids in order to maintain the working fluids in their high-density state. it is important to note that from the time the working fluid <b>12</b> is pressurized and leaves the container <b>14</b> until the time it is discharged to the atmosphere through the check valve <b>80</b>, the working fluid <b>12</b> always remains in its high-density state as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The flow rate of the working fluid <b>12</b> through the system <b>10</b> is determined by the difference between its initial pressure P<sub>IN </sub>and the pressure P<sub>OUT</sub>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">The thaw cycle is similar to the freeze cycle except that the flow path of the working fluid <b>12</b> in the system <b>10</b> is different. For the thaw cycle, the three-way valve <b>36</b> is actuated to open the flow path <b>40</b> to the heater <b>46</b>. The working fluid <b>12</b> is then delivered to the heat exchanger <b>42</b> for the heater <b>46</b> where the working fluid <b>12</b> is heated to a pre-set treatment thaw temperature (T<sub>TH</sub>). Once the working fluid <b>12</b> is heated to T<sub>TH </sub>the working fluid <b>12</b> is delivered the thermally insulated hose <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) to the treatment instrument <b>48</b>, which is positioned such that the shaft <b>50</b> extends into the target tissue to be heated/thawed. Operation of the system <b>10</b> for all other aspects is similar to that of the freeze cycle. Again, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the working fluid remains in its high-density state at all times during the thaw cycle while flowing in the system <b>10</b> until the check valve <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">In other embodiments, the system can be a closed loop system. As used herein, &#x201c;closed loop&#x201d; means that instead of venting working fluid <b>12</b> through a check valve <b>80</b> to the atmosphere alter it flows through the treatment instrument <b>48</b> for either freezing or thawing, the working fluid <b>12</b> is instead returned to the holding container <b>14</b> for re-use by the system <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, this can be achieved by means of an external pump (not shown). It is important to note that unlike prior systems (argon-based systems, for example), the cooling/freezing and warming/thawing effect in the present system <b>10</b> does not occur at the treatment instrument <b>48</b>. Instead, cooling and heating of the working fluid <b>12</b> are achieved using a dedicated cooler or heater prior to the working fluid <b>12</b> entering the treatment instrument <b>48</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a cooling probe <b>100</b> configured for cooling tissue in a patient, including visceral fat. The cooling probe <b>100</b> is configured to be placed through the lumen of a trocar that is inserted through the abdominal call of the patient, to perform a cooling procedure laparoscopically. The cooling probe <b>100</b> comprises a proximal end <b>102</b> and a distal end <b>104</b>, the proximal end <b>102</b> including a connector <b>106</b> and the distal end <b>104</b> including an expandable cooling cup <b>108</b>.

The shaft <b>110</b> may comprise a circular cross-section (as shown), or in other embodiments may comprise a non-circular cross-section (oval, teardrop-shaped, etc.) having a maximum transverse diameter and a minimum transverse diameter. The cup <b>108</b> and the connector <b>106</b> may each be secured to the shaft <b>110</b> by adhesive, epoxy, thermal bonding, shrink tube sealing, tying, or other methods that produce secure attachment. The connector <b>106</b> may comprise a molded polymer, such as polycarbonate, acrylic, polyvinyl chloride, or a copolymer including these or other polymers.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>, the cup <b>108</b> may have a length A of between about 3 mm and about 50 mm, or between about 5 mm and about 35 mm, or between about 8 mm and about 20 mm. The cup <b>108</b> may have an outer diameter D between about 6 mm and about 100 mm, or between about 10 mm and about 50 mm, or between about 20 mm and about 40 mm. The shaft <b>110</b> may extend a length L of between about 12 cm and about 80 cm, or between about 12 cm and about 30 cm. The shaft <b>110</b> may have a diameter ds that is between about 2 mm and about 8 mm. The cup <b>108</b> is configured to expand to an expanded configuration (state) that may have an inner diameter d that is at least about twice the diameter ds of the shaft <b>110</b>. In the expanded state, the cup <b>108</b> can have an inner diameter d (and thus an outer diameter D) that is significantly larger than the lumen of a trocar, for example, a 10 mm lumen. The cup <b>108</b> includes an interior <b>124</b> having a volume V. The volume V of the interior of the cup <b>108</b> may be between about 0.65 cm<sup>3 </sup>and about 393 cm<sup>3</sup>, or between about 1 cm<sup>3 </sup>and about 100 cm<sup>3</sup>. The cup <b>108</b> in its collapsed configuration is configured to fit down a 5 mm or 10 mm trocar lumen. Thus, the cup <b>108</b> in its collapsed configuration may be configured to have a maximum diameter of 4.8 mm or smaller, or to have a maximum diameter of 9.8 mm or smaller, or generally, a maximum collapsed diameter of between about 3 mm and about 9.8 mm, or between about 7 mm and about 9.8 mm.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">The cup <b>108</b> comprises four curved cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and an elastic cover <b>122</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the elastic cover <b>122</b> has been removed to more clearly show the shape and orientation of the cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>in the expanded configuration of the cup <b>108</b>. Each one of the cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>is configured to deliver coolant (e.g., thermal fluid) from a first end to a second end of each tube, in order to remove heat from cup <b>108</b> and to remove heat from any tissue that is within the interior <b>124</b> of the cup <b>108</b>. A vacuum or suction system will be described that is configured to pull tissue including fat into the interior of the cup <b>108</b>. The cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>each comprise an outer wall <b>126</b> and an inner lumen <b>128</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). The cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may comprise any material, either metal or polymeric, that provides heat transfer through the outer wall <b>126</b>. For example, the cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may comprise a high-strength polymeric material such as polyimide, polyamide, or polyester (e.g., PET or PETG) having a thin outer wall to optimize heat transfer. In some embodiments, the polymeric tubes may be heat-shaped to retain memory, and configured to that in their collapsed state they do not significantly overcome their elastic limit. In other embodiments, the polymeric tubes may comprise shape memory polymers that are configured to be changed from their collapsed state to their expanded state by in injection of a heated fluid. Thus, heated thermal fluid may be recirculated through the lumen of the shape memory polymer tubes to cause them to obtain their expanded configuration and then, once this expanded configuration is obtained, cooled thermal fluid may be recirculated through the lumen of the shape memory polymer tubes to provide cooling in the cup <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">In other embodiments, the polymeric tubes may include coextruded wires in their outer walls <b>126</b> such that a curved shape may be placed on them. In some embodiments, the wires may comprise a shape-memory alloy such as a nickel-titanium alloy. In one embodiment, the polymeric tubes with the coextruded wires may be heat set at a preferred shape, such that the wires behave as a superelastic shaped wire that causes the polymeric tubes to conform to their memory shape. The curved tubes may be placed in the collapsed state by placing through a relatively small trocar or catheter lumen, thus straightening the curved tubes while placing the shaped wire in a stress-induced martensitic state. When delivered out of the lumen, the wire moves toward its austenitic state, forcing the memorized curve in the tubes. In other embodiments, the shape-memory characteristics of the wire may be used to change the tubes from their collapsed state to their expanded state by in injection of a heated fluid. Thus, heated thermal fluid may be recirculated through the lumen of the polymer tubes to cause them to obtain their expanded configuration via the heating of the shape-memory wires, causing them to change to their austenitic state. Once this expanded configuration is obtained, cooled thermal fluid may be recirculated through the lumen of the tubes to provide cooling in the cup <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>21</b></figref>, the cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>comprise shaped superelastic tubes constructed from a shape-memory alloy such as a nickel-titanium alloy. Thus, the cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>perform not only their heat transfer function, but also a function of forming the shape of the cup <b>108</b> in its expanded state. The cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, like the embedded wires described above, act as ribs, extending along a surface of the cup <b>108</b> from the proximal end <b>112</b> to the distal end <b>130</b>, the one or more ribs configured to help move the cup from its collapsed state to its expanded state. In some embodiments, such as the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>21</b></figref>, the cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may provide this rib function on their own, while in other embodiments, the cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and additional wire ribs may together serve this function. The additional wires may have a circular cross-section, a rectangular cross-section, or another shaped cross-section. The wires and/or cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may be bonded to an inner surface <b>132</b> of the elastic cover <b>122</b>, or to an outer surface <b>134</b> of the elastic cover <b>122</b>, or some may be bonded to the inner surface <b>132</b> while others are bonded to the outer surface <b>134</b>. If bonded to the outer surface <b>134</b>, the expansion of the wires and/or cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>can be configured to &#x201c;pull&#x201d; the diameter of the cover <b>122</b> open, or to simply guide the expansion of a pre-sized cover <b>122</b>. In other embodiments, the wires and/or cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may be left unbonded, and the cover <b>122</b> may be configured on the outside of the wires and/or cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, such that expansion of the wires and/or cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>automatically stretches the cover <b>122</b>, to increase its diameter, and retraction or reduction in size of the wires and/or cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>automatically allows the cover <b>122</b> to retract in diameter. In some embodiments, the wires and/or cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may have a helical shape such that they extended around a circumference of the cover <b>122</b> while also extending from the proximal end <b>112</b> to the distal end <b>130</b> of the cup <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">The elastic cover <b>122</b> may be a general cup shape that is molded, spray-molded, or dip-molded from an elastomer such as silicone, or a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), such as polyether block amide, or thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV). The elastic cover <b>122</b> may comprise an elastic membrane. The cover <b>108</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> has a wine glass shape in its expanded state. In other embodiments, the cover <b>108</b> may have a basket shape, a generally hemispherical shape, or a generally conical shape. The elastic cover <b>122</b> is formed around the outside of the cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>such that expansion of cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>automatically stretches the cover <b>122</b>, to increase its diameter, and retraction or reduction in size of the cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>automatically allows the cover <b>122</b> to retract in diameter. The cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may also be bonded to the inner surface <b>132</b> of the elastic cover <b>122</b> in certain strategic locations. In some embodiments, only one, two, or three bonding points per cooling tube <b>120</b> may be used. The cooling tube <b>120</b> may be bonded to the inner surface <b>132</b> of the cover <b>122</b> with a flexible adhesive such as a polyurethane adhesive, or by other adhesives or epoxies. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>each define a plane that is transverse to a longitudinal axis of the shaft <b>110</b> when the cup <b>108</b> is in its expanded state. When the cup <b>108</b> is in its collapsed state, the cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may also form transverse planes (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>), but this is not a requirement, as in some cases, spiraling of the compressed cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may actually allow for a smaller collapsed profile. Though four cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, in other embodiments, a single cooling tube or two to twenty cooling tubes, or two to ten cooling tubes may be utilized.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a particular fluid flow path is indicated by the arrows in cooling tube <b>120</b><i>a</i>. Pressurized coolant enters the lumen <b>128</b> of the coolant tube <b>120</b><i>a </i>at a longitudinal inlet end <b>136</b> of cooling tube <b>120</b><i>a </i>in a longitudinal direction, generally parallel to longitudinal axis <b>138</b>. The coolant follows a first bend <b>140</b>, changing direction following a first generally radially extending section <b>142</b> to a second bend <b>144</b> at an outer diameter portion of the cooling tube <b>120</b><i>a</i>. The first bend <b>140</b> may orient the first generally radially extending section <b>142</b> substantially 90&#xb0; from the inlet end <b>136</b>, or may instead for an obtuse angle, such that the first generally radially extending section <b>142</b> also extends slightly distally. The first bend <b>140</b> may even be about 120&#xb0;, or even more. By configuring the first bend <b>140</b> slightly larger than 90&#xb0;, the proximal-to-distal sliding placement of an introducer (described below) may be somewhat facilitated by the forward-leaning angle. At the second bend <b>144</b>, the coolant changes direction to a first substantially longitudinally extending section <b>146</b> (proximal to distal), and moves distally to a third bend <b>148</b> an intermediate length <b>150</b> and a fourth bend <b>152</b>. The intermediate length <b>150</b> circulates the coolant in a direction generally transverse to the longitudinal axis <b>138</b>, but it may also have some convex curvature distally. The convex curvature may aid in the controlled, compression and collapse of the cooling tube <b>120</b><i>a</i>. After the fourth bend <b>152</b>, the coolant moves along a second substantially longitudinally extending section <b>154</b> (distal to proximal) that is reverse of the first substantially longitudinally extending section <b>146</b>. At a fifth bend <b>156</b> in the cooling tube <b>120</b><i>a </i>the coolant changes direction and moves along a second generally radially extending section <b>158</b> back toward the longitudinal axis <b>138</b>, and then redirects proximally at a sixth bend <b>160</b> to a longitudinal outlet end <b>162</b>. Each of the cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may be shaped in this same manner. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, each of the cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a </i>is oriented at about 90&#xb0; from the next around the longitudinal axis <b>138</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">The cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are connected to inflow and outflow lumens in the shaft <b>110</b> at their inlet ends <b>136</b> and outlet ends <b>162</b>.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the introducer sheath <b>127</b> is pulled proximally by the user, e.g. by holding the proximal end <b>131</b> and/or the tab <b>139</b>. Then, by carefully pulling the tab <b>139</b> in a transverse direction to the longitudinal axis <b>138</b>, the introducer sheath <b>127</b> is torn longitudinally along the weakened line <b>137</b> and is removed. The cooling probe <b>100</b> is now advanced by the user so that the cup <b>108</b> exits the cannula <b>103</b> and is able to expand toward its expanded configuration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the cup <b>108</b> is placed over a desired portion of visceral fat <b>117</b> to be treated, and suction is applied to the suction lumen <b>166</b> by connecting or activating suction to the suction port <b>184</b> of the connector <b>106</b>. The visceral fat <b>117</b> (and perhaps some amount of adjacent intestinal tissue) is pulled into the interior <b>124</b> of the cup <b>108</b>. The coolant is now circulated through the fluid inlet lumen <b>170</b> via the inflow port <b>180</b> and through the lumens <b>128</b> of the cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, thus removing heat from the cup <b>108</b> and from the visceral fat <b>117</b> within the cup <b>108</b> until the visceral fat <b>117</b> is brought to 10&#xb0; C. or below. By maintaining the visceral fat at a temperature of between about &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. and about +10&#xb0; C. for a period of time, for example, between about 30 seconds and about 10 minutes, the visceral fat can undergo apoptosis while the normal intestinal tissue is protected from significant damage. Fat tends to be more sensitive to lower temperatures than is much of the surrounding normal tissue. Thus, maintaining the visceral fat at the &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. to +10&#xb0; C. range is selective to deactivate the negative effects of the fat, without allowing the adjacent normal tissue to reach temperatures below &#x2212;20&#xb0; C., that may damage them. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, the cooling and the suction are terminated.

The cooling balloon <b>308</b> is also configured to be inflated by the coolant. Control of the inflow rate and the outflow rate (by an inflow pump and an outflow pump by the system <b>10</b>) creates the positive pressure gradient required to inflate the balloon <b>308</b>, and to maintain the inflation of the balloon <b>308</b>, while also allowing coolant heated by the body tissue and fluids to be replaced by new chilled coolant. While the balloon is being inflated, the inflow rate of coolant tends to be greater than the outflow rate of coolant. While the inflated balloon is actively heat exchanging with the fat, the inflow rate and outflow rate tend to closely match each other.

Coolant is circulated into and out of a mostly annular interior <b>424</b> of the cooling balloon <b>408</b> that is between the outer diameter of the inner balloon <b>463</b> and the inner diameter of the expandable membrane <b>422</b>. The most annular interior <b>424</b> (the space between the inner balloon <b>463</b> and the expandable membrane <b>422</b>) is configured to circulate coolant past the inner surface <b>432</b> of the expandable membrane <b>422</b> in order to promote heat exchange of the outer surface <b>434</b> of the expandable membrane <b>422</b> with the visceral fat being cooled. The choice of a gas, such as air, CO<sub>2</sub>, or nitrogen, to fill the interior <b>465</b> of the inner balloon <b>463</b> also serves as a thermal insulator so that the heat exchange is predominantly between the coolant flowing within the annular interior <b>424</b> and the fat or tissue externally adjacent the expandable membrane. Control of the inflow rate and the outflow rate (by an inflow pump and an outflow pump by the system <b>10</b>) assures an appropriately matched flow of the coolant, and the maintenance of a generally constant pressure within the annular interior <b>424</b>.

However, because the thermistor <b>81</b> of the cooling probe <b>400</b> is within the interior <b>424</b> of the expandable membrane <b>422</b>, the programmed temperature may be a lower calculated range.

After the cooling procedure, the coolant flow is stopped and the inner balloon <b>463</b> is deflated, and the cooling probe <b>400</b> is removed from the patient <b>109</b>. The balloon <b>408</b> can be positioned such that the treatment surface <b>457</b> lies flat on an upper surface or upper layer of the visceral fat <b>117</b>, to form a firm thermal contact with the tissue, for conductive heat transfer. The diameter of the expandable membrane <b>422</b> can be controlled to achieve the desired expanded size in comparison with the treatment area. The degree of expansion of the inner balloon <b>463</b> can also be adjusted, by changing pressure and/or diameter, to help achieve the desired size in comparison with the treatment area.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the cooling probe <b>400</b>&#x2032; wherein the expandable membrane <b>422</b> is removed and replaced by a series of eight spiral tubes <b>491</b><i>a</i>-<i>h </i>having a lumen <b>465</b>. Each of the spiral tubes <b>491</b><i>a</i>-<i>h </i>is configured to be carried on the outer diameter of the inner balloon <b>463</b>. Each of the first ends <b>493</b> of the spiral tubes <b>491</b> is hydraulically coupled to the fluid inlet lumen <b>470</b> by bonding. The fluid inlet lumen <b>470</b> may extend parallel to the inflation lumen <b>466</b>, allowing the fluid inlet lumen <b>470</b> to extend to the distal end <b>404</b> of the cooling probe <b>400</b>&#x2032;, as shown. The pressurized coolant thus is propelled radially at the distal end <b>404</b> and then proximally in a spiral manner having both circumferential and longitudinal components, toward the proximal end <b>412</b> of the inner balloon <b>463</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>, there are eight spiral tubes, and each tube <b>491</b> traverses 45&#xb0; circumferentially over the length of the inner balloon <b>463</b>. Other numbers of tubes <b>491</b> and other amounts of spiraling are anticipated. The spiral shapes of the tubes <b>491</b> aid in the collapse and expansion of the tubes <b>491</b> in relation to the collapse and expansion of the inner balloon <b>463</b>. Each of the second ends <b>497</b> of the spiral tubes <b>491</b> is hydraulically coupled to the fluid outlet lumen <b>474</b> by bonding. Thus, the front face <b>499</b> comprises an array of eight radially extending portions and the side <b>498</b> comprises a circumferential array of spiral portions both of which are capable of cooling adjacent tissue. In other embodiments, the spiral tubes <b>491</b><i>a</i>-<i>h </i>may be bonded to the inner balloon <b>463</b> at all surfaces, and may even be configured such that pressurization of the tubes can aid or cause the inflation of the inner balloon <b>463</b>. This mechanical action may be compared to the stiffening and flexing of a Bourdon tube. In some embodiments, the expandable membrane <b>422</b> may be re-added to the probe <b>400</b>&#x2032; and configured to be carried over the spiral tubes <b>491</b><i>a</i>-<i>h</i>. The spiral tubes <b>491</b><i>a</i>-<i>h </i>may even be formed as a part of the expandable membrane <b>422</b> such that it is one composite structure, or even one integral structure having a series of channels.

The cooling probe <b>500</b> is similar to the cooling probe <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> or the cooling probe <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> in the manner that central suction is applied within a cooling cup. However, in the cooling probe <b>500</b>, the cooling tubes <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, <b>220</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>have been replaced by a combination of ten support wires <b>520</b><i>a</i>-<i>j </i>and a cup-shaped cooling balloon <b>508</b> attached to the shaft <b>510</b> at the distal end <b>504</b> of the probe <b>500</b>. The cup-shaped cooling balloon <b>508</b> has an interior <b>524</b> configured for fat to be suctioned therewithin. The suction lumen <b>566</b> of the inner tube <b>564</b> is configured to apply a section to the interior <b>524</b> of the balloon <b>508</b>, in a similar manner to the cooling probes <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. The cooling balloon <b>508</b> comprises an outer expandable membrane <b>522</b> having an inner surface <b>532</b> and an outer surface <b>534</b>. The distal end <b>530</b> of the balloon <b>508</b> comprises a circumferential fold <b>531</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref>) on the outer expandable membrane <b>522</b>. The outer expandable membrane <b>522</b> may comprise a compliant or semi-compliant polymeric material, or may comprise an elastomeric material. High-strength materials may be used, as previously discussed, to provide a thin wall and help maximize the heat transfer through the wall. The outer expandable membrane <b>522</b> comprises a cylindrical shape that is inverted at the circumferential fold <b>531</b> to create an inner layer <b>527</b> comprising the inner surface <b>532</b> and an outer layer <b>529</b> comprising the outer surface <b>534</b>.

The bonds are on the outer circumference of the tubes <b>572</b>, <b>564</b>, but may alternatively be to the inner circumferences of either. The circumferential fold <b>531</b> and the bonds of the ends <b>601</b>, <b>603</b> to the tubes <b>572</b>, <b>564</b> thus creates a balloon interior <b>607</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">Within the interior <b>607</b> of the outer expandable membrane <b>522</b> is an inner balloon <b>563</b>, which may be made from similar materials to the outer expandable membrane <b>522</b>. The inner balloon <b>563</b> is inverted at a circumferential fold <b>615</b>. A first end <b>609</b> of the inner balloon <b>563</b> is bonded to a distal end <b>611</b> of the intermediate tube <b>568</b> at an outer circumference, and the second end <b>613</b> of the inner balloon <b>563</b> is bonded to the distal end <b>611</b> of the intermediate tube <b>568</b> at an inner circumference. The inversion of the inner balloon <b>563</b> thus creates an interior <b>617</b> of the inner balloon <b>563</b>. The attachments of the outer expandable membrane <b>522</b> and of the inner balloon <b>563</b> within the outer expandable membrane forms a flow space <b>619</b> in the remaining space of the interior <b>607</b>. A flow path for coolant is thus created as coolant pumped through the fluid inlet lumen <b>570</b> enters the flow space <b>619</b> at an entry annulus <b>621</b>, circulates distally and outwardly radially (dashed arrow) to a flow reversal area <b>623</b> comprising a generally 180&#xb0; turn. The flow from the entry annulus <b>621</b> to the flow reversal area <b>623</b> provides heat exchange with fat that has been suctioned into the interior <b>524</b> of the balloon <b>508</b> via the inner surface <b>532</b> of the expandable membrane <b>522</b>. The warmed coolant then travels along the flow space <b>619</b> in a proximally and inwardly radially (solid arrow) past an exit annulus <b>625</b> and into the fluid outlet lumen <b>574</b>. The direction of flow of the coolant, as in the other embodiments described herein, assures that the coolant is more protected from eating by the patient's body, and that the coolant passes by the fat as early as possible in the flow process. However, in any of the embodiments, it may be desired to alternatively apply the flow in a reverse manner to the lumens. For example, if the cup or balloon were significantly long and the contents included significant flow (e.g., arterial), then cross-flow heat exchange may actually be more efficient for overall efficiency, thus suggesting the use of flow in the opposite direction.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">In some embodiments, the injection of the pressurized coolant may cause some or all of the expansion of the balloon <b>508</b> from its collapsed state into its expanded state.

The wires <b>520</b><i>a</i>-<i>j </i>support an umbrella-type support and expansion.

One advantage of this is that the wires <b>520</b><i>a</i>-<i>j </i>also maintain the general form of the inner balloon <b>563</b>, without it requiring to be inflated (e.g., by an additional lumen). The wires <b>520</b><i>a</i>-<i>j </i>may be bonded or otherwise secured in place at their proximal ends <b>627</b> only, or may be bonded along their length to the inner and outer interior surfaces <b>629</b>, <b>631</b> of the inner balloon <b>563</b>, to further control the expansion of the inner balloon <b>563</b> and the amount or relative thinness to its material (to provide more patency for the flow space <b>619</b>.

The inner balloon <b>563</b> in this embodiment may even be inflated with a coolant to maximize the amount of heat transfer at the beginning of the procedure.
