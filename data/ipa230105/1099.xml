For example, dosage accuracy is an important parameter that influences the performance of the device and specifically in drug delivery devices is critical to the user's health.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Overall dimensions and weight of such liquid delivery device is another parameter that influences user's experience and specifically in drug delivery devices influences a user's willingness or ability to carry the device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The cost of goods also influences profitability and ability of a user to purchase such a device, and prefilled cartridge compatibility is another parameter that enables a user to use the device in compatible with a prefilled cartridge.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is thus advantageous to provide a liquid delivery device that can address at least some parameters such as those mentioned above.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following embodiments and aspects thereof are described and illustrated in conjunction with systems, tools and methods which are meant to be exemplary and illustrative, not limiting in scope.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a device and/or method for delivering liquid substances such drugs, medications, vitamin additives, minerals, chemotherapy or chemo drugs, liquids containing DNA (or the like) out of a container of or associated with the device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In various embodiments, such container may be a syringe, a cartridge, a pre-filled cartridge (or the like).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various embodiments of the present disclosure may thus be defined as aimed at providing a suitable solution for provision of dosage accuracy in a relative compact device structure that may be a substantially low cost liquid delivery device, and which can be used to displace substances (liquids, drugs and the like) out of container cartridges and/or prefilled cartridges.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment, a liquid delivery device may be arranged to include a crawling mechanism that can be inserted (at least partially) into a cartridge of the device, to engage with a plunger and with an internal peripheral surface of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Such crawling mechanism may be arranged to bear against and urge the plunger to be biased into the interior of the cartridge in order to urge delivery of substances, such as liquid drugs (or the like) out of the container.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, the crawling mechanism may be arranged to include several components, such as a motor and reduction gear, driving wheels and swinging hooks.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, a method for delivering substances such as liquid, drugs (or the like) out of a container of the device may include a setup stage.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Such setup stage may include urging engagement (possibly by a user of the device) between a cartridge and a crawling mechanism of the device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Such engagement may urge a plunger of the device to come into contact with edges of swinging hooks of the crawling mechanism, which in turn nay be pushed axially and due to swinging points the swinging hooks may then be urged to rotate. Such swinging hooks may be included in swing members of the crawling mechanism.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment, the swinging hooks of a swing member may be arranged as a so-called frame, possibly formed of or made to include a pair of side-bars, for driving wheels, which in turn may be forced away from the axis of the cartridge due to such swinging action until they come into contact and engage with an internal peripheral wall/surface of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, axial forces applied to swing members e.g. to tips of the swinging hooks by the plunger, may cause a swinging motion of the swing member and consequently swinging hooks, hence, causing an generally arced (partially radial) motion to the driving wheels associated to such swing members till they come into substantial contact with the internal peripheral wall of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Radial forces between the driving wheels and the internal peripheral wall of the cartridge may urge creation of frictional force between the driving wheels and the internal peripheral wall of the cartridge&#x2014;resulting in the torque being delivered to the rotation of driving wheels being translated to an axial force, causing the crawling mechanism to move axially.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Due to the swinging motion and the axial force, swinging hooks of swing members may be arranged in certain cases to penetrate into the plunger to thereby complete the setup stage.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment, a method for delivering substances such as liquid, drugs (or the like) out of a container of the device may include a subsequent delivery stage that may be activated after the setup stage.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The delivery stage may include activation of a motor possibly coupled with the driving wheels via a gear possibly a reduction gear.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Rotation of the driving wheels in the delivery stage may be performed while the driving wheels are in contact with the internal wall of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Hence, the crawling mechanism in at least certain embodiments may be arranged to move forward inside the cartridge while forcing the plunger to move forward as well, delivering substances out of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A rotation encoder that may be located in association with the motor, possibly at a back of the motor, may assist in controlling/monitoring the rotational motion of the motor.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A linear encoder may be integrated into a cable that delivers power/data from a PCB of the motor, to thereby control/monitor linear motion of the motor/plunger.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an embodiment, a method for delivering substances such as liquid, drugs (or the like) out of a container of the device may include an additional detachment stage that may be activated after the delivery stage.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The crawling mechanism may be detached from the cartridge by request, either by manually pulling the cartridge away from the crawling mechanism and/or by electrical command to the motor to rotate in the opposite direction of delivery.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Since in some cases the swinging hooks may penetrate into the plunger, manually pulling the cartridge away from the crawling mechanism in such embodiments may result in application of axial forces on the edge of the swinging hooks, causing the swinging hooks to rotate in a counter direction, so that the driving wheels are forced away from the internal wall of the cartridge and towards the axis of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition or alternatively, once the disposable part is detached from the reusable part (remainder of device including crawling mechanism), a coupling sensor may trigger the system into a &#x201c;detachment stage&#x201d;, causing the driving wheels to rotate in a backwards direction to detach the crawling mechanism from the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A spring (which possibly applies force to the flex PCB) may be arranged to pull the crawling mechanism to its base position in certain embodiments.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In various embodiments, edges of the swinging hooks may be attached to the plunger by penetrating into it (as described), however in other embodiments such attachment may be accomplished in others means, such as by vacuum cups, adhesive, magnet, etc. In certain embodiments, the swinging hooks may not form attachment with the plunger, but merely close abutting attachment (or the like).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In various embodiments, the crawling mechanism can be powered either by a cable or it may include its own power source (e.g. Battery)</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In various embodiments, control signals can be delivered to the crawling mechanism either by cable or by wireless signals.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further aspects of the present invention are exemplified in the following:</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">1. A liquid/drug delivery device including a crawling mechanism while one or more of the component of the crawling mechanism is in contact with the internal surface of the cartridge (in at least at one contact area).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">2. A plunger driving mechanism which is advancing with the plunger inside a cylindrical, rectangular, arced, oval or other shaped fluid cartridge.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">3. A plunger driving mechanism which is advancing a plunger inside a fluid cartridge and wherein the driving mechanism is entirely enclosed inside the cartridge, at least when the cartridge is empty.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">4. A plunger driving mechanism which is anchored to the plunger in forward motion and released from the plunger in backward motion.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">5. A drug delivering system that includes a linear encoder that monitors the motion of the plunger and an elastic element (spring) that can pull the crawling mechanism back to its base position.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">6. A drug delivery system with a coupling sensor between the reusable and the disposable units that can detect attachment/detachment between the reusable and disposable parts.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">7. A drug delivery system with a seal that is located around the drug cartridge for ingress protection/sealing.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">8. A drug delivery device which uses pre-filled cartridge and is attachable to the human body with an adhesive.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition to the exemplary aspects and embodiments described above, further aspects and embodiments will become apparent by reference to the figures and by study of the following detailed descriptions.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Exemplary embodiments are illustrated in referenced figures.
