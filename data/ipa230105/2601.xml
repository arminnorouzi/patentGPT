moldability as raw materials for an automobile interior or exterior member such as a pillar trim, a door trim, and a door panel. For example, a member in which the surface of an acrylonitrile-styrene-based resin (AS-based resin) or a polypropylene-based resin (PP-based resin) is covered with a skin of a soft resin such as polyvinyl chloride and decorated in a leather-like manner, and a member in which a grained AS-based resin or PP-based resin surface is coated and decorated in a leather-like manner are used.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for simplification of an automobile production step and recycling of a used material. From such a point, there is an increasing demand for using a resin molded product having undergone surface processing such as graining even in an automobile interior or exterior member without coating the resin molded product. However, the uncoated PP-based resin molded product is likely to be scratched when assembled and used.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, the following methods and compositions for producing a molded product having a suitable property as an automobile interior or exterior member and having excellent scratch resistance have been proposed.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0005">A method for improving the strength using a filler (see Patent Literature 1).</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0006">A method for improving the hardness by using a resin component having excellent crystallinity (see Patent Literature 2).</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0007">A polypropylene-based composition including talc and a scratch improving agent and having excellent Izod impact strength and scratch resistance (see Patent Literature 3).</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0008">A propylene-based resin composition including a specific propylene/ethylene block copolymer, talc, and a fatty acid amide, and having excellent resistance to whitening that occurs when a protruding portion is formed (protrusion whitening resistance) and scratch resistance (see Patent Literature 4).</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0009">A polypropylene-based resin composition including three specific polypropylenes and a specific ethylene/&#x3b1;-olefin copolymer rubber and having excellent physical property balance and scratch resistance (see Patent Literature 5).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0006" num="0010">Further, in the application of an automobile interior or exterior member, not only a scratch such as scratching but also deterioration of the surface condition of an automobile interior or exterior member due to rubbing with a soft substance such as rubber becomes problematic.
