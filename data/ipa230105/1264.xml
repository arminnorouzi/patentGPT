Field of Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an exercise machine and, more particularly, to a climbing exercise machine.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Related Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">U.S. Pat. No. 5,679,100 discloses a conventional climbing exercise machine. The climbing exercise machine 10 includes a left handle 48, a left tread 44, a right handle 50 and a right tread 46. The right tread 46 is lifted with the right handle 50 when the left tread 44 and the left handle 48 are lowered. The left tread 44 is lifted with the left handle 48 when the right tread 46 and the right handle 50 are lowered. Therefore, an exercise moves his or her right hand and feet upward when he or she moves the left hand and feet downward, and vice versa to simulate rock-climbing in the wild.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This type of exercise with the climbing exercise machine 10 is caused by a transmission including sprockets 30, 84, 116, 120, 122 and 126 and chains 88, 118 and 124. The sprockets 80 and 84 support the chain 88, which is connected to the handles 48 and 50 for alternately moving the handles 48 and 50 to and fro. The sprocket 116 is co-axially connected to the sprocket 84 by an axle 86. The sprockets 116 and 120 support the chain 118. The sprocket 122 is coaxially connected to the sprocket 120 by an axle 121. The sprockets 122 and 126 support the chain 124, which is connected to the treads 44 and 46.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The exerciser expects to exercise the arms and legs with the climbing exercise machine <b>10</b> as the arms and legs encounter resistance caused by the exerciser's weight and an extra load on the climbing exercise machine 10. The diameter of the sprocket 116 is half the diameter of the sprocket 84. The diameter of the sprocket 122 is half the diameter of the sprocket 120. Thus, the sprockets 84, 116, 120 and 122 and the chain 118 are used as a reducer to render the stroke of the movement of the legs shorter than the stroke of the movement of the hands. However, the legs bear most of the resistance. Hence, with the climbing exercise machine 10, the exercise exercises the legs much more than the hands. Moreover, the climbing exercise machine 10 is not suitable for exercisers at all levels, particularly those who would like to conduct mild and/or intense training.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">CN205730174 discloses a climbing exercise machine 100 including a belt 233 wound on two pulleys 236 and 239. An axle 234 supports two reels 235 and 237 and the pulley 236. The reel 235 reels a rope 231 to move a tread 211. The tread 211 is connected to an end of a sliding module 21. A handle 21 is connected to an opposite end of the sliding module 21. The reel 237 reels a rope 232 to move a tread 221. The tread 221 is connected to an end of a sliding module 22. A handle 222 is connected to an opposite end of the sliding module 22. The reels 235 and 237 rotate in opposite directions so that the tread 211 and the handle 212 are lifted when the tread 221 and the handle 222 are lowered, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An axle 238 supports the pulley 239 and a flywheel 24. In operation, the flywheel 24 rotates and intersects a magnetic field generated by a magnetic control module 25 so that the rotation of the flywheel 24 encounters resistance from the magnetic control module 25. However, the climbing exercise machine 100 is not suitable for exercisers at all levels, particularly those who would like to conduct mild and/or intense training.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is therefore intended to obviate or at least alleviate the problems encountered in the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is the primary objective of the present invention to provide a climbing exercise machine suitable for exercisers at all levels.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve the foregoing objectives, the climbing exercise machine includes a base, two columns, a beam, two handles, two treads, an input axle, an output axle, a transmission case, a disc, a frame and a resistance element.
