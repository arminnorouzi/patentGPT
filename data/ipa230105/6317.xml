The disclosure herein more specifically relates to the field of bushings for battery terminals of lead acid batteries.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Lead acid batteries are known. Lead acid batteries are made up of plates of lead and separate plates of lead dioxide, which are submerged into an electrolyte or acid solution. The lead, lead dioxide and electrolyte provide a chemical means of storing electrical energy which can perform useful work when the terminals of a battery are connected to an external circuit. The plates of lead, lead dioxide and electrolyte, together with a battery separator, are contained within a housing of a polypropylene material.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In batteries with multiple cell elements, the cells are connected in series by conductive straps or intercell connectors. The straps also connect the cells to a positive terminal and a negative terminal. These terminals are accessible outside the battery housing. These terminals allow for a vehicle (or other application) to connect to the battery for use. The conductive straps and terminals comprise a conductive material. Typically, in a lead-acid battery, this conductive material is comprised of lead.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a lead acid battery, a battery bushing forms a portion of the terminal and typically serves as the contact and fastener between the polymer housing of a lead acid battery and the metal, typically lead, battery terminal. This bushing must provide resistance to acid leakage through this interface.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, when a battery cable is coupled to a battery terminal (to access the available power from the battery), the battery terminal may experience torque. In order to properly fasten the battery cable, the battery terminal must resist at least the applied torque. In addition, when in use in a vehicle, for example, the battery may be jostled and moved during travel causing the battery cable to torque the terminal and associated bushing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, a bushing for a lead acid battery and battery terminal is needed which has improved resistance to acid leakage and improved resistance to torque.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A battery terminal bushing is disclosed. The battery terminal bushing comprises a body having an insertion end and an exterior end opposite the insertion end. One or more sealing rings surround the body between the insertion end and the exterior end. A terminal post connector segment is provided on the insertion end of the body. An anti-torque pattern is provided on one or more surfaces of the body configured to engage and be contained within the battery housing material. A lead acid battery comprising the battery terminal bushing is also disclosed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An additional battery terminal bushing is disclosed. The battery terminal bushing comprises a body having an insertion end and an exterior end opposite the insertion end and one or more sealing rings on the body. A plurality of anti-torque features are provided on the body. The anti-torque features comprise a surface area of at least approximately 200 mm2 and provide a resistance to torque which is greater than 150 inch-pounds of torque. A lead acid battery comprising the battery terminal bushing is also disclosed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An additional battery terminal bushing is also disclosed. The battery terminal bushing comprises a body having an insertion end and an exterior end opposite the insertion end. One or more sealing rings are provided on the body.

The alloy may, as a non-limiting example, be a lead tin alloy with a tin composition range of 1-4%, 1-2.25%, 1-1.5%, and the like. The lead may be virgin lead or high purity lead or highly purified secondary lead, in various examples of embodiments. In one or more examples of embodiments, the lead or lead alloy may be a recycled lead or lead alloy. The bushing made of lead may be constructed by common methods in the art, including but not limited to, cold forming and/or die casting and/or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The housing <b>114</b> and cover <b>116</b> may be primarily composed of a polymer material. For example, the cover <b>116</b>, container/housing <b>114</b>, and/or various components may be made of any polymeric (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, a polypropylene containing material, etc.) or composite (e.g., glass-reinforced polymer) material. In one or more examples of embodiments, the polymer material may be a recycled polymer material. In this regard, the container <b>114</b> and/or cover <b>116</b> may be made of polypropylene-containing material (e.g., pure polypropylene, co-polymers comprising polypropylene, polypropylene with additives, etc.), or other materials resistant to the caustic acid electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Accordingly, in an assembled lead acid battery <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, a metal or lead component, namely, a bushing <b>300</b> or <b>400</b> may be attached or secured within the polymeric housing <b>114</b> or cover <b>116</b> material.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Within the polymeric housing <b>114</b> and cover <b>116</b> in a lead acid battery is oftentimes a liquid electrolyte such as a sulfuric acid. It is not desirable for the acid to leak from the battery housing <b>114</b> or cover <b>116</b>. Aside from the environmental and health and safety impacts of exposure to the acidic electrolyte, acid which leaks may also cause &#x201c;black post,&#x201d; namely, a condition in which the battery terminal and/or bushing discolors leading to warranty claims and other issues with the battery. Retention of the electrolyte within the battery is made even more challenging by the joining of two different materials which do not naturally fuse or join together. These two components composed of different material compositions must form a tight seal.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, a battery terminal is subjected to torque. In one example, a connecting cable or battery cable <b>204</b> (such as from a vehicle <b>102</b>) is attached to the battery terminal <b>218</b> (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). In a vehicle <b>102</b>, a battery <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> may be subject to different loads or stresses and motion. As a result, the cable <b>204</b> may apply a torque or rotational force to the battery bushing <b>300</b> or <b>400</b>. Likewise, when a bushing <b>400</b> is used, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, which includes an internal thread <b>408</b> that receives a terminal <b>218</b> or connection to a battery cable <b>204</b>, a torque is applied to the battery bushing <b>400</b> as the terminal <b>218</b> is threaded into the internal thread <b>408</b>. Because the bushing <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> and the housing <b>114</b> or cover <b>116</b> are made of different materials, they may have different hardness, which may cause one material to deform as torque is applied. Moreover, the different materials may be difficult to rigidly secure (e.g., adhere) together. Therefore, a load or stress placed on one of the two components may cause the bushing <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> to twist or rotate relative to the housing <b>114</b> or cover <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Accordingly, a bushing <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> as provided herein has mechanisms and features which provide a resistance to, or prevention of, electrolyte leakage and torque resistance. To this end, a battery terminal bushing <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> is disclosed. The battery terminal bushing <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> comprises a body <b>306</b>, <b>406</b> having an insertion end <b>304</b>, <b>404</b> and an exterior end <b>310</b>, <b>410</b> opposite the insertion end.

In the illustrated embodiment, one or more circumferential projections or acid rings or sealing rings <b>206</b> are shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>12</b></figref> two circumferential projections or acid rings or sealing rings <b>206</b> are shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>-<b>18</b></figref> one and one-half (&#xbd;) circumferential projections or acid rings or sealing rings <b>206</b> are shown.

The circumferential projections <b>206</b> may include an undercut on an outer portion of the projection. In the illustrated example, this undercut forms an &#x201c;arrowhead&#x201d; shape <b>212</b> on the outer portion of the projection <b>206</b>, although variations thereon may be acceptable. Between circumferential projections <b>206</b> an annular cavity <b>214</b> is therefore formed.

In the illustrated embodiments, the anti-torque ring <b>208</b> may be a first anti-torque feature and is an area of increased surface area surrounding a portion of the bushing. To this end, the anti-torque ring <b>208</b> may include a pattern of alternating peaks <b>216</b> or protrusions and valleys <b>219</b>, (e.g., forming &#x201c;teeth&#x201d;), which provide an increased surface area to the anti-torque ring as compared to a more rounded surface. Various patterns and profiles of teeth may be used to accomplish the objective of torque resistance. In particular, patterns which provide more surface area to provide engagement between the bushing and the polymer housing <b>114</b> or cover <b>116</b> may be preferred.

The second anti-torque feature <b>210</b> is an area of increased surface area on a second surface of the battery bushing which is spaced from the first anti-torque feature <b>208</b>. In particular, a second anti-torque feature <b>208</b> may be provided on or near the internal portion of the battery housing <b>114</b> or cover <b>116</b>, for example, on a bottom <b>312</b>, <b>412</b> or back surface or insertion end <b>304</b>, <b>404</b> of the bushing. The second anti-torque feature <b>210</b> may be an area of peaks and valleys, curves, or other undulations or surface roughening. In the illustrated example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, and <b>18</b></figref>, the second anti-torque feature <b>210</b> surrounds the terminal post connection area or segment <b>402</b>, which peaks <b>316</b>, valleys <b>318</b>, curves <b>320</b>, and/or undulations to form a variation in dimension on the surface, or otherwise a surface configured to increase the surface area. In one or more examples of embodiments, the second anti-torque feature <b>210</b> may cooperate with the first anti-torque feature <b>208</b> in the resistance to torque placed on the battery terminal and bushing. In this regard, the anti-torque features <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> may comprise, alone or in combination, a surface area of at least approximately 200 to 230 mm2, or more, on one or more surfaces of the battery bushing <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>. Use of additional surface area on surfaces which engage the polymer of the housing <b>114</b> or cover <b>116</b> provide a desired resistance to rotation.
