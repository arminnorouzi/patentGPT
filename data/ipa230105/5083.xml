With the advancement of science and technology and the continuous improvement of national grain storage methods, mycotoxins in grains primarily occur at pre-harvest. Before the harvest, the accumulation of mycotoxins occurs due to the fungal infection in grain crops during the field growth, the impact of farming methods, as well as unstable weather conditions, and varies in different regions and different years. Therefore, it is very important to predict the deoxynivalenol content of grains at pre-harvest, so as to implement targeted preventive measures to fundamentally reduce deoxynivalenol contamination in grains.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the prior art, most of the methods for predicting the deoxynivalenol content are predicting growth period data of the current year based on growth period data in previous years. However, if there is a large difference between the climatic data of the current year and the climatic data of the same time period in previous years, there may be a large error in the prediction result.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the prior art, there is also a static prediction method that performs prediction only at a single time point, thus often leading to an inaccurate prediction result.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The prior art further has the problem of an excessively large overhead time of the algorithm employed for multi-dimensional large-batch data.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The objective of the present application is to solve the defects in the prior art by providing a method and system for dynamically predicting a deoxynivalenol content of wheat at harvest.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present application provide the following technical solutions:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a first aspect, an embodiment of the application provides a method for predicting a deoxynivalenol content of wheat at harvest.
