Modern prime movers, such as internal combustion engines, electric prime mover systems, hybrid internal combustion engine systems including hybrid electric systems and hybrid pneumatic systems, and automotive applications thereof, such as high power haul trucks, are increasingly requiring more and more electrical and mechanical power for ancillary loads and accessories. For example, many engine systems require emissions treatment equipment, such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems and related components such as electrically heated diesel emissions fluid dosing components and catalyst heaters. Electrification of prime mover system accessories such as compressors, fans, pumps and other mechanical loads puts an increasing demand on electrical systems associated therewith. Furthermore, engine and other prime mover systems are experiencing ever increasing needs for multiple and differently configured accessory drives operable to provide rotational force in the form of torque applied to different types of mechanical loads. These and other systems put an increasing demand on the alternator at certain times during the duty cycle and can mean that existing alternators cannot output the electrical power required. Similarly, customers may prefer to have greater output for comfort and ancillary items in the cab such as global positioning system (GPS), heating, ventilation, air-conditioning and refrigeration (HVACR) systems and other power drawing devices. Many engine applications including, for example, high horsepower (HHP) off road haul trucks used in the mining industry are becoming increasingly more reliant on electrical power due to the range of ancillary loads that they now have to power during service. This increases power draw from the batteries and in turn the alternator of the haul truck engine, therefore requiring larger output alternators and controls effective to ensure that the electrical output needed is being met by the engine. Present approaches to providing increased electrical power suffer from a number of drawbacks and disadvantages. There remains a significant unmet need for the unique apparatuses, methods and systems disclosed herein.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For the purposes of clearly, concisely and exactly describing illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure, the manner and process of making and using the same, and to enable the practice, making and use of the same, reference will now be made to certain exemplary embodiments, including those illustrated in the figures, and specific language will be used to describe the same.

In general, process <b>500</b> reviews power or current demands and engages if further power or current supply is required through the changing electrical demand associated with the duty cycle and environment.
