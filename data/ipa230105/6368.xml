This crimp terminal includes a bent portion that extends from the crimp portion and is bent, and the protruding portion is easily manufactured due to being continuous with the bent portion. In addition, the protruding portion includes an extending portion that extends from the bent portion along the extending direction of the core wire and an intersection portion that extends in a direction that intersects the extending portion, and the intersection portion in particular is disposed to dig into the core wire in a crimped state. Thus, particularly if the core wire is made of an aluminum-based metal or the like, the oxide layer on the surface of the core wire is broken by the intersection portion to reduce the electrical resistance of the surface, and favorable electrical connection of the core wire is secured. In addition, in some crimp terminals such as those described above, a groove that extends along a direction orthogonal to the extending direction of the core wire is provided in the inner surface of the crimp portion (for example, see Patent Document 1 (FIGS. 23 to 25)).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent Document 1: JP 2018-085232A</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, there has been a problem with the above-described crimp terminal in that the core wire in a crimped state can easily come loose.
