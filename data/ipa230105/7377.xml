to a wireless earphone.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Currently, due to convenience and miniaturization, wireless earphones are quite popular with users, and are becoming more widely used. However, because an internal structure of a wireless earphone is comparatively small, how to reduce a volume occupied by an antenna and save internal space of a wireless earphone when disposing the antenna inside the wireless earphone is an urgent problem to be resolved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This application provides a wireless earphone. An antenna in the wireless earphone occupies a comparatively small volume, so that space in the wireless earphone is saved.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a wireless earphone. The wireless earphone has an earbud portion and a stalk portion. The earbud portion is connected to one end of the stalk portion. The earbud portion is configured with a speaker module. The stalk portion is configured with a battery. The wireless earphone includes a circuit board and a first antenna. The first antenna is a slot antenna. The circuit board extends from the earbud portion to an end, of the stalk portion, that is away from the earbud portion. The circuit board is connected to the speaker module and the battery. The circuit board includes a reference ground. The reference ground extends from one end of the circuit board to the other end of the circuit board. A slot is disposed on the reference ground to form a radiator of the slot antenna. The slot is located in the stalk portion and extends along a length direction of the stalk portion.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this embodiment of this application, an antenna in the wireless earphone includes the slot antenna, and the slot antenna is disposed on the circuit board configured to connect the speaker module and the battery. In other words, the antenna of the wireless earphone and the circuit board in the wireless earphone are integrated. This can prevent the antenna in the wireless earphone from occupying internal space of the wireless earphone. In addition, the antenna applicable to the wireless earphone can be obtained by disposing the slot on the circuit board, so that a structure is simple. This can simplify an internal structure of the wireless earphone, and simplify an assembly technique of the wireless earphone.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some implementations of this application, the slot antenna further includes a coupling stub. The coupling stub is located in the slot. An extension direction of the coupling stub is the same as the extension direction of the slot. A feed point is disposed on the coupling stub. A radio frequency signal is fed to the radiator of the slot antenna from the feed point. The coupling stub is disposed in the slot, so as to adjust an impedance of the slot antenna, so that the impedance of the slot antenna is close to 50&#x3a9;. In this way, the slot antenna can have comparatively good radiation performance.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some implementations of this application, the coupling stub extends from an end, of the slot, closer to the earbud portion to an end, of the slot, that is away from the earbud portion; and the feed point is located at an end, of the coupling stub, closer to the earbud portion. The feed point is located at the end, of the coupling stub, closer to the earbud portion, so as to reduce a transmission distance of a radio frequency signal and reduce a loss of the radio frequency signal on a transmission path.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some implementations of this application, the wireless earphone includes a microstrip. One end of the microstrip is electrically connected to the feed point. The microstrip is configured to transmit a radio frequency signal for the slot antenna. The microstrip includes a transmission portion and a coupling portion connected to the transmission portion. The coupling portion extends in the slot to form the coupling stub of the slot antenna. A partial structure of the microstrip configured to transmit a radio frequency signal forms the coupling stub, so that a quantity of structures electrically connecting the microstrip to the coupling stub can be reduced, thereby simplifying the internal structure of the wireless earphone, and simplifying the assembly technique of the wireless earphone.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some implementations of this application, a length of the slot is a quarter of a wavelength corresponding to an operating frequency band of the slot antenna, and an opening is disposed at one end of the slot. In this implementation, the opening is formed at one end of the slot, so that the slot antenna can have comparatively good antenna performance when the length of the slot is a quarter. The length of the slot is smaller than that of a slot whose length is a &#xbd; wavelength, and is more applicable to wireless earphones with comparatively small volumes.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some implementations of this application, the slot antenna includes a feed point. A radio frequency signal is fed to the radiator of the slot antenna from the feed point. The feed point is located at a periphery of the slot, and a distance between a location of the feed point and an end, of the slot, far away from the opening is a 1/20 wavelength. In this implementation, when the distance between the location of the feed point and the end, of the slot, far away from the opening is the 1/20 wavelength, an antenna impedance can be closer to 50&#x3a9;, thereby achieving a better antenna effect.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some implementations of this application, the stalk portion includes a connecting segment connected to the earbud portion, and a bottom segment located on one side of the connecting segment. An arrangement direction of the earbud portion and the connecting segment intersects an arrangement direction of the connecting segment and the bottom segment. The battery is located in the bottom segment. The circuit board includes a first section, a second section, and a third section that are sequentially connected. The first section is located at the earbud portion, the second section is located at the connecting segment, and the third section is located at the bottom segment. From a location at which the third section is connected to the second section, the slot is formed in a direction in which the third section extends away from the second section. A sum of electrical lengths of the first section and the second section is greater than or equal to a &#xbc; wavelength. An electrical length of the third section is greater than or equal to the &#xbc; wavelength. In this implementation, the sum of the electrical lengths of the first section and the second section of the circuit board is approximately the &#xbc; wavelength or greater than the &#xbc; wavelength, so that a &#xbd; wavelength mode generated by the circuit board can be excited, thereby achieving comparatively high radiation efficiency. In some implementations of this application, the stalk portion includes a connecting segment connected to the earbud portion, and a top segment and bottom segment that are located on two sides of the connecting segment. An arrangement direction of the earbud portion and the connecting segment intersects an arrangement direction of the connecting segment and the bottom segment and top segment. The battery is located in the bottom segment. The wireless earphone further includes a second antenna. The second antenna is located in the top segment. A radiator of the second antenna includes a feeding end and an extreme end far away from the feeding end. The feeding end is closer to the connecting segment than the extreme end.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The second antenna is added to the top segment of the wireless earphone, where the feeding end of the second antenna is closer to the connecting segment and the extreme end is far away from the feeding end, so that a direction of an antenna current generated by the circuit board through excitation by the second antenna can be a direction from the feeding end to the extreme end, to obtain a second equivalent current intersecting a first equivalent current generated by the circuit board through excitation by the slot antenna. In this way, an antenna directivity pattern of the slot antenna and an antenna directivity pattern of the second antenna can be complementary to each other, thereby improving received signal strength of the wireless earphone in each angle. Compared with a wireless earphone having only a single antenna, the wireless earphone in this application may have a plurality of polarization manners (for example, vertical polarization and horizontal polarization) of a received signal, and the slot antenna and the second antenna may be designed for different polarizations, so that good signal strength can be obtained regardless of which polarization manner is used for a received signal. A probability of matching a polarization manner of the wireless earphone and a manner of arrival can be improved, thereby improving received signal strength. In addition, the directivity patterns of the slot antenna and the second antenna are complementary to each other, and the slot antenna and the second antenna can be designed for different polarizations, so as to avoid a received signal with strong interference. When quality of a signal received by one antenna is poor, receiving may be switched to the other antenna, thereby improving received signal strength.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some implementations of this application, the slot antenna excites the circuit board to generate the first equivalent current, and a direction of the first equivalent current is from the end, of the stalk portion, that is away from the earbud portion to an end, of the earbud portion, that is away from the stalk portion; and the second antenna excites the circuit board to generate the second equivalent current, and a direction of the second equivalent current intersects the direction of the first equivalent current.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some implementations of this application, the circuit board includes a first section, a second section, and a third section that are sequentially connected. The first section is located at the earbud portion, the second section is located at the connecting segment, and the third section is located at the bottom segment. An electrical length of the radiator of the second antenna is a &#xbc; wavelength, and an electrical length of the first section is the &#xbc; wavelength.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some implementations of this application, the slot antenna includes the feed point, the feed point is located at an end, of the third section, closer to the second section, the feeding end of the second antenna is close to an end, of the second section, that is away from the third section, and an electrical length of the second section of the circuit board is the &#xbc; wavelength. The feed point of the slot antenna is located at the end, of the third section, closer to the second section, and a feed point of the second antenna is close to the end, of the second section, that is away from the third section. Therefore, when the second section has a specific electrical length (for example, the &#xbc; wavelength), isolation between the slot antenna and the second section can be raised, so that both the slot antenna and the second antenna have good antenna performance.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some implementations, the direction of the second equivalent current is from the end, of the earbud portion, that is away from the stalk portion to the extreme end, and the direction of the first equivalent current is orthogonal to the direction of the second equivalent current.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some implementations of this application, an electrical length of the third section of the circuit board is the &#xbc; wavelength. In this implementation, the electrical lengths of the first section, the second section, and the third section of the circuit board are all approximately the &#xbc; wavelength. Therefore, an electrical length of the circuit board from the feed point of the second antenna to a side of the third section is a sum of the electrical lengths of the second section and the third section, and is close to a half wavelength; and an electrical length of the circuit board from the feed point of the second antenna to a side of the first section is the electrical length of the first section, and is close to the &#xbc; wavelength. Therefore, an antenna impedance formed by the circuit board from the feed point of the second antenna to the side of the third section is a high impedance, and an antenna impedance formed by the circuit board from the feed point of the second antenna to the side of the first section is a low impedance (close to 50&#x3a9; in this embodiment). A ground current of the second antenna is mainly distributed on the first section of the circuit board, and a direction of the ground current is from an end, of the first section, that is away from the second section to the feeding end. Therefore, the second antenna can excite generation of a common mode, and can generate the second equivalent current approximately orthogonal to the first equivalent current, so that the antenna directivity pattern of the slot antenna and the antenna directivity pattern of the second antenna can better complement each other, thereby improving received signal strength of the wireless earphone in each angle. In addition, polarization directions of the slot antenna and the second antenna may be orthogonal, so that good signal strength can be obtained regardless of which polarization manner is used for a received signal. A probability of matching a polarization manner of the wireless earphone and a manner of arrival can be improved, thereby improving received signal strength. In addition, the directivity patterns of the slot antenna and the second antenna are complementary to each other, and the slot antenna and the second antenna can be designed for different polarizations, so as to avoid a received signal with strong interference. When quality of a signal received by one antenna is poor, receiving may be switched to the other antenna, thereby improving received signal strength.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some implementations of this application, the second section of the circuit board is disposed in the connecting segment in a bent manner, so as to ensure the electrical length of the second section, and reduce a size of internal space, of the wireless earphone, occupied by the second section.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some implementations of this application, the wireless earphone includes an antenna support, the antenna support is located in the top segment, and the radiator of the second antenna is disposed around the antenna support, so as to ensure an electrical length of the radiator of the second antenna, and reduce a size of internal space, of the wireless earphone, occupied by the second antenna.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some implementations, the second antenna is a monopole antenna or an inverted F antenna.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some implementations of this application, the wireless earphone includes a radio frequency front-end circuit. The radio frequency front-end circuit is coupled to the slot antenna and the second antenna, and is configured to transmit radio frequency signals to the slot antenna and the second antenna or process radio frequency signals received by the slot antenna and the second antenna. The radio frequency front-end circuit includes an switching switch, and the switching switch is configured to switch the radio frequency front-end circuit to couple to the slot antenna or the second antenna.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The radio frequency front-end circuit in this implementation includes the switching switch, and uses a switched-diversity design, to switch, based on an actual requirement, to connecting to the slot antenna or the second antenna, thereby improving received signal strength. It may be understood that, with the radio frequency front-end circuit and the antenna in this embodiment, whether to use the slot antenna or the second antenna to transmit a signal can also be selected based on an actual requirement, so as to transmit a signal with comparatively high signal strength.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some implementations of this application, the wireless earphone includes a radio frequency front-end circuit, the radio frequency front-end circuit includes a first transceiver circuit and a second transceiver circuit, the first transceiver circuit is coupled to the slot antenna, and the second transceiver circuit is coupled to the second antenna.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The radio frequency front-end circuit in this implementation includes two transceiver circuits. The two transceiver circuits can simultaneously receive and process signals received by the slot antenna and the second antenna, thereby simultaneously receiving received signals in different transmission directions or different polarization directions, so as to improve received signal strength.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to a second aspect, some embodiments of this application further provide a wireless earphone.

This can prevent the antenna in the wireless earphone from occupying internal space of the wireless earphone. In addition, the antenna applicable to the wireless earphone can be obtained by disposing the slot on the circuit board, so that a structure is simple. This can simplify an internal structure of the wireless earphone, and simplify an assembly technique of the wireless earphone.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

In this way, clearance of the slot antenna is ensured, so that the slot antenna has good performance.

To ensure clearance of the slot antenna, a distance between the circuit board <b>20</b> and the battery <b>50</b> is at least greater than 0.1 mm. The distance between the circuit board <b>20</b> and the battery <b>50</b> is a distance from the circuit board <b>20</b> to a metal housing of the battery <b>50</b>. In some embodiments, an insulating cement material layer may be disposed between the circuit board <b>20</b> and the metal housing of the battery <b>20</b>, to use the insulating material layer to achieve stability of the circuit board <b>20</b> relative to the battery <b>50</b> and ensure a specific gap between the circuit board <b>20</b> and the battery <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">An antenna of the wireless earphone <b>100</b> in this embodiment of this application is the slot antenna, and the slot antenna is characterized by an ultra-low profile.

This can prevent the antenna in the wireless earphone <b>100</b> from occupying internal space of the wireless earphone <b>100</b>. In addition, in this embodiment, the antenna applicable to the wireless earphone <b>100</b> can be obtained by disposing the slot <b>27</b> on the circuit board <b>100</b>, so that a structure is simple. This can simplify an internal structure of the wireless earphone <b>100</b>, and simplify an assembly technique of the wireless earphone <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this embodiment, a length of the slot <b>27</b> is a &#xbc; wavelength. An opening <b>271</b> is disposed at one end of the slot <b>27</b>, so as to meet a boundary condition of the slot antenna whose length is the &#xbc; wavelength, thereby ensuring that the slot antenna can have comparatively good radiation performance. It should be noted that each &#xbc; wavelength in this application is a quarter of a wavelength corresponding to an operating frequency band of the antenna, each &#x215b; wavelength in this application is one eighth of the wavelength corresponding to the operating frequency band of the antenna, and each 1/20 wavelength in this application is one twentieth of the wavelength corresponding to the operating frequency band of the antenna. For example, that the length of the slot <b>27</b> is the &#xbc; wavelength in this embodiment means that the length of the slot <b>27</b> is a quarter of the wavelength corresponding to the operating frequency band of the slot antenna. In this embodiment, the operating frequency band generated through resonance of a radiation part of the slot antenna is a Bluetooth frequency band (approximately 2.4 GHz), to implement Bluetooth communication of the wireless antenna <b>100</b>. Therefore, in this embodiment, the length of the slot <b>27</b> is approximately 20 mm, which is a quarter of a wavelength corresponding to the Bluetooth frequency band. A width of the slot <b>27</b> is as large as possible under width limitation of the reference ground <b>202</b>, but is far smaller than the length of the slot <b>27</b>. Optionally, the width of the slot <b>27</b> may be approximately 0.5 mm. A length direction of the slot <b>27</b> is the extension direction of the slot <b>27</b> on the circuit board <b>20</b> (the Z direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), and a width direction of the slot <b>27</b> is perpendicular to the length direction. It may be understood that the wireless earphone may alternatively communicate with another structure by using another antenna mode such as Wi-Fi. When the wireless earphone communicates with another structure by using another antenna mode such as Wi-Fi, the length of the slot <b>27</b> needs to be correspondingly changed. For example, when the wireless earphone communicates with another structure by using Wi-Fi, the length of the slot <b>27</b> is approximately a quarter of an operating wavelength of a Wi-Fi frequency band. It may be understood that, in some embodiments, the length of the slot <b>27</b> may be alternatively &#xbd; of the wavelength corresponding to the operating frequency band of the slot antenna. In this case, the opening <b>271</b> does not need to be disposed at one end of the slot <b>27</b>, that is, the slot <b>27</b> is a structure whose two ends are closed, so as to ensure that the slot antenna can have comparatively good radiation performance.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The slot antenna further includes a feed point A.

One end of the microstrip is electrically connected to the radio frequency front-end circuit of the chip <b>30</b>, and the other end of the microstrip extends to the feed point A of the slot antenna. In this way, the radio frequency front-end circuit can feed a radio frequency signal into the radiator of the slot antenna from the feed point A, and the radiator of the slot antenna can also feed a received radio frequency signal into the radio frequency front-end circuit through the feed point A. In this embodiment of this application, the microstrip connecting the radio frequency front-end circuit and the feed point A of the slot antenna may be replaced with another signal cable. For example, the signal cable may be alternatively a coaxial line, a strip line, or a common metal trace.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The feed point A may be located on the reference ground <b>202</b> and close to an edge of the slot <b>27</b>.

When the feed point A is located at the location, an antenna impedance may be closer to 50&#x3a9;, thereby achieving a better antenna effect.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In this embodiment, the slot <b>27</b> is disposed on the third section <b>26</b> of the circuit board <b>20</b>, the length of the slot <b>27</b> is approximately the &#xbc; wavelength, and generally, an electrical length of the third section <b>26</b> is approximately the &#xbc; wavelength. A current generated by the circuit board through excitation by the slot antenna <b>27</b> is concentrated mainly on two sides of the slot, and a current generated through excitation at another location is comparatively small. Therefore, a length at a location, other than that of the slot <b>27</b>, on the third section <b>26</b> has comparatively slight impact on the slot antenna. Therefore, a length at a location, other than that of the slot <b>27</b>, on the circuit board <b>20</b> may be correspondingly changed based on an actual requirement. For example, the electrical length of the third section <b>26</b> may be slightly greater than the &#xbc; wavelength, to ensure that one end of the third section <b>26</b> can be connected to the battery, and the other end of the third section <b>26</b> is connected to the second section <b>25</b>. A sum of electrical lengths of the first section <b>24</b> and the second section <b>25</b> of the circuit board <b>20</b> is approximately the &#xbc; wavelength or greater than the &#xbc; wavelength, so that a &#xbd; wavelength mode generated by the circuit board <b>20</b> can be excited, thereby achieving comparatively high radiation efficiency. For example, an electrical length of the second section <b>25</b> may be 0, and an electrical length of the first section <b>24</b> may be the &#xbc; wavelength; or each of an electrical length of the second section <b>25</b> and an electrical length of the first section <b>24</b> may be the &#x215b; wavelength; or each of an electrical length of the second section <b>25</b> and an electrical length of the first section <b>24</b> may be the &#xbc; wavelength.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">It may be understood that, in some embodiments, the wireless earphone may not include the stalk portion <b>2</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>is a schematic diagram of a structure of a wireless earphone <b>100</b> according to another embodiment of this application.
