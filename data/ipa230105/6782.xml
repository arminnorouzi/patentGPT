It is to perform study and, if needed, specify extension of Type II CSI feedback to rank&#x3e;2. Second, it is to provide enhancements on multi-TRP/panel transmission including improved reliability and robustness with both ideal and non-ideal backhaul. In particular, it is to specify downlink control signaling enhancement(s) for efficient support of non-coherent joint transmission. It is to perform study and, if needed, specify enhancements on uplink control signaling and/or reference signal(s) for non-coherent joint transmission.

The communication environment <b>100</b> includes a network device <b>110</b> and a terminal device <b>120</b> served by the network device <b>110</b>. The serving area of the network device <b>110</b> may be called as a cell <b>102</b>. In the communication environment <b>100</b>, the network device <b>110</b> can transmit data and control information to the terminal device <b>120</b>, and the terminal device <b>120</b> can also transmit data and control information to the network device <b>110</b>. A communication link from the network device <b>110</b> to the terminal device <b>120</b> is referred to as a downlink (DL) or a forward link, whereas a communication link from the terminal device <b>120</b> to the network device <b>110</b> is referred to as an uplink (UL) or a reverse link.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the network device <b>110</b> is coupled with two TRPs <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>, and may communicate with the terminal device <b>120</b> via the two TRPs <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>. For example, in a repeated transmission between the network <b>110</b> and the terminal device <b>120</b>, such as in a multi-TRP URLLC transmission, the network device <b>110</b> may transmit or receive the same data <b>140</b> via the TRP <b>131</b> and the TRP <b>132</b>. As used herein, the data <b>140</b> may include any data that can be transmitted between the network device <b>110</b> and the terminal device <b>120</b>, including user plane data, control plane data, or the like. For example, the data <b>140</b> may be a Transport Block (TB) or a packet. In the following, the TRP <b>131</b> may also be referred to as a first TRP, while the TRP <b>132</b> may also be referred to as a second TRP. The first and second TRPs <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> may be included in a same serving cell (such as, the cell <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) or different serving cells provided by the network device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the first and second TRPs <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> may be explicitly associated with different higher-layer configured identities. For example, a higher-layer configured index can be associated with a pre-defined Control Resource Set (CORESET), a pre-defined reference signal (RS), or a pre-defined Transmission Configuration Indication (TCI) state, which is used to differentiate between transmissions between different TRPs and the terminal device <b>120</b>. When the terminal device <b>120</b> receives two DCIs from two CORESETs which are associated with different higher-layer configured identities, the two DCIs are indicated from different TRPs. Further, the first and second TRPs <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> may be implicitly identified by a dedicated configuration to the physical channels or signals. For example, a dedicated CORESET, a RS, and a TCI state, which are associated with a TRP, are used to identify a transmission from a different TRP to the terminal device <b>120</b>. For example, when the terminal device <b>120</b> receives a DCI from a dedicated CORESET, the DCI is indicated from the associated TRP dedicated by the CORESET.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the repeated transmission or reception via the two TRPs <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>, the network device <b>110</b> may use a repetition scheme among a number of available repetition schemes. The repetition scheme may specify a transmission manner for the network device <b>110</b> to use the two TRPs <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> cooperatively, for example, a multiplexing scheme between the two TRPs <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>, the respective resource allocations for the two TRPs <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>, or the like.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, to facilitate further down-selection for one or more schemes in the 3GPP meeting RAN1 #96bis, some schemes for multi-TRP based URLLC scheduled by single DCI at least are clarified as following.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Scheme 1 (SDM): n (n&#x3c;=N<sub>s</sub>) TCI states within the single slot, with overlapped time and frequency resource allocation.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Scheme 1a: Each transmission occasion is a layer or a set of layers of the same TB, with each layer or layer set is associated with one TCI and one set of DMRS port(s).

From the UE perspective, different coded bits are mapped to different layers or layer sets with the same mapping rule as in Rel-15.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Scheme 1b: Each transmission occasion is a layer or a set of layers of the same TB, with each layer or layer set is associated with one TCI and one set of DMRS port(s). Single codeword with one RV is used for each spatial layer or layer set. The RVs corresponding to each spatial layer or layer set can be the same or different.

As such, the most appropriate frequency density of the PT-RSs can be determined for each resource subset. To this end, the network device <b>110</b> or the terminal device <b>120</b> may determine, for each of the resource subsets, a frequency density of the PT-RSs based on the number of resources in the resource subset. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, it is assumed that the number of resources (for example, PRBs) assigned/associated to TCI state A (the resource subset <b>310</b>) is N<sub>RB_a</sub>, and the number of resources (for example, PRBs) assigned/associated to TCI state B (the resource subset <b>320</b>) is N<sub>RB_b</sub>. For example, the total number of resource blocks or the scheduled bandwidth for the PDSCH scheduled by the single DCI may be N<sub>RB</sub>. For example, N<sub>RB_a</sub>+N<sub>RB_b</sub>=N<sub>RB</sub>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0077">Therefore, the frequency density of the PT-RSs in the resource subset <b>310</b> can be determined based on N<sub>RB_a</sub>, and the frequency density of the PT-RS in the resource subset <b>320</b> can be determined based on N<sub>RB_b</sub>. For instance, based on Table 5.1.6.3-2 as defined in the 3GPP TS 38.214, the PT-RS frequency density in the resource subset <b>310</b> can be decided by replacing the parameter &#x201c;N<sub>RB</sub>&#x201d; with &#x201c;N<sub>RB_a</sub>,&#x201d; and the PT-RS frequency density in the resource subset <b>320</b> can be decided by replacing the parameter &#x201c;N<sub>RB</sub>&#x201d; with &#x201c;N<sub>RB_b</sub>.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0081" num="0078">As another example of the first option, the PT-RS resource offset can be configured for the resource subsets independently. As such, the most appropriate PT-RS resource offset can be determined for each resource subset. To this end, the network device <b>110</b> or the terminal device <b>120</b> may determine, for each of the resource subsets and based on the number of resources, the frequency density and an identifier of the terminal device, an offset between a starting resource for the mapping and the resource with the lowest frequency in the resource subset. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the PT-RS resource offset in the resource subset <b>310</b> can be determined based on N<sub>RB_a</sub>, and the PT-RS resource offset in the resource subset <b>320</b> can be determined based on N<sub>RB_b</sub>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0079">More specifically, based on the below formula (1) as defined in section 7.4.1.2.2 of 3GPP TS 38.211, the PT-RS resource offset in the resource subset <b>310</b> can be decided by replacing the parameter &#x201c;N<sub>RB</sub>&#x201d; with &#x201c;N<sub>RB_a</sub>,&#x201d; and the PT-RS resource offset in resource subset <b>320</b> can be decided by replacing the parameter &#x201c;N<sub>RB</sub>&#x201d; with &#x201c;N<sub>RB_b</sub>.&#x201d; Other parameters in the
