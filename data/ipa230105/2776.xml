More specifically, the present invention relates to modification of the translation of a nucleotide of interest which is encoded by a viral vector, in a viral vector production cell.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Gene therapy broadly involves the use of genetic material to treat disease. It includes the supplementation in cells with defective genes (e.g. those harbouring mutations) with functional copies of those genes, the inactivation of improperly functioning genes and the introduction of new therapeutic genes.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Therapeutic genetic material may be incorporated into the target cells of a host using vectors to enable the transfer of nucleic acids. Such vectors can be generally divided into viral and non-viral categories.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Viruses naturally introduce their genetic material into target cells of a host as part of their replication cycle. Engineered viral vectors harness this ability to enable the delivery of a nucleotide of interest (NOI) or transgene to a target cell. To date, a number of viruses have been engineered as vectors for gene therapy. These include retroviruses, adenoviruses (AdV), adeno-associated viruses (AAV), herpes simplex viruses (HSV) and vaccinia viruses.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to modification to carry the NOI, viral vectors are typically further engineered to be replication defective. As such, the recombinant vectors can directly infect a target cell, but are incapable of producing further generations of infective virions. Other types of viral vectors may be conditionally replication competent within cancer cells only, and may additionally encode a toxic transgene or pro-enzyme.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Retroviral vectors have been developed as therapies for various genetic disorders and are now showing increasing promise in clinical trials (e.g. Galy, A. and A. J. Thrasher (2010) <i>Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol </i>11(6): 545-550; Porter, D. L., B. L. Levine, M. Kalos, A. Bagg and C. H. June (2011) <i>N Engl J Med </i>365(8): 725-733; Campochiaro, P. A.

Aubourg (2012) <i>Methods Enzymol </i>507: 187-198; Sadelain, M., I. Riviere, X. Wang, F. Boulad, S. Prockop, P. Giardina, A. Maggio, R. Galanello, F. Locatelli and E. Yannaki (2010) <i>Ann N Y Acad Sci </i>1202: 52-58; DiGiusto, D. L., A. Krishnan, L. Li, H. Li, S. Li, A. Rao, S. Mi, P. Yam, S. Stinson, M. Kalos, J. Alvarnas, S. F. Lacey, J. K. Yee, M. Li, L.

(2013) <i>Expert opinion in biological therapy</i>).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Important examples of such vectors include the gamma-retrovirus vector system (based on MMLV), the primate lentivirus vector system (based on HIV-1) and the non-primate lentivirus vector system (based on EIAV).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Reverse genetics has allowed these virus-based vectors to be heavily engineered such that vectors encoding large heterologous sequences (circa 10 kb) can be produced by transfection of mammalian cells with appropriate DNA sequences (reviewed in Bannert, K. (2010) Caister Academic Press: 347-370).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Engineering and use of retroviral vectors at the research stage typically involves the production of reporter-gene vectors encoding, for example, GFP or lacZ. The titres of these clinically irrelevant vectors are usually in the region of 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>to 1&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>transducing units per mL (TU/mL) of crude harvest material. Further concentration and purification of this material can achieve working stocks in excess of 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>TU/mL. However, the production of vectors encoding therapeutically relevant NOIs often results in substantially reduced titres compared to these reporter vectors.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">There are several factors that are potentially responsible for this effect:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">1. The size of the therapeutic genome. Very large genomes can be packaged by retroviruses, but it is thought that reverse transcription and/or integration steps become less efficient as size increases.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0012">2. The stability of vector genome RNA. This may be reduced by the presence of unpredicted instability elements in the NOI.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0013">3. Suboptimal nucleotide usage within the vector genome RNA. Wild-type virus genomes often have a certain nucleotide bias (e.g. HIV-1 is AT rich). Vector genomes tend to be less AT rich, which may affect packaging and/or post-maturation steps.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0014">4. Expression of the NOI in viral vector production cells. (Over-)expressed protein may have an indirect or direct effect on vector virion assembly and/or infectivity.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">It has been empirically shown that expression of the protein encoded by the NOI within viral vector production cells can adversely affect therapeutic vector titres (described in WO2015/092440).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">Incorporation of a protein encoded by the NOI (the protein of interest, POI) into vector virions may also impact downstream processing of vector particles; for example, an NOI encoding a transmembrane POI may lead to high surface expression of the transmembrane protein in the viral vector virion, potentially altering the physical properties of the virions. Furthermore, this incorporation may present the POI to the patient's immune system at the site of delivery, which may negatively impact transduction and/or the long-term expression of the therapeutic gene in vivo. The NOI could also induce the production of undesirable secondary proteins or metabolites which could impact production, purification, recovery and immunogenicity and it is therefore desirable to minimise this.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">The capability to repress the expression of a NOI in viral vector production cells while maintaining effective expression of the NOI in target cells is also desirable. Whatever mechanism is employed, the &#x2018;natural&#x2019; pathway of assembly and resulting functionality of the viral vector particles must not be impeded. This is not straightforward because the viral vector genome molecule that will be packaged into virions must necessarily encode the NOI expression cassette. In other words, because the vector genome molecule and NOI expression cassettes are operably linked, modification of the NOI expression cassette may have adverse consequences on the ability to produce the vector genome molecule in the cell. For example, if a physical transcription block (e.g. TetR repressor system) is used to repress the NOI expression cassette it is likely that production of the vector genome molecule would also be inhibited through steric hindrance. In addition, control mechanism modifications must also not adversely affect the functionality of the vector genome molecule after virion maturation and release (i.e. with regards to directing transduction of the target cell). For example, a retroviral vector genome RNA molecule must be capable of the processes of reverse transcription and integration&#x2014;any modification to the NOI expression cassette must not impede these steps in the transduction process.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">Repression of NOI expression within viral vector production cells may present further advantages. If NOI expression leads to a reduction in the viability of vector production cells, its repression may benefit manufacturing at large scale which requires large cell numbers. The reduction in cell debris due to cell death would also reduce impurities within the crude vector harvest material. Processing, purification and concentration of the vector platform (i.e. different therapeutic genes encoded within the same vector system) could be standardised; if the only heterologous genes expressed within viral vector production cells are those required for vector production, downstream processing could be more easily optimised for an entire platform of therapeutic vectors, resulting in very similar physical specifications of vector preparations. Variability of immune response to, and toxicity of, resulting vectors in vivo may be minimised, which may lead to more persistent therapeutic NOI expression in the target cells.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">Tissue-specific promoters which limit expression of the NOI in production cells are a possible solution to this problem, although leakiness of these promoters might lead to adverse levels of transgene protein. However, greater and more robust expression of the NOI in target cells can be achieved using constitutive promoters. Indeed, such robust expression may be required for efficacy in vivo. In addition, tissue-specific promoters may be less predictable when following a therapeutic vector product through animal models and into humans during pre-clinical and clinical development.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">WO2015/092440 (incorporated herein by reference) discloses the use of a heterologous translation control system in eukaryotic cell cultures to repress the translation of the NOI (repress transgene expression) during viral vector production and thus repress or prevent expression of the protein encoded by the NOI. This system is referred to as the Transgene Repression In vector Production cell system or TRIP system. In one form, the TRIP system utilises the bacterial trp operon regulation protein, tryptophan RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP), and the TRAP binding site/sequence (tbs) to mediate transgene repression. Surprisingly, the use of this system does not impede the production of packageable vector genome molecules nor the activity of vector virions, and does not interfere with the long-term expression of the NOI in the target cell.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0021">The present invention relates to modifications made to the transgene mRNA that enable improved levels of translation repression by TRAP, which may be used to improve the TRIP system.

Surprisingly, it is found that when compared to leader sequences from other promoters, use of such a leader sequence leads to improved levels of repression of the transgene by TRAP-tbs (TRAP denoted by doughnut shape). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is presumed that such a leader sequence enables a more stable TRAP-tbs complex such that inhibition of ribosome scanning is maximised.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

Enhanced repression by TRAP-tbs when using the L33 Improved leader sequence compared to a variety of constitutive promoters containing native UTR sequences.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0115">A. A schematic indicating the organization of the GFP test reporter plasmids. The 5&#x2032;UTR comprised the identical tbs sequence and other elements, except for the different promoters utilized, and the different leader sequences upstream of the tbs (these are shown in Panel I of Table I). Note (as per Table I), the intron-containing EF1a (EF1a) and UBC promoters considered directly comparable to their &#x2018;short&#x2019;, intron-less counterparts EFS and UBCs respectively because the intron sequences will not be present in mRNA. The 34nt leader was present within the CMV promoter-containing reporter as a control (this was previously been shown to enable &#x3e;100-fold repression by TRAP-tbs). The other constitutive promoters contained leaders that comprised native leader sequence as well as some synthetic sequence, or were engineered in this study to harbor the L33 Improved leader sequence, which is derived from Exon 1 of the EF1a promoter.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0116">B. The reporters were tested for non-repressed or repressed levels of GFP expression by co-transfection of the reporter plasmids with either pBlueScript (No TRAP) or pEF1&#x3b1;-TRAP (TRAP), respectively. Transfected HEK293T cells (suspension, serum-free) were analysed by flow cytometry two days post-transfection, and GFP Expression scores (% GFP&#xd7;median fluorescence intensity) generated and log-10 transformed. The data in the chart is displayed by general promoter strength (No TRAP levels) from left to right, and compared to Mock transfected (pBlueScript only) or untransfected cells (UNT). In each case where the native leader is compared to the L33 Improved leader, the L33 Improved leader enables substantially lower levels of GFP expression in the presence of TRAP&#x2014;enabling &#x3e;10-fold improvement in repression by TRAP-tbs. In most cases, the non-repressed levels of GFP expressed were also slightly improved when using the L33 Improved leader.

The MCS variant reporter constructs were driven by the EFS promoter and contained the L33 Improved leader, whereas the &#x2018;No MCS&#x2019; control reporter construct was driven by the CMV promoter and harbored the original 34nt leader (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> to perform similarly to the L33 Improved leader).

A A schematic of a TRiP&#x2032; lentiviral vector genome encoding an EF1a-GFP transgene cassette, wherein the TRAP binding site (tbs) is positioned within the 5&#x2032;UTR of the cassette (supply of TRAP during vector production reduces transgene expression levels). During production of MSD-2KO lentiviral vectors, the full length, unspliced packagable vRNA and transgene mRNA are the main forms of cytoplasmic RNA produced from the lentiviral vector cassette (i) (when the transgene promoter is active during production). However, the promiscuous activity of the MSD in standard lentiviral vector genomes leads to additional &#x2018;aberrant&#x2019; splice products that may encode the transgene (ii); this could occur independently of the internal transgene promoter i.e. a tissue specific promoter.

Relative to the total amount of GFP produced in cultures during standard lentiviral vector production, the MSD-2KO modification had the substantial effect of reducing the amount of GFP produced even in the absence of TRAP (&#x2dc;5-fold). Accordingly, the repressive effects of TRAP were augmented by use of the MSD-2KO lentiviral vector genome, leading to much lower levels of GFP in cultures.

E., Dodson G, Greaves R B, Chen X, Gollnick P. (1999) <i>Nature </i>401(6750): 235-242). It is activated to interact with RNA by binding up to 11 molecules of tryptophan in pockets between neighbouring subunits. The target RNA is wound around the outside of this quaternary ring structure (Babitzke P, S. J., Shire S J, Yanofsky C. (1994) <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry </i>269: 16597-16604).</p><p id="p-0153" num="0161">Without wishing to be bound by theory, in the natural mechanism of sensing and controlling tryptophan synthesis, TRAP is understood to act at the level of transcription termination by binding to a binding site in the newly synthesised RNA leader. This destabilises an overlapping anti-terminator sequence such that a downstream rho-independent terminator is active, leading to the production of only short RNAs. When tryptophan is limiting within the bacterium, the TRAP ring can no longer bind to its RNA binding site. Accordingly, the anti-terminator is activated and transcription continues into the tryptophan synthesis gene operon. TRAP can also act at the translational level: tryptophan-dependent binding of TRAP to its binding site in the 5&#x2032;-UTR of the RNA transcript liberates an anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence, this forms a stable stem with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence so that ribosome initiation of translation is repressed. Finally, in other contexts when TRAP is bound to its tbs it is capable of repressing translation initiation by physically blocking the 40S scanning ribosome complex before it can reach the initiation codon, whereupon the more stable and higher-affinity translation machinery would otherwise form.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0162">The TRAP open-reading frame may be codon-optimised for expression in mammalian (e.g. <i>Homo sapiens</i>) cells, since the bacterial gene sequence is likely to be non-optimal for expression in mammalian cells. The sequence may also be optimised by removing potential unstable sequences and splicing sites. The use of a HIS-tag C-terminally expressed on the TRAP protein appears to offer a benefit in terms of translation repression and may optionally be used. This C-terminal HIS-tag may improve solubility or stability of the TRAP within eukaryotic cells, although an improved functional benefit cannot be excluded.

Whilst the KAGNN consensus sequence may be varied to maintain TRAP-mediated repression, preferably the precise sequence chosen may be optimised to ensure high levels of translation in the non-repressed state. For example, the tbs sequences may be optimised by removing splicing sites, unstable sequences or stem-loops that might hamper translation efficiency of the mRNA in the absence of TRAP (i.e. in target cells).

Such an interaction with an RNA-binding protein such as TRAP results in the repression or prevention of translation of a NOI to which the nucleic acid binding site (e.g. the tbs or portion thereof) is operably linked.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0206">By &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; it is to be understood that the components described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner.

As a further example, 0 to 13 nucleotides may be used to separate the TRAP-binding site or portion thereof and the translation initiation codon.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0208">The tbs or portion thereof may be placed downstream of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to repress translation of the NOI in a multicistronic mRNA. Indeed, this supplies further evidence that tbs-bound TRAP might block the passage of the 40S ribosome; IRES elements function to sequester the 40S ribosome subunit to an mRNA in a CAP-independent manner before the full translation complex is formed (see Thompson, S. (2012) Trends in Microbiology 20(11): 558-566) for a review on IRES translation initiation). Thus, it is possible for the TRIP system to repress multiple open-reading frames from a single mRNA expressed from viral vector genomes. This will be a useful feature of the TRIP system when producing vectors encoding multiple therapeutic genes, especially when all the transgene products might negatively affect vector titres to some degree.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0209">In one embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence comprises a spacer sequence between an IRES and the tbs or the portion thereof.

In addition, all of the tested overlapping Kozak and tbs sequences unexpectedly directed efficient levels of translation initiation, i.e. the tested overlapping sequences provided similar levels of transgene expression to the non-overlapping Kozak and tbs sequences in the absence of TRAP. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the improved levels of repression can be attributed to improved occlusion of the transgene initiation codon by the TRAP-tbs complex when the tbs or portion thereof overlaps the Kozak sequence.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0216">The term &#x201c;Kozak sequence&#x201d; is to be understood as a consensus sequence in eukaryotic mRNA which is recognised by the ribosome as the translational start site. The Kozak sequence includes the ATG initiation (start) codon in DNA (AUG in mRNA). The exact Kozak sequence present in eukaryotic mRNA determines the efficiency of translation initiation, i.e. certain Kozak sequences will not lead to efficient translation initiation.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0217">The full Kozak sequence is typically understood to have the consensus sequence (gcc)gccRccATGG for DNA and (gcc)gccRccAUGG for RNA, wherein: a lowercase letter denotes the most common base at a position where the base at this position can vary; an uppercase letter denotes a highly conserved base at this position; &#x201c;R&#x201d; denotes that a purine (i.e. A or G) is typically optimal at this position; and the sequence in parentheses (gcc) is of uncertain significance. T/U is generally the least preferred nucleotide at all of the positions of the Kozak sequence consensus that are upstream of the initiation codon.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0218">As the first three bases of the full Kozak sequence are of uncertain significance, the Kozak sequence can also be understood to have the consensus sequence, referred to herein as the &#x201c;extended Kozak sequence&#x201d;, GNNRVVATGG for DNA (SEQ ID NO: 27) and GNNRVVAUGG for RNA, wherein &#x201c;R&#x201d; is to be understood as specifying a purine (i.e. A or G) at that position in the sequence, &#x201c;V&#x201d; is to be understood as specifying any nucleotide from G, A, or C and &#x201c;N&#x201d; is to be understood as specifying any nucleotide at that position in the sequence.

From the outset of this work, it was not known what would be the achievable level of repression mediated by TRAP-tbs, when the tbs is inserted into native UTRs of a variety of constitutive promoters. Ideally, it would be advantageous to be able to supply a single conserved 5&#x2032;UTR leader sequence together with the tbs when modifying the promoter of choice in order to avoid any of the potential variability in repression levels that might be directed by native 5&#x2032;UTR sequences. Surprisingly, it was found that the first exon of the EF1a promoter (SEQ ID NO: 25) provides consistently good levels of transgene repression by TRAP compared to 5&#x2032;UTR leaders comprising native leader sequences, and this leader also provides good levels of transgene expression in the absence of TRAP.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0257">In some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence comprises a 5&#x2032; leader sequence upstream of the tbs or the portion thereof. The leader sequence may be immediately upstream of the TRAP binding site or the portion thereof, i.e. there may be no further sequences separating the leader sequence and the TRAP binding site or portion thereof. If the 5&#x2032; leader is derived from a splicing event, then the sequences from the exon/exon junction to the tbs should be kept to a minimal length (preferably 12nt). The leader sequence may comprise a sequence derived from the non-coding EF1a exon 1 region. In a preferred embodiment, the leader sequence comprises a sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO:25, SEQ ID NO:26 or SEQ ID NO: 93.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0258">Multiple Cloning Site</p><p id="p-0261" num="0259">To improve the tractability of the TRIP system it is desirable to be able to have the ability to clone a NOI directly into the expression cassette containing the promoter-5&#x2032;UTR-tbs sequence via the option of several different restriction enzymes (RE), i.e. to incorporate a multiple cloning site (MCS) between the tbs and the Kozak sequence (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). The present inventors have demonstrated that several different MCS can be tolerated by the TRIP system, i.e. transgene repression is still obtained when an MCS is used. This was unexpected given that 5&#x2032;UTR leader sequences can modulate the degree of TRAP-mediated repression, that the close proximity of the tbs to the ATG initiation codon is important, and that an efficient Kozak sequence must be maintained with or between the MCS and the initiation codon of the NOI to ensure efficient translation initiation. In addition, the number and/or combinations of RE sites that could be used whilst maintaining TRAP-mediated repression could not be predicted.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0260">As such, sequence &#x2018;compression&#x2019; was required such that several (overlapping) RE sites could be incorporated in as short a distance as possible from the tbs to the ATG initiation codon (to retain proximity of tbs to ATG), whilst also maintaining an efficient core Kozak sequence of RVVATG.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0261">In a further aspect, the invention provides a nucleic acid sequence comprising a nucleotide of interest, a tbs or a portion thereof as described herein, a multiple cloning site (MCS) and a Kozak sequence as described herein, wherein said MCS is located downstream of the tbs or portion thereof and upstream of the Kozak sequence. Suitably, the tbs or portion thereof and the Kozak sequence do not overlap.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0262">As used herein, a &#x201c;multiple cloning site&#x201d; is to be understood as a DNA region which contains several restriction enzyme recognition sites (restriction enzyme sites) very close to each other. In one embodiment, the RE sites may be overlapping in the MCS for use in the invention.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0263">As used herein, a &#x201c;restriction enzyme site&#x201d; or &#x201c;restriction enzyme recognition site&#x201d; is a location on a DNA molecule containing specific sequences of nucleotides, 4-8 nucleotides in length, which are recognised by restriction enzymes. A restriction enzyme recognises a specific RE site (i.e. a specific sequence) and cleaves the DNA molecule within, or nearby, the RE site.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0264">A consensus TRAP binding site sequence that is capable of binding TRAP is [KAGNN] repeated multiple times (e.g. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 or more times); wherein K may be T or G in DNA and U or G in RNA. In one embodiment of the present invention, the TRAP binding site or portion thereof comprises the sequence KAGN<sub>&#x2265;2 </sub>(e.g. KAGN<sub>2-3</sub>). For the avoidance of doubt therefore, this tbs or portion thereof comprises, for example, any of the following repeat sequences: UAGNN, GAGNN, TAGNN, UAGNNN, GAGNNN, or TAGNNN. &#x201c;N&#x201d; is to be understood as specifying any nucleotide at that position in the sequence. For example, this could be G, A, T, C or U. The number of such nucleotides is preferably 2 but up to three, for example 1, 2 or 3, KAG repeats of an 11&#xd7; repeat tbs or portion thereof may be separated by 3 spacing nucleotides and still retain some TRAP-binding activity that leads to translation repression. Preferably not more than one N<sub>3 </sub>spacer will be used in an 11&#xd7; repeat tbs or portion thereof in order to retain maximal TRAP-binding activity that leads to translation repression.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0265">In one embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence comprises one of the following sequences:</p><p id="p-0268" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00019" num="00019"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="182pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>(a)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;45)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>GAGCTCTAGAVVATG;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(b)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;46)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>GAGCTCGTCGACVATG;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(c)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;47)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>GAGCTCGAATTCGAAVVATG;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(d)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;48)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>GAGCTCTAGACGTCGACVATG;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(e)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;49)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>GAGCTCTAGAATTCGAAVVATG;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(f)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;50)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>GAGCTCTAGATATCGATRVVATG;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(g)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;51)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>KAGACTAGTACTTAAGCTTRVVATG;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(h)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;52)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>GAGCTCTAGACCATG;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(i)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;53)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>GAGCTCGTCGACCATG;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(j)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;54)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>GAGCTCGAATTCGAACCATG;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(k)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;55)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>GAGCTCTAGACGTCGACCATG;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(l)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;56)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>GAGCTCTAGAATTCGAACCATG;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(m)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;57)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>GAGCTCTAGATATCGATACCATG;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>or</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(n)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;58)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>KAGACTAGTACTTAAGCTTACCATG;</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0269" num="0266">wherein &#x201c;K&#x201d;

The let-7 gene encodes a small, highly conserved RNA species that regulates the expression of endogenous protein-coding genes during worm development. The active RNA species is transcribed initially as an &#x2dc;70nt precursor, which is post-transcriptionally processed into a mature &#x2dc;21nt form. Both let-7 and lin-4 are transcribed as hairpin RNA precursors which are processed to their mature forms by Dicer enzyme.</p><p id="p-0380" num="0392">In addition to the NOI the vector may also comprise or encode a siRNA, shRNA, or regulated shRNA (Dickins et al. (2005) Nature Genetics 37: 1289-1295, Silva et al. (2005) Nature Genetics 37:1281-1288).</p><p id="p-0381" num="0393">Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) mediated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a conserved cellular defence mechanism for controlling the expression of foreign genes. It is thought that the random integration of elements such as transposons or viruses causes the expression of dsRNA which activates sequence-specific degradation of homologous single-stranded mRNA or viral genomic RNA. The silencing effect is known as RNA interference (RNAi) (Ralph et al. (2005) Nature Medicine 11:429-433). The mechanism of RNAi involves the processing of long dsRNAs into duplexes of about 21-25 nucleotide (nt) RNAs. These products are called small interfering or silencing RNAs (siRNAs) which are the sequence-specific mediators of mRNA degradation. In differentiated mammalian cells, dsRNA&#x3e;30 bp has been found to activate the interferon response leading to shut-down of protein synthesis and non-specific mRNA degradation (Stark et al., Annu Rev Biochem 67:227-64 (1998)). However this response can be bypassed by using 21nt siRNA duplexes (Elbashir et al., EMBO J. December 3; 20(23):6877-88 (2001), Hutvagner et al., Science. August 3, 293(5531):834-8.

They may be single-stranded or double-stranded. It will be understood by a skilled person that numerous different polynucleotides can encode the same polypeptide as a result of the degeneracy of the genetic code. In addition, it is to be understood that skilled persons may, using routine techniques, make nucleotide substitutions that do not affect the polypeptide sequence encoded by the polynucleotides of the invention to reflect the codon usage of any particular host organism in which the polypeptides of the invention are to be expressed.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0396">The polynucleotides may be modified by any method available in the art.

They may also be cloned by standard techniques.</p><p id="p-0386" num="0398">Longer polynucleotides will generally be produced using recombinant means, for example using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cloning techniques. This will involve making a pair of primers (e.g. of about 15 to 30 nucleotides) flanking the target sequence which it is desired to clone, bringing the primers into contact with mRNA or cDNA obtained from an animal or human cell, performing PCR under conditions which bring about amplification of the desired region, isolating the amplified fragment (e.g. by purifying the reaction mixture with an agarose gel) and recovering the amplified DNA. The primers may be designed to contain suitable restriction enzyme recognition sites so that the amplified DNA can be cloned into a suitable vector.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0399">Major Splice Donor</p><p id="p-0388" num="0400">RNA splicing is catalysed by a large RNA-protein complex called the spliceosome, which is comprised of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). The borders between introns and exons are marked by specific nucleotide sequences within a pre-mRNA, which delineate where splicing will occur. Such boundaries are referred to as &#x201c;splice sites.&#x201d; The term &#x201c;splice site&#x201d; refers to polynucleotides that are capable of being recognized by the splicing machinery of a eukaryotic cell as suitable for being cut and/or ligated to another splice site.</p><p id="p-0389" num="0401">Splice sites allow for the excision of introns present in a pre-mRNA transcript. Typically, the 5&#x2032; splice boundary is referred to as the &#x201c;splice donor site&#x201d; or the &#x201c;5&#x2032; splice site,&#x201d; and the 3&#x2032; splice boundary is referred to as the &#x201c;splice acceptor site&#x201d; or the &#x201c;3&#x2032; splice site.&#x201d; Splice sites include, for example, naturally occurring splice sites, engineered or synthetic splice sites, canonical or consensus splice sites, and/or non-canonical splice sites, for example, cryptic splice sites.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0402">Splice acceptor sites generally consist of three separate sequence elements: the branch point or branch site, a polypyrimidine tract and the acceptor consensus sequence. The branch point consensus sequence in eukaryotes is YNYTRAC (where Y is a pyrimidine, N is any nucleotide, and R is a purine). The 3&#x2032; acceptor splice site consensus sequence is YAG (where Y is a pyrimidine) (see, e.g., Griffiths et al., eds., <i>Modern Genetic Analysis, </i>2nd edition, W.H.

It is well known that the G<sup>3</sup>T<sup>4 </sup>dinucleotide is generally the least variable sequence within the canonical splice donor consensus sequence, and mutations to the G<sup>3 </sup>and or T<sup>4 </sup>will most likely achieve the greatest attenuating effect.

However, until the present invention, the production of MSD-mutated vectors has either relied upon supply of the HIV-1 tat protein (1<sup>st </sup>and 2<sup>nd </sup>generation lentiviral vectors) or has been of lower efficiency due to the unstabilising effect of mutating the MSD on vector RNA levels (in 3<sup>rd </sup>generation vectors). Due to safety reasons there is no desire or justification for &#x2018;reintroducing&#x2019; tat back into contemporary 3rd generation LV systems, and consequently there is currently no solution to the reduction in production titres of MSD-mutated vectors intended for clinical use.</p><p id="p-0459" num="0459">The present inventors show that MSD-mutated, 3<sup>rd </sup>generation (i.e. tat-independent) LVs can be produced to high titre by co-expression of a modified U1 snRNA directed to bind to the 5&#x2032;packaging region of the vector genome RNA during production. It is surprisingly shown that these modified U1 snRNAs can enhance the production titres of MSD-mutated LVs in a manner that is independent of the presence of the 5&#x2032;polyA signal within the 5&#x2032;R region, indicating a novel mechanism over others' use of modified U1 snRNAs to suppress polyadenylation (so called U1-interference, [Ui]). It is surprisingly shown that targeting the modified U1 snRNAs to critical sequences of the packaging region produce the greatest enhancement in MSD-mutated LV titres. The present inventors also disclose novel sequence mutation within the major splice donor region such that reduction in titres of MSD-mutated LV is less pronounced, and that enhancement in titres of such MSD-mutated LV variants by modified U1 snRNAs is greatest.</p><p id="p-0460" num="0460">The present inventors have surprisingly found that the output titres of lentiviral vectors can be enhanced by co-expressing non-coding RNAs based on U1 snRNAs, which have been modified so that they no longer target the endogenous sequence (a splice donor site) but now target a sequence within the vRNA molecule. As demonstrated in the present Examples, the inventors show that the relative enhancement in output titres of lentiviral vectors harbouring attenuating mutations within the major splice donor region (containing the major splice donor and cryptic splice donor sites) by said modified U1 snRNAs are greater than standard lentiviral vectors containing a non-mutated major splice donor region.</p><p id="p-0461" num="0461">As demonstrated in the present Examples, vector genomes harbouring a broad range of mutation types within the major splice donor region (point mutations, region deletion, and sequence replacement) that lead to reduced titres may be used in combination with a modified U1 snRNA. The approach may comprise co-expression of modified U1 snRNAs together with the other vector components during vector production. The modified U1 snRNAs are designed such that binding to the consensus splice donor site has been ablated by replacing it with a heterologous sequence that is complementary to a target sequence within the vector genome vRNA. The invention describes various modes of application and optimal characteristics of the modified U1 snRNAs, including target sequence and complementarity length, design and modes of expression.</p><p id="p-0462" num="0462">In one aspect of the invention as described herein, the vector may be used in combination with a modified U1 snRNA. This is discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0463" num="0463">Splicing and polyadenylation are key processes for mRNA maturation, particularly in higher eukaryotes where most protein-coding transcripts contain multiple introns. The elements within a pre-mRNA that are required for splicing include the 5&#x2032; splice donor signal, the sequence surrounding the branch point and the 3&#x2032; splice acceptor signal. Interacting with these three elements is the spliceosome, which is formed by five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), including U1 snRNA, and associated nuclear proteins (snRNP). U1 snRNA is expressed by a polymerase II promoter and is present in most eukaryotic cells (Lund et al., 1984<i>, J. Biol. Chem., </i>259:2013-2021). Human U1 snRNA (small nuclear RNA) is 164 nt long with a well-defined structure consisting of four stem-loops (West, S., 2012<i>, Biochemical Society Transactions, </i>40:846-849). U1 snRNA contains a short sequence at its 5&#x2032;-end that is broadly complementary to the 5&#x2032; splice donor sites at exon-intron junctions. U1 snRNA participates in splice-site selection and spliceosome assembly by base pairing to the 5&#x2032; splice donor site. A known function for U1 snRNA outside splicing is in the regulation of 3&#x2032;-end mRNA processing: it suppresses premature polyadenylation (polyA) at early polyA signals.</p><p id="p-0464" num="0464">Human U1 snRNA (small nuclear RNA) is 164nt long with a well-defined structure consisting of four stem-loops (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The endogenous non-coding RNA, U1 snRNA, binds to the consensus 5&#x2032; splice donor site (e.g. 5&#x2032;-MAGGURR-3&#x2032;, wherein M is A or C and R is A or G) via the native splice donor annealing sequence (e.g. 5&#x2032;-ACUUACCUG-3&#x2032;) during early steps of intron splicing. Stem loop I binds to U1A-70K protein that has been shown to be important for polyA suppression. Stem loop II binds to U1A protein, and the 5&#x2032;-AUUUGUGG-3&#x2032; sequence binds to Sm proteins, which together with Stem loop IV, is important for U1 snRNA processing. As defined herein the modified U1 snRNA for use according to the present invention is modified to introduce a heterologous sequence that is complementary to a target sequence within the vector genome vRNA molecule at the site of the native splice donor targeting/annealing sequence (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0465" num="0465">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;modified U1 snRNA&#x201d;, &#x201c;re-directed U1 snRNA&#x201d;, &#x201c;re-targeted U1 snRNA&#x201d;, &#x201c;re-purposed U1 snRNA&#x201d; and &#x201c;mutant U1 snRNA&#x201d;, mean a U1 snRNA that has been modified so that it is no longer complementary to the consensus 5&#x2032; splice donor site sequence (e.g. 5&#x2032;-MAGGURR-3&#x2032;) that it uses to initiate the splicing process of a target gene. Thus, a modified U1 snRNA is a U1 snRNA which has been modified so that it is no longer complementary to the splice donor site sequence (e.g. 5&#x2032;-MAGGURR-3&#x2032;). Instead, the modified U1 snRNA is designed so that it targets or is complementary to a nucleotide sequence having a unique RNA sequence within the packaging region of a MSD-mutated lentiviral vector genome molecule (target site), i.e. a sequence that is unrelated to splicing of the vRNA. The nucleotide sequence within the packaging region of a MSD-mutated lentiviral vector genome molecule can be preselected. Thus, the modified U1 snRNA is a U1 snRNA which has been modified so that its 5&#x2032; end is complementary to a nucleotide sequence within the packaging region of a MSD-mutated lentiviral vector genome molecule. As a result, and not wishing to be bound by theory, the modified U1 snRNA is thought to bind to the target site sequence based on complementarity of the target site sequence with the short sequence at the 5&#x2032; end of the modified U1 snRNA, thus stabilising the vRNA leading to increased output vector titres of the MSD-mutated lentiviral vector.</p><p id="p-0466" num="0466">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;native splice donor annealing sequence&#x201d; and &#x201c;native splice donor targeting sequence&#x201d; mean the short sequence at the 5&#x2032;-end of the endogenous U1 snRNA that is broadly complementary to the consensus 5&#x2032; splice donor site of introns.

A large number of different retroviruses have been identified. Examples include: murine leukemia virus (MLV), human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV), Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), Fujinami sarcoma virus (FuSV), Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo MLV), FBR murine osteosarcoma virus (FBR MSV), Moloney murine sarcoma virus (Mo-MSV), Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MLV), Avian myelocytomatosis virus-29 (MC29) and Avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV). A detailed list of retroviruses may be found in Coffin et al. (1997) &#x201c;Retroviruses&#x201d;, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press Eds: J M Coffin, S M Hughes, H E Varmus pp 758-763.</p><p id="p-0517" num="0516">Retroviruses may be broadly divided into two categories, namely &#x201c;simple&#x201d; and &#x201c;complex&#x201d;. Retroviruses may even be further divided into seven groups. Five of these groups represent retroviruses with oncogenic potential. The remaining two groups are the lentiviruses and the spumaviruses. A review of these retroviruses is presented in Coffin et al (1997) ibid.</p><p id="p-0518" num="0517">The basic structure of retrovirus and lentivirus genomes share many common features such as a 5&#x2032; LTR and a 3&#x2032; LTR, between or within which are located a packaging signal to enable the genome to be packaged, a primer binding site, integration sites to enable integration into a target cell genome and gag/pol and env genes encoding the packaging components&#x2014;these are polypeptides required for the assembly of viral particles. Lentiviruses have additional features, such as the rev gene and RRE sequences in HIV, which enable the efficient export of RNA transcripts of the integrated provirus from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of an infected target cell.</p><p id="p-0519" num="0518">In the provirus, these genes are flanked at both ends by regions called long terminal repeats (LTRs). The LTRs are responsible for proviral integration, and transcription. LTRs also serve as enhancer-promoter sequences and can control the expression of the viral genes.</p><p id="p-0520" num="0519">The LTRs themselves are identical sequences that can be divided into three elements, which are called U3, R and U5. U3 is derived from the sequence unique to the 3&#x2032; end of the RNA. R is derived from a sequence repeated at both ends of the RNA and U5 is derived from the sequence unique to the 5&#x2032; end of the RNA. The sizes of the three elements can vary considerably among different retroviruses.</p><p id="p-0521" num="0520">In a typical retroviral vector of the present invention, at least part of one or more protein coding regions essential for replication may be removed from the virus; for example, gag/pol and env may be absent or not functional. This makes the viral vector replication-defective.</p><p id="p-0522" num="0521">Portions of the viral genome may also be replaced by a library encoding candidate nucleic acid binding sequences as described herein operably linked to a regulatory control region and a reporter gene in the vector genome in order to generate a vector comprising candidate nucleic acid binding sequences as described herein which is capable of transducing a target non-dividing cell and/or integrating its genome into a host genome.</p><p id="p-0523" num="0522">Lentiviruses are part of a larger group of retroviruses. A detailed list of lentiviruses may be found in Coffin et al (1997) &#x201c;Retroviruses&#x201d; Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press Eds: J M Coffin, S M Hughes, H E Varmus pp 758-763). In brief, lentiviruses can be divided into primate and non-primate groups. Examples of primate lentiviruses include but are not limited to: the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of human auto-immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The non-primate lentiviral group includes the prototype &#x201c;slow virus&#x201d; visna/maedi virus (VMV), as well as the related caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV), equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV).</p><p id="p-0524" num="0523">The lentivirus family differs from retroviruses in that lentiviruses have the capability to infect both dividing and non-dividing cells (Lewis et al (1992) EMBO J 11(8):3053-3058 and Lewis and Emerman (1994) J Virol 68 (1):510-516). In contrast, other retroviruses, such as MLV, are unable to infect non-dividing or slowly dividing cells such as those that make up, for example, muscle, brain, lung and liver tissue.</p><p id="p-0525" num="0524">A lentiviral vector, as used herein, is a vector which comprises at least one component part derivable from a lentivirus. Preferably, that component part is involved in the biological mechanisms by which the vector infects cells, expresses genes or is replicated.</p><p id="p-0526" num="0525">The lentiviral vector may be derived from either a primate lentivirus (e.g. HIV-1) or a non-primate lentivirus.</p><p id="p-0527" num="0526">Examples of non-primate lentivirus may be any member of the family of lentiviridae which does not naturally infect a primate and may include a feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), a caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV), a Maedi visna virus (MVV) or an equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV).</p><p id="p-0528" num="0527">In general terms, a typical retroviral vector production system involves the separation of the viral genome from the essential viral packaging functions. These components are typically provided to the production cells on separate DNA expression cassettes (alternatively known as plasmids, expression plasmids, DNA constructs or expression constructs).</p><p id="p-0529" num="0528">The vector genome comprises the NOI. Vector genomes typically require a packaging signal (&#x3c8;), a central polypurine tract (cppt), a rev-response element (RRE) the internal expression cassette harbouring the NOI, (optionally) a post-transcriptional element (PRE), typically a central polypurine tract (cppt), the 3&#x2032;-ppu and a self-inactivating (SIN) LTR. The R-U5 regions are required for correct polyadenylation of both the vector genome RNA and NOI mRNA, as well as the process of reverse transcription. The vector genome may optionally include an open reading frame, as described in WO 2003/064665.</p><p id="p-0530" num="0529">In one aspect nucleotide sequence may be suitable for use in a lentiviral vector in a tat-independent system for vector production. As described herein, 3<sup>1d </sup>generation lentiviral vectors are tat-independent, and the nucleotide sequences according to the present invention may be used in the context of a 3<sup>1d </sup>generation lentiviral vector. In one aspect of the invention tat is not provided in the lentiviral vector production system, for example tat is not provided in trans. In one aspect the cell or vector or vector production system as described herein does not comprise the tat protein.</p><p id="p-0531" num="0530">The packaging functions include the gag/pol and env genes. These are required for the production of vector particles by the production cell. Providing these functions in trans to the genome facilitates the production of replication-defective virus.</p><p id="p-0532" num="0531">Production systems for gamma-retroviral vectors are typically 3-component systems requiring genome, gag/pol and env expression constructs. Production systems for HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors additionally require the accessory gene rev to be provided in trans and for the vector genome to include the rev-responsive element (RRE). EIAV-based lentiviral vectors do not require rev if an open-reading frame (ORF) is present (see WO 2003/064665).</p><p id="p-0533" num="0532">Usually both the &#x201c;external&#x201d; promoter (which drives the vector genome cassette) and &#x201c;internal&#x201d; promoter (which drives the NOI cassette) encoded within the vector genome cassette are strong eukaryotic or virus promoters, as are those driving the other vector system components. Examples of such promoters include CMV, EF1&#x3b1;, PGK, CAG, TK, SV40 and Ubiquitin promoters. Strong &#x2018;synthetic&#x2019; promoters, such as those generated by DNA libraries (e.g. JeT promoter) may also be used to drive transcription. Alternatively, tissue-specific promoters such as rhodopsin (Rho), rhodopsin kinase (RhoK), cone-rod homeobox containing gene (CRX), neural retina-specific leucine zipper protein (NRL), Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy 2 (VMD2), Tyrosine hydroxylase, neuronal-specific neuronal-specific enolase (NSE) promoter, astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter, human al-antitrypsin (hAAT) promoter, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), liver fatty acid binding protein promoter, Flt-1 promoter, INF-&#x3b2; promoter, Mb promoter, SP-B promoter, SYN1 promoter, WASP promoter, SV40/hAIb promoter, SV40/CD43, SV40/CD45, NSE/RU5&#x2032; promoter, ICAM-2 promoter, GPIIb promoter, GFAP promoter, Fibronectin promoter, Endoglin promoter, Elastase-1 promoter, Desmin promoter, CD68 promoter, CD14 promoter and B29 promoter may be used to drive transcription.</p><p id="p-0534" num="0533">Production of retroviral vectors involves either the transient transfection of the production cells with these DNA components or use of stable producer cell lines (PCLs) wherein the components are integrated within the production cell genome (e.g. Stewart, H. J., M. A. Leroux-Carlucci, C. J. Sion, K. A. Mitrophanous and P. A. Radcliffe (2009) <i>Gene Ther. </i>16(6): 805-814 Epub 29 Mar. 2005). An alternative approach is to use a stable packaging cell (into which the packaging components are stably integrated) and then transiently transfect in the vector genome plasmid as required. In order to generate the viral vectors of the present invention the production cells must be capable of expressing TRAP. Thus, in one embodiment of the invention the production cells will stably express the TRAP construct. In another embodiment of the invention the production cells will transiently express the TRAP construct. In another embodiment of the invention the production cells will stably express a TRAP construct and also transiently express a TRAP construct.</p><p id="p-0535" num="0534">It should be noted that, although the TRIP system has been mainly described for producing retroviral vectors, analogous strategies can be applied to other viral vectors.</p><p id="p-0536" num="0535">In one embodiment of the present invention, the viral vector is derived from EIAV. EIAV has the simplest genomic structure of the lentiviruses and is particularly preferred for use in the present invention. In addition to the gag/pol and env genes, EIAV encodes three other genes: tat, rev, and S2. Tat acts as a transcriptional activator of the viral LTR (Derse and Newbold (1993) Virology 194(2):530-536 and Maury et al (1994) Virology 200(2):632-642) and rev regulates and coordinates the expression of viral genes through rev-response elements (RRE) (Martarano et al. (1994) J Virol 68(5):3102-3111). The mechanisms of action of these two proteins are thought to be broadly similar to the analogous mechanisms in the primate viruses (Martarano et al. (1994) J Virol 68(5):3102-3111). The function of S2 is unknown. In addition, an EIAV protein, Ttm, has been identified that is encoded by the first exon of tat spliced to the env coding sequence at the start of the transmembrane protein. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention the viral vector is derived from HIV: HIV differs from EIAV in that it does not encode S2 but unlike EIAV it encodes vif, vpr, vpu and nef.</p><p id="p-0537" num="0536">The term &#x201c;recombinant retroviral or lentiviral vector&#x201d; (RRV) refers to a vector with sufficient retroviral genetic information to allow packaging of an RNA genome, in the presence of packaging components, into a viral particle capable of infecting a target cell. Infection of the target cell may include reverse transcription and integration into the target cell genome. The RRV carries non-viral coding sequences which are to be delivered by the vector to the target cell. A RRV is incapable of independent replication to produce infectious retroviral particles within the target cell. Usually the RRV lacks a functional gag/pol and/or env gene, and/or other genes essential for replication.</p><p id="p-0538" num="0537">Preferably the RRV vector of the present invention has a minimal viral genome.</p><p id="p-0539" num="0538">As used herein, the term &#x201c;minimal viral genome&#x201d; means that the viral vector has been manipulated so as to remove the non-essential elements whilst retaining the elements essential to provide the required functionality to infect, transduce and deliver a nucleotide sequence of interest to a target cell. Further details of this strategy can be found in WO 1998/17815 and WO 99/32646. A minimal EIAV vector lacks tat, rev and S2 genes and neither are these genes provided in trans in the production system. A minimal HIV vector lacks vif, vpr, vpu, tat and nef.</p><p id="p-0540" num="0539">However, the expression plasmid used to produce the vector genome within a production cell will include transcriptional regulatory control sequences operably linked to the retroviral genome to direct transcription of the genome in a production cell/packaging cell. These regulatory sequences may be the natural sequences associated with the transcribed retroviral sequence, i.e. the 5&#x2032; U3 region, or they may be a heterologous promoter such as another viral promoter, for example the CMV promoter, as discussed below. Some lentiviral vector genomes require additional sequences for efficient virus production. For example, particularly in the case of HIV, RRE sequences may be included. However the requirement for RRE (and dependence on rev which is provided in trans) may be reduced or eliminated by codon optimisation. Further details of this strategy can be found in WO 2001/79518. Alternative sequences which perform the same function as the rev/RRE system are also known. For example, a functional analogue of the rev/RRE system is found in the Mason Pfizer monkey virus. This is known as the constitutive transport element (CTE) and comprises an RRE-type sequence in the genome which is believed to interact with a factor in the infected cell. The cellular factor can be thought of as a rev analogue. Thus, CTE may be used as an alternative to the rev/RRE system. Any other functional equivalents which are known or become available may be relevant to the invention. For example, it is also known that the Rex protein of HTLV-I can functionally replace the Rev protein of HIV-1. Rev and RRE may be absent or non-functional in the vector for use in the methods of the present invention; in the alternative rev and RRE, or functionally equivalent system, may be present.</p><p id="p-0541" num="0540">SIN Vectors</p><p id="p-0542" num="0541">The vectors for use in the methods of the present invention are preferably used in a self-inactivating (SIN) configuration in which the viral enhancer and promoter sequences have been deleted. SIN vectors can be generated and transduce non-dividing target cells in vivo, ex vivo or in vitro with an efficacy similar to that of wild-type vectors. The transcriptional inactivation of the long terminal repeat (LTR) in the SIN provirus should prevent mobilization of vRNA, and is a feature that further diminishes the likelihood of formation of replication-competent virus. This should also enable the regulated expression of genes from internal promoters by eliminating any cis-acting effects of the LTR.</p><p id="p-0543" num="0542">By way of example, self-inactivating retroviral vector systems have been constructed by deleting the transcriptional enhancers or the enhancers and promoter in the U3 region of the 3&#x2032; LTR. After a round of vector reverse transcription and integration, these changes are copied into both the 5&#x2032; and the 3&#x2032; LTRs producing a transcriptionally inactive &#x2018;provirus&#x2019;. However, any promoter(s) internal to the LTRs in such vectors will still be transcriptionally active. This strategy has been employed to eliminate effects of the enhancers and promoters in the viral LTRs on transcription from internally placed genes. Such effects include increased transcription or suppression of transcription. This strategy can also be used to eliminate downstream transcription from the 3&#x2032; LTR into genomic DNA. This is of particular concern in human gene therapy where it is important to prevent the adventitious activation of any endogenous oncogene.

This makes the viral vector replication-defective.

In a further embodiment a heterologous binding domain (heterologous to gag) located on the RNA to be delivered and a cognate binding domain on Gag or GagPol can be used to ensure packaging of the RNA to be delivered. Both of these vectors are described in WO 2007/072056.</p><p id="p-0549" num="0548">Adenoviral Vectors</p><p id="p-0550" num="0549">In another embodiment of the present invention, the vector may be an adenovirus vector. The adenovirus is a double-stranded, linear DNA virus that does not replicate through an RNA intermediate. There are over 50 different human serotypes of adenovirus divided into 6 subgroups based on their genetic sequence.</p><p id="p-0551" num="0550">Adenoviruses are double-stranded DNA non-enveloped viruses that are capable of in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro transduction of a broad range of cell types of human and non-human origin. These cells include respiratory airway epithelial cells, hepatocytes, muscle cells, cardiac myocytes, synoviocytes, primary mammary epithelial cells and post-mitotically terminally differentiated cells such as neurons.</p><p id="p-0552" num="0551">Adenoviral vectors are also capable of transducing non-dividing cells. This is very important for diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, in which the affected cells in the lung epithelium have a slow turnover rate. In fact, several trials are underway utilising adenovirus-mediated transfer of cystic fibrosis transporter (CFTR) into the lungs of afflicted adult cystic fibrosis patients.</p><p id="p-0553" num="0552">Adenoviruses have been used as vectors for gene therapy and for expression of heterologous genes. The large (36 kb) genome can accommodate up to 8 kb of foreign insert DNA and is able to replicate efficiently in complementing cell lines to produce very high titres of up to 10<sup>12 </sup>transducing units per ml. Adenovirus is thus one of the best systems to study the expression of genes in primary non-replicative cells.</p><p id="p-0554" num="0553">The expression of viral or foreign genes from the adenovirus genome does not require a replicating cell. Adenoviral vectors enter cells by receptor mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cell, adenovirus vectors rarely integrate into the host chromosome. Instead, they function episomally (independently from the host genome) as a linear genome in the host nucleus.</p><p id="p-0555" num="0554">Adeno-Associated Virus Vectors</p><p id="p-0556" num="0555">Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is an attractive vector system for use in the present invention as it has a high frequency of integration and it can infect non-dividing cells.

(2010) 4:123-156).</p><p id="p-0561" num="0560">The use of HSV in therapeutic procedures requires the strains to be attenuated so that they cannot establish a lytic cycle. In particular, if HSV vectors are used for gene therapy in humans, the polynucleotide should preferably be inserted into an essential gene. This is because if a viral vector encounters a wild-type virus, transfer of a heterologous gene to the wild-type virus could occur by recombination. However, as long as the polynucleotide is inserted into an essential gene, this recombinational transfer would also delete the essential gene in the recipient virus and prevent &#x201c;escape&#x201d; of the heterologous gene into the replication competent wild-type virus population.</p><p id="p-0562" num="0561">Vaccinia Virus Vectors</p><p id="p-0563" num="0562">The vector of the present invention may be a vaccinia virus vector such as MVA or NYVAC.</p><p id="p-0564" num="0563">Alternatives to vaccinia vectors include avipox vectors such as fowlpox or canarypox known as ALVAC and strains derived therefrom which can infect and express recombinant proteins in human cells but are unable to replicate.</p><p id="p-0565" num="0564">Baculovirus Vectors</p><p id="p-0566" num="0565">The vector of the present invention may also be a baculovirus vector.

Virol. 65, 4985).</p><p id="p-0571" num="0570">Insertion of IRES elements into retroviral vectors is compatible with the retroviral replication cycle and allows expression of multiple coding regions from a single promoter (Adam et al (as above); Koo et al (1992) Virology 186:669-675; Chen et al 1993 J. Virol 67:2142-2148). IRES elements were first found in the non-translated 5&#x2032; ends of picornaviruses where they promote cap-independent translation of viral proteins (Jang et al (1990) Enzyme 44: 292-309). When located between open reading frames in an RNA, IRES elements allow efficient translation of the downstream open reading frame by promoting entry of the ribosome at the IRES element followed by downstream initiation of translation.</p><p id="p-0572" num="0571">A review on IRES is presented by Mountford and Smith (TIG May 1995 vol 11, No 5:179-184).

Prokaryotic promoters and promoters functional in eukaryotic cells may be used. Tissue specific or stimuli specific promoters may be used. Chimeric promoters may also be used comprising sequence elements from two or more different promoters.</p><p id="p-0579" num="0578">Suitable promoting sequences are strong promoters including those derived from the genomes of viruses, such as polyoma virus, adenovirus, fowlpox virus, bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), retrovirus and Simian Virus 40 (SV40), or from heterologous mammalian promoters, such as the actin promoter, EF1&#x3b1;, CAG, TK, SV40, ubiquitin, PGK or ribosomal protein promoter. Alternatively, tissue-specific promoters such as rhodopsin (Rho), rhodopsin kinase (RhoK), cone-rod homeobox containing gene (CRX), neural retina-specific leucine zipper protein (NRL), Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy 2 (VMD2), Tyrosine hydroxylase, neuronal-specific neuronal-specific enolase (NSE) promoter, astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter, human al-antitrypsin (hAAT) promoter, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), liver fatty acid binding protein promoter, Flt-1 promoter, INF-&#x3b2; promoter, Mb promoter, SP-B promoter, SYN1 promoter, WASP promoter, SV40/hAIb promoter, SV40/CD43, SV40/CD45, NSE/RU5&#x2032; promoter, ICAM-2 promoter, GPIIb promoter, GFAP promoter, Fibronectin promoter, Endoglin promoter, Elastase-1 promoter, Desmin promoter, CD68 promoter, CD14 promoter and B29 promoter may be used to drive transcription.</p><p id="p-0580" num="0579">Transcription of a gene may be increased further by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Enhancers are relatively orientation- and position-independent; however, one may employ an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus, such as the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270) and the CMV early promoter enhancer. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; to the promoter, but is preferably located at a site 5&#x2032; from the promoter.</p><p id="p-0581" num="0580">The promoter can additionally include features to ensure or to increase expression in a suitable target cell. For example, the features can be conserved regions e.g. a Pribnow Box or a TATA box. The promoter may contain other sequences to affect (such as to maintain, enhance or decrease) the levels of expression of a nucleotide sequence. Suitable other sequences include the Sh1-intron or an ADH intron. Other sequences include inducible elements, such as temperature, chemical, light or stress inducible elements. Also, suitable elements to enhance transcription or translation may be present.</p><p id="p-0582" num="0581">The TRAP-tbs interaction may be useful in forming the basis for a transgene protein repression system for the production of retroviral vectors, when a constitutive and/or strong promoter, including a tissue-specific promoter, driving the transgene is desirable and particularly when expression of the transgene protein in production cells leads to reduction in vector titres and/or elicits an immune response in vivo due to viral vector delivery of transgene-derived protein.</p><p id="p-0583" num="0582">Regulators of NOIs</p><p id="p-0584" num="0583">A complicating factor in the generation of retroviral packaging/producer cell lines and retroviral vector production is that constitutive expression of certain retroviral vector components and NOIs are cytotoxic leading to death of cells expressing these components and therefore inability to produce vector. Therefore, the expression of these components (e.g. gag-pol and envelope proteins such as VSV-G) can be regulated. The expression of other non-cytotoxic vector components, e.g. rev, can also be regulated to minimise the metabolic burden on the cell. Thus the modular constructs or nucleotide sequences encoding vector components and/or cells as described herein may comprise cytotoxic and/or non-cytotoxic vector components associated with at least one regulatory element. As used herein, the term &#x201c;regulatory element&#x201d; refers to any element capable of affecting, either increasing or decreasing, the expression of an associated gene or protein. A regulatory element includes a gene switch system, transcription regulation element and translation repression element</p><p id="p-0585" num="0584">A number of prokaryotic regulator systems have been adapted to generate gene switches in mammalian cells. Many retroviral packaging and producer cell lines have been controlled using gene switch systems (e.g. tetracycline and cumate inducible switch systems) thus enabling expression of one or more of the retroviral vector components to be switched on at the time of vector production. Gene switch systems include those of the (TetR) protein group of transcription regulators (e.g. T-Rex, Tet-On, and Tet-Off), those of the cumate inducible switch system group of transcription regulators (e.g. CymR protein) and those involving an RNA-binding protein (e.g. TRAP).</p><p id="p-0586" num="0585">One such tetracycline-inducible system is the tetracycline repressor (TetR) system based on the T-REx&#x2122; system. By way of example, in such a system tetracycline operators (TetO<sub>2</sub>) are placed in a position such that the first nucleotide is 10 bp from the 3&#x2032; end of the last nucleotide of the TATATAA element of the human cytomegalovirus major immediate early promoter (hCMVp) then TetR alone is capable of acting as a repressor (Yao F, Svensjo T, Winkler T, Lu M, Eriksson C, Eriksson E., 1998<i>, Hum Gene Ther, </i>9: 1939-1950). In such a system the expression of the NOI can be controlled by a CMV promoter into which two copies of the TetO<sub>2 </sub>sequence have been inserted in tandem. TetR homodimers, in the absence of an inducing agent (tetracycline or its analogue doxycycline [dox]), bind to the TetO<sub>2 </sub>sequences and physically block transcription from the upstream CMV promoter. When present, the inducing agent binds to the TetR homodimers, causing allosteric changes such that it can no longer bind to the TetO<sub>2 </sub>sequences, resulting in gene expression. The TetR gene may be codon optimised as this was found to improve translation efficiency resulting in tighter control of TetO<sub>2 </sub>controlled gene expression.</p><p id="p-0587" num="0586">The TRiP system is described in WO 2015/092440 and provides another way of repressing expression of the NOI in the production cells during vector production. The TRAP-binding sequence (e.g. TRAP-tbs) interaction forms the basis for a transgene protein repression system for the production of retroviral vectors, when a constitutive and/or strong promoter, including a tissue-specific promoter, driving the transgene is desirable and particularly when expression of the transgene protein in production cells leads to reduction in vector titres and/or elicits an immune response in vivo due to viral vector delivery of transgene-derived protein (Maunder et al, Nat Commun. (2017) March 27; 8).</p><p id="p-0588" num="0587">Briefly, the TRAP-tbs interaction forms a translational block, repressing translation of the transgene protein (Maunder et al, Nat Commun. (2017) March 27; 8). The translational block is only effective in production cells and as such does not impede the DNA- or RNA-based vector systems. The TRiP system is able to repress translation when the transgene protein is expressed from a constitutive and/or strong promoter, including a tissue-specific promoter from single- or multi cistronic mRNA. It has been demonstrated that unregulated expression of transgene protein can reduce vector titres and affect vector product quality. Repression of transgene protein for both transient and stable PaCL/PCL vector production systems is beneficial for production cells to prevent a reduction in vector titres: where toxicity or molecular burden issues may lead to cellular stress; where transgene protein elicits an immune response in vivo due to viral vector delivery of transgene-derived protein; where the use of gene-editing transgenes may result in on/off target affects; where the transgene protein may affect vector and/or envelope glycoprotein exclusion.</p><p id="p-0589" num="0588">Packaging Sequence</p><p id="p-0590" num="0589">As utilized within the context of the present invention the term &#x201c;packaging signal&#x201d;, which is referred to interchangeably as &#x201c;packaging sequence&#x201d; or &#x201c;psi&#x201d;, is used in reference to the non-coding, cis-acting sequence required for encapsidation of retroviral RNA strands during viral particle formation. In HIV-1, this sequence has been mapped to loci extending from upstream of the major splice donor site (SD) to at least the gag start codon. In EIAV the packaging signal comprises the R region into the 5&#x2032; coding region of Gag.</p><p id="p-0591" num="0590">As used herein, the term &#x201c;extended packaging signal&#x201d; or &#x201c;extended packaging sequence&#x201d; refers to the use of sequences around the psi sequence with further extension into the gag gene. The inclusion of these additional packaging sequences may increase the efficiency of insertion of vector RNA into viral particles.</p><p id="p-0592" num="0591">Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) RNA encapsidation determinants have been shown to be discrete and non-continuous, comprising one region at the 5&#x2032; end of the genomic mRNA (R-U5) and another region that mapped within the proximal 311nt of gag (Kaye et al., J Virol. October; 69(10):6588-92 (1995).</p><p id="p-0593" num="0592">Pseudotyping</p><p id="p-0594" num="0593">In one preferred aspect, the viral vector of the present invention has been pseudotyped. In this regard, pseudotyping can confer one or more advantages. For example, the env gene product of the HIV based vectors would restrict these vectors to infecting only cells that express a protein called CD4. But if the env gene in these vectors has been substituted with env sequences from other enveloped viruses, then they may have a broader infectious spectrum (Verma and Somia (1997) Nature 389(6648):239-242). By way of example, workers have pseudotyped an HIV based vector with the glycoprotein from VSV (Verma and Somia (1997) Nature 389(6648):239-242).</p><p id="p-0595" num="0594">In another alternative, the Env protein may be a modified Env protein such as a mutant or engineered Env protein.

These pseudotyped VSV-G vectors may be used to transduce a wide range of mammalian cells. More recently, Abe et al. (1998) J Virol 72(8) 6356-6361 teach that non-infectious retroviral particles can be made infectious by the addition of VSV-G.</p><p id="p-0600" num="0599">Burns et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:8033-7) successfully pseudotyped the retrovirus MLV with VSV-G and this resulted in a vector having an altered host range compared to MLV in its native form. VSV-G pseudotyped vectors have been shown to infect not only mammalian cells, but also cell lines derived from fish, reptiles and insects (Burns et al. (1993) ibid). They have also been shown to be more efficient than traditional amphotropic envelopes for a variety of cell lines (Yee et al., (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:9564-9568, Emi et al. (1991) Journal of Virology 65:1202-1207). VSV-G protein can be used to pseudotype certain retroviruses because its cytoplasmic tail is capable of interacting with the retroviral cores.</p><p id="p-0601" num="0600">The provision of a non-retroviral pseudotyping envelope such as VSV-G protein gives the advantage that vector particles can be concentrated to a high titre without loss of infectivity (Akkina et al. (1996) J. Virol. 70:2581-5). Retrovirus envelope proteins are apparently unable to withstand the shearing forces during ultracentrifugation, probably because they consist of two non-covalently linked subunits. The interaction between the subunits may be disrupted by the centrifugation. In comparison the VSV glycoprotein is composed of a single unit. VSV-G protein pseudotyping can therefore offer potential advantages.</p><p id="p-0602" num="0601">WO 2000/52188 describes the generation of pseudotyped retroviral vectors, from stable producer cell lines, having vesicular stomatitis virus-G protein (VSV-G) as the membrane-associated viral envelope protein, and provides a gene sequence for the VSV-G protein.</p><p id="p-0603" num="0602">Ross River Virus</p><p id="p-0604" num="0603">The Ross River viral envelope has been used to pseudotype a non-primate lentiviral vector (FIV) and following systemic administration predominantly transduced the liver (Kang et al (2002) J Virol 76(18):9378-9388).

Compared with VSV-G-pseudotyped vectors, GP64-pseudotyped vectors have a similar broad tropism and similar native titres.

A modular construct is a DNA expression construct comprising two or more nucleic acids used in the production of lentiviral vectors. A modular construct can be a DNA plasmid comprising two or more nucleic acids used in the production of lentiviral vectors. The plasmid may be a bacterial plasmid. The nucleic acids can encode for example, gag-pol, rev, env, vector genome. In addition, modular constructs designed for generation of packaging and producer cell lines may additionally need to encode transcriptional regulatory proteins (e.g. TetR, CymR) and/or translational repression proteins (e.g. TRAP) and selectable markers (e.g Zeocin&#x2122;, hygromycin, blasticidin, puromycin, neomycin res/stance genes).

A variant sequence can be obtained by addition, deletion, substitution, modification, replacement and/or variation of at least one residue present in the naturally-occurring protein.</p><p id="p-0786" num="0796">The term &#x201c;derivative&#x201d; as used herein, in relation to proteins or polypeptides of the present invention includes any substitution of, variation of, modification of, replacement of, deletion of and/or addition of one (or more) amino acid residues from or to the sequence providing that the resultant protein or polypeptide retains at least one of its endogenous functions.</p><p id="p-0787" num="0797">The term &#x201c;analogue&#x201d; as used herein, in relation to polypeptides or polynucleotides includes any mimetic, that is, a chemical compound that possesses at least one of the endogenous functions of the polypeptides or polynucleotides which it mimics.</p><p id="p-0788" num="0798">Typically, amino acid substitutions may be made, for example from 1, 2 or 3 to 10 or 20 substitutions provided that the modified sequence retains the required activity or ability.

The term &#x201c;homology&#x201d; can be equated with &#x201c;identity&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0793" num="0802">In the present context, a homologous sequence is taken to include an amino acid sequence which may be at least 50%, 55%, 65%, 75%, 85% or 90% identical, preferably at least 95% or 97% or 99% identical to the subject sequence. Typically, the homologues will comprise the same active sites etc. as the subject amino acid sequence. Although homology can also be considered in terms of similarity (i.e. amino acid residues having similar chemical properties/functions), in the context of the present invention it is preferred to express homology in terms of sequence identity.</p><p id="p-0794" num="0803">In the present context, a homologous sequence is taken to include a nucleotide sequence which may be at least 50%, 55%, 65%, 75%, 85% or 90% identical, preferably at least 95% or 97% or 99% identical to the subject sequence. Although homology can also be considered in terms of similarity, in the context of the present invention it is preferred to express homology in terms of sequence identity.</p><p id="p-0795" num="0804">Homology comparisons can be conducted by eye, or more usually, with the aid of readily available sequence comparison programs. These commercially available computer programs can calculate percentage homology or identity between two or more sequences.</p><p id="p-0796" num="0805">Percentage homology may be calculated over contiguous sequences, i.e. one sequence is aligned with the other sequence and each amino acid in one sequence is directly compared with the corresponding amino acid in the other sequence, one residue at a time. This is called an &#x201c;ungapped&#x201d; alignment. Typically, such ungapped alignments are performed only over a relatively short number of residues.</p><p id="p-0797" num="0806">Although this is a very simple and consistent method, it fails to take into consideration that, for example, in an otherwise identical pair of sequences, one insertion or deletion in the nucleotide sequence may cause the following codons to be put out of alignment, thus potentially resulting in a large reduction in percent homology when a global alignment is performed. Consequently, most sequence comparison methods are designed to produce optimal alignments that take into consideration possible insertions and deletions without penalising unduly the overall homology score. This is achieved by inserting &#x201c;gaps&#x201d; in the sequence alignment to try to maximise local homology.</p><p id="p-0798" num="0807">However, these more complex methods assign &#x201c;gap penalties&#x201d; to each gap that occurs in the alignment so that, for the same number of identical amino acids, a sequence alignment with as few gaps as possible, reflecting higher relatedness between the two compared sequences, will achieve a higher score than one with many gaps. &#x201c;Affine gap costs&#x201d; are typically used that charge a relatively high cost for the existence of a gap and a smaller penalty for each subsequent residue in the gap. This is the most commonly used gap scoring system. High gap penalties will of course produce optimised alignments with fewer gaps. Most alignment programs allow the gap penalties to be modified. However, it is preferred to use the default values when using such software for sequence comparisons. For example when using the GCG Wisconsin Bestfit package the default gap penalty for amino acid sequences is &#x2dc;12 for a gap and &#x2212;4 for each extension.</p><p id="p-0799" num="0808">Calculation of maximum percentage homology therefore firstly requires the production of an optimal alignment, taking into consideration gap penalties. A suitable computer program for carrying out such an alignment is the GCG Wisconsin Bestfit package (University of Wisconsin, U.S.A.; Devereux et al. (1984) Nucleic Acids Research 12:387). Examples of other software that can perform sequence comparisons include, but are not limited to, the BLAST package (see Ausubel et al. (1999) ibid&#x2014;Ch. 18), FASTA (Atschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 403-410) and the GENEWORKS suite of comparison tools. Both BLAST and FASTA are available for offline and online searching (see Ausubel et al. (1999) ibid, pages 7-58 to 7-60). However, for some applications, it is preferred to use the GCG Bestfit program. Another tool, called BLAST 2 Sequences is also available for comparing protein and nucleotide sequences (see FEMS Microbiol Lett (1999) 174(2):247-50; FEMS Microbiol Lett (1999) 177(1):187-8).</p><p id="p-0800" num="0809">Although the final percentage homology can be measured in terms of identity, the alignment process itself is typically not based on an all-or-nothing pair comparison. Instead, a scaled similarity score matrix is generally used that assigns scores to each pairwise comparison based on chemical similarity or evolutionary distance. An example of such a matrix commonly used is the BLOSUM62 matrix&#x2014;the default matrix for the BLAST suite of programs. GCG Wisconsin programs generally use either the public default values or a custom symbol comparison table if supplied (see user manual for further details). For some applications, it is preferred to use the public default values for the GCG package, or in the case of other software, the default matrix, such as BLOSUM62.</p><p id="p-0801" num="0810">Once the software has produced an optimal alignment, it is possible to calculate percentage homology, preferably percentage sequence identity. The software typically does this as part of the sequence comparison and generates a numerical result.</p><p id="p-0802" num="0811">&#x201c;Fragments&#x201d; are also variants and the term typically refers to a selected region of the polypeptide or polynucleotide that is of interest either functionally or, for example, in an assay. &#x201c;Fragment&#x201d; thus refers to an amino acid or nucleic acid sequence that is a portion of a full-length polypeptide or polynucleotide.</p><p id="p-0803" num="0812">Such variants may be prepared using standard recombinant DNA techniques such as site-directed mutagenesis. Where insertions are to be made, synthetic DNA encoding the insertion together with 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; flanking regions corresponding to the naturally-occurring sequence either side of the insertion site may be made. The flanking regions will contain convenient restriction sites corresponding to sites in the naturally-occurring sequence so that the sequence may be cut with the appropriate enzyme(s) and the synthetic DNA ligated into the cut. The DNA is then expressed in accordance with the invention to make the encoded protein. These methods are only illustrative of the numerous standard techniques known in the art for manipulation of DNA sequences and other known techniques may also be used.</p><p id="p-0804" num="0813">All variants, fragments or homologues of the RNA-binding protein of the invention will retain the ability to bind the cognate binding site of the invention such that translation of the NOI is repressed or prevented in a viral vector production cell.</p><p id="p-0805" num="0814">All variants fragments or homologues of the binding site of the invention will retain the ability to bind the cognate RNA-binding protein, such that translation of the NOI is repressed or prevented in a viral vector production cell.</p><p id="p-0806" num="0815">Codon Optimisation</p><p id="p-0807" num="0816">The polynucleotides used in the present invention (including the NOI and/or components of the vector production system) may be codon-optimised. Codon optimisation has previously been described in WO 1999/41397 and WO 2001/79518. Different cells differ in their usage of particular codons. This codon bias corresponds to a bias in the relative abundance of particular tRNAs in the cell type. By altering the codons in the sequence so that they are tailored to match with the relative abundance of corresponding tRNAs, it is possible to increase expression. By the same token, it is possible to decrease expression by deliberately choosing codons for which the corresponding tRNAs are known to be rare in the particular cell type. Thus, an additional degree of translational control is available.</p><p id="p-0808" num="0817">Many viruses, including HIV and other lentiviruses, use a large number of rare codons and by changing these to correspond to commonly used mammalian codons, increased expression of a gene of interest, e.g. a NOI or packaging components in mammalian producer cells, can be achieved. Codon usage tables are known in the art for mammalian cells, as well as for a variety of other organisms.</p><p id="p-0809" num="0818">Codon optimisation of viral vector components has a number of other advantages. By virtue of alterations in their sequences, the nucleotide sequences encoding the packaging components of the viral particles required for assembly of viral particles in the producer cells/packaging cells have RNA instability sequences (INS) eliminated from them. At the same time, the amino acid sequence coding sequence for the packaging components is retained so that the viral components encoded by the sequences remain the same, or at least sufficiently similar that the function of the packaging components is not compromised. In lentiviral vectors codon optimisation also overcomes the Rev/RRE requirement for export, rendering optimised sequences Rev-independent. Codon optimisation also reduces homologous recombination between different constructs within the vector system (for example between the regions of overlap in the gag-pol and env open reading frames). The overall effect of codon optimisation is therefore a notable increase in viral titre and improved safety.</p><p id="p-0810" num="0819">In one embodiment only codons relating to INS are codon optimised. However, in a much more preferred and practical embodiment, the sequences are codon optimised in their entirety, with some exceptions, for example the sequence encompassing the frameshift site of gag-pol (see below).</p><p id="p-0811" num="0820">The gag-pol gene comprises two overlapping reading frames encoding the gag-pol proteins. The expression of both proteins depends on a frameshift during translation. This frameshift occurs as a result of ribosome &#x201c;slippage&#x201d; during translation. This slippage is thought to be caused at least in part by ribosome-stalling RNA secondary structures. Such secondary structures exist downstream of the frameshift site in the gag-pol gene. For HIV, the region of overlap extends from nucleotide 1222 downstream of the beginning of gag (wherein nucleotide 1 is the A of the gag ATG) to the end of gag (nt 1503). Consequently, a 281 bp fragment spanning the frameshift site and the overlapping region of the two reading frames is preferably not codon optimised. Retaining this fragment will enable more efficient expression of the Gag-Pol proteins.</p><p id="p-0812" num="0821">For EIAV the beginning of the overlap has been taken to be nt 1262 (where nucleotide 1 is the A of the gag ATG). The end of the overlap is at 1461 bp. In order to ensure that the frameshift site and the gag-pol overlap are preserved, the wild type sequence has been retained from nt 1156 to 1465.</p><p id="p-0813" num="0822">Derivations from optimal codon usage may be made, for example, in order to accommodate convenient restriction sites, and conservative amino acid changes may be introduced into the Gag-Pol proteins.</p><p id="p-0814" num="0823">In one embodiment, codon optimisation is based on lightly expressed mammalian genes. The third and sometimes the second and third base may be changed.</p><p id="p-0815" num="0824">Due to the degenerate nature of the genetic code, it will be appreciated that numerous gag-pol sequences can be achieved by a skilled worker. Also there are many retroviral variants described which can be used as a starting point for generating a codon-optimised gag-pol sequence. Lentiviral genomes can be quite variable. For example there are many quasi-species of HIV-1 which are still functional. This is also the case for EIAV. These variants may be used to enhance particular parts of the transduction process. Examples of HIV-1 variants may be found at the HIV Databases operated by Los Alamos National Security, LLC at http://hiv-web.lanl.gov. Details of EIAV clones may be found at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database located at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.</p><p id="p-0816" num="0825">The strategy for codon-optimised gag-pol sequences can be used in relation to any retrovirus. This would apply to all lentiviruses, including EIAV, FIV, BIV, CAEV, VMR, SIV, HIV-1 and HIV-2. In addition this method could be used to increase expression of genes from HTLV-1, HTLV-2, HFV, HSRV and human endogenous retroviruses (HERV), MLV and other retroviruses.</p><p id="p-0817" num="0826">Codon optimisation can render gag-pol expression Rev-independent. In order to enable the use of anti-rev or RRE factors in the lentiviral vector, however, it would be necessary to render the viral vector generation system totally Rev/RRE-independent. Thus, the genome also needs to be modified. This is achieved by optimising vector genome components. Advantageously, these modifications also lead to the production of a safer system absent of all additional proteins both in the producer and in the transduced cell.</p><p id="p-0818" num="0827">Table 1 shows sequences, wherein K may be T or G, &#x201c;R&#x201d; is to be understood as specifying a purine (i.e. A or G) at that position in the sequence, &#x201c;V&#x201d; is to be understood as specifying any nucleotide from G, A, or C and &#x201c;N&#x201d; is to be understood as specifying any nucleotide at that position in the sequence.

Ideally, it would be advantageous to be able to supply a single conserved 5&#x2032;UTR leader sequence together with the tbs when modifying the promoter of choice in order to avoid any of the potential variability in repression levels that might be directed by native 5&#x2032;UTR sequences. Surprisingly, it was found that the first exon of the EF1a promoter (SEQ ID NO; 25) provides consistently good levels of transgene repression by TRAP compared to 5&#x2032;UTR leaders comprising native leader sequences, and this leader also provides good &#x2018;ON&#x2019; levels of transgene expression in the absence of TRAP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0834" num="0842">The first 33nts of the EF1&#x3b1; exon&#x2014;herein termed &#x201c;L33 Improved leader&#x201d;&#x2014;was positioned directly upstream of the tbs, and this sequence used to replace the entire 5&#x2032;UTR of the native leader of the following promoters: RSV, EF1&#x3b1;/EFS, Ubiquitin/UBCs, SV40, human PGK and HSV TK (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). For CMV, the L33 Improved leader was compared to the original 34nt leader used in WO2015/092440, herein termed &#x201c;original leader&#x201d;. The tbs was also cloned directly into the native 5&#x2032;UTRs of these promoters at a heterologous NotI site (see Table I-Panel I/II for details of sequences). These GFP-encoding constructs were individually co-transfected into HEK293T cells+/&#x2212;a TRAP-expression plasmid, and GFP expression measured two days post-transfection by flow cytometry. A GFP Expression Score (% GFP positive cells&#xd7;MFI) was generated from flow cytometry data and plotted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0835" num="0843">The data shows that the L33 Improved leader out-performed the native 5&#x2032;UTR leaders for all the constitutive promoters tested. The presence of TRAP mediated measureable repression for all the tbs-containing constructs but the level of repression achieved was not as good for native 5&#x2032;UTR-tbs constructs compared to those containing the L33 Improved leader. Moreover, the &#x2018;ON&#x2019; levels of expression (without TRAP) for the L33 Improved leader-containing constructs were generally greater than the native 5&#x2032;UTR-tbs constructs. The L33 Improved leader performed comparably to the original leader in the CMV promoter, indicating that the greater level of repression by TRAP is achieved in both original leader and L33 Improved leader configurations.</p><p id="p-0836" num="0844">A second Improved leader&#x2014;herein termed &#x201c;L12 Improved leader&#x201d;&#x2014;was generated by truncating the L33 Improved leader to 12nts (i.e. the first 12 nts of the EF1a Exon 1), and cloned into six constitutive promoter-containing GFP reporter cassettes harboring either the MCS2.1 or MCS4.1 sequences (see below) between the tbs and the Kozak sequence. The reporters were tested for non-repressed or repressed levels of GFP expression by co-transfection of the reporter plasmids with either pBlueScript (No TRAP) or pEF1&#x3b1;-TRAP (TRAP), respectively. Transfected HEK293T cells (suspension, serum-free) were analysed by flow cytometry two days post-transfection, and GFP Expression scores (% GFP&#xd7;median fluorescence intensity) generated and log-10 transformed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0837" num="0845">The data demonstrate that the L12 Improved leader performed similarly to the L33 Improved leader&#x2014;allowing full repression by TRAP-tbs, with GFP levels repressed to background levels. Interestingly the &#x2018;ON&#x2019; (not repressed/without TRAP) levels of GFP were slightly higher for L12 or L33 depending on the promoter employed. For example, &#x2018;ON&#x2019; levels were greater for L12 in EFS constructs but for huPGK the L33 Improved leader gave the great &#x2018;ON&#x2019; levels.</p><p id="p-0838" num="0846">This will allow flexibility in being able to choose between either L12 or L33 when considering utilization of the TRIP system with different promoters, so that gene expression levels in the absence of TRAP (i.e. in vector transduced cells) can be maximized, whilst knowing that absolute repression achieved by TRAP-tbs during vector production will be extremely good for either L12 or L33 Improved leaders.</p><p id="p-0839" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00058" num="00058"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0"

compared to the Improved leaders. The Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was previously used in conjunction with a synthetic leader sequence outlined in WO2015/092440 (original leader), which typically enables the TRAP-tbs complex to repressed transgene expression by &#x3e;100-fold. The promoters tested were: Rous Sarcoms Virus (RSV), Elongation Factor 1&#x3b1; (EF1&#x3b1;), Ubiquitin C (UBC), Simian Virus 40 (SV40), (human) Phosphoglycerate kinase (huPGK), and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase (hsvTK). Note that the EF1a and UBC native 5&#x2032;UTRs result from splicing-out of an intron, which results in a spliced junction and is denoted in the sequence by two bold GG dinucleotides. It should also be noted that since the study is focused on the expression/repression of transgene at the translation level (modulated by TRAP-tbs) the presence of the introns within EF1a and UBC &#x2018;long&#x2019; pre-mRNAs are not considered since they are not present in spliced mRNA; the EF1a promoter is therefore directly comparable to the &#x2018;short&#x2019; variant (EFS) that lacks the intron, and likewise the UBC is comparable to the &#x2018;short&#x2019; UBCs promoter. Further variants of the invention in the context of the EF1a promoter (intron-containing) are described in Example 5. The constitutive promoters evaluated in the study harbored 5&#x2032;UTR leaders that comprised native leader sequence (underlined), followed by synthetic sequence up to an including a NotI site; the tbs sequence immediately followed the NotI site. The Improved leaders L33 and L12 comprises sequence derived from the first exon of the EF1a promoter. [Panel II] The tbs sequence principally used in the study to compare the impact of UTR leader sequence on transgene (GFP) repression levels by TRAP-tbs, and the semi-degenerate tbs consensus sequence. [Panel III] Sequences comprising the multiple cloning sites sequence evaluated in the study compared to No MCS, which was used in WO2015092440. Underlined sequence comprises the 3&#x2032; end of the tbs, italicized sequence comprises restriction enzyme (RE) sites (some overlap the tbs and/or each other to allow for sequence compression in order to minimize the sequence between the tbs and core Kozak sequence), and the core Kozak sequence is in bold.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 2: Identification of Optimal Tbs-MCS-Transgene Configurations</heading><p id="p-0841" num="0848">To improve the tractability of the TRIP system&#x2014;particularly for commercialization within a &#x2018;kit&#x2019;&#x2014;it is desirable to be able to have the ability to clone a transgene of interest directly into the expression cassette containing the promoter-5&#x2032;UTR-tbs sequence via the option of several different restriction enzymes (RE) i.e. a multiple cloning site (MCS) (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). However, given that 5&#x2032;UTR leader sequences can modulate the degree of TRAP-mediated repression, and that the close proximity of the tbs to the ATG initiation codon is important, it was not obvious at the outset of this work as to how many and/or what combinations of RE sites could be used whilst maintaining TRAP-mediated repression.</p><p id="p-0842" num="0849">In addition, a further requirement was to ensure that the &#x2018;ON&#x2019; levels of the transgene (without TRAP) are high i.e. an efficient core Kozak sequence must be maintained within or between the MCS and the ATG. This required sequence &#x2018;compression&#x2019; such that several (overlapping) RE sites could be incorporated in as short a distance as possible from the tbs to the ATG (to retain proximity of tbs to ATG), whilst also maintaining an efficient core Kozak sequence of consensus RVVATG. The design of seven MCS variants cloned between the tbs and the ATG codon of the transgene (in this case GFP) is reported in Table I-Panel III (sequences; SEQ ID NOs: 52-58) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. Variants MCS2.1 to MCS4.4 incorporate progressively more (overlapping) RE sites between the tbs and the core Kozak sequence, whilst ensuring a relatively short distance (&#x3c;15nt) between the tbs and the ATG codon. In all cases it was possible to position either a SacI or SpeI site overlapping the 3&#x2032;terminus of the tbs without disrupting the consensus of the final 1-2 repeats (KAGNN). The MCS variants introduced between 2 to 4 RE sites or 3 to 5 REs sites if the NcoI site is retained in the transgene core Kozak sequence (dependent on a G downstream of ATG); across all the MCS variants a total of 15 RE sites (16 including the NcoI) were tested as part of MCSs in this context, and also in the context of the EFS promoter using the L33 Improved leader described in Example 1 to ensure that any differences observed would not be due to influence of the sequences upstream of the tbs. These GFP-encoding MCS variants (cloned within a scAAV2 vector genome cassette) were individually co-transfected into HEK293T cells+/&#x2212;a TRAP-expression plasmid, and GFP expression measured two days post-transfection by flow cytometry. A GFP Expression Score (% GFP positive cells&#xd7;MFI) was generated from flow cytometry data and plotted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0843" num="0850">The data identifies that all seven MCS variants could be repressed to levels similar to the original reporter construct (driven by stronger CMV promoter), which contained no MCS between the tbs and ATG codon (the tbs and ATG is separated by 9nt in the original reporter). Importantly, six of the seven variants showed better repression by TRAP compared to the original reporter construct, and variants MCS2.1, MCS4.1 and MCS4.4 were repressed to undetectable levels, with virtually no impact on &#x2018;ON&#x2019; levels (without TRAP).</p><p id="p-0844" num="0851">To further validate the MCS2.1 and MCS4.1 variants, these sequences were cloned into scAAV2 vector genome reporter constructs encoding the constitutive promoters&#x2014;CMV, RSV, EFS, UBCs, SV40, huPGK and HSVTK&#x2014;together with the L33 Improved leader. These GFP-encoding reporter constructs were individually co-transfected into HEK293T cells+/&#x2212;a TRAP-expression plasmid, and GFP expression measured two days post-transfection by flow cytometry. A GFP Expression Score (% GFP positive cells&#xd7;MFI) was generated from flow cytometry data and plotted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0845" num="0852">The data demonstrates that the MCS2.1 and MCS4.1 variants display an excellent TRIP repression profile irrespective of the promoter being utilized. The average fold-repression across the set of constructs containing either of the two MCS variants was &#x2dc;5000-fold, and for many constructs close to the limit of GFP detection in the assay.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 3: Optimisation of Tbs-Kozak Junction</heading><p id="p-0846" num="0853">The testing of the MCS variants in Example 2 demonstrated that the sequence context between the terminus of the tbs and the ATG codon may also play a role in the degree of repression achieved by TRAP. Also, it was hypothesized that improved levels of repression (compared to the original configuration in WO2015092440) might be achieved by &#x2018;hiding&#x2019; the Kozak sequence within the 3&#x2032; terminus of the tbs (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). To be able to achieve this, the terminal 1-2 repeat consensus (KAGNN) of the tbs would necessarily need to partially overlap the Kozak sequence.</p><p id="p-0847" num="0854">Four tbs-Kozak variants were designed (see Table II-Panel I) and cloned into a GFP reporter construct as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>. Variants 0, 1 and 2 were designed such that the extended Kozak sequence (conforming to consensus GNNRVVATG) overlapped with the final two tbs repeat sequences, whereas Variant 3 overlapped just the final tbs repeat sequence. These variants, along with the original reporter in which the Kozak sequence is 3 nucleotides downstream of the final tbs repeat sequence (i.e. no overlap), were individually co-transfected into HEK293T cells+/&#x2212;a TRAP-expression plasmid, and GFP expression measured two days post-transfection by flow cytometry. A GFP Expression Score (% GFP positive cells&#xd7;MFI) was generated from flow cytometry data and plotted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0848" num="0855">Two of these tbs-Kozak variants were tested in conjunction with two different promoters (EFS and huPGK) within scAAV2 vector genome expression cassettes, and compared to tbs-containing cassettes that did not have overlapping tbs/Kozak sequences.

A GFP Expression Score (% GFP positive cells&#xd7;MFI) was generated from flow cytometry data and plotted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). The non-overlapping tbs/Kozak variants (Original and a second variant containing an HpaI site between the tbs and the Kozak) were capable of 50-to-100 fold repression, whereas the new tbs-Kozak variants (tbs_V0 and tbs_V3) were repressed by at least 10-times this (500-to-3500 fold). These tbs-Kozak variants also performed similarly when the L33 or L12 Improved leaders were employed in either EFS or huPGK promoter cassettes. Importantly, the &#x2018;ON&#x2019; levels (no TRAP) for the new variants were similar to the non-overlapping tbs/Kozak variants, indicating that the Kozak sequences within the new variants were effective at directing efficient translation.</p><p id="p-0849" num="0856">The data indicates that all of the tbs-Kozak variants were capable of similar levels of &#x2018;ON&#x2019; transgene expression, showing that the Kozak sequences directed efficient levels of translation initiation. Variant 1 was poorly repressed by TRAP when compared to the original reporter configuration (10-fold higher levels of GFP expression in the presence of TRAP). However, surprisingly Variants 0, 2 and 3 were repressed to lower levels compared to the original configuration.</p><p id="p-0850" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00059" num="00059"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE&#x2003;II</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Optimal&#x2003;3&#x2032;tbs-Kozak&#x2003;junction&#x2003;sequences</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="133pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Panel&#x2003;I</entry><entry>Optimal&#x2003;3&#x2032;tbs-Kozak&#x2003;junction</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Original</entry><entry>[kagnn]aca<b>GCCACCATG</b></entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Variant&#x2003;&#x2018;0&#x2019;</entry><entry>|ka<b>GCC</b>][<b>GAGAT</b>]<b>G</b></entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Variant&#x2003;&#x2018;1&#x2019;</entry><entry>[kag<b>GC</b>][<b>GAGCA</b>]<b>TG</b></entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Variant&#x2003;&#x2018;2&#x2019;</entry><entry>|kagn<b>G</b>][<b>GAGCC</b>]<b>ATG</b></entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Variant&#x2003;&#x2018;3&#x2019;</entry><entry>[kagnn][<b>GAGAC</b>]<b>CATG</b></entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0851" num="0857">[Panel I] Variant Kozak sequences designed to overlap the 3&#x2032; end of the upstream tbs sequence.

To assess if the tbs-Kozak variants &#x2018;performed&#x2019; similarly within the full length EF1a promoter (i.e. post splicing-out of the intron), three tbs-Kozak variants (0, 2 and 3) were cloned into a GFP reporter cassette containing the EF1a promoter (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>). After splicing, the 5&#x2032;UTR contains exon1 (i.e. the L33 Improved leader), a short 12nt sequence comprising the first nucleotides of exon2, and then a tbs-Kozak variant sequence (SEQ ID NO: 60). These GFP reporter plasmids, along with a reporter containing no tbs, were individually co-transfected into suspension, serum-free HEK293T cells+/&#x2212;a TRAP-expression plasmid, and GFP expression measured two days post-transfection by flow cytometry. A GFP Expression Score (% GFP positive cells&#xd7;MFI) was generated from flow cytometry data and plotted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>). Further, these tbs-containing GFP expression cassettes were cloned into an HIV-1 based lentiviral vector genome plasmid (in which the MSD and crSD were inactivated, see below), and a similar experiment carried out in suspension, serum-free HEK293T cells, resulting in GFP Expression scores (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>100</b></figref>). The data show that indeed the overlapping tbs-Kozak variants were capable of improved transgene repression compared to the non-overlapping tbs/Kozak variant employed.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 6&#x2014;MSD-2KO Lentiviral Vectors Produce Less Transgene Protein During Production Due to Ablation of Aberrant Splicing</heading><p id="p-0859" num="0864">A further advantage of ablating aberrant splicing during lentiviral vector production is to reduce the amount of transgene-encoding mRNA that leads to transgene protein production.</p><p id="p-0860" num="0865">During the course of this work, we unexpectedly found that transgene-encoding mRNAs were effectively produced from the &#x2018;external&#x2019; (CMV) promoter driving the vector genome cassette due to splicing-out from the splicing region of the SL2 (part of the packaging signal) to internal splice acceptor sites (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>). The degree to which this occurs depends on the internal sequences between the cppt and the transgene ORF (i.e. the promoter-5&#x2032;UTR sequence). The use of the EF1a promoter (containing a very strong splice acceptor) in the transgene cassette, results in aberrant splicing from the MSD in over 95% of total transcripts originating from the external promoter (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). By comparing total GFP expression in standard or MSD-2KO lentiviral vector production cultures (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>), we show that up to 80% of the transgene protein expressed during production originates from the aberrant splice product.

These were based on all the possible variants encoded by three &#x2018;overlap groups&#x2019;; KAGatg (where the KAGNN consensus overlaps the ATG of the core Kozak as much as possible, i.e. overlaps by the first two nucleotides of the ATG of the core Kozak), KAGNatg (where the KAGNN consensus overlaps the first nucleotide of the ATG of the core Kozak) and KAGNNatg (where the KAGNN consensus does not overlap the ATG of the core Kozak). (The initial variants tbs-kzkV0, tbs-kzkV1 and tbs-kzkV2 in Examples 3 and 5 fall within these defined groups). Any variants within these groups that generated a &#x2018;GT&#x2019; dinucleotide were not generated/evaluated because of the undesirable possibility that these may produce cryptic splice donor

These variants were cloned into a pEF1&#x3b1;-GFP reporter plasmid, and therefore the 5&#x2032;UTR contained (after splicing of its intron) the L33 leader (exon 1) plus a short 12nt sequence from exon 2, which was previously shown in Example 5 to be less repressible by TRAP unless an overlapping tbs-Kozak variant was used. Suspension (serum-free) HEK293T cells were transfected with these variants individually with or without a TRAP-expression plasmid under conditions that typically reflected lentiviral vector (LV) transfection/production (e.g. inclusion of sodium butyrate induction), and flow cytometry performed at typical LV harvest times (2 days post-transfection). Global GFP Expression scores were generated (% GFP&#xd7;MFI; ArbU) for +/&#x2212;TRAP conditions and then fold-repression values generated and plotted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>. The results demonstrate that the more the core Kozak consensus sequence overlaps the 3&#x2032; terminal KAGNN tbs repeat, the better the level of TRAP repression. Statistical analysis (T-Test) of the fold differences of each overlap group demonstrate a significant increase in repression as more of the core Kozak was overlapped with the 3&#x2032; terminal KAGNN tbs repeat, with the best repression scores coming from the KAGatg group where &#x2154;<sup>rd </sup>of the initiation codon forms part of the KAGNN repeat.

The two variants from the KAGatg overlap group are highlighted to show that for these two best performing variants in terms of TRAP repression, the GAGatg variant (tbskzkV0.G) gave the highest &#x2018;ON&#x2019; levels, presumably because it conforms to the core Kozak consensus of RVVATG, whereas TAGatg (tbskzkV0.T) does not.</p><p id="p-0867" num="0871">All these data support the general principle that overlapping tbs-Kozak variants are more effective in mediating TRAP repression compared to non-overlapping tbs variants, and that preferably the tbs-Kozak overlap conforms to the core Kozak consensus of RVVATG to ensure good &#x2018;ON&#x2019; transgene expression in vector-transduced target cells. Thus, the employment of these novel tbs-Kozak variants will enable more efficient transgene repression during viral vector production, potentially leading to increase in viral vector titres if said transgene protein activity is detrimental to viral vector titres and/or activity.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example 8: Further Use of an Optimal Overlapping tbs-Kozak Variant to Improve TRAP-Mediated Repression of Common Promoters Harbouring an Intron</heading><p id="p-0868" num="0872">In Example 5, the use of overlapping tbs-Kozak variants was shown to improve TRAP-mediated repression when using the full length EF1a promoter, which contains an intron. For similar promoters used widely in viral vector genomes for gene therapy&#x2014;for example the CAG promoter&#x2014;the presence of embedded exon/intron sequence means that the degree of TRAP-mediated repression may be affected by sequences within &#x2018;native&#x2019; exonic sequences. From the point of view of improving TRAP-mediated repression, it may not be obvious or feasible to alter exonic sequences, especially if these are involved in splicing enhancement (e.g. a splice enhancer element close to the splice donor site). The widely used CAG promoter comprises the CMV enhancer element, the core chicken &#x3b2;-Actin gene promoter-exon1-intron sequence, and the splice acceptor-exonic sequence from the rabbit &#x3b2;-Globin gene. Elsewhere in the invention it was surprisingly found that exon 1 from the EF1a promoter (L33) could be used upstream of all types of tbs variants to improve TRAP-mediated repression, presumably providing good sequence context to support formation a stable TRAP-tbs complex, to enable efficient translation inhibition. The overlapping tbs-Kozak variants were shown to aid TRAP-mediated repression in both EF1a (intron-containing) and several other promoters lacking introns.</p><p id="p-0869" num="0873">In this example (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>), both features were applied to improving TRAP-mediated repression from the CAG promoter by [a] placing the tbskzkV0.G variant (also referred to as Variant &#x2018;0&#x2019; in other Examples) within the &#x2018;native&#x2019; 5&#x2032;UTR region of the CAG promoter (SEQ ID NO: 117) and [b], swapping the entire &#x2018;native&#x2019; intron-containing 5&#x2032;UTR region with the EF1a 5&#x2032;UTR-intron region harbouring the tbskzkV0.G variant (SEQ ID NO: 118). The corresponding spliced sequences are shown as SEQ ID NO: 119 and SEQ ID NO: 120, respectively. In addition, it was shown by exemplification that a promoter typically used without an intron in viral vector genomes&#x2014;in this case CMV&#x2014;could be appended with an artificial 5&#x2032;UTR containing a heterologous intron, expression of which had previously shown to be efficiently repressed by TRAP. Specifically, the 5&#x2032;UTR with the EF1a 5&#x2032;UTR-intron region harbouring the tbskzkV0.G variant (SEQ ID NO: 118) was used in the CMV promoter context.</p><p id="p-0870" num="0874">These reporter constructs (encoding GFP) were evaluated for both &#x2018;ON&#x2019; expression levels and TRAP-mediated repression in suspension (serum-free) HEK293T cells, modelling a viral vector production scenario. Cells were transfected with GFP reporter plasmid+/&#x2212;pTRAP, cultures induced with sodium butyrate after transfection (as per typical viral vector production) and cells analysed for GFP expression &#x2dc;2 days post-transfection (i.e. at typical viral vector harvest point). GFP Expression scores (% GFP positive&#xd7;MFI; ArbU) were generated and plotted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>), and TRAP-repression scores displayed. These data indicate that TRAP-mediated expression in typical viral vector production cells can be improved from the CAG promoter using the tbskzkV0.G variant, from 3-fold to 30-fold. Moreover, the data show that the &#x2018;native&#x2019; 5&#x2032;UTR region sequence from different promoters can be replaced with the intron-containing EF1a 5&#x2032;UTR harbouring the tbsKzkV0.G variant, leading to both substantially improved TRAP-mediated repression (30-40 fold to &#x3e;100-fold) and maintenance of high gene expression in the absence of TRAP (i.e. modelling expression in viral vector-transduced target cells). Thus, the novel EF1a-5&#x2032;UTR-intron-tbskzkV0.G sequence may be useful in providing heterologous promoters the known benefits imparted by an intron in target cells (i.e. increased gene expression), whilst also enabling efficient repression of the transgene protein during viral vector production, potentially leading to increase in viral vector titres if said transgene protein activity is detrimental to viral vector titres. This also applies to the use of the EF1&#x3b1;-5&#x2032;UTR-intron sequence with other overlapping tbs-Kozak sequences.</p><p id="p-0871" num="0875">All publications mentioned in the above specification are herein incorporated by reference.
