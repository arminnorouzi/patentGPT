Typically, in radio, such broadcasters' listening areas are associated with a national, metropolitan area or geographic region and commercial time is sold to advertisers within that area or region.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, conventionally, the value of such commercial time is, in part, based on the number of listeners that are potentially hearing a commercial; nevertheless, the effectiveness of those commercials (and the promotional material included therein) in persuading a listener to partake of an advertised product or service or visit an advertiser's location may be based, at least in part, on the availability of the advertiser's product, service or location to a listener. Thus, although a radio station listener may hear an advertiser's commercial, the likelihood that the listener may purchase the advertiser's product/service or visit the advertiser's location is at least in part based on the availability of advertiser's product/service or proximity of the advertiser's location.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Still further, in some cases the promotional material details included or referred to in the commercial are too voluminous or complicated for the listener to remember and record in the time of the commercial. This is particularly true if the listener is also driving a vehicle or engaged in another activity while listening to the advertisement. These deficiencies severely limit the efficacy of the commercial in persuading a listener to partake of an advertised product or service or visit an advertiser's location.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of various invention embodiments.

To the contrary, those skilled in the art should appreciate that there are numerous variations and equivalents that may be employed without departing from the scope of the present invention. Those equivalents and variations are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the following description of various embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, various embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and functional modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It should be understood that the term &#x201c;radio broadcaster&#x201d; is meant to include organizations and/or individuals involved in the broadcast of audio radio broadcasting area wide programming (local, regional, national) and localized auxiliary information. The term &#x201c;broadcasting area wide programming&#x201d; or &#x201c;license coverage area&#x201d; is meant to include, for example, programming content that is intended to be distributed throughout a particular broadcasting area or more than one area including regional or national areas if multiple radio broadcasters are included for example in radio network broadcasting; thus, depending on the format of the station, such programming may include, for example, talk radio programs, music programs, songs, sporting event coverage, etc. Likewise, the term &#x201c;localized auxiliary information&#x201d; is meant to include, e.g., advertisements, public safety information, public service information, emergency broadcast information, program related content, etc. Thus, radio broadcasters are not limited to individuals or organizations owning licenses for radio broadcasting; however, the term radio broadcaster does include such individuals or organizations.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In explaining the operation of various disclosed embodiments, description of one or more &#x201c;main transmitters&#x201d; and &#x201c;booster transmitters&#x201d; is provided. It should be understood that the term &#x201c;main transmitter&#x201d; encompasses a transmitter that may be, for example, the only transmitter used by a radio broadcaster in a particular radio broadcasting area, or it may be the most powerful (or one of the most powerful) transmitters comprising a single frequency network in the radio broadcasting area.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">To the contrary, the term &#x201c;booster transmitter&#x201d; (which is interchangeable with the term &#x201c;signal boosters&#x201d; and &#x201c;auxiliary transmitter&#x201d;) includes low-power transmitters (relative to the maximum class of the main transmitter), which are conventionally used to improve communications in locations within the normal coverage area of a radio system where the radio signal is blocked or shielded due to natural terrain or man-made obstacles (e.g., to provide fill-in coverage but not increase the normal coverage area).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As explained in U.S. Pat. No. 9,232,481, entitled &#x201c;EQUIPMENT, SYSTEM AND METHODOLOGIES FOR ROBUST COVERAGE IN A BROADCAST AREA&#x201d; and U.S. Pat. No. 8,862,048, &#x201c;EQUIPMENT, SYSTEM AND METHODOLOGIES FOR SEGMENTATION OF LISTENING AREA INTO SUB-AREAS ENABLING DELIVERY OF LOCALIZED AUXILIARY INFORMATION&#x201d; (both expressly incorporated by reference herein), a segmented listening area that is configured to deliver localized auxiliary information may utilize &#x201c;zones&#x201d; within the FCC defined service area of a radio broadcast transmitter associated with a particular broadcaster. These zones may contain 1 to N number of on-channel, same frequency boosters that broadcast, in a simulcast manner, during specific instances in time.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Although advertisers reach large audiences by purchasing commercial time from broadcast and Internet media providers, targeting advertisements to specific localized geographical areas is desired by advertisers and is available through other traditional and digital publishers offering advertising supported media targeting local audiences.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As discussed in those references, in an FM implementation, the design of geographic zones may be such that the signal power from the on-channel boosters in a zone may radiate a signal significantly stronger than the broadcaster's main station transmitter in the zone. Therefore, FM receivers in the zone capture on the on-channel booster signal rather than the main transmitter signal by using signal processing in its circuitry and software to compare received signals from the main and auxiliary transmitters and rejecting the weaker signal. Thus, a broadcaster can transmit different, local audio information to the specific zone versus what is broadcast over the main transmitter. At the same time, there may exist several other on-channel zones within the listening area that are simultaneously, and/or independently, broadcasting different information that the broadcaster wants to transmit in that particular zone. These zones may be separated geographically so as not to emit transmission signals that interfere with each other.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, optionally, promotional content may be transmitted from the booster transmitter(s) in a Time Division Multiplex Access (TDMA) frame structure such that the information to be broadcast on each transmitter does not overlap in time. As a result, the booster transmitter(s) can transmit on multiple RF frequencies separated by time, and provide localized auxiliary content transmission on different transmission frequencies within the particular zone(s) of more than one radio broadcaster.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">With this understanding of the technical aspects of at least some radio broadcasting in mind, it is known further that one media that is widely used for advertising is FM broadcast radio. Many listeners of FM broadcasts are drivers or passengers in automobiles. Conventionally, FM broadcasters reach a large geographic area using a main transmitter and one or more auxiliary transmitters simulcasting the main transmitter broadcast such that listeners hear the same commercial everywhere the FM broadcast signal reaches. As a result, localizing an advertisement to reach an area smaller than the typical FM broadcast signal footprint has not been possible.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Another media that is widely used for advertising is HD Radio&#x2122;, which is also frequently used to reach drivers or passengers in automobiles. HD Radio&#x2122; is the brand name one implementation of In-Band On-Channel (IBOC) digital radio broadcast technology, which can use a portion of the existing radio station frequency allocation to simulcast an existing analog radio station in digital format with less noise and with additional text and graphical information. In implementation, the system actually broadcasts unused channels adjacent to an existing radio station's allocation leaving the original analog signal intact, allowing enabled receivers to switch between digital and analog.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Conventionally, potential consumers now use smart devices such as smartphones, smart watches, tablets, and laptops to receive, collect and save information and data for later use. For example, coupons, sales and other promotional material, and loyalty program identifiers can be collected and stored on smart devices.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Moreover, listeners of broadcast radio audio advertisements have to memorize a slogan, contact information (physical, telephone, Internet or other) or a discount code, or remember the time and place of an advertised offer.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As a result, there is no effective way for advertisers on FM broadcast stations to both target localized audiences and to deliver advertising content to listeners' smart devices in the localized audience while minimizing the need for listener actions.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Conventionally, various mechanisms have been proposed and implemented for targeted advertising that exploits the ability of zone cast casting to transmit local information from FM broadcast boosters. However, these targeted advertisements pertain to audio programming and do not interact with a smart device.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Xperi&#x2122; (Ibiquity&#xae; has proposed targeting audiences via each of the HD1-4 audio sub-channels. This targeting, however, is demographic-based, not geographic and, as a result, fails to serve localized audiences.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Xapp&#xae; has proposed use of speech recognition to allow a listener to interact with broadcast radio content including advertising. However, that interaction is limited to the broadcast radio receiver and must be augmented with wide area networking and computing resources to perform actions requested by a listener.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Still further, SiriusXM&#xae; has proposed use of a receiver with an included flash memory card that potential consumers would need to remove and then insert into a personal computer or other non-radio enabled processing device in order to take advantage of an offer to purchase music. Of note, SiriusXM is a satellite broadcast service that covers extensive geographic areas and only uses boosters to provide coverage in places where the satellite signal is blocked such as tunnels.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">StratosAudio&#xae; has proposed a system, in which an offer code is displayed as text on a receiver using the Radio Broadcasting Database System (RBCS). However, the potential consumer is required to memorize or save that text data.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">With this understanding of the technical landscape in mind, it should also be noted that social media tools, services and platforms collect data on their members' activities and interests, and data aggregation companies collect data on potential consumers, to provide detailed information to advertisers to enable more focused and effective campaigns. Nevertheless, such fine-grained demographic data does not include location specific data, in particular, if a potential consumer is travelling by automobile, to provide targeted advertising to that potential consumer on a real time or near real time basis.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In accordance with disclosed embodiments, a system and method operations utilize the functionality of local zone cast casting boosters to deliver advertising or other content in a form that is easily transferable to a smart device. As discussed above, zone casting enables advertisers to reach localized audiences in selected neighborhoods within a larger FM broadcast footprint. For example, disclosed embodiments enable the ability for a potential consumer to easily take a coupon or discount code with them after they leave their transportation vehicle and use it when purchasing a good or service.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">QR codes are graphical encodings of data that is machine readable. Data may include encoded text that comprise links known as URLs as well as information such as an image file of a sales coupon. In use, for example, restaurants conventionally place QR code graphics that encode the URL or web address, or a link to a downloadable file of their menus. Smart devices include cameras that can decode QR codes and recover the encoded text. The link can then be followed to download the information that the QR code text referenced.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In implementation of the disclosed embodiments, a server may provide the information needed by each booster to provide the local content. Additionally, the sever schedules the insertion of the local content in each booster's programming.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a system <b>100</b> for inserting sub-audible identifiers to deliver QR codes or other promotional material to a smart device via a localized zone cast in accordance with the disclosed embodiments.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an advertising server (not shown) may insert (see <b>130</b>) unique subaudible tone sequences or non-interfering audio tone sequences implemented as an audio watermark or other similar encoding <b>120</b> into the programming and promotional material (e.g., advertising) <b>110</b> and transmit (see <b>140</b>) that combination to a zone casting booster <b>150</b>. Such subaudible tones can contain a data item that enables retrieval of additional information, e.g., promotional information such as a coupon or discount code. The subaudible tones can also carry identifiers such as a URL that links to more detailed information.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Thereafter, the local zone casting booster <b>150</b> transmits (see <b>160</b>) the combination for receipt by a radio receiver <b>170</b> for subsequent output to one or more potential consumers, e.g., in a transportation vehicle. As a result of that transmission and receipt, a software application potential consumer's smart device may monitor (see <b>180</b>) for the subaudible tone sequences <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">More specifically, in accordance with at least one embodiment, the software application on the potential consumer's smart device may use the smart device's microphone to listen for subaudible tones <b>120</b>.
