As such, the pre-programmed profiles may include tilt up or tilt down on treadmills or pedal resistance changes on stationary bicycles, but they are not related to a road or path shown on video. iFit is a video subscription service for exercise equipment that shows personal trainers taking actual real world paths but the link between the video and the exercise equipment is non-existent. RunTV shows real world paths with and without coaches; this system will adjust speed of video based upon footfall speed on exercise equipment. At YouTube.com, some training videos display the video of the real road with beautiful music but are not interactive with the exercise equipment.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For bicycle trainers, U.S. Pat.

As an example, the grade of a bicycle path and a wind speed may be constantly changing throughout a workout as a user rides on a windy, hilly, simulated course. Thus, the bicycle trainer will continually update a power set point based on the variables received from a computing device and the instantaneous speed of the rider based on the rider's pedaling of the bicycle trainer. The bicycle trainer is able to control the feel of a ride through electromagnetic resistance to simulate a windy hill climb by increasing the electromagnetic resistance (and then reducing the electromagnetic resistance when descending the hill or experiencing a strong tail wind).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are some training devices that can simulate virtual road like what you can experience in a bike or car racing game, but they cannot really simulate the grade/slope of the road because the road itself is virtual but not real.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, a video playback and interface system for exercise training equipment is provided wherein the location, speed and slope data are gathered during the video recording of an actual exercise path and the gathered data is further processed to provide a simulated exercise experience of the video.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, the connected exercise training equipment is an exercise bicycle, treadmill, rowing machine or swim trainer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment, the video playback speed is determined by exercise training equipment speed.

The exercise training equipment <b>102</b> may be any such equipment including recumbent or upright bicycle trainer, bicycle on flywheel trainer, and treadmill. A speedometer <b>104</b> attached or part of exercise training equipment <b>102</b> provides speed date to a processor board <b>108</b>. The processor board <b>108</b> also receives input from a downloaded processed video <b>112</b>. The downloaded video <b>112</b> may be stored on the internet <b>114</b>, a portable or computer hard drive, USB memory, CD, DVD or another video storage medium. The downloaded video <b>112</b> was processed by a video process device <b>118</b> which then uploaded the processed video <b>116</b> to the internet <b>114</b> or other video storage medium. The video process device <b>118</b> gets its input from the raw route video <b>120</b> shot on a video camera <b>122</b> and from geographic data <b>124</b> obtained through global positioning satellite detectors <b>126</b> or other location and slope determination means including cellular mobile communication (such as 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G networks), Bluetooth Low Energy, WiFi, Near Field Communication (NFC), Ultra Wideband (UWB), or other radiofrequency means and inclinometer. The geographic data consists of latitude and longitude and may also include altitude. The video process device <b>118</b> may also be connected to an inclinometer (<b>134</b>) to record slope data along the route; processing of altitude data from GPS may also provide similar information but altitude information requires connection to additional satellites for triangulation, which may not be available in all locations.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The display equipment <b>100</b> may be a mobile phone, tablet, glasses, smart watch, projector, television, video monitor or any other device capable of displaying video content.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The processor board <b>108</b> uses the speed data <b>106</b> to continuously adjust the speed of the video displayed on the display equipment <b>100</b> by sending the video signal <b>110</b>.

For example, a resistance signal <b>130</b> is sent by control board <b>128</b> to a resistance device <b>132</b> attached to the exercise training equipment <b>102</b>. The resistance device <b>132</b> may be built into the exercise training equipment <b>102</b> or may be an external device attached to the exercise training equipment <b>102</b>.

The motor and gear box may be of any type and may provide resistance to the training equipment by any means including friction or gear engagement. Another possible arrangement is for motor (<b>300</b>) to be a linear or step motor that moves one or multiple permanently installed magnets close to or farther away from the spinning disk that creates resistance. Another possible arrangement is that the resistance device (<b>132</b>) generates resistance fully using an electromagnet, which in this case both motor (<b>300</b>) and gear box (<b>302</b>) are not needed, and the resistance is adjusted by electric current controlled by a signal from the control board (<b>128</b>).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, one possible flow for the exercise equipment trainer user interface is provided. This example is for a bicycle trainer, but a similar flow can be provided for a treadmill or other exercise equipment trainer. The exercise equipment trainer user starts the controller at <b>400</b> and is asked if this a first ride at <b>402</b>. If the answer is no, then the user is asked if previous rides should be resumed at <b>404</b>.

The example provided is for a route on a road but may be modified for any actual path, including trail or waterway. When preparing to video record a route at <b>500</b>, the route road speed limit is checked and a target vehicle speed for recording is determined at <b>502</b>. The video recording speed may be determined based upon the road speed limit, the vehicle speed or another factor at <b>504</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the chosen speed as an example is 20 miles per hour at <b>502</b>. If the speed is above 20 miles per hour, then the recording speed is set at 240 frames per second or if the speed is below 20 miles per hour, then the recording speed is set at 120 frames per second. In actuality, the speed limit or vehicle speed for determining recording speed can be any value other than 20 miles per hour and the chosen recording speed can be any that is feasible. The recording speed may be any feasible speed though the ultimate goal is to have a high definition video that can be displayed without pixelation, skipping or other poor video quality characteristics; the high definition video should be able to be displayed at any playback speed. An inclinometer is calibrated at <b>512</b> and the video recording, GPS data and inclinometer data recording begin simultaneously at <b>514</b>, the vehicle moves forward at <b>516</b> and maintain a constant speed at <b>518</b>. The vehicle stops, along with video and incline data recording, at the end of the route (<b>520</b>) with process end at <b>522</b>. At <b>514</b>, actual speed data may also be recorded for use in video processing. A step may be needed to calibrate the GPS and speed device prior to video recording process.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, one possible flowchart for processing videos is provided. At the start <b>600</b>, the slope data and video file are loaded to the computer at <b>602</b> and <b>606</b>, respectively. The slope data is converted to a usable format at <b>604</b>. For the video file, the GPS data is extracted and converted to a usable format, typically the same format as the slope data, at <b>608</b>; unneeded data is removed at <b>610</b> and the GPS and slope data are then integrated together.

Data integration may form a single data file or data packet with both video and slope data or a package with a separate video file and one or more slope data files. A manual video correction is then performed at <b>618</b>; further details are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.

This video correction editing can be done either manually or through computer programs, it will not always be needed but circumstances during recording may require this process. When video correction editing is determined to be needed at <b>700</b>, recall the target vehicle speed at step <b>702</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> step <b>502</b>. Determine if any unintended stops were made at <b>704</b>. If yes, then remove the video frames when stopped. Then determine if there were any unnecessary hard braking at <b>708</b>. If yes, then remove some of the frames when braking hard at <b>710</b>. At <b>712</b>, add or remove frames to correct for actual vehicle speed versus target vehicle speed; if the actual vehicle speed was faster than target vehicle speed, then frames will need to be added and vice versa if the actual vehicle speed was slower than target.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As an alternative to removing or duplicating frames at <b>712</b>, the actual speed data can be used to adjust playback speed variably; if the actual speed is faster than target speed, then the playback can be slowed to simulate the target speed and vice versa if the actual speed is slower than the target speed. However, in the former case, resolution may be lost in the video playback as less frames are displayed or shown per time unit.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">At <b>714</b>, determine if the slope data is correct.

At the start <b>800</b>, a default friction resistance factor is set at <b>802</b>, speed data is read at <b>804</b> and a wind resistance factor is determined from the speed data at <b>806</b>. Slope data is read at <b>808</b> and an incline or gravity resistance factor is determined from the slope data at <b>810</b>. The friction, wind and incline or gravity resistance factors are then used to calculate combined resistance factor at <b>812</b>, this process provided occurs continuously to provide a continuously changing resistance on the exercise training equipment as the incline, speed and friction change.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some situations, especially when the actual road has a long steep downhill section, the gravity force may become so big that it will pull the bike forward despite all combined resistance. In these situations, the combined resistance factor can be zero or negative and impacts the video playback speed. Thus at <b>814</b>, a determination is made what resistance factor to apply based upon the combined resistance factor. If the combined resistance factor is positive, the combined resistance factor is applied at <b>820</b> and the video playback speed will be determined by the rider pedal speed at <b>822</b>. However if the combined resistance factor is zero or negative, the gravity force may pull the bike faster than the rider pedal speed and a minimal resistance may be applied at <b>816</b> with the video playback speed will then be decided by a separate algorithm at <b>818</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a flow diagram for another possible scheme for processing videos is provided.

Based on the target vehicle speed, actual vehicle speed and video recording speed, a decision is made as to whether frames are to be kept, removed or added at <b>908</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> provides one possible method for doing this. After <b>908</b>, one data file F<b>1</b> with frames and their related data that will be kept or added is created at <b>910</b>. Another data file F<b>2</b> with frames that will be removed or added is created at <b>912</b>.

This video correction process provided is manual, but the editing can be done either manually or through computer programs. This video correction process will not always be needed but special circumstances, e.g. when slope changes dramatically like going uphill to downhill within the distance of the slope measurement interval, during recording may require this process. When video correction process is determined to be needed at <b>1000</b>, the whole video will be viewed and checked manually at step <b>1002</b>.

Using the process outlined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, video viewers (e.g. riders) may move forward at different speeds and may even make a stop and then move again at any place and time; following the process in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> for editing of the exercise video ensures that users have a high quality video and interactive experience in any use situation. Thus, adjusting the potentially inconsistent actual vehicle moving speed to be constant in the video is critical when the video is played at a constant normal video playback speed. To reach this goal, the distance traveled per frame should be constant throughout the video. During the route video recording, it is inevitable that the video recording vehicle is sometimes slower than target recording vehicle speed, and sometimes it is faster. That means in the video, some video sections have slower actual recording vehicle speed, and some video sections have faster actual recording vehicle speed. Thus, the video needs to be processed to adjust for the variable actual recording vehicle speed.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">When in one section the video recording vehicle actual speed is slower than target speed, which means in this video section average frame to frame distance traveled is shorter than that at target speed, frames will be removed; when in one section the video recording vehicle actual speed is faster than target speed, which means in the video average frame to frame distance traveled is longer than that of target speed, frames will added.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">After the process starts at <b>1100</b>, target vehicle speed for the video is chosen at <b>1102</b>, with the actual vehicle speed and video recording speed (fps: frame per second) collected at <b>1103</b>.
