Depending on the driving mode, the electric machine of the front axle, for example, can be unenergized and only the electric machine of the rear axle can be energized, and therefore the vehicle is driven only by the rear axle. This increases the overall efficiency and extends the range. However, with a pure rear axle operation of this type, friction losses occur because of the carried-along, deactivated front axle drive.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">DE 20 2015 000 397 U1 discloses an actuating device for a claw clutch. EP 2 409 873 B1 discloses a method for operating a drive train of a motor vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Described below are a drive apparatus for a vehicle axle of an electrically operated vehicle and a method for operating such a drive apparatus, in which drag losses in a deactivated electric machine can be reduced in the driving mode.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As described below, an electric machine outputs drive via an axle differential to output shafts which each lead to a vehicle wheel. One of the output shafts is divided into a wheel-side shaft section and an electric-machine-side shaft section. The two shaft sections can be coupled in terms of drive to each other by a positively locking clutch, in the driving mode, to bring the electric machine into driving connection with the vehicle wheels. Alternatively thereto, the two shaft sections can be decoupled from each other in the driving mode, when the electric machine is deactivated, to avoid drag losses. The positively locking clutch may be realized as a sliding sleeve which is arranged on spline teeth of a first of the two shaft sections non-rotatably, but so as to be displaceable axially. The sliding sleeve can be displaceable by an actuating force, which is generated by an actuator, between an open clutch state and a closed clutch state. In the open clutch state, the sliding sleeve is not in positively locking connection with the second shaft section. By contrast, in the closed clutch state, the sliding sleeve is in positively locking connection with the second shaft section. The actuator is in electric signal connection with an actuator control device. When there is a clutch engagement requirement, the coordinator activates the actuator with a closing signal to close the positively locking clutch. By contrast, when there is not a clutch engagement requirement, the coordinator activates the actuator with an opening signal to open the positively locking clutch.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The presence/absence of a clutch engagement requirement is determined in a main control device that is superior to the coordinator, in particular a driving dynamics controller, depending on current driving mode parameters. According to an embodiment, the main control device is not in direct signal connection with the actuator, but rather is in signal connection with the actuator with the interposition of the coordinator.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The coordinator can be realized as a microcontroller and/or has a local, decentral decision-making capability in the event of a malfunction in the coupling or decoupling operation, and therefore more rapid elimination of faults is possible than in the related art.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment, the coordinator is in signal connection with the electric machine. Before a coupling operation or a decoupling operation is carried out, the coordinator activates the electric machine in such a manner that, during the coupling or decoupling operation, a substantially load-free clutch actuation of the positively locking clutch is ensured.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a specific embodiment variant, before the coupling operation, a synchronization can be carried out with the aid of the actuator control device. In the synchronization, the coordinator can activate the electric machine in such a manner that synchronism substantially prevails between the wheel-side shaft section and the electric-machine-side shaft section. As soon as there is synchronism, the coordinator generates the closing signal to start the coupling operation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, before the start of the decoupling operation, the coordinator can carry out a zero-torque regulation. In the zero-torque regulation, the coordinator activates the electric machine in such a manner that a substantial torque relief, in particular torque freedom prevails in the still closed positively locking clutch. Without such a zero-torque regulation, when the electric machine is deactivated, the positively locking clutch which is still closed would be loaded with the drag torque. If a drag torque is excessively large, there would be the problem (without zero-torque regulation) that the actuating force exerted by the actuator may not be sufficient to release the positively locking clutch.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">To provide a reliable coupling operation and decoupling operation, during the synchronization or during the zero-torque regulation, the coordinator permanently monitors the wheel rotational speed (that is to say the output rotational speed) and the electric machine rotational speed.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">To further increase the reliability during the actuation of the clutch, a position sensor may be assigned to the coordinator. An actual position of the sliding sleeve can be detected by the position sensor. After a coupling operation or decoupling operation has taken place, a plausibility check can be carried out in the actuator control device, in which the sliding sleeve actual position detected by the position sensor is checked for plausibility. The plausibility check checks whether the sliding sleeve actual position coincides with a sliding sleeve decoupling position or sliding sleeve coupling position, the positions being stored in the coordinator. If they coincide, a satisfactory decoupling operation or coupling operation can be assumed.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In respect of the high packing density in the region of the vehicle axle, it is of great importance for the positively locking clutch together with the actuator to be realized compactly so as to reduce construction space. Against this background, the actuator can be assigned an actuator sleeve which is arranged on a cylindrical sliding sleeve outer circumference. For the rotational uncoupling from the sliding sleeve, which rotates during operation, the actuator sleeve can be mounted on the sliding sleeve outer circumference via at least one rolling bearing, specifically in such a manner that the axial actuating force generated by the actuator is introduced into the sliding sleeve via the rotationally uncoupled actuator sleeve and the rolling bearing.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment variant, for a transmission of actuating force, both the bearing outer ring of the rolling bearing can be connected to the actuator sleeve in a manner transmitting actuating force and the bearing inner ring of the rolling bearing can be connected to the sliding sleeve in a manner transmitting actuating force.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The above actuator sleeve can be displaced by the actuator between an open position, in which the positively locking clutch is open, and a closed position. For this purpose, the actuator can interact with the actuator sleeve via a transmission stage. In a realization which is advantageous in terms of construction space, the transmission stage can have an external teeth on the cylindrical sliding sleeve outer circumference. The external teeth are spaced apart from one another in the axial direction and are in toothed engagement with a gear wheel of an actuator shaft of an electric motor which forms the actuator.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A positively locking clutch may be designed as a claw clutch in which the sliding sleeve and the second shaft section have mutually axially facing wheel- and axle-side shift claws. The cylindrical sliding sleeve outer circumference can merge into the larger-diameter shift claws, with an inner corner region being formed. The actuator sleeve can be arranged in the resulting inner corner region in a manner advantageous in terms of construction space.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">During the coupling operation (that is to say closing operation) of the above claw clutch, the wheel- and axle-side shift claws can be opposite one another in the axial direction tooth on space such that a smooth positively locking clutch can run. By contrast, in the more probable situation, during the closing operation, the shift claws initially come into contact tooth on tooth. After reaching the tooth on tooth contact, according to an embodiment the actuator sleeve is displaced further until it reaches its closed position, specifically by building up a spring force of an overload spring that acts axially on the shift claws and by which the wheel- and axle-side shift claws are braced in relation to one another. As soon as the shift claws are brought into a tooth on space relative position by a small relative angular rotation of the two clutch halves, the wheel- and axle-side shift claws can enter into positively locking connection with the spring force being dissipated.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a technical realization, the wheel-side shift claws can be formed on a carrier ring which is arranged spline teeth on the wheel-side shaft section so as to be nonrotatable and axially displaceable. On its side axially opposite the electric machine-side shaft section, the carrier ring can be supported against an axial stop of the wheel-side shaft section via the abovementioned overload spring. If, therefore, during the closing operation of the claw clutch, the wheel- and axle-side shift claws come into tooth on tooth contact, the actuator sleeve is displaced together with the sliding sleeve into the closed position, and therefore the sliding sleeve, by building up the spring force, displaces the carrier ring on the wheel-side shaft section by a compensating stroke. As soon as there is tooth on space because of a small relative angular rotation of the two clutch halves, the positively locking connection takes place in which the wheel-side carrier ring, by using up the above compensating stroke and by dissipating the spring force, enters into positively locking connection with the axle-side shift claws.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">An exemplary embodiment is described below with reference to the attached figures, in which:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a roughly schematic top view of an electrically operated motor vehicle with vehicle axles emphasized and illustrated in outlined form;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a drive apparatus for the front axle of the vehicle;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of an exemplary embodiment of a claw clutch which is illustrated in the open clutch state, and</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> are graphs of a decoupling operation and a coupling operation, respectively.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an electrically operated motor vehicle which has an electrically driveable front axle VA and an electrically drivable rear axle HA.

As soon as, e.g., after a small relative angular rotation, tooth <b>58</b> is opposite space <b>60</b>, the carrier ring <b>41</b>, by using up the overload stroke Ah and by dissipating the spring force of the overload spring <b>45</b>, is brought abruptly into positively locking connection with the axle-side shift claws <b>33</b> of the sliding sleeve <b>37</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For the coupling (that is to say during closing of the claw clutch <b>21</b>), first of all the electric machine EM is energized and therefore the displaceable part (that is to say the wheel-side shift claws <b>35</b>) of the claw clutch <b>21</b> is synchronized with the current wheel rotational speed n<sub>rad</sub>. If synchronicity is virtually achieved, the actuator <b>49</b> is activated to close the claw clutch <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the following, a decoupling operation is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and a coupling operation with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In respect of easier understanding of the diagrams in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the illustrated progressions of the wheel rotational speed m<sub>ad </sub>and of the electric machine rotational speed n<sub>EM </sub>are depicted with transmission ratios eliminated:</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the starting point is a driving situation in which, up to a time t<b>0</b>, all of the electric machines EM, EM<b>1</b>, EM<b>2</b> are activated and both the front axle VA and the rear axle HA are connected in the drive train. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the front axle VA is driven with a front axle torque M<sub>VA </sub>via the electric machine EM, while the rear axle HA is driven by a rear axle torque M<sub>HA </sub>(via the electric machines EM<b>1</b>, EM<b>2</b>). The sum of the front axle and rear axle torque M<sub>VA </sub>and M<sub>HA </sub>corresponds to an overall torque M<sub>ges </sub>requested by the driver via the gas pedal. The M<sub>ges </sub>is divided by a main control device <b>70</b> into the front axle torque M<sub>VA </sub>and into the rear axle torque M<sub>HA </sub>depending on current driving mode parameters.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a decoupling signal S<sub>ab </sub>(time t<sub>0</sub>) is generated in a main control device <b>70</b>, for example a driving dynamics controller, depending on current driving mode parameters. When the decoupling signal S<sub>ab </sub>is generated, a torque displacement starts, in which the front axle torque M<sub>VA </sub>is reduced and at the same time the rear axle torque M<sub>HA </sub>is increased by the same amount, specifically with the overall torque M<sub>ges </sub>being unchanged as a whole, to avoid comfort losses for the driver. In addition, the coordinator <b>71</b> starts a zero-torque regulation. During the zero-torque regulation, the front axle electric machine EM is brought slightly into a propulsion mode. As a result, the drag torque acting in the claw clutch <b>21</b>, which is still closed, is compensated for or eliminated. In this way, the claw clutch <b>21</b> which is still closed is free from torque or free from load. As soon as torque freedom is achieved, the coordinator <b>71</b> produces a clutch opening signal S<sub>auf </sub>(at the time t<sub>2 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) such that the claw clutch <b>21</b> can be opened free from load. At the time t<sub>3</sub>, the rotational speed n<sub>EM </sub>of the deactivated electric machine EM is reduced to zero while the wheel rotational speed n<sub>rad </sub>remains constant beyond the decoupling operation.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A coupling operation will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>: the diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> starts from a driving situation in which, up to the time t<sub>0</sub>, only the rear axle HA with activated rear axle electric machines EM<b>1</b>, EM<b>2</b> is connected into the drive train, while the front axle VA with deactivated electric machine EM (that is to say n<sub>EM</sub>=0) is decoupled from the drive train. The wheel-side shaft section <b>17</b> therefore rotates at a wheel rotational speed n<sub>rad</sub>, while the electric machine rotational speed n<sub>EM </sub>is 0 up to the time t<sub>0</sub>. At the time t<sub>0</sub>, the main control device <b>70</b> generates a coupling signal S<sub>an </sub>on the basis of current driving mode parameters to connect the front axle VA into the drive train. A synchronization &#x394;t<sub>s </sub>subsequently takes place, in which the still decoupled electric machine EM is regulated to a synchronization rotational speed to approximately produce synchronism between the two shaft sections <b>17</b>, <b>19</b>. As soon as there is synchronism, the coordinator <b>71</b> produces a closing signal S<sub>zu </sub>(time t<sub>1</sub>) such that the claw clutch <b>21</b> is closed in a load-free manner and the electric machine EM can pass a driving torque to the drive train. At the time t<sub>2</sub>, the actuator sleeve <b>53</b> reaches its closed position corresponding thereto.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As is furthermore revealed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a position sensor <b>77</b> is assigned to the actuator control device <b>71</b>.
