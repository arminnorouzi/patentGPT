The entirety of the above-mentioned patent application is hereby incorporated by reference herein and made a part of this specification.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a transport apparatus and a substrate processing apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, a substrate processing apparatus has been used to perform various processes on a substrate such as a semiconductor wafer. An example of the substrate processing apparatus is a CMP (chemical mechanical polishing) apparatus for performing a polishing process and the like on a substrate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The CMP apparatus includes a polishing apparatus for polishing a substrate, a cleaning apparatus for cleaning and drying a substrate, a load/unload apparatus which transfers a substrate to the polishing apparatus and receives the substrate that has been cleaned and dried by the cleaning apparatus, etc. Further, the CMP apparatus includes a transport apparatus for transporting a substrate in the polishing apparatus, the cleaning apparatus, and the load/unload apparatus. The CMP apparatus sequentially performs various processes of polishing, cleaning, and drying while transporting the substrate by the transport apparatus.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the CMP apparatus, the substrate is exposed to air, and moisture and oxygen adhere to the surface of the substrate, which causes oxidation and corrosion. In this regard, as disclosed in Patent Document 1 (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2015-95526), the substrate held by the hand is covered with a cover, and by supplying nitrogen gas from the cover, the air on the surface of the substrate is replaced with nitrogen gas.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the conventional art does not consider suppressing the supply amount of inert gas to efficiently suppress oxidation and corrosion of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">That is, in the technique disclosed in Patent Document 1, the inert gas is supplied from the cover to the entire surface of the substrate. In this case, if the substrate held by the hand is stationary, the air on the surface of the substrate can be replaced with the inert gas by supplying a small amount of the inert gas. In contrast, when the substrate is moved in a direction along the surface of the substrate, e.g., when the transport apparatus turns while the hand holds the substrate, the inert gas supplied from the cover is replaced by the air in the moving direction, and the oxygen concentration on the surface of the substrate tends to increase. In this regard, it is conceivable to supply a large amount of inert gas so that the inert gas on the surface of the substrate is not replaced by air; however, when a large amount of inert gas is supplied to the entire surface of the substrate, it is not preferable because the liquid film formed on the substrate surface may be blown off, which may instead lead to oxidation and corrosion of the substrate surface.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an embodiment, a transport apparatus includes a hand, a drive mechanism, a cover member, and a gas supply member. The hand is configured to hold a substrate. The drive mechanism is configured to transport the substrate by moving the hand. The cover member has an opposing surface opposed to a surface of the substrate held by the hand and is formed with a plurality of holes opened in the opposing surface. The gas supply member is configured to supply an inert gas to the surface of the substrate via the plurality of holes of the cover member. The plurality of holes are formed in the opposing surface so that an opening ratio of an outer peripheral portion of the opposing surface is higher than an opening ratio of a central portion of the opposing surface.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a plan view showing an overall configuration of a CMP apparatus serving as an example of a substrate processing apparatus according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view schematically showing a polishing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> are a plan view and a side view schematically showing the configuration of a cleaning apparatus.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a side view schematically showing the configuration of the cleaning apparatus.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a side view schematically showing the configuration of a first transport apparatus.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a view schematically showing protection of the surface of a wafer by supply of an inert gas.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a view showing a plurality of holes formed in a cover member.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a view showing a modification example of a plurality of holes formed in the cover member.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the disclosure suppress the supply amount of inert gas to efficiently suppress oxidation and corrosion of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Hereinafter, a transport apparatus and a substrate processing apparatus according to an embodiment of the disclosure will be described with reference to the drawings.

In particular, according to this embodiment, it is possible to suppress the supply amount of inert gas to efficiently suppress oxidation and corrosion of the surface of the wafer W. That is, as in the conventional art, in the case of supplying the inert gas to the entire surface of the wafer, when the wafer is transported in a direction along the surface of the wafer, e.g., when the transport apparatus turns while the hand holds the wafer, the inert gas supplied to the surface of the wafer is replaced by air in the moving direction, and the oxygen concentration tends to increase. In this regard, it is conceivable to supply a large amount of inert gas so that the inert gas on the wafer surface is not replaced by air, but it is economically unfavorable to use a large amount of inert gas. In addition, when a large amount of inert gas is supplied to the wafer surface, it is not preferable because the liquid film formed on the wafer surface may be blown off, which may instead lead to oxidation and corrosion of the wafer surface.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In contrast, in this embodiment, the plurality of holes <b>226</b> for supplying the inert gas are formed only in the outer peripheral portion of the opposing surface <b>228</b>. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the inert gas may be intensively supplied only to the outer peripheral portion of the wafer W. As a result, even though the amount of the inert gas supplied from the gas supply member <b>222</b> is small, a strong curtain of inert gas can be formed on the outer peripheral portion of the wafer W. Therefore, in the case where the cover member <b>220</b> is fixed to the hand <b>230</b>, even if the horizontal drive mechanism <b>240</b> moves the hand <b>230</b> or the rotational drive mechanism <b>250</b> changes the orientation of the hand <b>230</b> in the horizontal plane to move the wafer W in the horizontal direction, since the inert gas on the surface of the wafer W is less likely to be replaced by the air in the moving direction, the oxygen concentration on the surface of the wafer W can be kept low. Further, in the case where the cover member <b>220</b> is fixed to the base <b>270</b>, even if the rotational drive mechanism <b>250</b> changes the orientation of the hand <b>230</b> in the horizontal plane to move the wafer W in the horizontal direction, since the inert gas on the surface of the wafer W is less likely to be replaced by the air in the moving direction, the oxygen concentration on the surface of the wafer W can be kept low. Further, since the inert gas is sprayed only on the outer peripheral portion of the wafer W, it is less likely that the liquid film would be removed, at least on the central portion of the wafer W. As a result, oxidation and corrosion of the wafer W can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, in this embodiment, in the outer peripheral portion <b>228</b><i>b </i>of the opposing surface <b>228</b>, since the three hole groups (the first hole group <b>226</b><i>a</i>, the second hole group <b>226</b><i>b</i>, and the third hole group <b>226</b><i>c</i>) are formed along the circumferential direction, a stronger curtain of inert gas can be formed on the outer peripheral portion of the wafer W. Further, since the second hole group <b>226</b><i>b </i>has a larger number of holes than the first hole group <b>226</b><i>a</i>, the holes of the second hole group <b>226</b><i>b </i>can be arranged at positions corresponding to spaces between the holes of the first hole group <b>226</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, since the third hole group <b>226</b><i>c </i>has a larger number of holes than the second hole group <b>226</b><i>b</i>, the holes of the third hole group <b>226</b><i>c </i>can be arranged at positions corresponding to spaces between the holes of the second hole group <b>226</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, even if the wafer W is moved in the horizontal direction, it is less likely that the air in the moving direction would enter the region on the surface of the wafer W, the oxygen concentration on the surface of the wafer W can be kept low, and as a result, oxidation and corrosion of the wafer W can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The gas supply member <b>222</b> may start supplying the inert gas with the cover member <b>220</b> and the wafer W being opposed to each other. In this case, the air on the outer peripheral portion of the surface of the wafer W is first replaced with the inert gas, and then the air on the central portion of the wafer W is gradually replaced with the inert gas. Further, the gas supply member <b>222</b> may also start supplying the inert gas before the cover member <b>220</b> and the wafer W are opposed to each other. For example, in the case where the cover member <b>220</b> is fixed to the hand <b>230</b>, the gas supply member <b>222</b> may start supplying the inert gas when the hand <b>230</b> extends the arm member <b>234</b> and moves horizontally toward the wafer W to hold the wafer W. In this case, since the air on the surface of the wafer W can be swept out by the inert gas supplied from the plurality of holes <b>226</b> when the cover member <b>220</b> is moving along the surface of the wafer W, the air on the surface of the wafer W can be quickly replaced with the inert gas. Further, in the case where the cover member <b>220</b> is fixed to the base <b>270</b>, the gas supply member <b>222</b> can start supplying the inert gas when the hand <b>230</b>, which has extended the arm member <b>234</b> to hold the wafer W, contracts the arm member <b>234</b> and moves horizontally toward the lower region of the cover member <b>220</b>. In this case, since the air on the surface of the wafer W can be swept out by the inert gas supplied from the plurality of holes <b>226</b> when the wafer W is moving along the opposing surface <b>228</b> of the cover member <b>220</b>, the air on the surface of the wafer W can be quickly replaced with the inert gas.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the above description, the first transport apparatus <b>209</b> has been described as the transport apparatus for the wafer W in the cleaning apparatus <b>4</b>. However, the disclosure is not limited thereto, and the configurations of the cover member <b>220</b>, the gas supply member <b>222</b>, and the like may be applied to the transport apparatus (e.g., the first linear transporter <b>6</b> and the second linear transporter <b>7</b>) configured to transport the wafer W processed by the polishing apparatus <b>3</b> or the cleaning apparatus <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, in the above embodiment, as an example, a plurality of holes <b>226</b> are formed only in the outer peripheral portion <b>228</b><i>b </i>of the opposing surface <b>228</b>, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a view showing a modification example of a plurality of holes formed in the cover member. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, in addition to the first hole group <b>226</b><i>a</i>, the second hole group <b>226</b><i>b</i>, and the third hole group <b>226</b><i>c </i>formed in the outer peripheral portion <b>228</b><i>b </i>of the opposing surface <b>228</b>, the plurality of holes <b>226</b> also include a fourth hole group (four holes) <b>226</b><i>d </i>formed in the central portion <b>228</b><i>a </i>of the opposing surface <b>228</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Even if the holes of the fourth hole group <b>226</b><i>d </i>are formed in the central portion <b>228</b><i>a </i>of the opposing surface <b>228</b> as in the modification example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the opening ratio of the outer peripheral portion <b>228</b><i>b </i>of the opposing surface <b>228</b> is higher than the opening ratio of the central portion <b>228</b><i>a </i>of the opposing surface <b>228</b>. Therefore, as in the above embodiment, since the inert gas can be intensively supplied to the outer peripheral portion of the wafer W, even though the amount of inert gas supplied from the gas supply member <b>222</b> is small, a strong curtain of inert gas can be formed on the outer peripheral portion of the wafer W. Therefore, even if the hand <b>230</b> is moved in the horizontal direction, it is less likely that the inert gas on the surface of the wafer W would be replaced by the air in the moving direction. Further, since the inert gas is mainly sprayed on the outer peripheral portion of the wafer W, it is less likely that the liquid film would be removed from the central portion of the wafer W, and oxidation and corrosion of the wafer W can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Although some embodiments of the disclosure have been described above, the above-described embodiments of the disclosure are intended to facilitate understanding of the disclosure and do not limit the disclosure.
