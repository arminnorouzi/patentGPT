More particularly, the present invention relates to apparatus and methods for effectively separating and removing specific components from blood.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Blood may be fractionated and the different fractions of the blood used for different medical needs. For instance, anemia (low erythrocyte levels) may be treated with infusions of erythrocytes. Thrombocytopenia (low thrombocyte (platelet) levels) may be treated with infusions of platelet concentrate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The sedimentation of the various blood cells and plasma is based on the different specific gravity of the cells and the viscosity of the medium. When sedimented to equilibrium, the component with the highest specific gravity (density) eventually sediments to the bottom, and the lightest rises to the top. Under the influence of gravity or centrifugal force, blood spontaneously sediments into three layers. At equilibrium the top, low-density layer is a straw-colored clear fluid called plasma. Plasma is a water solution of salts, metabolites, peptides, and many proteins ranging from small (insulin) to very large (complement components). Plasma per se has limited use in medicine but may be further fractionated to yield proteins used, for instance, to treat hemophilia (factor VIII) or as a hemostatic agent (fibrinogen). The term platelet rich plasma (PRP) is used for this component because most of the plasma proteins and platelets in the whole blood are in the plasma following slow centrifugation so the concentration of platelets in the plasma has increased while suspended in supernatant plasma. The uppermost layer after centrifugation typically contains plasma proteins only and is typically called platelet-poor plasma (PPP) due to the absence or low number of platelets as a result of a &#x201c;hard spin&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The bottom, high-density layer is a deep red viscous fluid comprising nuclear red blood cells (RBC) specialized for oxygen transport. The red color is imparted by a high concentration of chelated iron or heme that is responsible for the erythrocytes high specific gravity. Packed erythrocytes, matched for blood type, are useful for treatment of anemia caused by, e.g., bleeding. The relative volume of whole blood that consists of erythrocytes is called the hematocrit, and in normal human beings can range from about 38% to about 54%.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The intermediate layer is the smallest layer, appearing as a thin white band on top the erythrocyte layer and below the plasma, and is called the buffy coat. The buffy coat itself has two major components, nucleated leukocytes (white blood cells) and a nuclear smaller bodies called platelets (or thrombocytes). Leukocytes confer immunity and contribute to debris scavenging. Platelets seal ruptures in the blood vessels to stop bleeding and deliver growth and wound healing factors to the wound site. The buffy coat may be separated from whole blood when the blood is subjected to a &#x201c;hard spin&#x201d; in which the whole blood is spun hard enough and long enough so that platelets sediment from plasma onto packed red cells and white cells percolate up through red cell pack to the interface between red cells and plasma.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">When whole blood is centrifuged at a low speed (e.g., up to 1,000 g) for a short time (e.g., two to four minutes) white cells sediment faster than red cells and both sediment much faster than platelets. At higher speeds the same distribution is obtained in a shorter time. The method of harvesting PRP from whole blood is based on this principle. Centrifugal sedimentation that takes the fractionation only as far as separation into packed erythrocytes and PRP is called a &#x201c;soft spin&#x201d; which is typically used to describe centrifugation conditions under which erythrocytes are sedimented but platelets remain in suspension. &#x201c;Hard spin&#x201d; is typically used to describe centrifugation conditions under which erythrocytes sediment and platelets sediment in a layer immediately above the layer of erythrocytes.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The auto-transfusion equipment used to make autologous platelet concentrates requires a skilled operator and considerable time and expense and these devices require a large prime volume of blood. While many of these devices have somewhat reduced the cost and the time required, skilled operators and time are still required. Accordingly, there remains a need for simple and effective methods and devices for separating and removing components from whole blood. Embodiments of the present invention are designed to meet these and other needs.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some embodiments of the present invention relate to apparatus and methods for rapid fractionation of blood into its different components, e.g., erythrocyte, plasma, and platelet fractions. The devices and methods described have particular value for rapid preparation of autologous concentrated platelet fractions, e.g., to help or speed healing.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Whole blood may be spun in a vented tube with a density-adjusted float mechanism which can float freely and unanchored within the tube along with the whole blood. The density of the float mechanism may be adjusted so that when the whole blood has been separated, the float at equilibrium may rest above the sedimented red blood cell (RBC) pack, isolating the PRP supernatant. The float may serve as a barrier to prevent contamination with RBC when the PRP is withdrawn from the tube.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One variation may generally comprise a separator assembly which may include a syringe or centrifuge container tube which defines a channel for collecting, e.g., a whole blood sample. The separator float may have an atraumatic and arcuate shape, e.g., spherical, ellipsoidal, cylindrical, etc. and having a diameter which corresponds to the inner diameter of the channel so that the float may move freely within the length of the channel uninhibited and which allows for blood components to pass through the annular space defined between the outer diameter of the float and the inner surface of the channel. However, this annular space may also be small enough so as to discourage the free and uninhibited passage of blood components through.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A float having a spherical shape not only can be used to isolate the upper and lower fluid fractions, but may also decrease the likelihood of the float cocking or jamming during centrifugation. Additionally and/or optionally, select surfaces or all of the surfaces of the float may also be optionally treated as well. For instance, overmold skins, silicone coatings, wetting agents such as latherin, surfactant proteins, etc., may be applied to the select surfaces of the float or over the entirety of the float. In one variation, the upper surface of the float may be treated to trap or retain a thin layer of red blood cells upon which platelets in the PRP layer may sediment upon. The presence of the red blood cells may cushion and minimize any platelets from directly contacting the surface of the float which may potential evert and damage the contacting platelets.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one variation, the density of the float can be set so that the RBC layer is entirely below the upper surface of the float, e.g., after a &#x201c;soft spin&#x201d;. Alternatively, the density of the float may be set to capture a small amount of the RBC layer above the float. If the buffy coat is desired, the density of the float can be set so that after a &#x201c;hard spin&#x201d; the buffy coat and a small amount of the RBC layers are above the float. The same float may have its density set so that the float resides between the RBC layer and the PRP layer, e.g., at its midline or anywhere along the float, after a soft spin and then resides with, e.g., its midline or anywhere along the float, below the buffy coat after a &#x201c;hard spin&#x201d;. Some plasma can be withdrawn separately before the buffy coat is harvested to produce a more concentrated final product.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As previously mentioned, the float at equilibrium may rest above the sedimented red blood cell (RBC) pack, isolating the PRP supernatant such as after a &#x201c;soft spin&#x201d;. The float at equilibrium may accordingly separate the channel between an upper channel in which the PRP layer and/or buffy coat resides above the float (e.g., above the outer diameter of the float) towards a proximal or proximal or upper end of the tube, and a lower channel in which the RBC layer resides below the float (e.g., below the outer diameter of the float) towards a distal or lower end of the tube. In other variations, the density of the float may be tuned so that the buffy coat forms around the periphery of the float, e.g., above the midline of the float or anywhere along the float after a &#x201c;hard spin&#x201d;. Separating the PRP layer from the RBC layer helps to ensure that the any red blood cells from the RBC layer are entirely isolated from the supernatant PRP layer contained above the float.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another variation the tube may optionally include a seal to maintain sterility. The seal may also incorporate a withdrawal tube connected to a withdrawal tube channel defined through the seal. The position of the seal relative to the tube may be optionally adjusted so that once processing has been completed and the float is positioned at equilibrium relative to the upper and lower fluid fractions, the seal may be pushed, screwed, or otherwise urged down upon the tube so as to position the opening of the withdrawal tube into contact against or in proximity to the float so that the PRP layer can be withdrawn through the tube.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another alternative, the float may optionally incorporate a tether attached to the float to facilitate its removal, if needed, while in other variations the tether may be configured from a length of tubing, e.g., silicone tubing, connected or connectable to an opening for removal of the PRP layer. In yet another variation, the relatively high viscosity of the RBC layer may be utilized to maintain separation when the tube is inverted so that the supernatant PRP layer can be withdrawn from a cap or septum Luer on the top cap of the inverted tube. The tube could also be configured to expand radially relative to its longitudinal axis during centrifugation to allow the float to migrate freely within the tube to its equilibrium position relative to the centrifuged fractional layers. However, when the centrifugation is stopped, the inner diameter of the tube may contract to trap the float in place at its equilibrium position. The float itself could alternatively be compressible under centrifugally generated pressure but re-expand after centrifugation has stopped so as to lock a position of the float against the inner surface of the tube at its equilibrium position.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As previously discussed, the float itself may also be in an alternative shape. Another particular variation of the float may comprise a tapered interface surface formed in a conical configuration which terminates in an apex that may be atraumatically shaped, e.g., blunted, so as to minimize damage to the blood components. The tapered interface surface may be optionally shaped so as to mirror the tapered shape of the tube interior. The tapered interface surface may also prevent red blood cells from accumulating upon the upper surface of the float during centrifugation. The tapered interface surface may present a slanted or non-orthogonal surface relative to a normal surface of the float which may facilitate the platelets to move or slide down upon the slanted interface surface. The degree of the slant may range anywhere from, e.g., about 2 to about 45 degrees, although the degree of the non-orthogonal surface may vary depending on factors such as the volume of fluid present. Moreover, the surfaces may be smoothed from a relatively rough polymer to a polished surface, e.g., utilizing polymer coatings, nanoparticles, etc. Additionally and/or alternatively, a bottom surface of the float may also be tapered as well so as to prevent platelets from depositing upon the lower surface as the red blood cells pack out, squeezing platelets out of the burgeoning pack.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In yet another variation, a syringe or container tube may be used in a vacuum-drawn system for separating and then collecting the supernatant fraction. A translatable plunger may be slidably positioned within the channel and a pull rod may be coupled to the plunger via a plunger lock attached to the plunger on a side of the plunger opposite to the float. A pull rod lock may be integrated with the tube at a distal surface of the tube around a pull rod opening through which the pull rod may be translated. A Luer assembly may be integrated with at a proximal end of the tube along with a valve and a cap or septum Luer which may be used to seal the Luer.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The proximal end of the tube just below the Luer assembly may also define an interface surface which may be tapered or shaped to receive the float in a corresponding manner to optimize the amount of the PRP layer which may be withdrawn from the tube.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">One variation for utilizing the container tube may utilize the pull rod which may be pushed to move the plunger and float into an initial position where the float is pushed into contact against the interface surface of tube prior to receiving whole blood. The tube may be supplied preloaded with, e.g., anticoagulant or any other agent, contained within the channel. Having the tube preloaded with anticoagulant would enable the blood to be drawn directly into the tube without the need for additional processing. With the valve closed, the pull rod may be pulled or pushed to move the plunger into a distal position within the tube. Because the valve is closed, a vacuum may be formed within the tube. The pull rod may be rotated partially about its longitudinal axis relative to the tube and plunger so as to lock a position of the pull rod to the tube and to prevent the plunger from being moved back proximally in position due to the vacuum.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A syringe or blood line may be attached to the Luer and the valve may then be opened allowing (whole) blood to be drawn through the Luer and into the channel by the vacuum formed within the tube. Once the blood has filled the channel of tube, the valve may then be closed again and the blood line disconnected and removed. The pull rod may be decoupled or detached from the plunger lock as well as from the pull rod lock such that the pull rod is fully removed so that the tube, float, and whole blood may be centrifuged. With the whole blood introduced within the channel or tube, the float may remain settled at its distal position prior to centrifuging the assembly.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Once the tube and its contents have been sufficiently centrifuged, the whole blood may separate into its fractional components and the float may alter its position within the channel accordingly due to the differing densities of the individual fractional layers. To effect removal of the PRP layer, a syringe or line may be coupled to the Luer and the valve may then be opened to allow withdrawal of the PRP layer through line. The RBC layer may remain between the plunger and float and the float may remain at the interface of the PRP layer and RBC layer as the PRP layer is withdrawn through Luer. As the PRP layer is fully withdrawn the upper surface of the float may come into contact against the interface surface of the tube so that the float and interface surface form a float interface which may seal the tube and prevent any further withdrawal through Luer. The RBC layer may accordingly remain trapped between the lower surface of the float and the plunger.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For shipment and storage of the tube, the float may incorporate an attractive element such as a magnet embedded entirely or partially within the float. An externally positioned attractive element may be located externally of the tube, such as near the bottom of the tube, to attract the embedded element within the float to prevent the float from movement during shipment or handling of the tube. Prior to use of the tube, the external attractive element may be removed to release a position of the float within the tube.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In yet another variation, an external clamp on the tube may be used to trap the position of the float at the bottom of the tube to ensure that the float remains secured in its position particularly if any preloaded anticoagulant is present within the tube. The clamp may be removed before or after blood introduction or before centrifugation.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one variation, an apparatus for separating blood may generally comprise a tube defining a channel and configured for receiving a quantity of blood, and a float contained within the tube and having a density which is predefined so that the float is maintained at equilibrium between a first layer formed from a first fractional component of the blood and a second layer formed from a second fractional component of the blood.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another variation, a method for separating blood may generally comprise introducing a volume of blood into a channel of a tube which encloses a float having a density which is predefined, and subjecting the tube to a centrifugation such that the blood separates into at least a first layer formed from a first fractional component of the blood and a second layer formed from a second fractional component of the blood, wherein the float is maintained at equilibrium between the first layer and the second layer.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a perspective of one variation of a float separator assembly.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows a partial cross-sectional side view another variation of a float separator assembly having a withdrawal tube.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D</figref> show perspective views of alternative variations for locking a relative position of the float within the tube after centrifugation is completed.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> show perspective and side views of another variation of the float separator having an upper tapered interface surface and both upper and lower tapered interface surfaces.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a perspective view of another variation of the float separator assembly.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>G</figref> show an example of the float separator assembly used to separate and selectively collect the different blood components.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> show perspective views of the float separator positioned between the separated blood components.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a tube assembly which enables the float to be maintained in a secured configuration.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref> show perspective views of the tube with the float positioned within the bottom of the tube interior and of the float removed from the tube with the attractive element contained entirely within or along the float.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> show side views of different embodiments of the float abutting against the bottom of the tube with the attractive element embedded within the float.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a perspective view of the released float repositioned to separate the layer of PPP from RBC.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a side view of a tube having a removable packaging post positioned to secure a position of the float within the tube.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a float maintained in position within the tube via a clamp or other external compressive mechanism.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Throughout the description, terms such as &#x201c;top&#x201d;, &#x201c;above, &#x201c;bottom&#x201d;, &#x201c;below&#x201d; are used to provide context with respect to the relative positioning of components when, e.g., a container tube with fractional components of blood are positioned when the longitudinal axis of a container tube is positioned upright or non-horizontally. Such description is used for illustrative purposes only.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one variation of a separator assembly, whole blood may be spun in a vented tube with a density-adjusted float mechanism which can float freely and unanchored within the tube along with the whole blood. The density of the float mechanism may be defined or predefined using various methodologies, e.g., combining differing polymers in differing ratios, integrating weights, removing mass, etc., so that when the whole blood has been separated, the float at equilibrium may rest above the sedimented red blood cell (RBC) pack, isolating the PRP supernatant. The float may serve as a barrier to prevent contamination with RBC when the PRP is withdrawn from the tube.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">One variation is shown in the perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> which shows a separator assembly <b>10</b> which may generally comprise a syringe or centrifuge container tube <b>12</b> which defines a channel <b>18</b> for collecting, e.g., a whole blood sample. The container tube <b>12</b> may be made of any variety of biocompatible materials and may also generally range in dimensions but in one example may have an inner diameter of, e.g., 1.5 to 3.5 cm, with a length of, e.g., 6 to 12 cm. The separator float <b>20</b> may have an atraumatic and arcuate shape, e.g., spherical, ellipsoidal, cylindrical, etc. and having a diameter which corresponds to the inner diameter of the channel <b>18</b> so that the float <b>20</b> may move freely within the length of the channel <b>18</b> uninhibited and which allows for blood components to pass through the annular space defined between the outer diameter of the float <b>20</b> and the inner surface of the channel <b>18</b>. However, this annular space may also be small enough so as to discourage the free and uninhibited passage of blood components through. Hence, the outer diameter of the float <b>20</b> may range from, e.g., generalized to have an outer diameter of 98 to 101% of the inner surface of the channel <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For floats <b>20</b> having an outer diameter which equals or exceeds the inner diameter of the channel <b>18</b> in which the float <b>20</b> is contained when at rest, such floats <b>20</b> may be used with container tubes <b>12</b> made from flexible materials such as plastics or polymers rather than glass. The inner diameter of the channel <b>18</b> may reconfigure itself to radially expand to result in a relatively larger inner diameter, for instance, when spun in a separation procedure. During this spinning process, the float <b>20</b> may freely move within the channel <b>18</b> to a position of equilibrium relative to the blood components contained within. When the container tube <b>12</b> has stopped spinning or has slowed down, the inner diameter of the channel <b>18</b> may reconfigure itself to radially retract to a relatively narrower diameter which may then clamp down or compress against the outer diameter of the float <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In other variations, the float <b>20</b> may have an outer diameter relative to the inner surface of the channel <b>18</b> ranging from tens or hundreds of microns of clearance (or interference), depending on the particular application.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The variation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a float <b>20</b> having a spherical shape which not only can be used to isolate the upper and lower fluid fractions, but may also decrease the likelihood of the float <b>20</b> cocking or jamming during centrifugation. The float <b>20</b> may also be fabricated from any variety of biocompatible materials so long as the density of the float <b>20</b> is desirably tuned or tunable for the present application. The float <b>20</b> may thus be fabricated as a solid and uniform object (having a suitable density) or in other variations, the float <b>20</b> may be hollow so as to be injected or filled with a material which allows for the float <b>20</b> density to be changed or desirably adjusted. In this variation, the separator float <b>20</b> may have a density which is tuned specifically for use with whole blood, e.g., specific density of 1.0 to 1.1 gram/ml at 25&#xb0; C.), while in other variations, the float <b>20</b> may be fabricated to have a different density, e.g., 1.03 to 1.07 gram/ml, etc.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Additionally and/or optionally, select surfaces or all of the surfaces of the float <b>20</b> may also be optionally treated as well. For instance, overmold skins, silicone coatings, wetting agents such as latherin, surfactant proteins, etc., may be applied to the select surfaces of the float or over the entirety of the float. In one variation, the upper surface of the float <b>20</b> may be treated to trap or retain a thin layer of red blood cells upon which platelets in the PRP layer may sediment upon. The presence of the red blood cells may cushion and isolate any platelets from directly contacting the surface of the float <b>20</b> which may potentially evert and damage the contacting platelets. In this instance, at least one layer of the red blood cells upon the surface of the float <b>20</b> may be sufficient to provide the cushioning to the platelets.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Although the float <b>20</b> is shown as having a spherical shape, the float may be shaped to have various configurations. For example, in other embodiments, the float may be shaped to have a cylindrical body having a length and a curved, domed, or otherwise convex shape along the bottom or distal portion of the float. The upper or proximal portion of the float may also be curved, domed, convex, concave, or angled relative to a longitudinal axis of the float.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one variation, the density of the float <b>20</b> can be set so that the RBC layer is entirely below the upper surface of the float <b>20</b>, e.g., after a &#x201c;soft spin&#x201d;. Alternatively, the density of the float <b>20</b> may be set to capture a small amount of the RBC layer above the float <b>20</b>. If the buffy coat is desired, the density of the float <b>20</b> can be set so that after a &#x201c;hard spin&#x201d; the buffy coat and a small amount of the RBC layers are above the float <b>20</b>. The same float <b>20</b> may have its density set so that the float <b>20</b> resides between the RBC layer and the PRP layer, e.g., at its midline or anywhere along the float, after a soft spin and then resides with, e.g., its midline or anywhere along the float, below the buffy coat after a &#x201c;hard spin&#x201d;. Some plasma can be withdrawn separately before the buffy coat is harvested to produce a more concentrated final product.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For discussion purposes, a &#x201c;hard spin&#x201d; may range, e.g., between 2000 to 4000&#xd7;g over 2 to 20 minutes, while a &#x201c;soft spin&#x201d; may range, e.g., between 500 to 1000&#xd7;g over 5 to 20 minutes.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As previously mentioned, the float <b>20</b> at equilibrium may rest above the sedimented red blood cell (RBC) pack, isolating the PRP supernatant such as after a &#x201c;soft spin&#x201d;. The float <b>20</b> at equilibrium may accordingly separate the channel <b>18</b> between an upper channel <b>22</b> in which the PRP layer and/or buffy coat resides above the float <b>20</b> (e.g., above the outer diameter of the float <b>20</b>) towards a proximal or proximal or upper end <b>14</b> of the tube <b>12</b>, and a lower channel <b>24</b> in which the RBC layer resides below the float <b>20</b> (e.g., below the outer diameter of the float <b>20</b>) towards a distal or lower end <b>16</b> of the tube <b>12</b>. In other variations, the density of the float <b>20</b> may be tuned so that the buffy coat forms around the periphery of the float <b>20</b>, e.g., above the midline <b>34</b> of the float <b>20</b> after a &#x201c;hard spin&#x201d; or anywhere along the float. Separating the PRP layer from the RBC layer helps to ensure that the any red blood cells from the RBC layer are entirely isolated from the supernatant PRP layer contained above the float <b>20</b>. The tube <b>12</b> may also have a cover or seal and a removable cap or septum Luer <b>26</b> through which the PRP layer and/or buffy coat may be accessed for removal. While a cap may be removable to provide access for withdrawal, the use of a septum Luer <b>26</b> may enable the septum Luer <b>26</b> to remain in place, e.g., for introducing blood into the tube <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Alternatively, the tube <b>12</b> may be sealed with a conventional septum which omits any Luer fittings. By utilizing a septum to seal the tube <b>12</b>, the tube <b>12</b> may be vacuum sealed until used.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">While the density may be tuned to have the float <b>20</b> positioned at equilibrium at specified positions between the fractional layers, there is relatively greater latitude on the tolerance for the density as the float <b>20</b>. For example, if the float <b>20</b> were used to separate the intermediate buffy coat layer after a &#x201c;hard spin&#x201d;, the density tolerance on the float <b>20</b> would be much tighter given the relatively thin layer of the buffy coat compared to the PRP or RBC layers. On the other hand, if the float <b>20</b> were used to separate the PRP layer from the RBC layer after a &#x201c;soft spin&#x201d;, the latitude on the density range for the float <b>20</b> would be relatively greater.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Another variation is shown in the partial cross-sectional side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> which illustrates a tube <b>12</b> having the float <b>20</b> within. An example of the float neutral line <b>34</b> (e.g., outer diameter) is shown for illustrative purposes. The tube <b>12</b> may optionally include a seal <b>28</b> to maintain sterility, as described above. The seal <b>28</b> may also incorporate a withdrawal tube <b>30</b> connected to a withdrawal tube channel <b>32</b> defined through the seal <b>28</b>, as illustrated. The position of the seal <b>28</b> relative to the tube <b>12</b> may be optionally adjusted so that once processing has been completed and the float <b>20</b> is positioned at equilibrium relative to the upper and lower fluid fractions, the seal <b>28</b> may be pushed, screwed, or otherwise urged down upon the tube <b>12</b> so as to position the opening of the withdrawal tube <b>30</b> into contact against or in proximity to the float <b>20</b> so that the PRP layer can be withdrawn through the tube <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In another alternative, the float <b>20</b> may optionally incorporate a tether (not shown) attached to the float <b>20</b> to facilitate its removal, if needed, while in other variations the tether may be configured from a length of tubing, e.g., silicone tubing, connected or connectable to an opening for removal of the PRP layer. In yet another variation, the relatively high viscosity of the RBC layer may be utilized to maintain separation when the tube <b>12</b> is inverted so that the supernatant PRP layer can be withdrawn from a cap or septum Luer <b>26</b> on the top cap of the inverted tube <b>12</b>. If the viscosity of the RBC layer is insufficient to reliably maintain separation when the tube is inverted, the tube <b>12</b> could be configured to expand radially relative to its longitudinal axis during centrifugation to allow the float <b>20</b> to migrate freely within the tube <b>12</b> to its equilibrium position relative to the centrifuged fractional layers, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>. In other words, the tube <b>12</b> may expand from a resting first diameter to an expanded second diameter when undergoing centrifugation. The float <b>20</b> may have a float diameter which is equal to or slightly larger than the first diameter of the tube <b>12</b> but which is less than the expanded second diameter of the tube <b>12</b>. However, when the centrifugation is stopped, the inner diameter of the tube <b>12</b> may contract from its expanded second diameter back down to its first diameter to trap the float <b>20</b> in place at its equilibrium position. The float <b>20</b> itself could alternatively be compressible under centrifugally generated pressure but re-expand after centrifugation has stopped so as to lock a position of the float <b>20</b> against the inner surface of the tube <b>12</b> at its equilibrium position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As previously discussed, the float itself may also be in an alternative shape.

The tapered interface surface <b>42</b> may be optionally shaped so as to mirror the tapered shape of the tube interior. The tapered interface surface <b>42</b> may also prevent red blood cells from accumulating upon the upper surface of the float <b>40</b> during centrifugation.

In some embodiments, the degree of slant may range anywhere from, e.g., from about 2 to about 45 degrees, optionally from about 5 to about 40 degrees, from about 7.5 to about 35 degrees, from about 10 to about 30 degrees, from about 12.5 to about 25 degrees, or from about 15 to about 20 degrees, relative to a normal surface of the float. In other embodiments, the degree of the slant may be about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 or 45 degrees, relative to a normal surface of the float.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, the float has a surface topography configured to substantially prevent platelet adhesion. In other embodiments, the float is configured to have a surface topography and surface tapered at an angle to substantially prevent platelet adhesion.

The tube <b>50</b> may be supplied preloaded with, e.g., anticoagulant or any other agent, contained within the channel. Having the tube <b>50</b> preloaded with anticoagulant would enable the blood to be drawn directly into the tube <b>50</b> without the need for additional processing. With the valve <b>66</b> closed, the pull rod <b>58</b> may be pulled or pushed to move the plunger <b>54</b> into a distal position within the tube <b>50</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. The float <b>72</b> may be seen as dropping through the channel <b>74</b> of the tube <b>50</b> along with the plunger <b>54</b>. Because the valve <b>66</b> is closed, a vacuum may be formed within the tube <b>50</b>. The pull rod <b>58</b> may be rotated partially about its longitudinal axis relative to the tube <b>50</b> and plunger <b>54</b> so as to lock a position of the pull rod <b>58</b> to the tube <b>50</b> and to prevent the plunger <b>54</b> from being moved back proximally in position due to the vacuum.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">A syringe or blood line may be attached to the Luer <b>64</b> and the valve <b>66</b> may then be opened, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, allowing (whole) blood <b>76</b> to be drawn through the Luer <b>64</b> and into the channel <b>74</b> by the vacuum formed within the tube <b>50</b>. Once the blood <b>76</b> has filled the channel <b>74</b> of tube <b>50</b>, the valve <b>66</b> may then be closed again and the blood line disconnected and removed.

With the whole blood <b>76</b> introduced within the channel <b>74</b> or tube <b>50</b>, the float <b>72</b> may remain settled at its distal position prior to centrifuging the assembly.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Once the tube <b>50</b> and its contents have been sufficiently centrifuged, the whole blood <b>76</b> may separate into its fractional components and the float <b>72</b> may alter its position within the channel <b>74</b> accordingly due to the differing densities of the individual fractional layers. The variation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref> illustrates the float <b>72</b> at equilibrium positioned at the interface between a first layer, e.g., PRP layer <b>76</b>&#x2032;, and a second layer, e.g., RBC layer <b>76</b>&#x2033;. To effect removal of the PRP layer <b>76</b>&#x2032;, a syringe or line <b>78</b> may be coupled to the Luer <b>64</b> and the valve <b>66</b> may then be opened to allow withdrawal of the PRP layer <b>76</b>&#x2032; through line <b>78</b> and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref>. The RBC layer <b>76</b>&#x2033; may remain between the plunger <b>54</b> and float <b>72</b> and the float <b>72</b> may remain at the interface of the PRP layer <b>76</b>&#x2032; and RBC layer <b>76</b>&#x2033; as the PRP layer <b>76</b>&#x2032; is withdrawn through Luer <b>64</b>.

A volume of the resulting platelet-poor plasma (PPP) which may form above the PRP layer <b>76</b>&#x2032; may be withdrawn from the tube <b>50</b>. The buffy coat contained within the tube <b>50</b> may be resuspended in the smaller remaining volume by pulling the remaining supernatant fluid back-and-forth within the syringe <b>78</b> several times with minimal shearing or frothing. A stop may be removably affixed to the tube <b>50</b> so that a distance between the float and the interface surface <b>70</b> of the tube <b>50</b> is fixed in order to define the volume of the supernatant fluid in which the buffy coat is resuspended to a preset amount.

The tube <b>92</b> may be sealed under vacuum with a septum <b>94</b> and may allow for blood to be drawn directly from the patient and into a tube <b>92</b> which may be preloaded with anticoagulant. The tube <b>92</b> may be fabricated from glass to prevent any potential issues with foreign agents leaching from the tube and into the enclosed volume of anticoagulant, e.g., during storage.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown, the float <b>96</b> may be enclosed within the tube <b>92</b> along with the volume of anticoagulant. However, the float <b>96</b> may potentially rise within the tube <b>92</b> due to density differences with the anticoagulant and the float <b>96</b> is desirably secured into an immobile position for shipping and handling. In this variation, the float <b>96</b> may be fabricated from any number of biocompatible materials, such as HDPE, and may have a density of, e.g., 1.03 to 1.07 or just under 1.04 in this variation. Because of the hardness of a glass tube <b>92</b>, an external clamp may be inappropriate for securing a position of the float <b>96</b> within the tube <b>92</b>. If the tube <b>92</b> were made from a plastic material, a clamp may be simply positioned over the external surface of the tube <b>92</b> in proximity to the float <b>96</b> such that the walls of the tube <b>92</b> deform slightly and compress upon the float <b>96</b> to maintain it in position and prevent its movement (as described in further detail below); however, applying a compressive force may not be feasible with a tube <b>92</b> made from a relatively harder material such as glass. The float <b>96</b> may accordingly have an attractive element <b>98</b>, such as a magnet, integrated within the float <b>96</b> such as a distal end or portion of the float <b>96</b> in proximity to the distal end or bottom of the tube <b>92</b> interior. The attractive element <b>98</b> may be varied in dimension (e.g., 3.175 mm length and 3.175 mm diameter) and magnetic strength depending on the desired attractive force to retain the float <b>96</b> position.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The attractive element <b>98</b> may be embedded entirely within the float <b>96</b> to prevent direct contact with any fluids within the tube <b>92</b> or it may be configured to project beyond the surface of the float <b>96</b>. A corresponding external attractive element <b>102</b> (described below) may be positioned along or against the exterior of the tube <b>92</b> in apposition to the attractive element <b>98</b> contained within or along the float <b>96</b>, e.g., a removable external magnet positioned over the tube <b>92</b> or within or along packaging containing the tube <b>92</b>. Because the external attractive element <b>102</b> is positioned externally of the tube <b>92</b>, the external element <b>102</b> may be simply removed a distance from the tube <b>92</b> to sever the magnetic attraction between the elements and thereby release the position of the float <b>96</b> prior to or after receiving blood within the tube <b>92</b> so that the float <b>96</b> may be free to reposition itself accordingly within the tube <b>92</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the tube <b>92</b> with the float <b>96</b> positioned within the bottom of the tube interior with the attractive element <b>98</b> contained entirely within or along the float <b>96</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the float <b>96</b> removed from the tube <b>92</b> to show how the attractive element <b>98</b> may be positioned near a distal end or portion of the float <b>96</b> while remaining entirely embedded within.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> shows a side view of the float <b>96</b> abutting against the bottom of the tube <b>92</b> with the attractive element <b>98</b> embedded within the float <b>96</b> and in proximity to the bottom of the tube <b>92</b>.

The packaging post <b>120</b> may extend from the cap <b>124</b> and into the interior of the tube and into contact against the top surface of the float <b>122</b> to maintain the position of the float <b>122</b> during shipping and handling. When the tube is readied for use, the cap <b>124</b> and its extending packaging post <b>120</b> may be removed from the tube allowing for the float <b>122</b> to move within the tube interior.
