To avoid or reduce the system bit error, forward error correction (FEC) is widely used in the digital communication system. However, due to a reason such as a limitation of a size, power consumption, or costs, when an FEC decoding module and a classification and recognition module are two different components, the receiving device cannot determine error correction information corresponding to service data of each peer device. Consequently, transmission efficiency of the error correction information is affected, and data processing efficiency is low.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An embodiment of this application provides an information processing apparatus, to improve transmission efficiency of error correction information and improve data processing efficiency.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides an information processing apparatus. The apparatus includes a decoding module and a classification and statistics collection module. The decoding module is configured to receive M first codewords from at least one peer device, where each first codeword includes first service data with a K-unit length and an error correction code with an R-unit length, and M, K, and R are all integers greater than or equal to 1. The decoding module is further configured to decode the M first codewords to obtain M second codewords, where a length of each second codeword is a sum of the K-unit length and the R-unit length, each second codeword includes second service data with the K-unit length and error correction information, the second service data is error-corrected first service data, and the error correction information is error statistics information obtained after error correction is performed on the first service data with the K-unit length based on the error correction code with the R-unit length. The classification and statistics collection module is configured to determine a bit error rate of the first service data based on the error correction information.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this embodiment, when the decoding module and the classification and statistics collection module are two independent components, the decoding module combines the decoded service data and the error correction information into a second codeword and transmits the second codeword to the classification and statistics collection module, so that the classification and statistics collection module can perform classification and statistics collection on the error correction information and the service data corresponding to the error correction information. Therefore, in a transmission process, no processing needs to be performed on the error correction information. This not only improves transmission efficiency of the error correction information, but also improves data processing efficiency.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a possible design, a valid length of the error correction information is less than or equal to the R-unit length. Therefore, it is ensured that all the error correction information can be written into the codeword without changing the length of the codeword.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another possible design, when the valid length of the error correction information is less than the R-unit length, a part other than the second service data with the K-unit length and the error correction information in each second codeword is an invalid padding code, so that integrity of the codeword is ensured.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another possible design, the classification and statistics collection module is further configured to collect statistics on second codewords of a same peer device among the M second codewords based on a peer device corresponding to each second codeword. Classification and statistics collection are performed on second codewords of each peer device, so that classification and calculation are performed on the service data of each peer device. Therefore, transmission efficiency of the service data is ensured for each peer device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another possible design, the classification and statistics collection module is further configured to perform classification processing on each second codeword to separately obtain the second service data with the K-unit length and the error correction information. Classification and statistics collection are performed on the second service data and the error correction information, and further, a transmission status of the service data is determined by using the error correction information. Therefore, transmission efficiency of the service data is ensured.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another possible design, the error correction information includes a first quantity of error data in the first service data with the K-unit length in each first codeword; and the classification and statistics collection module is further configured to determine the bit error rate of the first service data with the K-unit length based on the first quantity and the K-unit length. Because a bit error rate of each codeword is calculated, a transmission status of the codeword is determined, and service data transmission efficiency is ensured.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another possible design, the error correction information includes a first quantity of error data in the first service data with the K-unit length in each first codeword; and the classification and statistics collection module is further configured to count a second quantity of error data in the M first codewords based on the first quantity of error data in each first codeword, and determine a bit error rate of all service data in the M first codewords based on the second quantity, the K-unit length, and M. Because the bit error rate of all the codewords is calculated, a transmission status of all the codewords is determined, and service data transmission efficiency is ensured.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a second aspect, an embodiment of this application provides an information processing method.

The communication system model includes the following: First, a peer device performs FEC encoding, scrambling, and the like on a source signal, and then sends encoded data to a receiving device through channel transmission. The receiving device obtains decoded data by performing descrambling and decoding. The decoded data includes error correction information and service data. Error statistics collection and service processing are performed on the error correction information and the service data respectively.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a data stream before and after FEC encoding and decoding according to an embodiment of this application. Before FEC encoding is performed on service data, the service data includes service data <b>1</b>, service data <b>2</b>, service data <b>3</b>, . . . , and service data m, and a length of each piece of service data is k bytes. After FEC encoding is performed on each piece of service data, an error correction code is added after each piece of service data, where the error correction code may also be referred to as a redundancy code or a check code, and a length of each error correction code is r bytes. In this way, data with a length of k+r bytes is formed. The data with the length of k+r bytes may be used as one codeword. Therefore, m codewords are obtained. Lengths of k and r are related to specific FEC encoding. For example, in RS(255, 239), k=239 bytes, and r=16 bytes.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">After the m codewords are transmitted through a channel, a bit error may exist or data content changes. Therefore, when the m codewords pass through an FEC decoder, the error correction code is used to check the service data. If it is determined that an error exists in the service data, error data in the service data is corrected, the error correction code is removed, and the service data with a length of k bytes is restored. In some cases, service data in a last codeword may not have a length of k bytes, and a length of restored service data may be less than k bytes. If the error data in the service data exceeds a preset threshold, an error correction capability is exceeded. In this case, error correction does not need to be performed, and the r-byte error correction code is separated, to keep the k-byte service data unchanged.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the foregoing process, after the receiving device receives the m codewords sent by the peer device, the m codewords need to separately pass through an FEC decoding module and a classification and statistics collection module. The FEC decoding module is configured to decode the m codewords, and after decoding is completed, obtain error correction information of each of the m codewords, where the error correction information may include a quantity of error data in service data in each codeword or a quantity of corrected error data. The classification and statistics collection module may be configured to accumulate the quantity of error data based on the error correction information, for example, error data in a plurality of codewords or a plurality of bit streams, or collect statistics on service data based on different services.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a point-to-point continuous scenario, for example, a continuous bit stream, error correction information statistics are simple and can be continuously accumulated. However, in a time division multiplexing (TDM) passive optical network (PON) system, error correction information statistics are relatively complex. The TDM PON may include a gigabit passive optical network (GPON), an Ethernet passive optical network (EPON), a 10-gigabit passive optical network (XG-PON), a 10-gigabit symmetric passive optical network (XGS-PON), an Ethernet passive optical network (10G EPON), or the like.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a TDM PON transmission system according to an embodiment of this application. The system includes a plurality of optical network terminals (ONT), an optical line terminal (OLT), and an optical splitter. The ONT may also be an optical network unit (ONU). In an uplink direction, the plurality of ONTs (for example, an ONT <b>1</b>, an ONT <b>2</b>, an ONT <b>3</b>, . . . , and an ONT n) send data to the OLT in different timeslots by using the optical splitter. In a downlink direction, the OLT sends data to the plurality of ONTs by using the optical splitter. Each ONT receives data sent by the OLT and extracts data that belongs to the ONT. For a plurality of codewords sent in each timeslot, the OLT needs to collect statistics on error correction information based on different ONTs. For a same ONT, a plurality of codewords may be sent in different timeslots. Therefore, it is necessary to collect cumulative statistics on error correction information in the plurality of codewords in different timeslots.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an OLT hardware system according to an embodiment of this application. An OLT internally includes an FEC decoding module, a classification and statistics collection module, and a service processing module. The FEC decoding module is configured to decode a plurality of received codewords. The classification and statistics collection module is configured to separately collect statistics on error correction information based on different ONTs. The service processing module is configured to process service data in the plurality of received codewords. If the FEC decoding module, the classification and statistics collection module, and the service processing module are all in a same chip, information is transmitted within the chip, there is a correspondence between the error correction information collected by the classification and statistics collection module and the service data processed by the service processing module, and statistics collection performed on error correction information for service data in each codeword may be relatively simple. If the FEC decoding module and the classification and statistics collection module are two different components (which may be understood as different boards or modules in a device, or may be understood as different devices), because the error correction information is based on the codewords, the FEC decoding module cannot determine a specific ONT to which each codeword belongs, and there is no correspondence between the error correction information obtained through decoding by the FEC decoding module and the service data. If error correction information of each ONT needs to be collected, the error correction information needs to be processed. This is relatively complex, affects transmission efficiency of the error correction information, and causes low data processing efficiency. To resolve the foregoing technical problems, embodiments of this application provide the following solutions.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of an information processing method according to an embodiment of this application.

For example, a codeword <b>1</b> includes service data <b>1</b> and an error correction code <b>1</b>, a codeword <b>2</b> includes service data <b>2</b> and an error correction code <b>2</b>, . . . , and a codeword M includes service data M and an error correction code M. Each codeword includes K-byte service data and an R-byte error correction code. The error correction code may also be referred to as a redundancy code or a check code.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Then the peer device sends the encoded M codewords to the receiving device. After the encoded M codewords are transmitted through a channel, a bit error may exist or data content may change. Therefore, M first codewords received by the receiving device are different from the M codewords sent by the peer device. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, on a receiving device side, before decoding, a first codeword <b>1</b> includes service data <b>1</b><i>b </i>and a check code <b>1</b><i>b</i>, a first codeword <b>2</b> includes service data <b>2</b><i>b </i>and a check code <b>2</b><i>b</i>, . . . , and a last first codeword includes service data Mb and a check code Mb. The first codewords are different from the M codewords sent by the peer device.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">S<b>502</b>. The decoding module decodes the M first codewords to obtain M second codewords, where a length of each second codeword is a sum of the K-unit length and the R-unit length, each second codeword includes second service data with the K-unit length and error correction information, the second service data is error-corrected first service data, and the error correction information is error statistics information obtained after error correction is performed on the first service data with the K-unit length based on the error correction code with the R-unit length.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a specific implementation, in a decoding process, by using the error correction code in each first codeword, the decoding module performs error correction on the first service data in the first codeword to obtain second service data, and counts a quantity of error data in the first service data or a quantity of corrected data in the first service data in the first codeword, to generate error correction information, where the error correction information includes at least one of the quantity of error data or the quantity of corrected data. If the quantity of error data in the first service data in the first codeword exceeds a preset threshold, an error correction capability of the decoding module is exceeded. In this case, the first service data in each first codeword is kept unchanged. The error correction information may be identification information, and the identification information is used to indicate that the error correction capability is exceeded.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">After the error correction information and the second service data are obtained by decoding each first codeword, the error correction information and the second service data are not separated, but the error correction information and the second service data are combined to form a second codeword. A length of the second codeword is the same as a length of the first codeword, and both are a (K+R)-unit length. A length of the second service data in the second codeword and a length of the first service data in the first codeword are the same, and both are a K-unit length. A valid length of the error correction information is less than or equal to the R-unit length.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, if the valid length of the error correction information is equal to the R-unit length, the error correction information is written into all spatial locations of remaining R bytes in the second codeword. If the valid length of the error correction information is less than the R-unit length, the error correction information needs to occupy only a part of spatial locations of the remaining R-unit length in the second codeword. Therefore, an invalid padding code may be written into another part of spatial locations of the remaining R-unit length, and a part other than the second service data with the K-unit length and the error correction information in each second codeword is an invalid padding code. The invalid padding code may be 0, 1, 1010, or another agreed invalid bit stream.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Optionally, locations of the second service data, the error correction information, and the invalid padding code in the second codeword are not fixed. For example, the second codeword may sequentially include the second service data, the error correction information, and the invalid padding code, or may sequentially include the second service data, the invalid padding code, and the error correction information. Other cases are similar and are not described herein.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, when a decoding capability of the decoding module is satisfied, the receiving device decodes the M first codewords to obtain the M second codewords, where a second codeword <b>1</b> after decoding includes K-byte service data <b>1</b> and error correction information, a second codeword <b>2</b> after decoding includes K-byte service data <b>2</b> and error correction information, . . . , and a last second codeword after decoding includes K-byte service data M and error correction information. When the decoding capability of the decoding module is exceeded, the service data in each first codeword is kept unchanged, and after decoding, the service data in the second codeword is still the service data <b>1</b><i>b</i>, the service data <b>2</b><i>b</i>, . . . , and the service data Mb. The service data is the same as that in the first codeword. The error correction information may be identification information used to identify excessive errors.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It should be noted that the service data in the last codeword among the M first codewords may not have a K-unit length. Therefore, a length of the service data in the last codeword among the M second codewords obtained through decoding is less than or equal to the K-unit length.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">S<b>503</b>. The decoding module sends the M second codewords to a classification and statistics collection module.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a structure of a receiving device according to an embodiment of this application. The receiving device includes a decoding module and a classification and statistics collection module. The decoding module and the classification and statistics collection module are two independent components. The decoding module decodes the M first codewords to obtain the M second codewords, and then transmits the M second codewords to the classification and statistics collection module that is mutually independent of the decoding module. After receiving the M second codewords, the classification and statistics collection module performs classification processing on each second codeword to separately obtain second service data with the K-unit length and error correction information. If the second codeword includes the second service data with the K-unit length and the error correction information with the R-unit length, the second service data with the K-unit length and the error correction information with the R-unit length may be obtained separately after the classification processing. Because the second service data with the K-unit length and the error correction information with the R-unit length in the second codeword are classified within a same component, after the second service data with the K-unit length and the error correction information with the R-unit length are transmitted by using different channels, a correspondence exists, and cumulative calculation of the error correction information is performed based on the correspondence.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">S<b>504</b>. The classification and statistics collection module determines a bit error rate of the first service data based on the error correction information.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an implementation, a bit error rate of the service data is determined for each first codeword. The error correction information includes a first quantity of error data in the first service data with the K-unit length in each first codeword; and the classification and statistics collection module may determine the bit error rate of the first service data with the K-unit length based on the first quantity and the K-unit length. Further, the first quantity is divided by the K-unit length to obtain the bit error rate.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In another implementation, a bit error rate of the service data is determined for all the M first codewords. The error correction information includes a first quantity of error data in the first service data with the K-unit length in each first codeword; and the classification and statistics collection module counts a second quantity of error data in the M first codewords based on the first quantity of error data in each first codeword, and then determines a bit error rate of all service data in the M first codewords based on the second quantity, the K-unit length, and M. Further, a product of the K-unit length and M may be calculated, and then the second quantity is divided by the product to obtain the bit error rate of all the service data in the M first codewords.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another implementation, a bit error rate of the service data is determined for first codewords sent by a same peer device. The M first codewords include first codewords sent by N target peer devices. The classification and statistics collection module counts a second quantity of error data in the N first codewords based on a first quantity of error data in each of the N first codewords, and then determines a bit error rate of all service data in the N first codewords based on the second quantity, the K-unit length, and N. Further, a product of the K-unit length and N may be calculated, and then the second data is divided by the product to obtain the bit error rate of all the service data in the N first codewords.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">It should be noted that a manner of collecting statistics on the bit error rate includes but is not limited to the foregoing manner. Alternatively, another manner may be used to collect statistics on the bit error rate of the service data.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Optionally, the classification and statistics collection module may collect statistics on second codewords of a same peer device among the M second codewords based on a peer device corresponding to each second codeword. For example, the M second codewords include a codeword <b>1</b>, a codeword <b>2</b>, . . . , and a codeword <b>6</b>, and peer devices include a device <b>1</b> and a device <b>2</b>. The codeword <b>1</b>, the codeword <b>2</b>, and the codeword <b>6</b> belong to the device <b>1</b>. The codeword <b>3</b>, the codeword <b>4</b>, and the codeword <b>5</b> belong to the device <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, for the GPON system, a downlink frame includes a payload part, the payload part includes a plurality of general encapsulation methods (GEM) frames, and each GEM frame includes a GEM header. The GEM header includes a port identifier (port ID), and the port ID corresponds to a service stream of each ONT. An uplink frame includes a physical control frame header (PLOu) field and a payload field. The PLOu field includes an ONU ID, and the ONU ID is used to indicate an ONT to which a first codeword belongs. The payload field also includes a GEM header, the GEM header includes a port identifier (port ID), and the port ID corresponds to a service stream of each ONT. Therefore, the second codewords of the same peer device among the M second codewords may be counted based on the port ID or the ONU ID.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Optionally, other information in a data stream, for example, a media access control (MAC) address, or a serial number (SN), or a virtual local area network (VLAN) identifier (ID), may be used to collect statistics on the second codewords of the same peer device among the M second codewords.

Therefore, in a transmission process, no processing needs to be performed on the error correction information.
