The device can be mechanically or electronically activated for both light and sound. The head of the device can take many different forms but is universally applied to the body.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Celebration of sport and various like activities is ancient. From the Ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans, crowds have gathered to celebrate organized competition and have done so loudly and enthusiastically.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Devices of various types and kinds have existed throughout time to amplify the cheering, positively or negatively, of fans in sporting arenas, political venues and the like. These devices have often been home-made and one-offs not suitable for mass production.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In modern times, sports of all kinds draw many thousands of fans to outdoor, open air and enclosed venues. It is common for sports like American football, basketball, international soccer, cricket and others to draw fans in the dozens of thousands and sometimes in one hundred thousand in one event or more. In such cases, fans' ability to influence the outcome of games can be pronounced and welcomed. Fans themselves make noise naturally but can also enhance their noise-making ability by use of a device of one kind or another, many of which are known.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These devices, however, fail to provide interchangeability, for example, the ability to use one device for a child's team, a college team and a pro team. They also fail to provide a diverse ability by which noise can be made, whether mechanically rendered, electronically rendered or some combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">What is therefore needed and provided herein is a noise-making device that provides both the interchangeability and diversity of use currently lacking in modern, known noise-making devices.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, the invention provides, A noise-making device for use at sporting events, comprises a head or head portion. The head can be in the form of a particular team mascot, player, brand and the like. The noise-making device also contains a body upon which the head sits and from which may be releasable from the head. The body contains a hollow volume that can be filled with a number of items. For example, noise making items are positioned within the volume of the body. In use, the noise making items are activated and produce sound when a user engages the noise-making device. Also, noise making items may be positioned within the volume of the body and/or the head portion.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For instance, the noise-making device sounds when it is activated by a user shaking it. Such shaking can be either vigorous or mild, depending upon how the noise-making device is configured to respond. This embodiment describes a noise-making device using mechanical noise making items specifically configured (or naturally configured) to make noise when shaken within the body of the noise-making device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment herein, the noise-making device comprises electronic noisemaking means. Such electronic noise-making means may be in addition to mechanical noise making items as recounted hereinabove. Or, electronic noise-making means may be the only provided noise maker for the noise-making device. Such design is entirely within the design choice of a manufacturer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In practice, the noise-making device is activated when the electronic noise-making means are engaged, usually by a switch of one sort or another, being well known in the art. Alternatively, sound from the electronic noise-making means of the noise-making device is activated by a user shaking the device vigorously or mildly.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As noted hereinabove, the head of the noise-making device is detachable from the body thereof. Also, the head is interchangeable. There is a connector between the head and the body of the noise-making device that allows universal fit between multiple kinds of heads to the body.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a preferred embodiment herein, light elements are integral to the body of the noise-making device. The light elements may also be resident within the head of the noise-making device. When the head is connected to the body, the lights can be activated. In such instance, the connection of the head to the body completes a circuit.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The completion of the circuit activates one or more sound features of the noise-making device. Also, the completion of the circuit activates one or more light features of the noise-making device. The noise-making device further comprises one or more replaceable batteries for powering the noise-making device. In addition, or alternatively, the noise-making device comprises one or more self-charging means for powering the noise making device.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The various exemplary embodiments of the present invention, which will become more apparent as the description proceeds, are described in the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a planar side view of the noise-making device herein;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a front view of the noise-making device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a front view of one embodiment of a head herein; and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a front view of another embodiment of a head herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">By the term &#x201c;noise-making device&#x201d;, it is meant herein an audible device, a light making device or some combination of the two types of devices into one sound and light making device.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">By the term &#x201c;cheer making device&#x201d;, it is meant herein the noise-making device as described herein.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">By the term &#x201c;sports venues&#x201d;, it is meant herein sports venues, cheering venues, outdoor venues, pep rallies, political rallies, indoor sporting events, basketball games, cricket matches, football games, wrestling matches, mixed-martial art matches, martial art tournaments and the like.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The invention herein provides a noise-making device for use at sporting events, celebrations, cheering events and the like comprises a head or head portion.
