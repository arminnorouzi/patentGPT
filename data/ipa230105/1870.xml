The disclosure also relates to a computer-readable medium for providing accident parameters to a person outside a vehicle following an accident involving the vehicle, a system for providing accident parameters to a person outside a vehicle following an accident involving the vehicle, and a vehicle comprising the system for providing accident parameters to a person outside a vehicle after an accident involving the vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known from the prior art to transmit data on the severity of an accident from the vehicle to a call center server by means of an emergency call in the event of an accident. However, the call center server does not, or not completely, forward the accident severity data to emergency services. The statutory emergency call comprises a defined, minimum data packet which does not have any free parameters that would enable data on the severity of an accident to be transmitted to the emergency services via the statutory emergency call in the event of an accident.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is therefore an object to efficiently provide accident parameters to one or more persons outside the vehicle at an accident site. In particular, one object of the disclosure is to efficiently provide accident parameters at an accident site to one or more persons outside the vehicle, such as emergency service personnel or passers-by, in compliance with data protection regulations.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above-stated object is achieved by the features and embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, a method provides accident parameters to a person outside a vehicle after an accident involving the vehicle. The method for providing accident parameters may be a computer-implemented method and/or a control-unit-implemented method. The person outside the vehicle may be an emergency service worker or a passer-by near the vehicle accident site. The accident parameters are preferably made available to the person outside the vehicle by means of the vehicle. The vehicle can be a conventional, partially, highly, or fully automatically driven vehicle. In particular, the vehicle can be a motor vehicle. An accident parameter can be a number, text, a graphic, an image, and/or a multimedia object.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The method comprises ascertaining a first accident parameter that is representative of an accident severity and/or an accident consequence severity by means of a control unit of the vehicle. Preferably, the first accident parameter can be representative of the accident severity and/or the accident consequence severity for the vehicle. In addition or alternatively, the first accident parameter may be representative of the severity of the accident and/or the accident consequence severity for one or more occupants of the vehicle. The method comprises determining a display device of the vehicle that can display the first accident parameter and/or further accident parameters following the accident. The display device may be arranged in the interior of the vehicle or on the exterior of the vehicle. It is preferable to specify more than one display device, for example, two, three, and/or four display devices. For each display device, it can be determined whether the first accident parameter can be displayed by the respective display unit without errors.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The method comprises making the first accident parameter available on the determined display device of the vehicle. The method further comprises ascertaining a second accident parameter that is representative of the accident severity and/or the accident consequence severity by means of the control unit of the vehicle. Preferably, the second accident parameter can be representative of the accident severity and/or the accident consequence severity for the vehicle. In addition or alternatively, the second accident parameter may be representative of the accident severity and/or the accident consequence severity for one or more occupants of the vehicle. The method also comprises receiving a release signal for the second accident parameter via an input interface of the vehicle from the person outside the vehicle following the vehicle accident, verifying the release signal for the second accident parameter by means of the control unit of the vehicle, and providing the second accident parameter on the determined display device of the vehicle if the release signal was successfully verified by the control unit of the vehicle. In addition or alternatively, the second accident parameter can be provided on another display device of the vehicle. For this purpose, the method can determine an additional display unit of the vehicle that can display the second accident parameter without errors.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The method can advantageously provide different accident parameters on a display device of the vehicle following an accident involving the vehicle. The vehicle provides the emergency services with the necessary information for rescuing or providing medical treatment to the vehicle occupant(s) on site. The displayed accident parameters can be used to determine more efficiently what subsequent form of medical rescue and/or medical treatment to provide to the occupants. In order to protect the privacy of the occupants, accident parameters can only be provided after receiving the release signal. This means that the vehicle can selectively provide specific, predefined accident parameters only to emergency services personnel. This prevents the accident parameters of the vehicle that are provided from being misused by third parties. The privacy of the occupants can thus be efficiently protected.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an advantageous embodiment, the method can comprise receiving a request message to transmit the first accident parameter and/or the second accident parameter from a mobile terminal of the person outside the vehicle via a communication interface of the vehicle by means of the vehicle, transmitting the first accident parameter and/or the second accident parameter from the vehicle to the mobile terminal via the communication interface of the vehicle, receiving the first accident parameter and/or the second accident parameter from the vehicle by means of the mobile terminal, and providing the first accident parameter and/or the second accident parameter to the person outside the vehicle by means of the mobile terminal. This allows the person outside the vehicle to efficiently query the accident parameters. This is particularly advantageous if there is no functioning display device in the vehicle to provide the accident parameters.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with a further, advantageous design, the method can also comprise verifying whether the first accident parameter and/or the second accident parameter have been correctly transmitted by the mobile terminal via an emergency call signal from the vehicle. If the first accident parameter and/or the second accident parameter were not transmitted or were incorrectly transmitted via the emergency call signal of the vehicle, the method can provide a signal representative of an unsuccessful verification of the first accident parameter and/or the second accident parameter to the person outside the vehicle by means of the mobile terminal. If the first accident parameter and/or the second accident parameter have been correctly transmitted via the emergency call signal of the vehicle, the method can provide a signal representative of a successful verification of the first accident parameter and/or the second accident parameter to the person outside the vehicle by means of the mobile terminal. This allows efficient verification of data transmitted via the statutory or non-statutory emergency call using the accident parameters of the vehicle. An incorrect and/or failed transmission of the data via the emergency call can thus be efficiently detected.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with a further, advantageous embodiment, the first accident parameter and/or the second accident parameter can be provided on the determined display device of the vehicle depending on a distance of the person outside the vehicle from the vehicle. This allows the accident parameters to be efficiently provided by means of the vehicle. The energy consumption of the vehicle, in particular the display device or display devices of the vehicle, can be efficiently reduced if the accident parameters are only made available to persons outside the vehicle who are within a specified distance from the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with a further, advantageous embodiment the release signal from the mobile device of the person outside the vehicle can be transmitted to the vehicle via the communication interface of the vehicle, and/or the request message for the transmission of the first accident parameter and/or the second accident parameter can comprise the release signal. This enables the second accident parameter to be efficiently released by the person outside the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with a further advantageous design, the second accident parameter can be provided on the determined display unit of the vehicle depending on a distance of the mobile terminal of the person outside the vehicle from the vehicle. This means the second accident parameter can be provided in an energy-efficient manner.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another aspect, a computer-readable medium provides accident parameters to a person outside a vehicle following an accident involving the vehicle, wherein the computer-readable medium comprises instructions that, when executed on a computer or a control unit, carry out the method described above.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a further aspect, a system provides accident parameters to a person outside a vehicle following an accident involving the vehicle, wherein the system is designed to carry out the method described above.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to another aspect, a vehicle includes the system described above for providing accident parameters to a person outside a vehicle after an accident involving the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Additional features arise from the claims, the figures, and the description of the figures. All the features and feature combinations cited in the description above, and the features and feature combinations cited in the description of the figures below and/or shown in the figures alone are applicable not only in the respective combination indicated, but also in other combinations or else in isolation.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the following, a preferred exemplary embodiment is described by reference to the attached drawing.

In general, accident parameters can be representative of the severity of an accident or of the severity of the consequences of an accident.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The severity of the accident can be defined as the stress exerted on a vehicle and/or on the person. Examples of accident parameters of the accident severity are: collision speed or impact speed, vectorial speed change &#x394;v, energy equivalent speed, specific accident power, a combination of the vectorial speed change with a mean deceleration, intrusion, depth of intrusion, intrusion speed, mean acceleration and/or deceleration, degree of damage, impulse, impulse change, impulse direction, relative speed, impetus of impact, direction of impact, energy difference before and/or after the accident, and/or rollover.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The accident consequence severity can be defined as the sum of material damage to the vehicle and its surroundings and/or personal injury. Examples of accident parameters of the severity of the accident consequences are: probability of injury, probability of injury to a region and/or part of the body, probability of injury severity, probability of an AIS (Abbreviated Injury Scale), probability of a MAIS (Maximum AIS), probability of a MAIS3+ (MAIS greater than 3), and/or an ISS (Injury Severity Score).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The method <b>100</b> can determine <b>102</b> a first accident parameter that is representative of the severity of the accident and/or the severity of the accident consequences of the vehicle by means of a vehicle control unit. The method <b>100</b> can determine a display device <b>104</b> of the vehicle, which can display the first accident parameter and/or a second accident parameter after the accident, preferably without errors. For example, determining the display device can comprise retrieving a status value of the display device, wherein the status value of the display device is representative of the display device functioning without error. For example, the display device can be determined depending on damage to the vehicle after the accident.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The method <b>100</b> can provide <b>106</b> the first accident parameter on the determined display device of the vehicle. The first accident parameter on the determined display device can be provided temporarily, depending on events such as a distance of a person outside the vehicle from the vehicle, and/or permanently.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The method <b>100</b> can determine <b>108</b> a second accident parameter that is representative of the severity of the accident and/or the severity of the accident consequences of the vehicle by means of the vehicle control unit. In addition, the method <b>100</b> can receive <b>110</b> a release signal for the second accident parameter from the person outside the vehicle after the accident involving the vehicle via a communication interface of the vehicle, for example an NFC radio interface, and/or an input interface of the vehicle, for example a touch-sensitive input via a touch-sensitive input device. The vehicle can verify <b>112</b> the release signal for the second accident parameter by means of the control unit of the vehicle and provide <b>114</b> the second accident parameter on the determined display unit of the vehicle if the release signal has been successfully verified <b>112</b> by the control unit of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is advantageous that the vehicle can efficiently provide accident parameters to a person outside the vehicle. The release signal means that accident parameters can only be provided to authorized persons outside the vehicle, thus efficiently protecting the privacy of the vehicle occupants.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">LIST OF REFERENCE SIGNS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0028"><b>100</b> method</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0029"><b>102</b> determining a first accident parameter</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0030"><b>104</b> determining a display device</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0031"><b>106</b> providing the first accident parameter</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0032"><b>108</b> determining a second accident parameter</li>    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0033"><b>110</b> receiving a release signal</li>    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0034"><b>112</b> verifying the release signal</li>    <li id="ul0001-0008" num="0035"><b>114</b> providing the second accident parameter</li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-001-9" num="001-9"><claim-text><b>1</b>.-<b>9</b>.
