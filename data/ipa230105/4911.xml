Well interventions alter the state of the well or well geometry, provide well diagnostics, or manage the production of the well. During light interventions, operators lower tools or sensors into a live well while pressure is contained at the surface. In heavy interventions, the operators may stop production at the formation before making major equipment changes.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Light interventions are usually performed using slickline, wireline, or coiled tubing to minimize the possibility of potential well blockages. Light interventions are also performed to change or adjust downhole equipment such as valves or pumps, or to gather downhole pressure, temperature, and flow data.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Heavy interventions, also referred to as workovers, require the wellhead and other pressure barriers to be removed from the well to allow full access to the wellbore.

However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the description.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Throughout the application, ordinal numbers (e.g., first, second, third, etc.) may be used as an adjective for an element (i.e., any noun in the application). The use of ordinal numbers is not to imply or create any particular ordering of the elements nor to limit any element to being only a single element unless expressly disclosed, such as using the terms &#x201c;before&#x201d;, &#x201c;after&#x201d;, &#x201c;single&#x201d;, and other such terminology. Rather, the use of ordinal numbers is to distinguish between the elements. By way of an example, a first element is distinct from a second element, and the first element may encompass more than one element and succeed (or precede) the second element in an ordering of elements.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of this disclosure provide a method for a well intervention program. Initially, a collection of well intervention mandates is generated by a number of originators in an oil and gas industry hierarchy. The well intervention mandates are categorized, based on respectively originator rankings, into macro-level mandates, mid-level mandates, and micro-level mandates. A well intervention activity plan is generated that specifies attributes of the well intervention activity for each of the well intervention mandates. A most frequent timeframe is generated based on respective pre-defined cycle times of the mid-level mandates. An audit of the well intervention program is performed, based on a pre-determined audit criterion and over the most frequent time frame, to generate an audit result. The audit result is then presented to the originators throughout the oil and gas industry hierarchy. On-going audits of the well intervention program are routinely performed to generate audit results. A machine learning algorithm is used to generate an artificial intelligence (AI) model of the well intervention program based on the ongoing audit results. Accordingly, the well intervention mandates of the well intervention program are adjusted based on the AI model to enhance subsequent execution of the well intervention program.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a schematic diagram in accordance with one or more embodiments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a well environment (<b>100</b>) includes a subterranean formation (&#x201c;formation&#x201d;) (<b>104</b>) and a well system (<b>106</b>). The formation (<b>104</b>) may include a porous or fractured rock formation that resides underground, beneath the earth's surface (&#x201c;surface&#x201d;) (<b>108</b>). The formation (<b>104</b>) may include different layers of rock having varying characteristics, such as varying degrees of permeability, porosity, capillary pressure, and resistivity. In the case of the well system (<b>106</b>) being a hydrocarbon well, the formation (<b>104</b>) may include a hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir (<b>102</b>). In the case of the well system (<b>106</b>) being operated as a production well, the well system (<b>106</b>) may facilitate the extraction of hydrocarbons (or &#x201c;production&#x201d;) from the reservoir (<b>102</b>).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments disclosed herein, the well system (<b>106</b>) includes a rig (<b>101</b>), a wellbore (<b>120</b>) with a casing (<b>121</b>), a well sub-surface system (<b>122</b>), a well surface system (<b>124</b>), and a well control system (&#x201c;control system&#x201d;) (<b>126</b>). The well control system (<b>126</b>) may control various operations of the well system (<b>106</b>), such as well production operations, well drilling operation, well completion operations, well maintenance operations, and reservoir monitoring, assessment and development operations. For example, the well maintenance operations may include the well intervention operations in the wellbore (<b>120</b>). In particular, the well intervention operations relate to well drilling, completion, downhole surveillance, stimulation, downhole or wellhead maintenance work that are planned and executed through engineered rig-less or rig operations. Planning, executing, auditing, and other management tasks associated with the well intervention are collectively referred to as the well intervention program.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The rig (<b>101</b>) is the machine used to drill a borehole to form the wellbore (<b>120</b>). Major components of the rig (<b>101</b>) include the drilling fluid tanks, the drilling fluid pumps (e.g., rig mixing pumps), the derrick or mast, the draw works, the rotary table or top drive, the drill string, the power generation equipment and auxiliary equipment. Drilling fluid, also referred to as &#x201c;drilling mud&#x201d; or simply &#x201c;mud,&#x201d; is used to facilitate drilling boreholes into the earth, such as drilling oil and natural gas wells. The main functions of drilling fluids include providing hydrostatic pressure to prevent formation fluids from entering into the borehole, keeping the drill bit cool and clean during drilling, carrying out drill cuttings, and suspending the drill cuttings while drilling is paused and when the drilling assembly is brought in and out of the borehole.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The wellbore (<b>120</b>) includes a bored hole (i.e., borehole) that extends from the surface (<b>108</b>) towards a target zone of the formation (<b>104</b>), such as the reservoir (<b>102</b>). An upper end of the wellbore (<b>120</b>), terminating at or near the surface (<b>108</b>), may be referred to as the &#x201c;up-hole&#x201d; end of the wellbore (<b>120</b>), and a lower end of the wellbore, terminating in the formation (<b>104</b>), may be referred to as the &#x201c;downhole&#x201d; end of the wellbore (<b>120</b>). The wellbore (<b>120</b>) may facilitate the circulation of drilling fluids during drilling operations for the wellbore (<b>120</b>) to extend towards the target zone of the formation (<b>104</b>) (e.g., the reservoir (<b>102</b>)), facilitate the flow of hydrocarbon production (e.g., oil and gas) from the reservoir (<b>102</b>) to the surface (<b>108</b>) during production operations, facilitate the injection of substances (e.g., water) into the hydrocarbon-bearing formation (<b>104</b>) or the reservoir (<b>102</b>) during injection operations, or facilitate the communication of monitoring devices (e.g., logging tools) lowered into the formation (<b>104</b>) or the reservoir (<b>102</b>) during monitoring operations (e.g., during in situ logging operations).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the well system (<b>106</b>) is provided with a bottom hole assembly (BHA) (<b>151</b>) attached to a suitable conveyance method such as drill pipes (<b>150</b>) for rig operations to suspend into the wellbore (<b>120</b>) for performing the well drilling operation. The bottom hole assembly (BHA) is the lowest part of a drill string and includes the drill bit, drill collar, stabilizer, mud motor, etc. The well system (<b>106</b>) may also be provided with slickline, wireline, coiled tubing, downhole equipment such as valves, pumps, pressure/temperature/flow sensors, and other completion equipment of the casing (<b>121</b>).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the well system (<b>106</b>) is further provided with a well intervention management system (<b>160</b>). For example, the well intervention management system (<b>160</b>) may include hardware and/or software with functionality to manage or otherwise facilitate well intervention programs. In some embodiments, the well intervention management system (<b>160</b>) includes a computer system, such as a portion of the computing system described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> below.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The well intervention programs reflect the dynamic nature of oil and gas industry in two critical aspects. Firstly, well intervention programs are necessary for developing and producing oil and gas fields and constitute a considerable amount of the upstream operations expenditure. Secondly, well intervention programs encompass a wide array of frontline engineering and operational activities that ultimately have strong interlinking impacts with the pertinent high-level strategies and directions of the oil and gas industry. Therefore, the ability to efficiently audit well interventions may be a challenging task especially that such audits commonly cover multiple scopes (e.g., technical, regulatory, environmental, safety, financial, performance, etc.). For example, auditing gas wells for tubing metal loss surveillance against instituted frequency may be frequently required by the respective well integrity standards while surveillance results validation efficiency may be necessitated for performance assessment. Similarly, maintaining an effective alignment and proactive contributions between frontline level employees (e.g., engineers/SMEs) and high-level objectives remain a challenge especially given the growing volatility of the oil and gas economics that cause frequent target changes, and the continuously evolving/transforming strategies that require tapping into multi-discipline human resources (e.g., engineer, lab scientists, pump operators) for realization rather than making requirement enforcement. For example, an NOC (national oil company) strategy to reduce ground water utilization in well stimulation operations may not be effectively and timely achievable if all multi-discipline human resources are not tapped into to find feasible ways to achieve the strategy (e.g., by multi-pronged approach based on alternative water sources, design with reduced water quantities). Accordingly, the well intervention management system (<b>160</b>) is used to manage these challenges by enabling well intervention programs auditability on a near-real time basis for an entire business cycle, and attracting and aligning the contributions of multi-discipline human resources (not limited to high-level decision makers) to effectively drive positive business results.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">While the well intervention management system (<b>160</b>) is shown at a well site in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the well intervention management system (<b>160</b>) may also be remotely located away from well site.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates a portion of the well intervention management system (<b>160</b>) depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> above.

Such programs may be run in different ways to suit each organization's needs and priorities (i.e., operating company such as NOC or IOC, service company). However, well interventions are commonly encountered with some challenges, especially in excellence-oriented systems. One example of those challenges is auditing the well intervention program which may be required frequently for various objectives such as technical, regulatory, environmental, safety, financial, or performance related. When conducting such audits, organizations often run into a contradiction between audit comprehensiveness and thoroughness on one hand, and audit timeliness and efficiency on the other hand. Another example of a challenge that well intervention programs may encounter is people drive. The effectiveness of people contributions (i.e., employees, leaders) to the success of running well intervention activities sometimes face challenging tradeoffs such as maintaining hierarchy control through target enforcement vs. enabling grass-root employee participation and engagement.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0054">To implement near-real time auditability of the full cycle and the ability to efficiently attract and align people-drive towards positive business contributions (e.g., value generation, customer satisfaction, innovation) in synchronization with the dynamically-evolving strategies of the oil and gas industry, the well intervention success-factor enabler identifies the well intervention activities that has People-Drive flag set to &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; and identifies corresponding success factors that are defined via reward-based (i.e., incentivizing) approach as shown in LIST 3 below:</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">List 3</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0000"><ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0055">m) Contribution: Define the individual specific positive contributions impacting the flagged activity</li>    <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0056">n) People: Indicator of the relevant people capable of influencing the subject activity (i.e. job family)</li>    <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0057">o) Reward: A measure proportional to the efforts required by the people to make the defined positive contribution to the subject activity and the level of impact of the contributions on achieving the activity objectives.</li>    <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0058">p) Deliverable: Define the outcome and/or documentation that can be used to satisfactorily verify the contribution to the activity is adequate.</li>    <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0059">q) Verifier: the person designated to review and verify contributions.</li>    <li id="ul0003-0006" num="0060">r) Status: A measure considering the deliverable and verification to define contribution validity status (e.g. submitted, accepted, rejected).</li></ul></p><p id="p-0047" num="0061">Further, the well intervention success-factor enabler identifies Performance measures (PM) based on well intervention program pre-defined targets as shown in LIST 4 below:</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">List 4</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0000"><ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0062">s) Performance measure definition: the formula based on which the performance is measured.</li>    <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0063">t) Target: the desired results by the end of business cycle.</li>    <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0064">u) Actual performance: the performance reported for a defined timeline within the business cycle.</li>    <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0065">v) Unit: measurement unit.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0049" num="0066">In addition, the well intervention success-factor enabler defines (i) audit criteria based on well intervention program processes or mandates to determine success factors such as timeliness, acceptance and/or scoring standards, (ii) resources such as budget, material, manpower, technology, among others where and all related information are indexed, and (iii) organization-customized categorization to serve specific needs such as geographical distribution, service seasonality, among others.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0067">In one or more embodiments, the program management and AI engine (<b>214</b>) performs the function of a well intervention program manager and artificial intelligence (AI) processor.

The outcome (<b>320</b><i>c</i>) of utilizing the AI machine learning model (<b>320</b><i>b</i>) is used to optimize the mandates and activity plans of the well intervention program, to forecast year-end well intervention results, and to enhance next business cycle well intervention requirements. For an example wellbore static-bottom hole pressure rig-less surveillance, the job efficiency is enhanced by 5% through a customized design based on eliminating multiple slickline runs for a wellbore drift and pressure survey. Applying a single run for both wellbore drift and pressure survey is based on digital slickline technologies and yields an estimated value of $250,000 in a full business plan cycle.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0124">Embodiments may be implemented on a computing system.
