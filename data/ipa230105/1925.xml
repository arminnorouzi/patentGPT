If no preceding vehicle exits, inter-vehicle distance maintenance is not necessary, and, for example, desired acceleration/deceleration control can be realized by vehicle speed correction based on a request from fuel saving control. However, if a preceding vehicle exists, inter-vehicle distance maintenance is also necessary, and how speed control is realized between acceleration/deceleration requests by inter-vehicle distance maintenance control, and fuel saving control is unknown.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In view of the above, an objective of the present disclosure is made in view of the problems as described above, and is to provide a vehicle travel control apparatus and a vehicle travel control method that enable speed control that excel in energy efficiency in accordance with a terrain shape located ahead of a subject vehicle although a preceding vehicle exists.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As described above, according to the one aspect of the present disclosure, a vehicle travel control apparatus includes: an information acquiring section that is configured to acquire positional information of a current position of a subject vehicle, preceding vehicle information concerning a preceding vehicle travelling in front of the subject vehicle, and road information concerning a road in front of the subject vehicle; a determining section that is configured to determine whether a special road terrain exists in front of the subject vehicle based on the road information, energy efficiency for the subject vehicle being improved as a result of speed control for the subject vehicle by making use of the special road terrain; and a speed control section that is configured to control a speed of the subject vehicle to be a pre-set vehicle speed. A road zone including the special road terrain is defined as an energy efficiency zone. A road zone before the energy efficiency zone is defined as an inter-vehicle distance maintenance zone. The speed control section is further configured to: when the special road terrain does not exist in front of the subject vehicle but a preceding vehicle exists, perform the speed control to control the speed to be the pre-set vehicle speed while maintaining the subject vehicle with at least a pre-set inter-vehicle distance to the preceding vehicle; when the special road terrain exists in front of the subject vehicle but a preceding vehicle does not exist, perform the speed control to increase or decrease the speed of the subject vehicle with respect to the pre-set vehicle speed in the energy efficiency zone such that the energy efficiency is improved; and when the special road terrain exists in front of the subject vehicle, a preceding vehicle exists, and the speed of the subject vehicle is planned to increase with respect to the pre-set vehicle speed in the energy efficiency zone, perform the speed control to control the speed of the subject vehicle in the inter-vehicle distance maintenance zone such that the subject vehicle has an inter-vehicle distance to the preceding vehicle that is longer than the pre-set inter-vehicle distance.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a second aspect of the present disclosure, a vehicle travel control method is performed by at least one processor to control a speed of a subject vehicle. The vehicle travel control method includes: acquiring positional information of a current position of the subject vehicle, preceding vehicle information concerning a preceding vehicle travelling in front of the subject vehicle, and road information concerning a road in front of the subject vehicle; determining, based on the road information, whether a special road terrain exists in front of the subject vehicle, energy efficiency for the subject vehicle being improved by making use of the special road terrain as a result of speed control that is performed before the subject vehicle travels through the special road terrain; and controlling the speed of the subject vehicle to be a pre-set vehicle speed. A road zone including the special road terrain is defined as an energy efficiency zone. A road zone before the energy efficiency zone is defined as an inter-vehicle distance maintenance zone. Controlling the speed of the subject vehicle to be the pre-set vehicle speed further includes: when the special road terrain does not exist in front of the subject vehicle but a preceding vehicle exists, performing the speed control to control the speed of the subject vehicle to be the pre-set vehicle speed while maintaining the subject vehicle with at least a pre-set inter-vehicle distance to the preceding vehicle; when the special road terrain exists in front of the subject vehicle but a preceding vehicle does not exist, performing the speed control to increase or decrease the speed of the subject vehicle with respect to the pre-set vehicle speed in the energy efficiency zone such that the energy efficiency is improved; when the special road terrain exists in front of the subject vehicle, a preceding vehicle exists, and the vehicle speed is planned to increase with respect to the pre-set vehicle speed in the energy efficiency zone, performing the speed control to control the speed of the subject vehicle in the inter-vehicle distance maintenance zone such that the subject vehicle has an inter-vehicle distance to the preceding vehicle that is longer than the pre-set inter-vehicle distance; and when the special road terrain exists in front of the subject vehicle, a preceding vehicle exists, and the vehicle speed is planned to decrease with respect to the pre-set vehicle speed in the energy efficiency zone, performing the speed control to control the speed of the subject vehicle in the inter-vehicle distance maintenance zone such that the subject vehicle has an inter-vehicle distance to the preceding vehicle that is shorter than the pre-set inter-vehicle distance.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a third aspect of the present disclosure, a vehicle travel control apparatus includes: at least one processor programed to: acquire positional information of a current position of a subject vehicle, preceding vehicle information concerning a preceding vehicle travelling in front of the subject vehicle, and road information concerning a road in front of the subject vehicle; determine whether a special road terrain exists in front of the subject vehicle based on the road information, energy efficiency for the subject vehicle being improved as a result of speed control for the subject vehicle by making use of the special road terrain; and control a speed of the subject vehicle to be a pre-set vehicle speed. A road zone including the special road terrain is defined as an energy efficiency zone, and a road zone before the energy efficiency zone is defined as an inter-vehicle distance maintenance zone. The at least one processor is further programmed to: when the special road terrain does not exist in front of the subject vehicle but a preceding vehicle exists, perform the speed control to control the speed to be the pre-set vehicle speed while maintaining the subject vehicle with at least a pre-set inter-vehicle distance to the preceding vehicle; when the special road terrain exists in front of the subject vehicle but a preceding vehicle does not exist, perform the speed control to increase or decrease the speed of the subject vehicle with respect to the pre-set vehicle speed in the energy efficiency zone such that the energy efficiency is improved; and when the special road terrain exists in front of the subject vehicle, a preceding vehicle exists, and the speed of the subject vehicle is planned to increase with respect to the pre-set vehicle speed in the energy efficiency zone, perform the speed control to control the speed of the subject vehicle in the inter-vehicle distance maintenance zone such that the subject vehicle has an inter-vehicle distance to the preceding vehicle that is longer than the pre-set inter-vehicle distance.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the vehicle travel control apparatus and the vehicle travel control method, when no special road terrain exists in front of the subject vehicle but a preceding vehicle exits, speed control is performed to control the vehicle speed to be the pre-set vehicle speed while maintaining the inter-vehicle distance with a distance to the preceding vehicle that is longer than the pre-set inter-vehicle distance. Thus, when a preceding vehicle exists, the subject vehicle can travel at a pre-set vehicle speed while maintaining the inter-vehicle distance longer than the pre-set inter-vehicle distance. In addition, when the special road terrain exists and no preceding vehicle exists, speed control is performed to increase or decrease the speed of the subject vehicle relative to the pre-set vehicle speed such that the energy efficiency is enhanced in the energy efficiency zone. Therefore, when no preceding vehicle exists, the subject vehicle can travel at a vehicle speed for enhancing the energy efficiency.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Then, when the special road terrain exists, a preceding vehicle exits, and the vehicle speed is planned to increase relative to the pre-set vehicle speed in the energy efficiency zone, speed control is performed to increase the inter-vehicle distance to be longer than the pre-set inter-vehicle distance in the inter-vehicle distance maintenance zone. In a case that the vehicle speed is increased relative to the pre-set vehicle speed in the energy efficiency zone, it is necessary to increase the inter-vehicle distance because of the existence of the preceding vehicle. Because, in view of this, the inter-vehicle distance is made longer than the pre-set inter-vehicle distance in the closer inter-vehicle distance maintenance zone, it is possible to prevent the subject vehicle from coming closer to the preceding vehicle as a result of a vehicle speed increase in the energy efficiency zone. Thereby, no matter whether or not a preceding vehicle exists, it is possible to implement speed control that excels in energy efficiency in accordance with the special road terrain located ahead of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Next, a plurality of embodiments will be described with reference to the accompanied drawings.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A first embodiment of the present disclosure is explained by using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. A vehicle system <b>20</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is used in an automated driving vehicle (i.e., a subject vehicle) capable of automated driving. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the vehicle system <b>20</b> includes a vehicle control apparatus <b>21</b>, a travel control electronic control unit (Electronic Control Unit: abbreviated to ECU) <b>31</b>, a locator <b>33</b>, a map database <b>34</b>, a surrounding-environment monitoring sensor <b>35</b>, a communication module <b>37</b>, a vehicle condition sensor <b>38</b>, a manual operating section <b>32</b>, a driving switching section <b>30</b>, and a vehicle display apparatus <b>39</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">First, the automated driving vehicle is explained. The automated driving vehicle only has to be a vehicle capable of automated driving as mentioned before. As levels of automations which are degrees of automated driving, for example, there are a plurality of levels as defined by SAE. The levels of automation are classified into levels in the following manner according to the definitions by SAE.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Level 0 is a level at which all driving tasks are implemented by a driver without intervention by a system. The driving tasks are steering, and acceleration/deceleration, for example. Level 0 is equivalent to so-called manual driving using the manual operating section <b>32</b>. Level 1 is a level at which a system assists either steering or acceleration/deceleration. Level 2 is a level at which a system assists both steering, and acceleration/deceleration. Level 1 and Level 2 are equivalent to so-called driving assistance.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Level 3 is a level at which a system can implement all driving tasks at particular locations such as freeways and the like, and a driver performs driving operation at time of emergency. At Level 3, the driver is required to be able to act in response promptly in a case that a system requests the driver to take over driving. Level 3 is equivalent to so-called conditional automated driving. Level 4 is a level at which a system can implement all driving tasks except under particular situations such roads that cannot be handled by the system, extreme environments and the like. Level 4 is equivalent to so-called advanced automated driving. Level 5 is a level at which a system can implement all driving tasks in every possible environment. Level 5 is equivalent to so-called fully automated driving. The level is equivalent to so-called automated driving.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, the automated driving vehicle according to the present embodiment may be an automated driving vehicle whose level of automation is Level 3 or may be an automated driving vehicle whose level of automation is Level 4 or higher. In addition, the level of automation may be able to be switched. In the present embodiment, the level of automation can be switched to automated driving at Automation Level 3 or higher and to manual driving at Level 0.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Next, the configuration of each section is explained. The locator <b>33</b> includes a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receiver and an inertia sensor. The GNSS receiver receives positioning signals from a plurality of positioning satellites. The inertia sensor includes a gyro sensor, and an acceleration sensor, for example. The locator <b>33</b> combines the positioning signal received at the GNSS receiver with measurement results of the inertia sensor, and thereby serially measures the vehicle position of the subject vehicle. It is supposed that the vehicle position is represented by coordinates of latitudes/longitudes, for example. Note that in another possible configuration, measurement of the vehicle position may use a travelled distance determined from signals serially output from a vehicle speed sensor mounted on the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The map database <b>34</b> is a non-volatile memory, and has stored thereon map data about link data, node data, road shapes, structures, and the like. The link data includes pieces of data such as link IDs identifying links, link lengths representing the lengths of the links, link azimuths, link travel time, link shapes, node coordinates of the start points and end points of the links or road attributes. For example, the link shapes may be ones represented by coordinate sequences representing the coordinate positions of both ends of each link, and shape-interpolating points representing the shape therebetween. Examples of the road attributes include road names, road types, road widths, lane count information representing the numbers of lanes, speed regulation values, and the like. The node data includes pieces of data such as node IDs which are unique numbers given to nodes on a map, node coordinates, node names, node types or connection link IDs representing link IDs of links connected to the nodes. In another possible configuration, the link data may be not only defined for each road zone, but also subdefined for each lane, that is, each driving lane.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It may be made possible to identify, from lane count information and/or road types, which of multiple lanes on each side, a single lane on each side, a road with two way traffic without a center line, and the like a road zone, that is, links, correspond (corresponds) to. Roads with two way traffic without center lines do not include roads with one way traffic. The roads with two way traffic without center lines mentioned here represent roads with two way traffic without center lines in local roads excluding freeways, and roads dedicated for automobiles.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The map data may include 3D maps including point clouds of feature points of road shapes and structures. In a case that 3D maps including point clouds of feature points of road shapes and structures are used as the map data, the locator <b>33</b> may not use the GNSS receiver, but use the 3D maps, and sensing results of the surrounding-environment monitoring sensor <b>35</b> such as a LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging/Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging) or a surrounding-environment monitoring camera that senses point clouds of feature points of road shapes and structures to identify the subject vehicle position, in another possible configuration. Note that the 3D maps may be ones that are generated on the basis of captured images by REM (Road Experience Management).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The surrounding-environment monitoring sensor <b>35</b> is an autonomous sensor that monitors the surrounding environment of the subject vehicle. For example, the surrounding-environment monitoring sensor <b>35</b> senses objects near the subject vehicle like pedestrians, animals other than humans, moving bodies that are moving such as vehicles other than the subject vehicle or stationary objects that are stationary such as guardrails, curb stones, trees or fallen objects on roads. Other than these, the surrounding-environment monitoring sensor <b>35</b> also senses road markings near the subject vehicle such as lane markings. Examples of the surrounding-environment monitoring sensor <b>35</b> include a surrounding-environment monitoring camera that captures images of a predetermined area near the subject vehicle, and distance measurement sensors that transmit scanning waves to a predetermined area near the subject vehicle such as a millimeter wave radar, a sonar or a LIDAR, for example.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The vehicle condition sensor <b>38</b> is a sensor group for sensing various types of condition of the subject vehicle. Examples of the vehicle condition sensor <b>38</b> include a vehicle speed sensor, a steering sensor, an acceleration sensor, a yaw rate sensor, and the like. The vehicle speed sensor senses the vehicle speed of the subject vehicle. The steering sensor senses the steering angle of the subject vehicle. The acceleration sensor senses accelerations such as the forward/backward accelerations or lateral accelerations of the subject vehicle.

The identification information is information for identifying individual vehicles.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The travel environment acquiring section <b>25</b> acquires a travel environment of the subject vehicle <b>100</b>, and generates a virtual space simulating the acquired travel environment for the automated driving section <b>26</b>.

As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the automated driving section <b>26</b> includes a determining section <b>42</b> and a speed control section <b>43</b>, as functional blocks.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">By using the travel environment acquired at the travel environment acquiring section <b>25</b>, the automated driving section <b>26</b> implements vehicle control for causing the subject vehicle <b>100</b> to travel by automated driving. The automated driving section <b>26</b> causes the travel control ECU <b>31</b> to automatically perform acceleration/deceleration, and/or steering to thereby perform driving operation in place of the driver, that is, perform automated driving. In the present embodiment, the automated driving section <b>26</b> executes the adaptive cruise control mentioned before.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The determining section <b>42</b> uses the road information to determine whether a special road terrain that contributes to enhancement of the energy efficiency as a result of speed control is located ahead. The special road terrain is a terrain that contributes to improving the energy efficiency as a result of speed control that is performed before the subject vehicle enters the special road terrain. In other words, the energy efficiency for the subject vehicle can be improved by making use of the special road terrain by controlling the speed of the subject vehicle before the subject vehicle reaches the special road terrain. The special road terrain is such a terrain that the energy consumption can be reduced more if acceleration/deceleration control is adjusted relative to a pre-set vehicle speed as compared with a situation where the subject vehicle travels at the constant pre-set vehicle speed. The special road terrain is also referred to as a fuel saving control implementation area. For example, the special road terrain is a sag section. At a sag section, the subject vehicle is accelerated in advance at the downhill, and prepares for the uphill by gaining inertia. This can contribute to improving the energy efficiency. Enhancement or improvement of the energy efficiency is a synonym of reduction of the combustion consumption in a case of a gasoline-powered car, and is a synonym of reduction of the electrical power consumption in a case of an electric car. Speed control for enhancing the energy efficiency is referred to as fuel saving control below in some cases. In addition, a road zone including the special road terrain is defines as an energy efficiency zone. The energy efficiency zone includes the special road terrain, and has predetermined zones before and after it, for example zones with lengths which are equal to 500 m. A predetermined zone is set before the special road terrain at such a distance that the degree of contribution to enhancement of the energy efficiency attained by implementing acceleration/deceleration control based on fuel saving control is high. Accordingly, if the predetermined zone has only a length which is equal to several meters, since its starting point is too close to the special road terrain, necessary acceleration/deceleration control cannot be enough performed; in addition, if the predetermined zone has a length which is equal to several kilometers, since the starting point is too far from the special road terrain, the degree of contribution of acceleration/deceleration control is small. In addition, a road zone before the energy efficiency zone is defined as an inter-vehicle distance maintenance zone.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The speed control section <b>43</b> controls the speed of the subject vehicle <b>100</b> on the basis of a pre-set vehicle speed that has been set in advance, and a pre-set inter-vehicle distance that has been set in advance. The speed control section <b>43</b> controls the pre-set vehicle speed and the pre-set inter-vehicle distance such that the pre-set vehicle speed has a tolerance of &#xb1;several km/h, the pre-set inter-vehicle distance has a tolerance of approximately &#xb1;several dozen meters, and the energy efficiency is enhanced within the ranges of the tolerances.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In a case that there are no preceding vehicles <b>101</b>, inter-vehicle distance maintenance is not necessary, and desired acceleration/deceleration control can be realized by vehicle speed correction based on a request from fuel saving control. However, in a case that there is a preceding vehicle <b>101</b>, it is also necessary to maintain an inter-vehicle distance, and a conflict occurs between acceleration/deceleration requests by inter-vehicle distance maintenance control and fuel saving control in some cases.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In view of this, the pre-set inter-vehicle distance is given a tolerance of approximately &#xb1;several dozen meters as described above. In a case that it is expected that the subject vehicle enters a road with a special road terrain, the inter-vehicle distance is artificially adjusted within the tolerance of the pre-set inter-vehicle distance in advance, a conflict between an acceleration/deceleration request by inter-vehicle distance maintenance control and fuel saving control is avoided, and enhancement of the energy efficiency is realized. For example, control is performed such that the inter-vehicle distance is increased in advance in a case that an acceleration request is expected in the special road terrain, the inter-vehicle distance is reduced in advance in a case that a deceleration request is expected in the special road terrain, and so on. The tolerances of the pre-set inter-vehicle distance and pre-set vehicle speed are changed at any time to values set taking into consideration information about surrounding traffic obtained from the surrounding-environment monitoring sensor <b>35</b>, for example, about a situation related to following vehicles, and the like, to thereby give careful consideration to nearby vehicles also.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Specifically, the speed control section <b>43</b> sequentially corrects a pre-set vehicle speed Vset, and a pre-set inter-vehicle distance &#x3b4;set on the basis of a fuel saving request, and a request to follow a preceding vehicle <b>101</b>, and calculates a target vehicle speed Vref, and a target inter-vehicle distance &#x3b4;ref. Then, feedback control is performed such that the target vehicle speed, and the actual speed match, and the actual inter-vehicle distance becomes equal to or longer than the target inter-vehicle distance. Note that tolerances &#x3b1; and &#x3b2; given to the pre-set vehicle speed, and the pre-set inter-vehicle distance are set to &#xb1;several km/h, and &#xb1;several dozen meters, respectively, and are variable in accordance with the situation related to nearby vehicles.

At Step S<b>3</b>, the road information is used to determine whether or not a special road terrain exists in front of the subject vehicle. In a case that there is a special road terrain, the process proceeds to Step S<b>4</b>, and in a case that there are no special road terrains, the process proceeds to Step S<b>6</b>.

At Step S<b>4</b>, in accordance with the special road terrain, an optimal vehicle speed for improving the energy efficiency is calculated. For example, in a case that the subject vehicle is travelling on a downhill at a sag section, the target vehicle speed is corrected to increase, and in a case that the subject vehicle is travelling on an uphill thereafter, the target vehicle speed is corrected to decrease. Such correction is for increasing the target vehicle speed on the downhill, and travelling on the uphill efficiently by taking advantage of the inertia. Because the actual vehicle speed decreases on the uphill, it would be necessary to operate a driving portion of the subject vehicle promptly if the target vehicle speed remains unchanged after the downhill. However, by reducing the target vehicle speed on the uphill, the driving portion can be operated after the inertia is used effectively, and the energy efficiency can be enhanced. In addition, at the correction at Step S<b>4</b>, the correction is performed within the range of the tolerance as described above.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">At Step S<b>5</b>, curvature correction, and cant correction are implemented, the pre-set vehicle speed after corrected is output, and this procedure ends. At Step S<b>5</b>, the optimal vehicle speed that excels in the energy efficiency at Step S<b>4</b> is corrected to a vehicle speed at which the subject vehicle can travel safely based on the curvature and the cant. For example, in a case that a side slip occurs if the subject vehicle travels at the vehicle speed calculated at Step S<b>4</b>, the vehicle speed is corrected to a vehicle speed for preventing a side slip. At the correction at Step S<b>5</b>, the correction is performed within the range of the tolerance as mentioned before.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this manner, when a special road terrain exists ahead of the subject vehicle and no preceding vehicle <b>101</b> exists, the speed control section <b>43</b> performs speed control such that the speed of the subject vehicle <b>100</b> increases or decreases relative to the pre-set vehicle speed such that the energy efficiency is improved in the energy efficiency zone.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Next, speed control performed when a preceding vehicle <b>101</b> exists will be described.

A process depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is started when Step S<b>18</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is reached. At Step S<b>21</b>, it is determined whether or not fuel saving control is being implemented. In a case that fuel saving control is being implemented, the process proceeds to Step S<b>23</b>. In a case that fuel saving control is not being implemented, the process proceeds to Step S<b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0080">At Step S<b>22</b>, because the fuel saving control is not being implemented, but is waiting for being implemented or is not being implemented, vehicle speed correction based on acceleration/deceleration toward the target inter-vehicle distance is implemented, and this procedure ends. At Step S<b>23</b>, because the fuel saving control is being implemented, vehicle speed correction based on only deceleration toward the target inter-vehicle distance is implemented, and this procedure ends.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0081">In this manner, deceleration is performed only if the inter-vehicle distance is shorter than the target inter-vehicle distance while fuel saving control is being implemented, and acceleration is not performed if the inter-vehicle distance is equal to or longer than the target inter-vehicle distance. Because the fuel saving control is prioritized, only a functionality of the inter-vehicle distance maintenance for collision-prevention is enabled. Thereby, it is possible to maintain a safe inter-vehicle distance while prioritizing fuel saving control. In addition, if the fuel saving control is not being implemented, acceleration/deceleration control is performed such that a normal target inter-vehicle distance and target vehicle speed are maintained. Thereby, it is possible to make the vehicle speed close to the target vehicle speed while following the preceding vehicle <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0082">Next, specific vehicle speed control is explained using a timing chart. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an inter-vehicle distance maintenance control region and a fuel saving control region are set in accordance with an inter-vehicle distance. That is, if the inter-vehicle distance is equal to or shorter than the target inter-vehicle distance, the subject vehicle is under the inter-vehicle distance maintenance control region, and if the inter-vehicle distance is longer than the target inter-vehicle distance, the subject vehicle is under the fuel saving control region. In the inter-vehicle distance maintenance control region, acceleration/deceleration control for maintaining the inter-vehicle distance is implemented. In the fuel saving control region, acceleration/deceleration control for realizing fuel saving is implemented. In other words, if the inter-vehicle distance is equal to or shorter than the target inter-vehicle distance, inter-vehicle distance maintenance control is prioritized for safety, but if the inter-vehicle distance is longer than the target inter-vehicle distance, fuel saving control is prioritized.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0083">A timing chart depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts a case that there is a special road terrain which is a sag section located ahead of the subject vehicle, and there is also a preceding vehicle. At position P<b>1</b>, the special road terrain suitable for the fuel saving control is not sensed in terrain change assessment, and so pre-set inter-vehicle time h<sub>default </sub>which is a pre-set value is used. Here, the arrow of the terrain change assessment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is equivalent to a special road terrain sensible range. In the terrain change assessment, it is assessed whether there is a special road terrain within the range of sensing ahead of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0084">Thereafter, at position P<b>2</b>, the special road terrain suitable for the fuel saving control is sensed in the terrain change assessment. Accordingly, a long inter-vehicle time h<sub>long </sub>which is longer than the pre-set inter-vehicle time h<sub>default </sub>is set as the inter-vehicle time in preparation for future acceleration. Thereby, the inter-vehicle distance is artificially increased. In addition, because the special road terrain has been sensed, a road zone including the special road terrain is set as an energy efficiency zone. In addition, road zones before and after the energy efficiency zone are set as inter-vehicle distance maintenance zones.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0085">Thereafter, because the inter-vehicle distance increases, and, at position P<b>3</b>, the energy efficiency zone is reached, the inter-vehicle distance maintenance control region turns into the fuel saving control region, and control is then performed to maintain the minimum inter-vehicle distance necessary for collision-prevention. In the fuel saving control region, the inter-vehicle time is set to a short inter-vehicle time h<sub>short </sub>which is shorter than the pre-set inter-vehicle time h<sub>default</sub>. This is for setting the target inter-vehicle distance to the minimum inter-vehicle distance necessary for collision-prevention, and ensuring the largest fuel saving control region. In other words, this is speed control for minimizing a region of interference with a request to follow the preceding vehicle <b>101</b>. Thereby, the target vehicle speed becomes a value larger than the pre-set vehicle speed, and acceleration is enabled by making use of the downhill before the uphill.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0086">Thereafter, at position P<b>4</b>, the subject vehicle is travelling in the energy efficiency zone, and the fuel saving control continues. Because the subject vehicle has driven past the downhill at position P<b>4</b>, while the target vehicle speed is set to a speed slower than that on the downhill, the subject vehicle travels by inertia. Because the inertia is used, deceleration by braking to reach the target vehicle speed is not performed. In other words, speed control to improve energy efficiency using the inertia is implemented. Thereafter, because at position P<b>5</b>, the special road terrain suitable for the fuel saving control is not sensed in the terrain change assessment, and the energy efficiency zone has turned into the inter-vehicle distance maintenance zone, the fuel saving control region turns into the inter-vehicle distance maintenance control region and control for normal inter-vehicle distance maintenance is performed.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0087">A timing chart depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts a situation where there is a special road terrain which is an uphill road located ahead of the subject vehicle and there is also a preceding vehicle.

In the fuel saving control region, the inter-vehicle time is set to a short inter-vehicle time h<sub>short</sub>. This is for setting the target inter-vehicle distance to the minimum inter-vehicle distance necessary for collision-prevention, and ensuring the largest possible fuel saving control region.

This is because the subject vehicle travels on the uphill by the inertia. Thereafter, because at position P<b>15</b>, a special road terrain matching the fuel saving control is not sensed in the terrain change assessment, and the energy efficiency zone has turned into the inter-vehicle distance maintenance zone, the fuel saving control region turns into the inter-vehicle distance maintenance control region, and control for normal inter-vehicle distance maintenance is performed.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0091">A timing chart depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts a case that there is a special road terrain which is a curve located ahead of the vehicle, and there is also a preceding vehicle.

Thereby, the inter-vehicle distance is artificially reduced. In addition, because the special road terrain has been sensed, a road zone including the special road terrain is set as an energy efficiency zone. In addition, road zones before and after the energy efficiency zone are set as inter-vehicle distance maintenance zones.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0093">Thereafter, because the inter-vehicle distance decreases, and, at position P<b>23</b>, the energy efficiency zone is reached, the inter-vehicle distance maintenance control region turns into the fuel saving control region, and control is then performed to maintain the minimum inter-vehicle distance necessary for collision-prevention.

Thereafter, because at position P<b>25</b>, a special road terrain matching the fuel saving control is not sensed in the terrain change assessment, and the energy efficiency zone has turned into the inter-vehicle distance maintenance zone, the fuel saving control region turns into the inter-vehicle distance maintenance control region, and control for normal inter-vehicle distance maintenance is performed.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0095">In the manner as described above, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, if there is no special road terrain located ahead, and additionally there is a preceding vehicle <b>101</b>, the vehicle control apparatus <b>21</b> according to the present embodiment performs the speed control such that the vehicle speed becomes the pre-set vehicle speed while maintaining the subject vehicle with an inter-vehicle distance that is longer than the pre-set inter-vehicle distance.
