Other features will be apparent from the description, drawings, and from the claims.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the following description of embodiments of the invention, specific details are described in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the instant description.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, a method for evaluating a driving behavior is provided, wherein detected driving data of at least one human driver, or detected driving data of at least one automated driving vehicle are obtained, wherein based on the received driving data, an key performance indicator is determined, wherein both a travel time as well as an energy efficiency and/or emissions efficiency are taken into account in determining the key performance indicator, wherein the determined key performance indicator is provided as an evaluation result.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore and in some embodiments, a system for evaluating a driving behavior is provided, comprising a detector and an evaluation circuit, wherein the detector is configured for detecting and/or receiving driving data of at least one human driver while driving a vehicle, or driving data of at least one automated driving vehicle while driving, wherein the evaluation circuit is configured for determining a key performance indicator based on the detected and/or received driving data, and to take into account while determining the key performance indicator both a travel time as well as an energy efficiency and/or emissions efficiency, and for providing the determined key performance indicator as an evaluation result.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The method and the system may make it possible to quantitatively evaluate a driving behavior of a human driver or of an automated driving vehicle based on detected driving data. For this purpose, driving data may be detected particularly on trips or respectively in situations in which the automated driving vehicle is in control, i.e., in which an action executed by the automated driving vehicle affects a subsequent situation. Furthermore, driving data may be detected of at least one human driver who manually controls a vehicle (comparable with regard to the properties) on trip routes. In some embodiments, driving data from a plurality of human drivers may be detected, and used within the scope of the method. A key performance indicator may be determined based on the received driving data of the at least one human driver, or the received driving data of the at least one automated driving vehicle. In determining the key performance indicator, both a travel time as well as an energy efficiency and/or emissions efficiency may be taken into account. In this context, the energy efficiency refers to an efficiency in energy conversion (&#x201c;energy consumption&#x201d;). In this context, the emissions efficiency refers particularly to an efficiency in the emission of pollutants, particularly of carbon dioxide and/or fine particulate (e.g., caused by combustion residues and/or abrasion). The determined key performance indicator is provided as an evaluation result, for example as an analog or digital signal, for example as a digital data packet.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A benefit of the method and of the system may be that both a travel time as well as an energy efficiency and/or emissions efficiency are taken into account during the evaluation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another benefit of the method and of the system may be that a driving behavior of an automated driving vehicle may be evaluated in relation to a travel time and an energy efficiency and/or emissions efficiency under real use conditions, i.e., while the automated driving vehicle has full control over a situation occurrence.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The driving data in some embodiments comprise a travel time, a driven route, and values of a longitudinal acceleration. The route or respectively trip route may be divided into route segments or trip route segments with associated travel times. The driving data are detected particularly on a plurality of trip routes.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this disclosure, the evaluation of a driving behavior of an automated driving vehicle refers in some embodiments to an evaluation of a driving behavior of a control and/or regulation system of the automated driving vehicle, which may also be referred to as a Self Driving System (SDS), and generally comprises a central controller (processor). In the interests of simplicity, however, only the term automated driving vehicle is used in the scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A vehicle is for example a motor vehicle. However, in principle, the vehicle may be another land, rail, water, air or space vehicle, such as an air taxi or a drone.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, an operational domain is an Operational Design Domain (ODD). In this context, the operational domain refers to a type of an environment through which the vehicle must be controlled. The operational domain may relate to the following properties, for example: a type of road, an average speed, a presence or absence of traffic lights, a traffic density, a type and a number of other traffic participants (e.g., taxis, buses, trucks, etc.), a time of day, a day of the week, a season, a storm, a region, a country, etc. Furthermore, a type and a number of obstacles and/or situations to complete (e.g., intersection, left turn, right turn, change lanes, pass, etc.) may also be taken into account. An operational domain in some embodiments forms a type of reference territory or reference environment that is selected particularly as representative for continually recurring territories, environments, and/or data domains of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Parts of the system, for example the detector and/or the evaluation circuit, may be formed individually or collectively as a combination of hardware and software, for example as program code that is executed on a microcontroller or microprocessor. However, it is also possible for the parts to be designed individually or collectively as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and/or field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The term &#x2018;processor&#x2019; is used in the following collectively for the aforesaid options.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, it is provided that for the driving data of at least one human driver and/or for driving data of at least one automated driving vehicle, determined key performance indicators are compared to one another, for example in pairs, wherein a comparison result is provided as an evaluation result. Determined key performance indicators may thereby be compared to one another, so that for example a driving behavior of an automated driving vehicle (or respectively of the SDS) may be compared to a driving behavior of a human driver and/or to a driving behavior of another automated driving vehicle (or respectively of the SDS). In this context, it may for example be provided that the driving behavior of at least one human driver is used, wherein it is for example intended that an automated driving vehicle drives at least as well as the at least one human driver, for example, in relation to the key performance indicator, for example in relation to a travel time and an energy efficiency and/or emissions efficiency.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In this context, it is not necessary for the driving data on which the comparison is based of the at least one human driver and/or of the at least one automated driving vehicle to be detected on the same trip routes, but rather may also originate from different trip routes. For example, the environments and situations in which the driving data are detected (or were detected), however, must be comparable to one another, i.e., they must have been detected in the same operational (design) domain in order to lend validity to the comparative result.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, it is provided that the key performance indicator is determined for various operational domains, and respectively provided as an evaluation result dependent of the operational domain. Thereby a driving behavior may be evaluated in dependence of the operational domain. Similar to how it is usual with regard to information about fuel consumption of vehicles, this allows differentiation based on operational domains, for example, evaluating the driving behavior in the following operational domains: city, country and &#x201c;combined&#x201d; or rural road, highway, city.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, it is provided that a sum of travel times of all trip routes taken into account is used as a measure for the travel time. This makes it possible for example to evaluate the driving behavior over longer routes and independently of a specific traveled route. For example, the sum may be normalized so that even travel times for routes of differing length may be compared to one another. For example, the travel time may be taken into account by means of the following expression:</p><p id="p-0026" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <mi>L</mi>   <mrow>    <mi>T</mi>    <mo>&#xb7;</mo>    <mrow>     <semantics definitionURL="">      <mo>&#x2758;</mo>      <annotation encoding="Mathematica">"\[LeftBracketingBar]"</annotation>     </semantics>     <mi>R</mi>     <semantics definitionURL="">      <mo>&#x2758;</mo>      <annotation encoding="Mathematica">"\[RightBracketingBar]"</annotation>     </semantics>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>&#x2062;</mo>  <mrow>   <munder>    <mo>&#x2211;</mo>    <mrow>     <mi>r</mi>     <mo>&#x2208;</mo>     <mi>R</mi>    </mrow>   </munder>   <mfrac>    <msub>     <mi>t</mi>     <mi>r</mi>    </msub>    <msub>     <mi>l</mi>     <mi>r</mi>    </msub>   </mfrac>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0027" num="0000">where:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0025">L a total length of all referenced trip routes r,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0026">T a total travel time for completing all referenced trip routes r,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0027">R a quantity of all referenced trip routes r,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0028">|R| a number of the referenced trip routes r,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0029">r a trip route from the quantity of all referenced trip routes R,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0030">t<sub>r </sub>a travel time required for completing the trip route r,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0031">l<sub>r </sub>a length of the trip route r.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0028" num="0032">The prefactor serves for normalization, so that the expression may only assume values between 0 and 1.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0033">In some embodiments, it is provided that a sum of all positive longitudinal accelerations on all trip routes taken into account is used as a measure for the energy efficiency and/or emissions efficiency. An energy efficiency and/or emissions efficiency may thereby be taken into account in a simple manner, since frequent and significant acceleration in the longitudinal direction converts more energy and/or produces more emissions (pollutants) as less frequent and less significant acceleration. This sum may also be normalized. For example, the energy efficiency and/or emissions efficiency may be taken into account by means of the following expression:</p><p id="p-0030" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00002" num="00002"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <mi>T</mi>   <mrow>    <mi>L</mi>    <mo>&#xb7;</mo>    <mrow>     <semantics definitionURL="">      <mo>&#x2758;</mo>      <annotation encoding="Mathematica">"\[LeftBracketingBar]"</annotation>     </semantics>     <mi>R</mi>     <semantics definitionURL="">      <mo>&#x2758;</mo>      <annotation encoding="Mathematica">"\[RightBracketingBar]"</annotation>     </semantics>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>&#x2062;</mo>  <mrow>   <munder>    <mo>&#x2211;</mo>    <mrow>     <mi>r</mi>     <mo>&#x2208;</mo>     <mi>R</mi>    </mrow>   </munder>   <mrow>    <munderover>     <mo>&#x2211;</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>t</mi>      <mo>=</mo>      <mn>0</mn>     </mrow>     <msub>      <mi>t</mi>      <mi>r</mi>     </msub>    </munderover>    <mtext> </mtext>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <mi>max</mi>      <mo>&#x2061;</mo>      <mo>(</mo>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <msub>         <mi>a</mi>         <mi>r</mi>        </msub>        <mo>(</mo>        <mi>t</mi>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>       <mo>,</mo>       <mn>0</mn>      </mrow>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mi>&#x394;</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mi>t</mi>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0031" num="0000">where (aside from the previously introduced values):<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0034">&#x3b1;<sub>r</sub>(t) a measured acceleration figure at time point t,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0035">&#x394;t a time interval in which a measured value is detected (measurement period).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0032" num="0036">The prefactor serves for normalization, so that the expression may only assume values between 0 and 1.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0037">In some embodiments, it is provided that the travel time and the energy efficiency and/or emissions efficiency is weighted when taken into account for determining the key performance indicator.

Historical driving data may thereby be taken into account and made useful in determining the key performance indicator. Such historical driving data may also be derived from (enriched) road maps, for example. They usually contain not only static attributes, such as a maximum speed or a number of lanes, but rather additionally also speed profiles, as the case may be, e.g., floating car data (typically depending on day and time of day, or respectively resolved according to day and time of day). Based on these data, for example, an actual travel time for a road segment or trip route segment may be determined. An average speed may be determined based on the actual travel time and a length of an associated segment. A change of speed relative to the next segment may be used to determine an average acceleration.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040">In some embodiments, it is provided that the driving data, at least in part, are detected during a real trip of at least one human driver and/or an automated driving vehicle. Driving data may thereby be detected in real occurring situations, and made useful for determining the key performance indicators. The driving data may also be evaluated for subsequent simulations, to collect and/or determine true-to-reality parameters for the simulation. During a real trip, for example framework conditions are qualitatively registered: a traffic density, a type and a number of traffic participants, as well as additional potential disruptive influences. In parallel thereto, a length of each trip route taken (or segment thereof) into account is determined, and a travel time required for it is detected (measured). Similarly, values of a longitudinal acceleration are detected at regular time intervals. It may be for example provided that real trips are performed by a pool of drivers, to obtain driving data for an averaged human driving behavior in this manner. For this purpose, the drivers are or will be selected such that they are representative for a subsequent user group of the automated driving vehicle.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0041">In some embodiments, it is provided that the driving data, at least in part, are detected during a simulation trip of the at least one human driver and/or the automated driving vehicle. An effort may be thereby reduced for detecting the driving data as well as for the driving data of the at least one human driver as well as for the driving data of the automated driving vehicle, since the same routes may be driven through multiple times in simulation without great effort, for example. Moreover, situations that only rarely occur in reality may also be simulated. The simulation trips may be performed particularly based on parameter values that were determined within the scope of performed real trips and/or based on recorded driving data. It may be provided, for example, that the simulation is generated based on detected driving data and/or recorded driving data, for example, in that parameters (course of the route, traffic density, etc.) of simulated situations along a simulated route are determined based on these detected and/or recorded driving data. Here also, a pool of human drivers may be provided to obtain driving data for an averaged human driving behavior in this manner. For this purpose, the drivers may be particularly selected such that they are representative for a subsequent user group of the automated driving vehicle. The simulated trips are performed particularly in operational domains that are representative for a subsequent application region of the automated driving vehicle.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0042">Depending on how the input data of the automated driving vehicle have to be provided to perform the simulation trips, the following options result: If the automated driving vehicle (i.e., the SDS) is expecting object lists from an environment model as input information, it is sufficient in the scope of the simulation to emulate a time change of entries of the environment model about the respective trip route to be completed based on the recorded environment model information from the real trips. If the automated driving vehicle (i.e., the SDS) is expecting sensor data as input signals, because a sensor data fusion is performed for an internal environment model, for example, the sensor data must be emulated based on the real trips. The automated driving vehicle (i.e., the SDS) completes the trip routes in the simulator. A number of the trips is ideally selected so that they are statistically representative. The length of each route is identified during these trips and a travel time respectively required for it is detected (measured) or determined. Similarly, values of a longitudinal acceleration are determined at periodical time intervals. To make the values thus detected and/or determined plausible, they should be compared with the respective values from the real trips. The simulation parameters may also be adjusted, if applicable.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0043">In some embodiments, it is provided that a drive comfort is additionally taken into account in determining the key performance indicator. The drive comfort may thereby be represented in the key performance indicator and used for evaluation of the driving behavior of the at least one human driver and/or of the automated driving vehicle. A comfort may also be determined, for example, additionally or alternatively to a longitudinal acceleration, based on a transverse acceleration, since generally the experienced comfort is that much greater, the lower a transverse acceleration is. The travel time, the energy efficiency, and/or emissions efficiency, and the comfort, are particularly taken into account as weighted. This makes it possible to individually set a respective influence on the key performance indicators.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0044">In the following, the invention is explained in greater detail based on further exemplary embodiments and with reference to the FIGS.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0045">Specific references to components, process steps, and other elements are not intended to be limiting.
