More particularly, the present disclosure is related to a dental positioning appliance having one or more metallic portions.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many orthodontic treatments involve repositioning misaligned teeth and changing bite configurations for improved dental function and cosmetic appearance. Repositioning can be accomplished, for example, by applying controlled forces to one or more teeth over a period of time.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some orthodontic processes use removable positioning appliances for realigning teeth. Such appliances may utilize a thin shell of material having resilient properties, (an individual appliance is referred to as an &#x201c;aligner&#x201d;) whereby each appliance generally conforms to a patient's teeth but is slightly out of alignment with the initial tooth configuration.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Placement of such an appliance over the teeth can provide controlled forces in specific locations to gradually move the teeth into a new configuration. Repetition of this process with successive appliances that provide progressive configurations eventually move the teeth through a series of intermediate arrangements to a final desired arrangement. An example of such a system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,975,893.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such systems typically utilize materials that provide light weight and/or transparent appliances in a set that can be used serially such that as the teeth move, a new appliance can be implemented to further move the teeth. Such features may be beneficial in many instances, however, in some instances, it may be desirable to provide movement with less appliances, thereby reducing modeling and manufacturing costs as well as reducing the number of appliances the user has to utilize and keep track of, among other benefits. Additionally, if the appliance is designed to treat a smaller number of teeth within a patient's mouth, then it may be difficult to create a sufficient anchoring force or motive force with a plastic material used to form many such appliances that would be used to make the movements to the teeth that are desired.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a lower jaw of a subject together with an example of a dental positioning adjustment appliance embodiment according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates a cut away view of the appliance of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> taken along line <b>1</b>B-<b>1</b>B.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a lower jaw of a subject together with an example of several dental positioning adjustment appliance embodiments according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates a cut away view of one of the appliance embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> taken along line <b>2</b>B-<b>2</b>B.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates a cut away view of another appliance embodiment taken along a similar line as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of a mechanism that could be used to form one or more appliance embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a process for forming an appliance according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a general method for forming an appliance according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a method for forming an appliance according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the present disclosure, appliances and methods are provided for utilizing metallic portions in dental positioning appliances. In some embodiments, a removable dental positioning appliance has a shell with one or more cavities shaped to receive and reposition one or more teeth from a first orientation to a successive orientation and where at least a portion of the shell is formed from a metallic material (e.g., metallic mesh material). In various embodiments, the shell can be shaped to accommodate one tooth or multiple adjacent or nonadjacent teeth based upon the number and position of the one or more cavities that form the one or more portions of the shell.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a lower jaw of a subject together with an example of a dental positioning adjustment appliance embodiment according to the present disclosure. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the appliance <b>100</b> includes a mesh made out of a metallic material <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In various embodiments, the metallic material can be a planar sheet of material, strips of material, or one or more wires, among other material configurations and can be in a mesh, solid, perforated, layered, adjacently oriented, or other type of configuration. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the appliance is formed by one or more wires arranged in an overlapping pattern to form a mesh.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, a single wire can be woven to form the mesh. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, multiple vertical wires <b>112</b> are provided. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, multiple horizontal wires <b>114</b> are also provided. In various embodiments, as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the wires can be laid over each other and/or woven together.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As will be discussed in greater detail herein, the wires can be unfastened or can be fastened together in various manners. For example, the wires can be frictionally held together such as by weaving or tying, or held together by another material, such as solder, plastic, and/or an adhesive material among other suitable materials. In some embodiments, these materials can be coated onto or encapsulating around a portion of (e.g., such as the junctions <b>116</b> or other portions of wires <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) or an entire wire or the mesh as will be discussed in more detail herein.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The methods of the present disclosure can employ any positioners, retainers, and/or other removable appliances for finishing and maintaining teeth positions in connection with orthodontic treatment. The systems for use with embodiments of the present disclosure provide a plurality of such appliances can be intended to be worn by a patient successively in order to achieve the gradual tooth repositioning as described herein.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In such embodiments, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an appliance <b>100</b> can, for example, be fabricated from a shell having at least a portion formed from a metallic material. In various embodiments, the metallic material can be utilized to provide a resilient functionality sufficient to move at least one tooth.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the metallic portion is utilized to form a cavity shaped to receive and resiliently reposition one or more teeth from one teeth arrangement to a successive teeth arrangement. The shell may be designed to fit over a number of, in many instances all teeth, present in the upper or lower jaw <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some situations, certain individual or small sets of the teeth can be repositioned while others of the teeth can be used to provide a base or anchor region for holding the repositioning appliance in place as it applies the resilient repositioning force against the tooth or teeth to be repositioned. In some embodiments, the metallic portion of the shell can be oriented to provide additional support with respect to holding the appliance in place. Such embodiments can aid in stabilizing one or more teeth.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Such orientation can be beneficial, for example, where the tooth or teeth used as an anchor may have been recently moved and may not provide as much support as teeth that have not been moved. Such orientation can also be beneficial, for example, where a larger anchoring force may be needed than can typically be provided by the number of teeth being used as the anchor. In such instances, the metallic portion can be placed at or near the tooth or teeth used for anchor to provide support and/or force to provide the anchoring functionality.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In various embodiments, the metallic portion of the appliance can be oriented to provide the repositioning force whereby a plastic shell portion of the appliance provides a stabilizing anchoring support for the device. This orientation enables the conformation of the shell portion to adapt to the anchoring teeth and depending on the metal properties selected, a greater effective range for force generation on the repositioning portion of the appliance.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates a cut away view of the appliance of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> taken along line <b>1</b>B-<b>1</b>B. In this illustration, the mesh structure of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> can be observed more closely.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the appliance <b>100</b> includes a number of wires forming a mesh pattern <b>110</b>. The wires illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> include a number of generally vertical wires <b>112</b> and a number of generally horizontal wires <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In various embodiments, the wires may be in different orientations, such as, but not limited to, non-horizontal and/or non-vertical, and/or irregular. Further, in some embodiments, the wires may be non-linear. For example, a wire may be bent in one direction (e.g., one axis with respect to an axis of the elongation direction of the wire), as shown with respect to wires <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, or more than one direction (e.g., in two axial directions with respect to the axis of elongation of the wire).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The wires may include alternating active and passive wires, in some embodiments. In other words, varying wire materials may be present within the mesh.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Non-metallic wires may be incorporated into the mesh for additional support or improved esthetics, among other benefits. For example, metal fibers may be alternated with composite fibers to create a hybrid mesh.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the vertical wires <b>112</b> are layered over the horizontal wires <b>114</b>. As stated above, however, in various embodiments, the wires (e.g., <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>) may be woven together such as in an alternating over-under type pattern.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In embodiments, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the wires form a number of junctions <b>116</b> where the wires cross each other. As discussed above, the wires can, in some embodiments, be fastened together at these junction points. The fastening can be accomplished, for example, by a mechanical bracket type fastener, tied together, or by some type of bond being formed. Bonding mechanisms can include, for example, resins, adhesives, solder, polymers, and other materials that can be used to connect two wires together.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a lower jaw of a subject together with an example of several dental positioning adjustment appliance embodiments according to the present disclosure. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the appliance <b>200</b> includes a number of metallic portions <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, and <b>224</b>. In some embodiments, these portions could each be a separate (or part of a separate) dental appliance.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the portions <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, and <b>224</b> are part of a one piece shell <b>200</b> that has other portions formed from an other material than the metallic material of portions <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, and <b>224</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the metallic material is a mesh material <b>210</b> which can, for example, be formed by wires or strips of material, by a sheet of material with holes punched therein, or in other manners. The other material described above can be any suitable material for coating and/or connecting to the one or more metallic portions <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, and/or <b>224</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> includes tooth structures <b>220</b> and <b>224</b> that where each of the teeth is reinforced with metallic material <b>210</b> that spans at least the buccal and mesial surfaces. Such embodiments can be useful for a variety of purposes. For example, the mesh material can be used to further aid in anchoring a tooth.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The mesh material can be used to apply extra force to a particular tooth and/or to extend the ability of the appliance to move the tooth. Depending upon the type of material used to form the mesh, the distance of the movement of the tooth can be elongated, because the force imparted by the metallic material may be over a greater distance than other materials, such as some polymers and other materials.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In various embodiments, the length of time that the movement can take place can be elongated because the metallic material may not lose its ability to impart force as readily as some other materials, such as some polymers and other materials. In some embodiments, the length of time that movement of a tooth takes may be reduced because the metallic material can impart either a greater force or more consistent force over a greater range of movement than some other materials, such as some polymers.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, a portion includes a metallic material. In this embodiment, the portion <b>222</b> includes a metallic mesh material that is provided on a surface (e.g., lingual) that is typically not visible to a person looking at the patient's mouth and therefore, this may be a desirable embodiment for such situations. The use of a metallic portion on one or more selected surfaces, such as is shown in the portion <b>222</b> of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> can also be used, for example, to impart a particular force on the tooth (e.g., anchoring force, movement force, etc.). It should be noted that in some embodiments, the metallic material can be placed between two teeth which may provide an anchoring force or movement force to one or both of the teeth.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, as will be discussed in more detail herein, portions of or the entire appliance can be coated with a second material. This second material can be used to form the other portions (i.e., the portions other than <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, and <b>224</b>) of the dental appliance described above, in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In various embodiments, the second material could be a coating over, under, or encapsulating the portions <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, and <b>224</b>. Materials that can be used can include solders, epoxies, glues, polymers, oxides, and other suitable coating materials. In various embodiments, the materials may be bio-compatible materials.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Coatings can provide, for example, a more palatable texture, interaction with tooth surfaces, and/or taste than the metallic material, among other benefits. Another benefit may be that the coating can be used to hold one or more of the wires (e.g., wires <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), forming the mesh, in place. Another benefit can be that a second material may be more pleasing to the eye than the metallic material and therefore, may be more desirable to be used in viewable areas of the oral environment, such as the buccal, occlusal, and/or mesial surfaces of a tooth or teeth, among other surfaces.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates a cut away view of one of the appliance embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> taken along line <b>2</b>B-<b>2</b>B.

It should be noted that such an illustration may be representative of an entire appliance that is fabricated from a metallic material and encapsulated within a second material or where a portion of an appliance is fabricated with a metallic material and where that portion is encapsulated.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, in some embodiments, the appliance may be formed mostly from a polymeric material and where a metallic material is encapsulated in a portion. Such embodiments may aid in reinforcing or providing additional force to a particular area.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The metallic material, such as a metallic mesh material can be formed by metal injection molding, by casting (which may include heat-treatment post-casting), by stamping the appliance using a stamp, by pressing and/or heat treating with a mold, or by bending individual metallic portions (e.g., wires) and/or soldering the individual wire components together, among other techniques. In some embodiments, the metallic material may be arch-preformed.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the metallic material may be friction shaped through a pressing or other type of process wherein the material is shaped through a friction involving process. In various embodiments, the metallic material may be ultrasonically heated to maintain or obtain a desired shape.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, once the shape is formed, the metallic material can be coated with a second material. For example, in some embodiments, the coating can be sprayed or dip coated onto the metallic material. In various embodiments, the appliance can be cut (e.g., by a mechanical cutting tool or laser cutting tool) to trim the edges.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the computing device executable instructions for the cutting tool may be programmed to cut at mesh junctions to avoid sharp points in the final product. In some embodiments, the appliance may be dipped in a coating to cover any sharp edges, among other sharp edge solutions.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">There are several processes that can be used to form the appliance or portion thereof having metallic material. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> illustrate two such ways and discussion is provided about some other processes that may be utilized.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of a mechanism that could be used to form one or more appliance embodiments of the present disclosure. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a portion of a mechanism <b>303</b> is illustrated that can be used to form a portion of the shape of an appliance such as those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the forming of an appliance from a metal sheet of material <b>330</b>. It will be understood that this sheet of material could be a sheet of mesh material or other type of metallic or partially metallic material.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In a process such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, an appliance having metallic material can be pressed over a mold using a positive or, in some cases, a negative shape in a desired configuration. In some embodiments, metallic material can be sandwiched into a multi-piece forming mechanism (e.g., a number of dies), to press and/or hold the metallic material in a desired shape.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the forming mechanism <b>303</b> includes several portions, namely portions <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, <b>336</b>, and <b>338</b>. These at least some of these portions move toward one another to bend the sheet of material <b>330</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, changes in temperature of the environment around the mechanism <b>303</b>, of the portions <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, <b>336</b>, and/or <b>338</b> and/or the material <b>330</b> can be used to create the desired shape and/or force properties of the appliance or portion being formed. In various embodiments, some portion of the forming mechanism <b>303</b> or the entire mechanism can be formed from a metallic or ceramic material.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Where a shape memory type material is used as material <b>330</b>, then, a change in temperature or stress can be applied to the material <b>330</b> to produce the desired shape and/or force characteristics of the appliance or portion being formed. For instance, in some embodiments, the metallic material can be a shape memory alloy formed at least in part from nickel, titanium, copper, aluminum, and/or zinc, among other materials.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In such embodiments and as stated above, the metallic material may be coated for esthetics and/or hygiene among other considerations. In such embodiments, the amount of movement built in can, for example, be based on the amount of distortion that can be tolerated to still ensure appliance fit.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a process for forming an appliance according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an appliance or portion thereof can be formed over a positive model <b>444</b> of a desired shape, using a carrier material <b>440</b> to enable formation of the metallic material (e.g., metallic mesh material) <b>442</b> around the desired shape <b>444</b>. The metallic material <b>442</b> can then be set, for example, with high heat. The carrier material <b>440</b> can then be removed by any suitable manner.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">One suitable manner, for example, may be that the carrier material <b>440</b> is a dissolvable material, which can be removed by dissolving with a solvent such as water, organic solvent, or other solvent types. In some embodiments, the carrier <b>440</b> may be a wax which can be melted or burned off.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Another process for creating appliance embodiments or portions thereof may be to bend the individual ribs in a mesh material and then to assemble the individual ribs with connecting wire and solder or otherwise attach the framework together.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Various embodiments of the present disclosure can enable a longer range of movement to be built into an appliance without increasing the amount of force placed on the teeth. In other words, through use of shape memory alloy materials, for example, it may be possible for an appliance to provide the movement of 5 to 10 polymeric appliances without increasing patient discomfort and/or negative biological effects of high force on the one or more teeth.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As a result of such embodiments, fewer appliances may have to be built, thereby reducing materials costs and/or visits to the treatment professional, among other benefits. Another possible benefit is because the material is metallic it may be easier to disinfect an appliance, in some instances.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a method of forming a removable dental positioning appliance according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.
