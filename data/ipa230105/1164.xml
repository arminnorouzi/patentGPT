The preferred method for treating hydrocephalus includes a catheter-based shunting device to drain the excess cerebrospinal fluid into the abdominal cavity or and/cardiovascular system. Although this type of treatment has been used for more than 60 years, the design still suffers from a low lifespan, particularly due to obstruction occurring in the ventricular catheter of a system. Shunt obstructions can cause headaches, vomiting, drowsiness, papilledema, thoracic back pain, neck stiffness, blindness and even death. Thus, when obstruction of a catheter occurs, the shunt is replaced. However, the shunt is replaced during an additional invasive brain surgery, which can result in a serious brain hemorrhage and infection, endangering a patient's life.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">While ventricular catheters, and other catheters placed in fluid communication with the cerebrospinal fluid space, may be obstructed by a number of different tissues, choroid plexus and glial tissue, which includes astrocytes, are the major causes for the obstruction of ventricular catheters. Further, while investigating the response of astrocytes under fluid shear stress in vitro, the inventors found that fluid shear stress was capable of mitigating the growth of astrocytes. Accordingly, the Inventors have recognized the benefits associated with a ventricular catheter designed such that a wall shear stress inside the ventricular catheter during flow is enhanced so that the adhesion and/or ingrowth of astrocytes and/or other types of tissue within the ventricular catheter is reduced and/or substantially eliminated. Specifically, in some embodiments, the construction of a ventricular catheter may be optimized such that a wall shear stress within the holes and internal lumen of the catheter under a predetermined flow rate through the catheter may be greater than a predetermined threshold shear stress that is selected to prevent the adhesion and/or growth of tissue within the catheter. Thus, the disclosed systems may provide wall shear stresses on the inner surfaces of the catheter that are sufficiently high to reduce, or substantially prevent, obstructions forming in a ventricular catheter during use.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Based on the above, the Inventors have recognized that prior systems have focused on preventing obstruction by large tissue such as choroid plexus, rather than astrocytes. Thus, to hinder the entrapment of large tissue, such as choroid plexus (blood vessels in the brain), prior catheter designs sought to homogenize flow rates across the holes of a catheter by controlling the hole geometries to provide uniform volumetric flow across the catheter's length. However, this approach would not result in the attenuation of glial tissue infiltration, as the approach does not consider wall shear stress control. Instead, tissue infiltration, adhesion, and growth within a ventricular catheter may be reduced by manipulating geometric parameters of a ventricular catheter to achieve sufficiently enhanced wall shear stresses along the surfaces of the holes and internal lumen of the catheter. For example, design parameters that may be used to control the wall shear stress within a catheter may include, but are not limited to, appropriate combinations of hole spacing, hole depth, hole transverse dimension, internal lumen transverse dimension, exterior surface transverse dimension, and others. It should be appreciated that geometric parameters other than those noted above may be used to provide a minimum threshold wall shear stress along the length of a catheter.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In view of the above, in some embodiments, a catheter may include a tube with a plurality of holes disposed along at least a portion of a length of the tube. The holes may extend from an exterior surface to an internal lumen of the tube such that the surrounding environment is fluidly connected to the internal lumen of the tube through the holes. A fluid, such as cerebrospinal fluid, flowing from the surrounding environment, through the holes, into the internal lumen, and out of a distal end of the catheter may result in a wall shear stress being applied to the various interior surfaces of the holes and internal lumen. The fluid may flow through the catheter with an average predetermined flow rate. Further, the holes and internal lumen of the tube may be configured using appropriate parameters such as hole depth, hole transverse dimension, internal lumen transverse dimension, lumen length, and/or other appropriate parameters to provide a minimum wall shear stress along the interior surfaces of the holes and internal lumen when the fluid flows through the catheter at the average predetermined flow rate. As noted above, this minimum wall shear stress may be greater than a threshold shear stress to reduce, or substantially prevent, the adhesion and/or growth of brain cells, such as astrocytes, within the catheter.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In view of the above, the various parameters of a catheter design including hole and internal lumen dimensions, as well as the overall hole arrangement along a catheter, may be balanced to provide a desired minimum threshold wall shear stress under a predetermined average flow of cerebrospinal fluid through the catheter. For example, parameters that may be considered include: a ratio between a hole transverse dimension (e.g. diameter) to a lumen transverse dimension; the ratio between a hole depth and a spacing interval between adjacent holes; and/or any other appropriate ratio or parameter. Specifically, and without wishing to be bound by theory, as the ratio of a hole transverse dimension to a lumen transverse dimension decreases, the relative wall shear stress within the overall system may increase. Additionally, without wishing to be bound by theory, as the ratio of a hole depth to a spacing interval between holes increases, the overall average wall shear stress within the holes and lumen may also be increased. Thus, by balancing the depth, transverse dimensions, spacing, and/or length using the above concepts and/or other appropriate design parameters, an overall catheter design may be optimized to provide a desired minimum wall shear stress that is greater than a threshold wall shear stress along a length of the catheter in both the holes and internal lumen of the catheter. Again, this may help to reduce, or substantially prevent, brain tissue cells, such as astrocytes, from forming obstructions in the catheter.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In typical ventricular catheters, a constant hole depth is used along a length of the catheter and the hole diameters are varied to provide a uniform flow of fluid into the holes along a length of the catheter. However, as elaborated on below, such a construction results in very large uncontrolled variations in wall shear stress along a length of the catheter. Thus, in some embodiments, at least one hole of the plurality of holes located along a length of a catheter may have a depth that is different from a depth of the remaining holes. Further, in some of the embodiments, the plurality of holes may exhibit a plurality of different depths depending on the particular design. These differences in depths of the holes along a length of the catheter may be balanced with the transverse dimensions of the associated holes and/or other design parameters to provide a desired wall shear stress within each hole that is greater than a predetermined threshold shear stress as noted above. Further, in some embodiments, a depth of the holes may vary sequentially along the length of the catheter such that multiple holes, and in certain embodiments all of the holes, exhibit different depths that vary sequentially along a length of the catheter. In such an embodiment, sequentially located holes may show sequential changes in hole depth. Though instances where sequential portions of a catheter may show changes in hole depth are also contemplated. For example, a first set of holes located within a first portion of the catheter may have a first depth and a second set of holes located within a second portion of the catheter may have a second depth that is different from the first depth. In either case, the resulting catheters may exhibit flow that has been optimized to provide a desired wall shear stress behavior during operation as compared to providing just a uniform flow through the holes as is typical in other ventricular catheters. However, embodiments in which the hole transverse dimensions, and other parameters, are balanced to provide both the desired minimum wall shear stress as well as substantially uniform flow through adjacent holes are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As noted above, the hole depths may vary along a length of a catheter, in combination with other appropriate parameters, to provide a desired wall shear stress within the holes of a catheter and internal lumen. Accordingly, it should be understood that the differences in hole depths may be provided in any appropriate manner. For example, in one embodiment, a hole depth along a length of the catheter may be provided by modifying a transverse dimension of the internal lumen relative to a constant transverse dimension of the catheter's outer surface. Specifically, by increasing or decreasing the transverse dimension of one or more portions of the internal lumen relative to the transverse dimension of the outer surface, a hole depth may be controlled. The hole depth may also be controlled by increasing or decreasing the transverse dimension of one or more portions of an exterior surface of a catheter relative to a constant transverse dimension of the catheter internal lumen. Of course, embodiments in which hole depths along a length of a catheter are controlled using one or both of these strategies are contemplated as the disclosure is not limited to how the depths of the holes are provided.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Using the various embodiments of a catheter described herein, cerebrospinal fluid may be drained from a ventricular space of a brain by inserting a catheter into a location fluidly connected to the ventricular space of a subject's brain including, for example, direct implantation in the ventricular space, implantation into locations connected to the ventricular space such as a cisternal spaces, and/or any other appropriate location within a subject's cerebrospinal fluid space. As noted above, the catheter may include a tube with a plurality of holes disposed along a length and extending from an exterior surface to an internal lumen of a tube of the catheter. Cerebrospinal fluid may be drained from the ventricular space through the catheter resulting in flow through the holes and internal lumen of the catheter. The plurality of holes and the internal lumen of the tube may be configured such that a wall shear stress applied to the interior surfaces of the holes and the internal lumen during flow of the cerebrospinal fluid through the catheter is greater than a threshold shear stress to prevent cell adhesion and/or growth of tissue within the catheter.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the various embodiments described herein, a threshold wall shear stress can correspond to any appropriate range of threshold wall shear stresses that is appropriate to reduce and/or substantially prevent the adhesion and/or growth of tissue within a catheter. For example, in some embodiments, a threshold wall shear stress within the various portions of a ventricular catheter under a predetermined flow rate may be greater than or equal to 1.0 mPa, 2.0 mPa, 5.0 mPa, and/or any other appropriate threshold wall shear stress. Correspondingly, the threshold wall shear stress may be less than or equal to 10.0 mPa, 7.5 mPa, 5.0 mPa, and/or any other appropriate threshold wall shear stress. Combinations of the foregoing are contemplated, including a threshold wall shear stress that is between or equal to 1.0 mPa and 10.0 mPa. However, it should be understood that threshold wall shear stresses both greater than and less than those noted above may also be used in certain embodiments as the disclosure is not so limited.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">When discussing a wall shear stress in the various embodiments herein, it should be understood that cerebrospinal fluid flows through the catheters only when the associated valve is opened. Further, the valve may open and close many times during a single day. Accordingly, the catheters will go through periods of minimal or zero flow through the catheters, a transient period of flow during valve opening where larger wall shear stresses may be present, and steady-state periods of flow during open-valve conditions. Therefore, while the wall shear stresses applied during a transient flow period may be greater than the noted threshold shear stresses, the wall shear stresses discussed herein are primarily intended to refer to the wall shear stresses during steady-state periods of open-valve conditions with the noted flow rates. Therefore, the wall shear stresses within the holes and internal lumen of the various embodiments of catheters disclosed herein may be greater than a threshold shear stress during transient flow periods and/or during stead-state flow periods.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Unlike typical ventricular catheters where the wall shear stress during operation is not considered, it may be desirable for the wall shear stress along the length of a catheter within the various holes and internal lumen to be more uniform to provide a more uniform performance with regards to tissue adhesion and growth within the catheter. In one such embodiment, a ratio of a maximum wall shear stress along a length of the catheter relative to a minimum wall shear stress along a length of the catheter under a predetermined flow of a fluid, such as cerebrospinal fluid, may be used to quantify the uniformity of the applied wall shear stresses. Depending on the particular application, the ratio of the maximum wall shear stress in the catheter to the minimum wall shear stress in the catheter may correspond to any appropriate range of ratios. For example, in some embodiments, a ventricular catheter may exhibit a ratio of a maximum wall shear stress in the catheter to the minimum wall shear stress in the catheter under a predetermined flow that is greater than or equal to 1, 2, 3, and/or any other appropriate ratio. Correspondingly, the ratio of the maximum wall shear stress in the catheter to the minimum wall shear stress in the catheter under a predetermined flow may be less than or equal to 10, 9, 7, 5, and/or any other appropriate ratio. Combinations of the foregoing are contemplated including, a ratio of a maximum and minimum wall shear stress within a ventricular catheter for a predetermined flow through the catheter that is between or equal to 1 and 10, 3 and 9, and/or any other appropriate combination. However, it should be understood that ratios both greater than and less than those noted above may also be used in certain embodiments as the disclosure is not limited in this fashion.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Depending on the particular application, a hole depth may correspond to any appropriate range of hole depths. For example, in some embodiments, depth of the plurality of holes may be greater than or equal to 0.4 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.6 mm, and/or any other appropriate hole depth. Correspondingly, the hole depths may be less than or equal to 1.0 mm, 0.9 mm, 0.8 mm, 0.7 mm, 0.6 mm, and/or any other appropriate hole depth. Combinations of the foregoing are contemplated including hole depths that are between or equal to 0.4 mm and 1.0 mm, 0.5 mm and 0.6 mm, and/or any other appropriate combination of the foregoing. However, it should be understood that hole depths both greater than and less than those noted above may also be used in certain embodiments as the disclosure is not limited in this manner.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Depending on the particular application, a hole transverse dimension may correspond to any appropriate range of hole transverse dimensions which may be balanced with hole depth to provide a desired wall shear stress under a given predetermined flow rate. For example, in some embodiments, a hole transverse dimension may be greater than or equal to 0.8 mm, 0.9 mm, 1.0 mm, and/or any other appropriate hole transverse dimension. Correspondingly, the hole transverse dimension may be less than or equal to 1.3 mm, 1.2 mm, 1.1 mm, 1.0 mm, and/or any other appropriate hole transverse dimension. Combinations of the foregoing are contemplated including, a hole transverse dimension that is between or equal to 0.8 mm and 1.3 mm, 1.0 mm and 1.2 mm, and/or any other appropriate combination of the foregoing. Again, it should be understood that hole transverse dimensions both greater than and less than those noted above may also be used in certain embodiments as the disclosure is not so limited.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Depending on the particular application, a transverse dimension of an internal lumen of a ventricular catheter may correspond to any appropriate range of transverse dimensions of an internal lumen to provide desired wall shear stresses within the lumen when balanced with other design parameters of a catheter. Additionally, depending on the particular embodiment, the transverse dimension of the internal lumen may vary along a length of the catheter to provide a desired wall shear stress along a length of the catheter, or the transverse dimension of the internal lumen may be substantially constant along the length catheter as the disclosure is not limited in this manner. In either case, a transverse dimension of an internal lumen of a ventricular catheter may be greater than or equal to 0.8 mm, 1.0 mm, 1.2 mm, and/or any other appropriate transverse dimension. Correspondingly, the transverse dimension of an internal lumen may be less than or equal to 1.5 mm, 1.4 mm, 1.3 mm, and/or any other appropriate transverse dimension. Combinations of the foregoing are contemplated including, a transverse dimension of an internal lumen that is between or equal to 0.8 mm and 1.5 mm, 1.1 mm and 1.4 mm, and/or any other appropriate combination of the foregoing. However, it should be understood that transverse dimensions of an internal lumen both greater than and less than those noted above may also be used as the disclosure is not limited in this fashion.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition to the above, in some embodiments, a transverse dimension of an exterior surface of a ventricular catheter may correspond to any appropriate range of dimensions. For example, the transverse dimension of the exterior surface of a catheter may either vary along a length of the catheter and/or may be substantially constant along a length of the catheter. In either case, depending on the particular embodiment, the transverse dimension of the exterior surface of the catheter may be greater than or equal to 2.0 mm, 2.3 mm, 2.5 mm, and/or any other appropriate dimension. Correspondingly, the transverse dimension of the exterior surface of catheter may be less than or equal to 3 mm, 2.5 mm, 2.3 mm, and/or any other appropriate dimension. Combinations of the foregoing are contemplated, including, for example, a transverse dimension of an exterior surface of a catheter that is between or equal to 2 mm and 3 mm. Of course, embodiments in which catheters having exterior surfaces with transverse dimensions both greater than and less than those noted above are also contemplated as the disclosure is not limited in this manner.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Any appropriate spacing between adjacent holes along a length of a catheter may be used to provide a desired flow rate and/or uniformity of flow through a ventricular catheter during use. That said, in some embodiments, spacing between adjacent holes along a length of the catheter may be greater than or equal to 1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, and/or any other appropriate spacing between holes. Correspondingly, the spacing between adjacent holes along a length of a catheter may be less than or equal to 5 mm, 4 mm, 3 mm, 2 mm, and/or any other appropriate spacing. Combinations of the foregoing ranges are contemplated including, a spacing between adjacent holes that is between or equal to 1 mm and 5 mm. Again, it should be understood that spacing between holes both greater than and less than those noted above may also be used in certain embodiments. Further, depending on the particular application, a uniform spacing or non-uniform spacing between holes along a length of catheter may be used as the disclosure is not so limited.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As should be appreciated, the flowrate through a ventricular catheter during use may vary depending on the particular application. For example, in some embodiments, a ventricular catheter may be used on a pediatric patient, where a lower average flowrate of cerebrospinal fluid through the catheter would be expected as compared to a ventricular catheter implanted in an adult patient. Regardless, in some embodiments, an average predetermined flowrate during use with an implanted ventricular catheter may be assumed to be approximately 10%, or other appropriate percentage, of cerebrospinal fluid production rate of a subject to provide a minimum expected flow rate, through the catheter, and thus, minimum corresponding shear stresses, during use. The average production rate of cerebrospinal fluid in an adult is about 0.3 mL/min. Thus, in one such embodiment, an average predetermined flow rate used to design the systems disclosed herein may be greater than or equal to 0.01 mL/min, 0.02 mL/min, and/or any other appropriate flow rate. Correspondingly, the average predetermined flow rate during use may be less or equal to 0.04 mL/min, 0.03 mL/min, and/or any other appropriate flow rate. Combinations of the foregoing are contemplated including, an average predetermined flow rate that is between or equal to 0.01 mL/min and 0.04 mL/min. In some instance, the average predetermined flow rate used with the various embodiments disclosed herein may be about 0.03 mL/min. Again, depending on the particular application, it should be understood that flow rates both greater than and less than those noted above may also be used in certain embodiments in which a minimum threshold shear stress is provided under those flow rates as the disclosure is not limited in this fashion.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein, a transverse dimension may refer to a dimension that is perpendicular to a longitudinal axial direction of a particular feature. For example, a transverse dimension of a circular lumen and/or hole may refer to a diameter of the hole or lumen. Of course, in instances where non-circular features are used, the transverse dimension may refer to other dimensions such as a width of an ovular, square, or rectangular lumen or hole.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">It should be understood that the wall shear stresses applied to the inner surfaces of the holes and internal lumen of the catheters disclosed herein may be determined in any number of ways. For example, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations as described herein may be used to determine the wall shear stresses applied to the holes and internal lumen of a catheter. Alternatively, or in addition to CFD, various experimental methods may be used to evaluate the fluid flow through a catheter which may then be used to calculate the wall shear stress using any appropriate method. For example, a flow profile in one or more portions of a catheter may be measured using Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV). The wall shear stress profile may then be calculated from the velocity slope at the wall, which may be available from the experimentally obtained flow profile.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Many of the embodiments described herein are described relative to a ventricular catheter.

When a patient's brain <b>1</b> contains excessive cerebrospinal fluid so as to cause the pressure within the brain to exceed a safe threshold, the check valve opens, allowing cerebrospinal fluid to flow into the embedded tip portion of the proximal ventricular catheter that is embedded in the brain and in fluid communication with the ventricular space of the brain.

For modeling purposes, the flow rate was set to 0.03 mL/min, representing 10% of the typical cerebrospinal fluid production rate in the cerebral ventricular system. This flow rate represents a physiological lower bound of the shunt flow rate, which induces wall shear stress inside a catheter as low as possible. In simulations, the viscosity of the cerebrospinal fluid was assumed to be 0.8 mPa s. As noted above, the inventors observed from the astrocyte experiment that fluid shear stress of 1 mPa prevented astrocytes from increasing confluency and maintaining a healthy morphology. Thus, when applying 1 mPa as a cutoff wall shear stress to the simulation result, all holes and lumens except H<b>8</b> and L<b>8</b> failed to meet the threshold condition.

The inventors further observed that as the ratio between hole depth and hole spacing increased, the wall shear stress increases. For example, as the ratio between hole depth and hole spacing increased from 0.3 to 0.6 the wall shear stress increased along all sections of the catheter.
