Now a case is assumed where, for example, the NAND flash memory <b>13</b> in the memory device <b>10</b> includes a first NAND flash memory die and a second NAND flash memory die stacked above the first NAND flash memory die. In this case, the controller <b>14</b> reads a temperature measured by a first temperature sensor built in the first NAND flash memory die and a temperature measured by a second temperature sensor incorporated in the second NAND flash memory die, from the first NAND flash memory die and the second NAND flash memory die, respectively. Then, when at least one of the temperatures read from the first and second NAND flash memory dies is equal to or higher than the threshold temperature, the controller <b>14</b> reduces the frequency of issue of commands to the first and second NAND flash memory dies or the speed of access to the first and second NAND flash memory dies.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0224">In many cases, a temperature inside the controller <b>14</b> is higher than the temperature of each NAND flash memory die. If Tj_N_max is estimated by using a temperature measured by the temperature sensor TH_C in the controller <b>14</b>, therefore, it leads to a tendency that the thermal control is started prematurely before Tj_N_max actually rises to the temperature at which the thermal control is to be started, causing an unnecessary degradation of the access performance of the NAND flash memory <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0225">In this embodiment, by using the maximum temperature among temperatures measured by the temperature sensors TH_N<b>0</b> to TH_N<b>7</b>, as Tj_N_max, a point of time of starting the thermal control is made later than a point of time of starting the thermal control in the case of estimating Tj_N_max using a temperature measured by the temperature sensor TH_C in the controller <b>14</b>. As a result, a time during which the NAND flash memory dies <b>131</b> to <b>138</b> operate in their maximum access performance can be increased. Therefore, the temperature of each of the NAND flash memory dies <b>131</b> to <b>138</b> can be prevented from exceeding the upper limit of the operation guarantee temperature of the NAND flash memory die, without causing an unnecessary degradation of the access performance of the memory device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0226">In addition, the controller <b>14</b> is allowed to carry out the thermal control by reading only the temperatures measured by N-1 or less temperature sensors in N-1 or less NAND flash memory dies selected as temperature monitoring target dies, from N NAND flash memory dies stacked in the package <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0227">This makes it possible to quickly search for the highest temperature among the temperatures of the N NAND flash memory dies stacked in the package <b>11</b>. In addition, quickly searching for the highest temperature reduces the number of times of read access necessary for reading temperatures, which improves access performance related to reading/writing user data. For example, a case is assumed where the NAND flash memory <b>13</b> in the memory device <b>10</b> includes a third NAND flash memory die, in addition to the first and second NAND flash memory dies described above, the first NAND flash memory die is stacked above the third NAND flash memory die, and the third NAND flash memory die is closer to the first surface <b>21</b> than the first and second NAND flash memory dies. In this case, the controller <b>14</b> reads a temperature measured by a first temperature sensor built in the first NAND flash memory die and a temperature measured by a second temperature sensor incorporated in the second NAND flash memory die, from the first NAND flash memory die and the second NAND flash memory die, respectively. Then, when at least one of the temperatures read from the first and second NAND flash memory dies is equal to or higher than the threshold temperature, the controller <b>14</b> reduces the frequency of issue of commands to the first and second NAND flash memory dies or the speed of access to the first and second NAND flash memory dies. In other words, the controller <b>14</b> does not read a temperature measured by the third temperature sensor incorporated in the third NAND flash memory die, from the third NAND flash memory die, or does not compare the temperature measured by the third temperature sensor with the threshold value.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0228">N-1 or less nonvolatile memory dies that are the temperature monitoring target dies can be decided by learning in advance respective temperatures of the stacked NAND flash memory dies <b>131</b> to <b>138</b> in a period in which the NAND flash memory dies <b>131</b> to <b>138</b> are accessed. By this approach, N-1 or less nonvolatile memory dies that are the temperature monitoring target dies can be determined highly accurately. For example, when the NAND flash memory <b>13</b> in the memory device <b>10</b> is configured to include the above first, second, and third NAND flash memory dies, the controller <b>14</b> stores information for identifying the first and second NAND flash memory dies.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0229">In this embodiment, the stacked NAND flash memory dies <b>131</b> to <b>138</b> each store a correction value non-volatilely, the correction value being determined such that a temperature output of the temperature sensor TH_N is within a predetermined allowable temperature range at the first temperature (70&#xb0; C. or 85&#xb0; C.) higher than the room temperature (30&#xb0; C.), the predetermined allowable temperature range being set with respect to the first temperature (70&#xb0; C. or 85&#xb0; C.). In addition, each temperature sensor TH_N is configured to operate using correction values non-volatilely stored in the corresponding NAND flash memory die. Hence a temperature measurement error of each temperature sensor TH_N can be reduced in a temperature range in which the thermal control is carried out. For example, according to a method for manufacturing the memory device <b>10</b> including the controller <b>14</b> and the first and second NAND flash memory dies, a wafer including the first and second NAND flash memory dies is prepared first. Subsequently, the ambient temperature around the wafer is set to a first set value. As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the first set value is, for example, 70&#xb0; C.&#xb1;1.25&#xb0; C., that is, a temperature range of 68.75&#xb0; C. or higher and 71.25&#xb0; C. or lower, or is 85&#xb0; C.&#xb1;1.25&#xb0; C., that is, a temperature range of 83.75&#xb0; C. or higher and 86.25&#xb0; C. or lower. After the ambient temperature is set to the first set value, a first temperature is measured using the first temperature sensor. A first correction value that the first temperature sensor uses for temperature measurement is determined, using a measurement value of the first temperature sensor. The determined first correction value is written to a first nonvolatile memory die. In the same manner, after the ambient temperature is set to the first set value, a second temperature is measured, using the second temperature sensor. A second correction value that the second temperature sensor uses for temperature measurement is determined, using a measurement value of the second temperature sensor. The determined second correction value is written to a second nonvolatile memory die. Then, the ambient temperature is set to a second set value (e.g., 90&#xb0; C.&#xb1;1.25&#xb0; C.) higher than the first set value. After the ambient temperature is set to the second set value, a third temperature is measured, using the first temperature sensor. After the ambient temperature is set to the second set value, a fourth temperature is measured, using the second temperature sensor. Then, whether the third temperature and the fourth temperature are each within a threshold range is determined. Thereafter, the first and second nonvolatile memory dies are cut out from the wafer. When the third temperature and the fourth temperature are each within the threshold range, the cut-out first and second nonvolatile memory dies are packaged in the memory devices <b>10</b>. Hence the memory device <b>10</b> in which the controller <b>14</b> and the first and second nonvolatile memory dies are incorporated in one package <b>11</b> is manufactured.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0230">While certain embodiments have been described, these embodiments have been presented by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventions.
