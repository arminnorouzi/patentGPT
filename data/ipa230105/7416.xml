These audio multi-cables are commonly referred to as &#x201c;snakes&#x201d; and are bulky. Moreover, these cables may be cumbersome to handle, prone to contact failure within the stage-box connector, and may require a lot of storage space when not in use. In addition, the ground loop imbalance or electromagnetic interference from lighting or other sources may generate a low frequency hum or sporadic noise in one or more of the audio signals.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Moreover, audio transported to an audio mixing console may then have to be transported back to the stage, stadium or arena to be output through one or more loudspeakers. The audio mixing console to loudspeaker connection traditionally requires a separate cable.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, microphones produce a very low-level analog electrical signal that must be transported a substantial distance to an audio mixing console where the signal may be amplified hundreds of times its original level. Any interference picked up along the way may be amplified resulting in degraded audio quality.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Converting an analog signal received from a microphone or other media pickup device to digital requires active electronics that must receive reliable power. Thus, when the conversion is performed by electronics in a stage box, a power connection may be required near the stage, stadium, or arena to provide power to the stage box. Alternatively, a power cable from the audio mixing console to the stage box may be required.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Even a directional microphone may pick up sound from other sources. In certain situations, when a number of microphones are positioned at various locations upon a stage, podium, arena, and the like, phasing problems may appear due to the difference in time that it takes sound to travel to each microphone. A digital signal processor may be required to alleviate these phasing problems.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In light of the above discussion, there may be a need of improved methods and systems to reduce the above stated undesirable sound effects and to combine audio signal transport with power delivery.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">An Omnisnake apparatus and application may replace conventional audio/video performance capture and reproduction systems that include individual media transportation cables for each audio/video pickup device to a central base unit or mixing board. The Omnisnake apparatus and application may include enclosed custom or customized electronics, off-the-shelf cabling, and software running on off-the-shelf computing devices such as mobile computers. The customized electronics may include analog, digital, analog to digital, and digital to analog circuitry for providing audio/video capture, digital transmission over standard communication cables, and audio/video playback. In environments that require temporary setup of audio/video capture equipment for a live performance (e.g. a concert in the park), the Omnisnake apparatus and application substantially decreases the costs and complexity of such a temporary setup by allowing simplified cabling from a performance area (e.g. stage) to an audio control and management facility (e.g. a base unit, mixing board, etc.) and to loudspeakers. By combining high quality audio/video analog signal capture by a stage box that is disposed close to the performer's microphone with high speed digital transmission of audio/video/control signals among stage boxes (e.g. daisy chaining) and to base units or loudspeaker amplifiers, the quality of the audio pickup may be substantially improved while the size, cost, weight, and complications of cabling is significantly reduced.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention may amplify microphone signals physically and electrically close to the source to reduce the opportunities for signal interferences to be amplified along with the microphone signals. In embodiments, the present invention may convert the resulting amplified analog audio signals to robust pulse-code modulated digital signals. The digital signals may be serialized to form individual data streams. In embodiments, the present invention may multiplex the individual data streams in time-domain to form a single main data stream. This may facilitate the use of an easier transport medium than bulky audio multi-cables. Further, the present invention may de-multiplex the main data stream into individual data streams for conversion back into the analog domain and/or into standard AES3 digital audio format. The present invention may isolate the ground potential between the audio mixing console and the microphone location by supplying the electrical power needed to energize the amplifier circuitry. In embodiments, the microphones may also be provided with electrical power to eliminate the main source of ground-loop interference.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In embodiments, the transport medium may be used to transport an audio signal in two directions, allowing the present invention to control both audio pickup devices and loudspeakers.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In embodiments, video from a video capture device may be converted to a digital stream and multiplexed into a single main data stream to facilitate the use of an easier transport medium.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention may also include a portable computing device which may work in conjunction with or may replace conventional audio control panels, or mixing boards. The portable computing device may display a virtual mixing board for the user. The portable computing device may allow its user to manipulate audio settings wirelessly. Additionally, because the audio settings may be manipulated wirelessly, the sound engineer may move about the venue freely, not being tied to a traditional control panel at a fixed location, such as a mobile production trailer.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The methods and systems herein may comprise a means for capturing, transmitting, and reproducing audio and video signals.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an aspect of the invention, methods and systems include taking an audio signal received at a stage box from an audio pickup device connected to the stage box, transmitting the audio signal in digital form from a stage box over a single cable to a base unit and powering the stage box over the same cable that is used to transmit the audio signal.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the aspect, the stage box is located proximal to a live performance stage and the base unit is located distally from the stage box.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the aspect, the stage box may receive a plurality of audio signals from a plurality of audio pickup devices and may multiplex the audio signals into one digital signal and transmit the multiplexed digital signal over a single cable to a base unit.

The stage box <b>102</b> may be placed near a stage, an announcement booth, football field, tennis court, a live performance, and the like where audio or video may be produced. An audio pickup device, such as a microphone <b>120</b>, a musical instrument, a CD player, a tape deck, and the like may be connected to stage box <b>102</b> and may produce an audio signal. The stage box <b>102</b> may digitize an audio signal, producing a digital data stream. The stage box <b>102</b> may multiplex a plurality of digital data streams resulting from digitizing a plurality of audio signals into a main data stream. The stage box <b>102</b> may transport the main digital data stream to a remote location using a cable or wireless connection.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The stage box <b>102</b> may convert a plurality of audio signals into individual digital data streams and multiplex the data streams into one main data stream. The stage box <b>102</b> may transport the main data stream to a remote location, such as another stage box, a base unit <b>104</b>, a wireless network controller <b>208</b>, a portable computing device <b>206</b>, and the like. The stage box <b>102</b> may use a single cable connection to connect to the remote location. The cable connection may be a co-axial cable, tri-axial cable, or twisted-pair cable connection. The twister-pair may be shielded or unshielded, such as a CAT5 cable, CAT5e cable, CAT6 cable, and the like. The main data stream may be transported over one or more twisted-pairs in a cable such as a CAT5, CAT5e, or the like. In embodiments, the main data stream from a first stage box <b>102</b> may be transported over one set of the twisted-pairs, and a main data stream from a second stage box <b>102</b> may be transported over another set of the twisted-pairs in a given cable assembly. Any number of twisted-pairs may be utilized within a cable assembly for digital signals, analog signals, and the like for communicating between and among stage boxes, base boxes, audio pickup digitizing devices, and the like. For example, the co-axial cable may connect the stage box <b>102</b> to the front of house audio console or remote production truck. In an embodiment, the wireless connection may be one of Wi-Fi, RF, cellular, Bluetooth, and the like.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In embodiments, the stage box <b>102</b> may digitize a number of audio signals and then multiplex them into a single data stream, which may be sent over a single cable that may connect with the base unit <b>104</b>. The number of audio signals may be one of four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two, and the like. Each of the audio signals may be either a microphone <b>120</b> level, line level, or other audio pickup device that may use a different connector type to connect to the stage box <b>102</b>. The stage box <b>102</b> may provide a combination connector, such as an XLR/TRS connector (e.g. NUETRIK) that may accept a plurality of different connectors for microphone inputs, line level inputs, and the like.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In an exemplary scenario, an audio pickup device connected to the stage box <b>102</b> may have a variety of output levels. An audio pickup device with a line level output may have a consistent output level, while a microphone <b>120</b> may have a variable output level. A microphone output level may be from 20 dB to 60 dB below line level output. The stage box <b>102</b> may incorporate a pre-amplifier <b>108</b> that may increase the gain of the output level of a microphone <b>120</b> so that it is substantially similar to the output level of a line level audio pickup device. The pre-amplifier <b>108</b> may have a variable gain range to accommodate a variety of microphone <b>120</b>. An appropriate gain, as well as other pre-amplifier control settings, may be remotely selected from a base unit <b>104</b>, a virtual mixing board on a portable computing device <b>206</b>, a digital control panel, an analog control panel, and the like.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In embodiments, the microphone <b>120</b> may be one of Dynamic Microphone, Ribbon Microphone, Condenser Microphone, Wired Microphone, Handheld Wireless Microphone, Hands free Wireless Microphone, and the like.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">An audio pickup device may require a power source to function properly. For example, a microphone <b>120</b> may require a DC power source of 48 volts. The power source may be phantomed onto a microphone cable, creating a phantom power source. The stage box <b>102</b> may provide a phantom power source to an audio pickup device. The stage box <b>102</b> may provide a switch that turns on the phantom power source. The stage box <b>102</b> may provide an indicator light, such as an LED that may indicate that phantom power is being supplied to an audio pickup device. The stage box <b>102</b> may group audio pickup devices that need to be supplied with power into a bank of audio pickup devices and may supply power to an entire bank of audio pickup devices.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">A stage box <b>102</b> may have one or more connectors for connecting to a base unit or other stage boxes. In an example a stage box <b>102</b> may have a primary and secondary RJ45. A stage box <b>102</b> that may be connected to a base unit <b>104</b> through the primary RJ45 may also be connected to another stage box <b>102</b> through the secondary RJ45. Such a configuration may have the first stage box <b>102</b> acting as a base unit for the second stage box <b>102</b> from which it would receive a multiplexed main data stream. The first stage box <b>102</b> may integrate its own audio pickup device inputs with the multiplexed main data stream it receives from the second stage box <b>102</b>. Thus, the base unit <b>104</b> may receive a single multiplexed data stream containing audio signals from audio pickup devices connected to both the first stage box <b>102</b> and the second stage box <b>102</b>. In another example, a first base unit <b>104</b> may be connected to a second base unit <b>104</b>. The first base unit <b>104</b> may de-multiplex the main data stream received from the first stage box <b>102</b> and may pass on the audio signals representing the audio pickup devices connected to second stage box <b>102</b> to the second base unit <b>104</b>. Alternatively, the first base unit <b>104</b> may process all the audio signals received, or may pass along all the audio signals received to the second base unit <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The base unit <b>104</b> may de-multiplex the main data stream into individual data streams, and may convert these data streams back to analog audio signals as well as to AES3 digital audio formatted channels.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In embodiments, the base unit <b>104</b> may receive a multiplexed main data stream from the stage box <b>102</b> through a cable connection. The base unit <b>104</b> may de-multiplex the main data stream into separate individual digital audio streams and may convert the digital audio stream to analog audio signals. The base unit <b>104</b> may convert the digital audio stream received into a common format, such as AES3 digital format. In addition, the base unit <b>104</b> may also send a pre-amplifier control setting, such as gain, a timing reference, frequency, phasing, and the like to a stage unit <b>102</b> utilizing the same cable connection. To synchronize the digital audio outputs to an external source, the base unit <b>104</b> may receive an AES3 digital audio input as a timing reference. Another type of signal containing synchronizing information, such as analog video or Serial Digital Video, or AES3 word clock may alternatively be used as a timing reference. The base unit <b>104</b> may adjust a master clock to this reference and may send a timing reference to the stage box <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The base unit <b>104</b> may serve as a power source for the stage box <b>102</b> by sending power, such as DC voltage and the like along the same cable connection used to receive the digital audio stream to power the stage box <b>102</b>. The power may be a mixture of switching regulators and linear regulators. The power may be sent down the cable by filtering, i.e., by separating DC from digital A/C signal. In an embodiment, when twisted pair or the like are utilized for connection, power over Ethernet (POE) technology may be used to send power.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In embodiments, the pre-amplifier <b>108</b> located within the stage box <b>102</b> may be controlled remotely from the base unit <b>104</b> via a return data channel on the cable connection. The base unit <b>104</b> may send a pre-amplifier control setting to control the pre-amplifier <b>108</b> within a stage box <b>102</b>. A pre-amplifier control setting may be one of a gain setting, volume, synchronization information, phasing information, frequency information, power supply voltage, and the like and may be sent from base unit <b>104</b> to stage box <b>102</b>. The synchronization information may be locked to an external timing reference.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In embodiments, the present invention may also provide a return audio signal whereby the base unit <b>104</b> has an analog audio input <b>110</b>. The audio input <b>110</b> may produce an audio signal that may be digitized and a plurality of analog audio signals may be digitized and multiplexed into the same return data stream that provides pre-amplifier control settings to the stage box <b>102</b>. The number of analog audio input <b>110</b> may be one of two, four, eight, and the like. The stage box <b>102</b> may then de-multiplex the return data stream and convert it back to analog audio signals.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In an embodiment, a base unit <b>104</b> may supply power to a stage box <b>102</b> using the same cable connection used by stage box <b>102</b> to send the main data stream to base unit <b>104</b>. This arrangement may eliminate the need for a separate power source near the stage box <b>102</b> and may make the stage box <b>102</b> more portable.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In embodiments, the present invention may provide smart power to prevent damage to equipment that might be inadvertently connected to the cable attached to the base unit <b>104</b>. A power monitor facility in the base unit <b>104</b> may supervise the application of DC power on the cable by checking for a signature resistance, such as approximately 25,000 Ohms. The power monitor facility may interrupt power delivery if no resistance is present, or if the resistance present is not the signature resistance. Conversely, if the power monitor facility does see the correct signature resistance provided by a properly connected stage box <b>102</b>, it may perform a power-up sequence and send power, such as 48 volts DC to the stage box <b>102</b> via the cable. The power monitoring facility may provide over-current protection and may discontinue power delivery if stage box <b>102</b> draws more power than is anticipated. When the stage box <b>102</b> is disconnected, the power monitoring facility may discontinue the power supply.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In embodiments, the stage box <b>102</b> may only require a single cable for operation and connection to a base unit <b>104</b>, another stage box <b>102</b>, and the like. The stage box <b>102</b> may be compact. For example, the stage box <b>102</b> may be a 4&#xd7;1 version and multiple stage boxes <b>102</b> may be connected to form 16&#xd7;4 versions. In embodiments, several of these compact stage boxes <b>102</b> may be daisy-chained together by the cable. Each stage box <b>102</b> may have the ability to multiplex its own digitized audio streams with those received from another stage box <b>102</b> further down the chain. Thus, the audio streams from a plurality of stage boxes <b>102</b> may be combined into a single main data stream to be sent to a base unit <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In embodiments, the present invention may provide a 2&#xd7;2 plus video Stage box <b>102</b>/Base unit <b>104</b>. This unit may operate only over twisted pair cable and may be used with the 16&#xd7;4 base unit <b>104</b> and may be daisy chained with other Stage boxes <b>102</b> in a manner similar to the 4&#xd7;1 version. This unit may have the ability to serve either as a stage box <b>102</b> or base unit <b>104</b>, so that two 2&#xd7;2 plus video stage box <b>102</b>/base unit <b>104</b><i>s </i>may be connected via a single twisted pair cable to provide a complete stand-alone 2&#xd7;2 audio plus video system. The unit, which may be connected to an external DC power, may become the video source unit, and the other unit may become the video destination.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In an example, one twisted pair of a cable may carry one analog video channel in either direction. This may facilitate simplicity and cost control as well as facilitate longer overall length of a twisted-pair cable. Alternatively, the video may be digitized and sent over a twisted pair cable or other transport medium such as wireless connection. Alternatively, the digitized video may be multiplexed within the main data stream that also carries the digitized audio channels.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In embodiments, the stage box <b>102</b> may comprise sixteen audio pickup devices. Likewise, four return audio pickup devices may be utilized by the base unit <b>104</b> for a purpose such as a stage monitor. The stage box <b>102</b> may use a cable connection to connect to the base unit <b>104</b>. The cable connection may be one of co-axial cable, tri-axial cable, CAT5 cable, CAT6 cable, and the like.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In embodiments, a second stage box <b>102</b> may be used in place of a base unit <b>104</b>. It is understood by those skilled in the art that a stage box <b>102</b> may provide any or all of the functionality provided by a base unit <b>104</b> without changing the scope of this invention.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In embodiments, the present invention may daisy-chain a plurality of stage box <b>102</b> or base unit <b>104</b>. For example, one cable may connect two base units <b>104</b> with two stage boxes <b>102</b>. It is understood by those skilled in the art, that a different type of cable may be used to connect different components of the present invention. For example, a first stage box <b>102</b> may be connected to second stage box <b>102</b> using a twisted-pair cable, while the second stage box <b>102</b> may connected to a base unit <b>104</b> by a co-axial cable. The use of different cable types for different connections may allow for flexibility in installation, reduction in cost, and ease of maintenance. For example, the twisted-pair cable, which may be easy to run through conduits, may be used in a church instead of installing the multi-cable audio snake.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The present invention may allow for more flexibility and easier changes to the configuration of audio/visual equipment. For example, when a facility is used for different types of functions, it may be useful to locate a compact stage box <b>102</b> at various locations to account for varying audio and visual setups. The stage box <b>102</b> may be placed in the floor of a stage, within a floor box, and in other similar locations. In another example, cable connections, such as twisted-pair connections, can be made at various locations within the facility, allowing the stage box <b>102</b> to be moved to the necessary location and connected as needed, depending on setup requirements.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In embodiments, the stage box <b>102</b> and the base unit <b>104</b> may be logically programmed. An analog to digital (A2D) converter and a digital to analog (D2A) converter may be installed in stage box <b>102</b> and base unit <b>104</b>. Channels of audio and one video may be digitized. By converting an analog stream to a digital stream for transport, these converters may avoid or reduce ground loop interference, RF interference, interference from lighting systems, and the like. Once in the digital format, the audio and video signal may be immune to various kind of interference.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In embodiments, the present invention may also provide a maestro audio A2D converter device. This device may accept either balanced or unbalanced stereo analog signals from audio pickup devices and may convert them into a single digital audio stream that complies with the AES/EBU (AES3) and S/PDIF digital audio standards. The device may use 128 times oversampling for extremely accurate and linear analog to digital conversion, and may offer a high dynamic range with exceptionally low total harmonic distortion and noise. This, along with the 128 times oversampling, may help to move any noise associated with the digital conversion well outside the audible spectrum. In embodiments, a display such as two LED bar graphs, a monitoring screen, and the like may indicate the analog audio input levels to assure proper setup and operation. Internal switch settings may provide a selection of the three most common professional digital audio frame rates of 48 kHz, 44.1 kHz, and 32 kHz. The digital audio output may be provided on three connector types and formats: XLR for 110 ohm balanced cable, BNC for 75 ohm unbalanced co-axial cable and TOSLINK for optical cable.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In embodiments, the present invention may also provide a maestro audio digital to analog converter device. This device may receive an AES/EBU (AES3) or S/PDIF digital audio and may convert it to two channels of analog audio. It may automatically detect sample rates up to 96 kHz with low-jitter clock recovery. Three connector types and formats may be provided for the digital audio input: XLR for 110 ohm balanced cable, BNC for 75 ohm unbalanced co-axial cable and TOSLINK for optical cable. Front panel LEDs may indicate the detected frame rate for the three most common audio rates of 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz, and 48 kHz. In addition, front panel LEDs may indicate when the unit is properly locked to the digital audio input stream. This device may employ high-precision 24-bit conversion, oversampling, and filtering techniques, to deliver 120 dB of dynamic range and &#x2212;100 dB total harmonic distortion and noise.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In an embodiment, two balanced line-level audio outputs may be provided on XLR connectors as well as on a stereo headphone mini-jack for monitoring.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In embodiments, the present invention may also provide a maestro video analog to digital converter device. This device may accept either NTSC or PAL composite analog video or component S-Video and convert it to a SMPTE 259C 270 MHz Serial Digital Interface (SDI) with full 10-bit precision. It may include automatic detection of NTSC 525-line and PAL 625-line standards, four SDI outputs, VBI Data processing, a rugged self-contained metal enclosure and various mounting options from desktop, to rear side-rail rack mounting, to ganged front-side or rear-side rack mounting.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In embodiments, the present invention may also provide maestro video digital to analog converter maestro device. This device may receive a SMPTE 259C 270 MHz Serial Digital Interface (SDI) video stream and may convert it to NTSC/PAL composite analog video and component S-Video outputs.

The firmware or software upgrade may provide enhanced functionality, as well as new functionality. A firmware or software upgrade may be performed by connecting a computer, a flash drive, or the like to a connector within the stage box <b>102</b> or base unit <b>104</b>. Alternatively, an electronics board, such as a FLASH memory board, may be removed from the chassis and plugged in to an upgrade connector. A wireless upgrade may be performed using the wireless interface <b>230</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. If a connector is used, it may be any type of connector and may include a mini-connector accessible on the exterior of the box. In embodiments, specialized software may be downloaded over the Internet. In an example, upgraded firmware may go from a network, such as the Internet over the cable from the base unit <b>104</b> to the stage box <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In embodiments, firmware or software installed on stage box <b>102</b> or base unit <b>104</b> may comprise a diagnostic mode. The diagnostic mode may allow a technician or other user to perform diagnostics, maintenance, upgrades, and the like remotely. Thus, the maintenance and support cost may be lowered.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In embodiments, the stage box <b>102</b> may provide a test signal that may be used to configure and align an entire sound system (e.g. by using a handheld testing device, or the like). The digital audio may have a limit or maximum signal level to avoid flattening or distortion. For example, an analog amplifier driving home speakers may drive to the point where physical characteristics of system may flatten the top end of the system response to the input analog signal. In embodiments, there may be no limit in analog signals. The limit may depend on intermediate circuitry, such as speakers, and the like. The present invention may set up the entire digital signal transmission chain to make sure nothing distorts the input audio or video signal.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In embodiments, the present invention may provide an AES/EBU genie pocket test signal generator system.
