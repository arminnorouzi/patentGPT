The cannula and electrode assembly of this invention has plural conduct tips and be selectively operated so that at any given time a single tips or the plural tips are active.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An electrosurgical tool system, often referred to as an electrosurgical system, is a set of components used to flow current through a patient to accomplish a specific medical procedure. Often the procedure is to ablate at least some of the tissue through which the current is flowed to accomplish a desirable therapeutic effect. For example, an electrosurgical procedure is sometimes performed to selectively remove nerve tissue. This may be desirable if a set of the patient's nerves continually transmit signals to the brain that inaccurately indicate that a portion of the patient's body is in appreciable pain. If the receipt of these pain signals adversely affects the quality of life for the patient, an electrosurgical system is employed to ablate the nerves responsible for the transmission of these signals. As a consequence of the tissue ablation process the nerve becomes a lesion. As a result of the nerve becoming a lesion, the nerve no longer transmits pain signals to the brain.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many electrosurgical systems include a cannula and electrode assembly. As implied by its name this assembly includes a cannula and an electrode. The cannula is a needle like structure with sufficient strength to puncture the skin of the patient and be positioned adjacent the tissue through which the current is to be flowed. The distal end or tip of the cannula is conductive. The electrode is a closed end tube formed of conductive material. The tube is designed to seat in the lumen that extends through the cannula. Owing to the relatively small diameter of the electrode, often 0.4 mm or less in diameter, this tube tends to be relatively fragile. A hub or terminal is connected to the proximal end of the electrode body.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When this type of assembly is used to remove tissue, the cannula is typically initially inserted into the patient and directed to a location adjacent the target tissue, the tissue that is to be removed. During the insertion process a stylet may be seated in the cannula lumen to provide structural strength to the cannula. Once the cannula is in the generally vicinity of the target tissue, the stylet is removed. The electrode is inserted into the cannula lumen. A cable connects the electrode to a control console, also part of the electrosurgical system. The control console functions as the power source that applies current to the electrode. An electrically conductive ground pad, another component of the electrosurgical system, is placed against the patient. The ground pad is also connected to the control console.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The electrode assembly is used by sourcing a current from the control console to the electrode. Since the electrode and cannula physically abut, there is current flow to the cannula. An electrical path is established through the patient from the electrode and sleeve section of the cannula to the ground pad. This current flow is densest through the tissue immediately adjacent the distal end of electrode and the exposed distal end of the cannula. This current flow heats the tissue to a temperature that results in the ablation of the tissue.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Available cannula and electrode assemblies have proven to be good instruments for removing selected sections of tissue. Nevertheless, a limiting characteristic with the use of some of these assemblies is that, when activated, they tend to ablate relatively small volumes of tissue, tissue having a volume of 0.8 cm<sup>3 </sup>or less. This is especially true of assemblies having cannula with outer diameters of 18 gage or more (1.25 mm or less.) There are procedures in which the practitioner wants to ablate larger sections of tissue than can be removed in a single actuation of the assemblies. Consequently, after a first section of tissue is removed, the practitioner has to reposition the electrode assembly to remove an adjacent section of tissue. This requires the practitioner to, ever so slightly, reposition the electrode array so that, in the next actuation, current is only flowed through the tissue that is to be removed and not flowed through the adjacent tissue that should not be subjected to the removal process. Having to so reposition the electrode assembly, in addition to requiring a significant amount of skill, can lengthen the overall amount of time it takes to perform the procedure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An alternative cannula-and-electrode assembly has been proposed that is intended to increase the volume of tissue that can be removed with a single placement of the cannula. Specifically, it has been proposed to form the cannula of this type of assembly with a side opening that is located a short distance rearward of the distal end of the cannula. The assembly is further constructed with a means to turn the electrode as it is inserted in the cannula so that the distal end tip of the electrode extends out of this side port. The assembly thus has two tips: the distal end tip of the cannula; and the distal end tip of the electrode. When current is sourced to the assembly, the current flows from these two spaced apart tips.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Consequently, when current is sourced out of the electrode assembly of this invention, a relative dense electric field appears in the area around both of the tips. The field extend over a wider volume than the field output by an assembly with a convention electrode-in-the distal end of the cannula construction. The electrode assembly of this invention thus outputs a relatively dense current flow through a volume larger than is output by a conventionally constructed electrode assembly of the same size.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">There are procedures though in which the practitioner may not know until after the procedure is started if it is more appropriate to source current through a one tip assembly or a two tip assembly. Similarly, during the procedure, the practitioner may want to initial apply current using first the one tip (or two tip) assembly and then switch to applying current using a two tip (or one tip) assembly. In either of the above situations, the practitioner may find it necessary to interrupt the procedure in order first remove one cathode and electrode assembly and then insert a second assembly. As part of this process, the practitioner needs to take the time to ensure that the second assembly is properly positioned. Having to perform all these steps can increase the complexity of the procedure and the tip it takes to perform the procedure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">This invention relates to a new and useful cannula and electrode assembly for flowing current through living tissue. The assembly of this invention is designed so that after being inserted into the living being through which the current is to be sourced the assembly can be configured to source current from a single tips or plural spaced apart tips. In many versions of the invention, the assembly can be set to have two active tips.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The cannula of this assembly is formed so as to have a bend immediately proximal to the distal end of the cannula. The cannula has an outlet opening along the outer surface of the section of the cannula in which the bend is formed.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The electrode includes an elastic shaped section proximal to the distal end. More specifically, the electrode is shaped so as to have a length substantially equal to the length of the lumen that extends through the cannula. The electrode is further formed to have a bend in the section formed from elastic material. The bend is formed so as to be at the same general location along the length of the electrode that the bend is formed in the cannula.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A hub is attached to the proximal end of the electrode. The hub is connected to a cable through which current is sourced to the cannula. In many, but not all versions of the invention, the hub is provided with an indicia that provides an indication of the rotational orientation of the electrode within the cannula.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The assembly of this invention is used by first inserting the cannula in the patient. The cannula is positioned so the distal end tip is located adjacent the tissue through which the current is to be flowed. The electrode is then inserted in the cannula. If the practitioner only wants to flow current out of a single tip, the tip of the cannula, the electrode is inserted in the cannula in the rotational orientation so that the bend in the electrode is in same orientation as the bend in the cannula. Consequently, when the electrode is seated in the cannula, the tip of the electrode is seated in the distal end of the lumen of the cannula. Current is therefore sourced only from the tip of the cannula.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Alternatively, the practitioner can configure the assembly of this invention so that current can be simultaneously sourced from two tips. The assembly is so positioned by setting the rotational orientation of the electrode so that it is out of orientation with the bend in the cannula. When the electrode, in this orientation, is inserted in the cannula, the distal end of the electrode will extend out of the side port of the cannula. Thus while embedded in the patient, the assembly in this configuration has two active tips; the cannula tip and the electrode tip. As a consequence of the application of current to the electrode, current is flowed from both tips through the adjacent tissue.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The invention is pointed out with particularity in the claims.

The opposed hub face, face <b>75</b> is formed with a second indicia <b>76</b>, shown as &#x201c;V&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A tube like body <b>74</b> formed of conductive material that has both flexible and elastic characteristics extends forward from hub <b>68</b>. More particularly, the material is elastic so that, when subjected to deformative strain up to 3% and in some situations up to 6% deformative strain from its initial shape, the body will not permanently deform and return to its initial shape. In one version of the invention, body <b>74</b> is formed from a nickel titanium alloy known as Nitinol. Body <b>74</b> has an overall length such that when electrode <b>66</b> is inserted in the cannula <b>42</b> so that the electrode hub <b>68</b> abuts cannula hub <b>44</b>, the distal end tip of the electrode body is extends forward of at least a portion of the face forming the flared tip <b>60</b> of the cannula body <b>50</b>. The distal end tip of the electrode body does not extend beyond the distalmost end of the cannula body <b>50</b>. In some versions of the invention, when the electrode <b>66</b> is fully seated in the cannula <b>42</b>, the distal end top of the electrode body is located approximately 0.4 to 1.4 mm rearward of the distalmost tip of the cannula body <b>50</b>. The electrode body <b>74</b> has an outer diameter dimensioned so that when the electrode body <b>74</b> seats in cannula lumen <b>52</b>, there is contact between the inner surface of the cannula body <b>50</b> that defines lumen <b>52</b> and the outer surface of electrode body <b>74</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Electrode body <b>74</b> is further designed to have a bend <b>80</b>.

Bend <b>80</b> is located in the electrode body <b>74</b> so that when the electrode <b>66</b> is seated in the cannula <b>42</b>, the electrode bend <b>80</b> seats in the section of the cannula lumen <b>52</b> defined by cannula bend <b>54</b>. When the electrode <b>66</b> is assembled, the body <b>74</b> is placed in a rotational orientation relative to the hub <b>68</b> so that a distal section <b>82</b> of the body, the section distal to bend <b>80</b>, is directed towards hub face <b>70</b>.

A cable <b>35</b> connects the ground pad <b>34</b> to control console <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Cannula <b>42</b> is inserted into the patient adjacent the subcutaneous tissue that is to be subjected to the ablation process. In the insertion process the flared distal end tip <b>60</b> of the cannula is the portion of the electrode assembly <b>32</b> that punctures the skin. In this step, electrode <b>66</b> is not fitted to the cannula <b>42</b>. Instead, a flexible stylet (not illustrated) is seated in the cannula lumen <b>52</b>. The stylet inhibits the cannula body <b>50</b> from bending to the extent that such bending results in the permanent deformation of the cannula.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The practitioner steers the cannula <b>42</b> so it is located in the vicinity of the target tissue, the tissue that is to be subject to the ablation procedure. Owing to its relatively small diameter of the cannula body <b>50</b>, the cannula is relatively flexible. This flexibility facilitates the ability of the practitioner to steer the cannula to the vicinity of the target tissue. As part of this steering process, the practitioner positions the cannula so it is in the proper orientation relative to the tissue to be ablated. Once the cannula is properly positioned, the stylet is removed.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The practitioner then inserts the electrode <b>66</b> in the cannula <b>42</b>. If the particular procedure only requires the sourcing of current through a small volume of tissue adjacent the distal end of the assembly <b>32</b>, the electrode is seated so as to position the distal section <b>82</b> of the electrode body <b>74</b> in the cannula body distal section <b>56</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>. The practitioner so seats the electrode by setting the rotation orientation of the electrode body <b>74</b> inside the cannula body <b>50</b> so that cannula and electrode bends <b>54</b> and <b>80</b>, respectively, extend in the same direction. The practitioner sets this orientation of the electrode by aligning the electrode hub <b>68</b> so that as the hub <b>68</b> is moved towards cannula hub <b>44</b>, electrode indicia <b>72</b> faces cannula indicia <b>43</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As a consequence of the electrode <b>66</b> being so oriented, when the distal section <b>82</b> of the electrode body approaches the cannula bend <b>54</b>, the electrode bend <b>80</b> causes the electrode distal section <b>82</b> to curve into the cannula body distal section <b>56</b>. At the end of this insertion process, the distal end tip of the electrode body <b>74</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, seated inside the distalmost portion of cannula lumen <b>52</b>. When the assembly <b>32</b> is in this configuration, current is source from just one active tip, the insulation free portion of the cannula body <b>50</b>; bend <b>54</b> and distal section <b>56</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Alternatively, the practitioner may want to flow current through a relatively large volume of tissue adjacent the distal end of the assembly <b>32</b>. To perform this type of procedure, the practitioner seats the electrode <b>66</b> so the distal section <b>82</b> extends out of cannula body side opening <b>58</b>. Electrode <b>66</b> is so positioned by orientating the electrode body in the cannula so that along the longitudinal axis of the cannula proximal section, the electrode bend <b>80</b> has an orientation that is opposite to that of cannula bend <b>54</b>. Electrode <b>66</b> is so oriented by rotating the electrode so electrode indicia <b>76</b> is placed in orientation with cannula indicia <b>43</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>. Once the electrode <b>66</b> is so orientated, the electrode body <b>74</b> is advanced through the cannula lumen <b>52</b>. Eventually the distal end tip of the electrode body <b>74</b> reaches cannula side opening <b>58</b>. Owing the elastic characteristics of the material forming the electrode body <b>74</b>, the potential energy stored in bend <b>80</b> is released. This energy forces the body distal section <b>82</b> out of the cannula body side opening <b>58</b>. When the electrode is fully seated in the cannula, the distal section <b>82</b> of the electrode body <b>74</b> is located outside of and adjacent to the cannula distal section <b>56</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>7</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">When current is sourced through assembly as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, the current is thus sourced through two active tips; the exposed bend and distal section of the cannula body and the exposed distal section <b>82</b> of the electrode body. The current thus flows through a larger volume of tissue immediately adjacent the cannula than when the assembly is configured to source current from a single active tip.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The cannula and electrode of this assembly can thus be configured to operate in one of two modes, a mode in which the assembly sources current out of a single active tip or a mode in which the assembly sources current out of plural active tips. This allows the practitioner to, by setting the mode of operating of the assembly, set if the current is flowed through a relatively small volume or relative large volume of tissue adjacent the assembly <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, regardless of the mode of operation the electrode <b>66</b> is typically fully seated in the cannula <b>42</b>. Consequently, regardless of the operating mode, the thermocouple <b>84</b> is spaced essentially the same distance from tissue through which the current is flowed. The added separation of the thermocouple from the tissue when the electrode distal section <b>56</b> of cannula body <b>50</b> is minimal. Thus, in either mode of operation, the signal output by the thermocouple <b>84</b> representative of tissue temperature, represents the actual temperature of the tissue with the same degree of accuracy. This is useful because a practitioner may want to set the control console to cause a current to be applied to the tissue that ensures that the tissue is heated to a specific temperature. When the system <b>30</b> is so configured, the control console <b>36</b> employs the output signal from the thermocouple as the signal representative of tissue temperature.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">It is a still further feature of this invention is that, once the cannula <b>42</b> is inserted in the patient, the practitioner may reset the mode of operation of the assembly <b>32</b>. For example, the practitioner may start the procedure by sourcing current from just the single active tip, cannula body distal section <b>56</b>. The practitioner can then reset the assembly so that the current is formed from both tips, the cannula body distal section and the electrode body distal section. The practitioner performs this switch by first partially withdrawing the electrode body <b>74</b> from the cannula lumen <b>52</b>. The electrode <b>66</b> is then rotated to place electrode indicia <b>76</b> is placed in registration of cannula indicia <b>43</b>. The electrode body <b>74</b> is then fully reinserted in the cannula lumen <b>52</b>. This rotation and reinsertion of the electrode body <b>74</b> results in the extension of the electrode body distal section out of the cannula body side opening <b>58</b>. The assembly is then ready for operation in the mode in which the current is sourced from the two active tips.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Using the technique opposite from which is described above, assembly <b>32</b> once fitted to the patient can be switch from the plural active tip operating mode to the single active tip operating mode.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The above is directed to one specific version of the invention. Other versions of the invention may have features different from what has been described.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, there is no requirement that in all versions of the invention a thermocouple be the component disposed in the electrode that provides a signal representative of temperature. A thermal resistor or other temperature sensitive transducer may perform this function.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Likewise there is no requirement that in all versions of the invention either the cannula body or electrode body be components formed out of a single section of material. For example, the cannula body may include a proximal section formed from a nonconductive plastic. The bend and the distal section may be formed from metal or another conductive material.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further the described cannula is what is referred to as a monopolar cannula. The cannula has a single conductive surface. In an alternative version of this invention, the cannula may be a bipolar cannula. This type of cannula has two conductive surfaces that are electrically insulated from each other. The assembly of this version of the invention is used to perform what is known as a bipolar ablation procedure. The cannula second conductive surface functions as the return conductive terminal.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this version of the invention, when the assembly is operated in the plural active tip mode, the exposed distal section <b>82</b> of the electrode <b>66</b> and one of the exposed sections of the cannula form a pair of common active tips. The second exposed section of the cannula serves as the return conductive terminal.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Likewise the electrode body may be formed from plural sections of different material. For example the electrode body may have a proximal section formed from an elastic plastic. This plastic portion of the electrode body may be formed with the flexible bend. Distal to bend, the electrode may have a tip formed from a relatively inflexible conductor. An advantage of this version of the is that when the assembly is configured to operate in the plural active tip mode and the electrode is deployed out of the cannula side opening, the relatively inflexible exposed distal end may be less prone to breakage.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Further, there is no limitation that the invention solely be used in what are referred to as a monopolar procedure, a procedure in which the ground pad functions as the return electrode. Assembly <b>32</b> of this invention may be used to perform what is referred to as a parallel bipolar ablation procedure. In this type of procedure two cannula and electrode assemblies are inserted in the patient. These assemblies are positioned on opposed sides of the tissue through which the current is to be flowed. In this type of procedure, the second cannula and electrode assembly serves as what is referred to as the return electrode.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In these types of procedure, there is no requirement that both cannula and electrode assemblies be of the type of this invention. In this type of procedure it is recommended that the assembly <b>32</b> of this invention be orientated so that the electrode bend <b>80</b> is positioned so that the electrode distal section <b>82</b> be directed towards the tissue through which the current is to be filed. This recommendation applies when the assembly <b>32</b> is operated either the single or active tip mode or the plural active tip mode. This orientation of the electrode <b>66</b> is suggested to ensure that the thermocouple <b>84</b> is positioned relatively close to the tissue through which the current is to be flowed. This increases the extent to which the thermocouple outputs a signal that, as closely as possible, represents the temperature of the tissue through which the current is flowed.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an alternative electrode <b>102</b> of this invention.
