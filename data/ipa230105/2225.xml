The hydrogen storage materials prepared by the processes described herein exhibit enhanced hydrogen storage capacity when used as hydrogen storage systems. The processes described herein may be undertaken on a commercial scale.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The enormous demands placed on the world's fossil fuel reserves have led to concerns regarding global warming, energy security and environmental pollution. Researchers continue to seek alternative fuel sources. Molecular hydrogen is ideal in this regard because it is lightweight, abundant, has more than three times the energy density by mass than currently used hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline, and its only combustion product (water) is environmentally benign. Despite the advances made in fuel cell technology and hydrogen production, storage remains a great hurdle. See, e.g., R. H. Wiswall et al., <i>Science, </i>186, 1158, 1974; S. Orimo et al., <i>Chem. Rev., </i>107, 4111, 2007, and L. K. Heung, On-board Hydrogen Storage System Using Metal Hydride, <i>HYPOTHESIS II, </i>1, 1997. Using current technology, hydrogen storage has a low energy storage density by volume relative to hydrocarbon fuels. Therefore, with all other factors being equal, in order to store the same amount of energy, hydrogen storage requires a much larger and heavier storage tank than hydrocarbon fuel storage.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Gravimetric capacity is a measure of the amount of hydrogen that can be stored per unit mass of the storage system. Volumetric capacity is a measure of the amount hydrogen that can be stored per unit volume of the storage system. The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has set targets for hydrogen storage. The 2017 target set by the DOE for hydrogen storage is 5.5 wt. % and 40 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>volumetric adsorption for a fully reversible system operating near room temperature. The ultimate goals are 7.5 wt % and 70 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some technologies being considered involve the use of chemical carriers such as alloys, adsorbents such as amorphous carbons (see, e.g., R. Yang et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>131, 4224, 2009), zeolites (see, e.g., A. Pacula, et al., <i>J. Phys. Chem. C, </i>112, 2764, 2008) and metal organic frameworks (MOFs)(see, e.g., K. M. Thomas, <i>Dalton Trans., </i>1487, 2009; S. S. Kaye et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>129, 14176, 2007, and N. L. Rosi et al., Science, 300, 1127, 2003).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The use of metal hydrides, such as LiH and NaAlH<sub>4 </sub>is thwarted by heat management issues and problems with slow kinetics and/or reversibility. For example, when hydrogen reacts with magnesium or a sodium-aluminum alloy to give a metal hydride such as MgH<sub>2 </sub>and NaAlH<sub>4</sub>, significant amounts of heat are given off. When this heat is produced, a cooling step must be carried out to prevent a significant rise in temperature in the system, and this cooling step constitutes an energy loss to the system. Furthermore, heating is typically necessary to remove the hydrogen when required. This is an artifact of the high enthalpies of hydrogen binding (&#x3e;60 kJ/mol) typical of hydrides such as MgH<sub>2 </sub>and NaAlH<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Compression techniques have been used to increase gas pressure and improve the energy storage density by volume for hydrogen. This allows for the storage tanks to be smaller. However, compressing hydrogen requires a significant amount of energy, often accounting for as much as 30% of the stored energy. Furthermore, large pressure vessels are required for such compression techniques.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another technique for storing hydrogen involves converting hydrogen gas to liquid hydrogen. This technique requires cryogenic storage because hydrogen has a very low boiling point (&#x2212;252.88&#xb0; C.). The liquefaction of hydrogen requires a large amount of energy to maintain these extremely low temperatures. Furthermore, the storage tank for liquid hydrogen requires complex and expensive insulation in order to prevent the liquid hydrogen from evaporating. In addition, liquid hydrogen has a lower energy density by volume than hydrocarbon fuels, such as gasoline, by a factor of about 4.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Physisorption materials, such as amorphous carbons and metal organic frameworks (MOFs), achieve promising storage capacities at temperatures of 77 K, but typically lose approximately 90% of their performance at room temperature due to low heats of adsorption (typically 5-13 kJ/mol H<sub>2</sub>). See, e.g., A. Dailly et al., <i>J. Phys. Chem. B, </i>110, 1099, 2006, J. Rowsell et al., <i>Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., </i>2005, 4670, 2005. In order to achieve the DOE target under ambient conditions, the ideal H<sub>2 </sub>binding energy is predicted to be in the range of 20-30 kJ/mol per hydrogen molecule. See, e.g., R. Lochan et al., <i>Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., </i>8, 1357, 2006. Moreover, energy production costs for the preparation of hydrogen storage materials may be an important factor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is therefore a need for improved, lower cost materials that can be used as hydrogen storage systems. Additionally, there is a need for improved methods to synthesize materials of higher purity that exhibit enhanced hydrogen storage capacity when used as hydrogen storage systems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The inventor has developed improved metal hydride compounds useful in hydrogen storage applications and processes for their preparation. The improved processes involve, in one aspect, thermal and/or photochemical precipitation of metal hydrocarbon compounds (e.g., metal alkyl and/or metal aryl compounds) in the absence of hydrogen in the presence of (a) an inert solvent, (b) a solvent without a &#x3b2;-hydrogen, or a combination thereof to form a precipitated hydrogen storage material precursor. In one aspect, the alkyl and/or aryl groups do not contain a &#x3b2;-hydrogen substituent. As a result, the solvent and the alkyl/aryl groups do not undergo &#x3b2;-hydride elimination. In another aspect, transition metal carbonyl starting materials may be utilized. The resulting precipitate may then be hydrogenated to form the metal hydride (hydrogenated precipitate) hydrogen storage material.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The inventor has surprisingly found that the initial themal and/or photochemical precipitation process forms an intermediate containing residual hydrocarbon, in what is believed to be, without wishing to be bound by theory, bridging modes. Again, without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventor theorizes that the precipitation process forms a polymer by &#x3b1;-elimination (e.g., &#x3b1;-elimination of tetramethylsilane and subsequent polymerization in the case of a bis[(trimethylsilyl)methyl] compound) to form a bridging alkylidene structure, or &#x3b3;-methyl group activation and subsequent polymerization to form a species such as -M-CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>-M-, where M is a metal such as manganese) or, in the case of a metal aryl compound, by condensation via bimolecular C&#x2014;H activation and subsequent hydrocarbon elimination (i.e., bimolecular sigma bond metathesis). It is believed that these bridging ligands create space in the downstream amorphous structure, effectively acting as templates to ensure that molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) can diffuse in and out of the structure once the bridging hydrocarbon is removed. Hydrogenation of the precipitate subsequently removes residual hydrocarbon. Again, without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventor theorizes that the resulting metal hydride (hydrogenated precipitate) contains bridging hydride ligands. The inventor has surprisingly found that metal hydride formation is only desirable in the later stages of the synthesis, i.e., following precipitation of the intermediate polymeric species (the hydrogen storage material precursor). Hydride formation at too early a stage leads to a close-packed structure having low porosity and diminished hydrogen storage capacity.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The processes described herein are efficient and, importantly, are readily commerically scalable. Additionally, the use of solvents such as supercritical xenon allows the reactions to be preformed at lower temperatures and higher concentrations, allowing for shorter reaction times with fewer side-reactions and inactive by-product formation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, and again without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventor theorizes that when using supercritical solvents such as, for example, supercritical Xe or supercritical Kr, the Xe or Kr is able to penetrate the polymer structure and passively stabilize the incipient pore structure during hydrogenation and conversion of the polymeric structure (such as &#x2014;R&#x2014;Mn&#x2014;R&#x2014;) to the metal hydride (MnH<sub>x</sub>). This is because Xe and Kr can weakly coordinate to Mn and also fill empty void space with a Xe or Kr phase of variable density. When depressurising the Xe/H<sub>2 </sub>or Kr/H<sub>2 </sub>mixture, there is no phase change between newly formed hydrocarbon which was in the solid state, but now could be in the gas phase (ie M-R+H<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;M-H and R&#x2014;H). This prevents a sudden &#x201c;explosion&#x201d; and cracking or collapsing of the pore structure. This is because there is no phase change in a supercritical fluid. Additional benefits of using a supercritical fluid as a solvent include that it has a broad range of densities (unlike a liquid), is completely inert, weakly coordinating to transition metals, and is also capable of dissolving a broad range of organometallic polymers, which are sparingly soluble in hydrocarbons. For example, having a higher concentration of dialkyl or diaryl manganese complex in an inert supercritical fluid would favour a faster and more selective condensation reaction with the possibilities of higher temperatures (i.e., faster reactions) without side reactions. Additionally, supercritical Xe and Kr are known to be superior solvents for C&#x2014;H activation reactions because they bind to the substrate more weakly than competing organic solvent molecules. This has been demonstrated by comparing reaction rates of organomanganese Xe, Kr, and heptane complexes. See, e.g., Grills et al., <i>J. Phys. Chem. A., </i>104, 4300-4307, 2000.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Moreover, variation in reaction temperature, pressure, and synthesis times may be used to tune the final porosity and hydrogen storage properties (including volumetric and gravimetric density) of the final metal hydride storage material by controlling pore size. The present inventor has found that the composition of the metal hydride storage material is not the only factor that governs its hydrogen storage properties. Controlling the nanostructure of the metal hydride storage material is also important to tuning its hydrogen storage activity.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, the processes described herein allow for formation of a hydrogen storage material (metal hydride) monolith, (e.g., a solid block of hydrogen storage material (metal hydride) as opposed to a powder) which can be maintained in the synthesis vessel (which may be the storage system itself, i.e., any of the reactions described herein may be performed directly in the storage system) and used as is in the storage system, or removed and stacked with other monoliths in a different storage system. Tuning the pore structure, density, and hydrogen storage properties of the final monolith in situ with pressure, concentration, temperature of the supercritical solvent, and hydrogen pressure, etc. allows for a convenient one-step route which avoids having to pelletize the hydrogen storage material (metal hydride) and pack it into storage tanks. See, e.g., Hebb et al., <i>Chem. Mater., </i>15, 2016-2069, 2003; Cooper et al., <i>Adv. Mater., </i>15(13), 1049-1059, 2003.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The metal hydrides (hydrogenated precipitates) prepared by the processes described herein exhibit enhanced hydrogen storage capacity

The term &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; as used in connection with the compositions described herein can alternatively cover compositions &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; or &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; the recited components.</p><p id="p-0487" num="0483">The term &#x201c;coordinate&#x201d; as used here is not limited to a specific type of interaction between a metal center and hydrogen. For example, in one embodiment, the interaction between a metal center and hydrogen is a Kubas interaction.</p><p id="p-0488" num="0484">The term &#x201c;Kubas interaction&#x201d; refers to hydrogen bound in a non-dissociative manner as a dihydrogen molecule to a transition metal center. In a Kubas interaction, free d-electrons of a metal centre interact with hydrogen. Specifically, where the metal centre has a low coordination number, the dihydrogen shares both of its &#x3c3;-bonding electrons with the metal centre, and the metal centre back donates electrons by overlap of its &#x3c0; symmetry d-orbital with the empty antibonding &#x3c3;* empty orbital of the dihydrogen. This results in a lengthening of the H&#x2014;H bond (without rupture) and a shift to a lower wavenumber for the H&#x2014;H resonance (see, e.g. <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>119, 9179-9190, 1997).</p><p id="p-0489" num="0485">Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventor theorizes that one or more (such as 2 or more, such as 3, 4 or 5) H<sub>2 </sub>molecules interact with the metal centers by Kubas interactions to form metal hydrides of the formula MH<sub>x </sub>(optionally further comprising residual hydrocarbon and/or solvent) in which x can be approximately an even number, e.g., about 4, about 6, about 8, about 10 or about 12. However, bimolecular and/or free radical processes may also occur leading to metal hydrides of the formula MH<sub>x </sub>in which x can approximately an odd number, e.g., about 3, about 5, about 7, about 9, about 11 or about 13. Additionally, mixed metal hydrides, in which variable x is a non integer may also be formed by continuous (not stepwise) adsorption.</p><p id="p-0490" num="0486">The term &#x201c;substantially free&#x201d; as used herein means containing less than about 2 wt %, such as less than about 1 wt %, less than about 0.5 wt %, less than about 0.1 wt %, less than about 0.05 wt %, less than about 0.01 wt %, less than about 0.005 wt % or less than about 0.001 wt % of a specified element or compound.</p><p id="p-0491" num="0487">In one embodiment, the term &#x201c;residue&#x201d; refers to any carbon containing group that may be present in a precipitate or hydrogenated precipitate described herein. For example, the residue may be a solvent used in the formation of the precipitate or hydrogenated precipitate that has not been fully removed during the synthesis process. Another example of a residue may be a ligand (e.g., trimethylsilylmethyl, mesityl, benzyl or neopentyl) that is not fully removed from the metal center during formation of the precipitate or hydrogenated precipitate. The residue may also be a compound (e.g., a protic compound, such as methanol) that is added to the hydrogenated precipitate in order to increase microporosity of the hydrogenated precipitate structure (e.g., by forming bridging methoxide ligands within the structure), thereby facilitating H<sub>2 </sub>moving in and out of the hydrogenated precipitate. The term &#x201c;residue&#x201d; may also refer to residual metal halide, such as MgCl<sub>2</sub>, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, LiCl, LiI, etc.</p><p id="p-0492" num="0488">As used herein, in one embodiment the term &#x201c;thermodynamically neutral&#x201d; refers to the net enthalpy changes associated with either the process of hydrogen adsorption and/or the process of hydrogen desprotion when averaged over the whole metal hydride sample. For example, the net enthalpy changes associated with either the process of hydrogen adsorption and/or the process of hydrogen desprotion, when averaged over the bulk sample, are close to 0 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>H<sub>2</sub>. Typically, hydrogen adsorption on a microscopic basis exhibits a range of enthalpies between about &#x2212;5 and &#x2212;70 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>H<sub>2</sub>. Without wishing being bound to theory, the inventor theorizes that the energy required by external pressure to open up binding sites in the metal hydride is approximately equal and opposite to the exothermic M-H bond forming process, resulting in effective enthalpy buffering and thermodynamic neutrality. Also without being bound to theory, the inventor theorizes that the energy required to open up the hydrogen binding sites in the metal hydrides described herein is provided by the gradually increasing external pressure of the hydrogen, which is roughly equal and opposite in value to the energy involved in hydrogen binding to the metal enters resulting in thermodynamic neutrality, and can be rationalised by the energy required to twist the amorphous structure into a conformation favourable for hydrogen binding.

Without wishing to be bound by theory, the present inventor theorizes that the presence of the &#x3c0;-acid ligand (such as, e.g., CO) may stabilize the structure of the hydrogen storage material (metal hydride, hydrogenated precipitate) due to the propensity of CO to form bridges between metal centres. For example, in one embodiment, the &#x3c0;-acid ligand (such as, e.g., CO) is terminally bound to the metal center (M). In another embodiment, the &#x3c0;-acid ligand (such as, e.g., CO) bridges between two metal (M) centers in a ketonic fashion (e.g., (M-(CO)-M). In another embodiment, the &#x3c0;-acid ligand (such as, e.g., CO) bridges two metal (M) centers in a multidentate fashion (e.g., M-C&#x2014;O-M). In another embodiment, the &#x3c0;-acid ligand (such as, e.g., CO) bridges three metal (M) centers. The bound &#x3c0;-acid ligand (such as CO) may add structural stability through cycling and also mechanical stability to the microporous structure to vibrations, because of strong M/&#x3c0;-acid ligand bridging interactions.</p><p id="p-0518" num="0514">In one embodiment, any of the hydrogen storage materials described herein (such as metal hydrides and hydrogenated precipitates) contain a &#x3c0;-acid ligand added in an amount ranging from about 0.1 to about 5 mol %, such as about 1 to about 5 mol %, about 1 to about 4 mol %, about 1 to about 3 mol %, or about 1 to about 2 mol %, relative to the metal (M) center, such as Mn.</p><p id="p-0519" num="0515">In one embodiment, any of the hydrogen storage materials described herein (such as metal hydrides and hydrogenated precipitates) contain a &#x3c0;-acid ligand present.

The storing of hydrogen may be carried out in a storage system.</p><p id="p-0521" num="0517">One embodiment of a storage system suitable for hydrogen storage is a pressure vessel. For example, the pressure vessel may hold the metal hydride of the present invention at a temperature of up to 200&#xb0; C., e.g., from about &#x2212;100 to about 150&#xb0; C., from about &#x2212;50 to about 0&#xb0; C., from about &#x2212;25 to about 0&#xb0; C., from about 0 to about 150&#xb0; C., from about 0 to about 50&#xb0; C., from about 10 to about 30&#xb0; C. or from about 20 to about 25&#xb0; C. In one embodiment, the storage system is substantially free of oxygen.</p><p id="p-0522" num="0518">Hydrogen may be added to the storage system (e.g., a pressure vessel) and stored using the hydrogenated precipitates of the present invention. In one embodiment, no heating is required when adding hydrogen to the pressure vessel for storage.</p><p id="p-0523" num="0519">The amount of hydrogen that can be stored by the hydrogenated precipitates of the present invention is proportional to the pressure in the storage system. For example, at higher pressures, more hydrogen can be stored by the metal hydrides of the present invention. The pressure in the storage system may be increased by adding hydrogen to the storage system. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the inventor theorizes that as the pressure is increased, the number of Kubas interactions per metal centre may increase. As noted above, however, this process will appear continuous in the bulk state, resulting in the formation of a bulk material containing hydrogenated precipitates having a mixture of coordinated hydrogen molecules, and, therefore, an overall non-integer stoichiometry of manganese to hydrogen. Furthermore it may be possible (e.g., via a free radical and/or bimolecular process) to form molecular species of the formula MH<sub>3</sub>, MH<sub>5</sub>, MH<sub>7</sub>, MH<sub>9 </sub>and MH, etc.</p><p id="p-0524" num="0520">In further embodiments, any of the hydrogenated precipitates described herein optionally contain one or more additional metals (e.g., a metal other than titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel and copper).

For example, the hydrogenated precipitate may contain one or more additional metals selected from zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, technetium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, any of the hydrogenated precipitates described herein may optionally contain one or more additional period 4, period 5 or period 6 transition metals. In another embodiment, the hydrogenated precipitates may contain one or more additional metals selected from iron, zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, technetium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, cadmium, hafnium, tantalum, tungsten, rhenium, osmium, iridium, platinum, gold, mercury, and combinations thereof. The one or more additional metals may be present in an amount of about 50 wt. % or less, about 40 wt. % or less, about 30 wt. % or less, about 25 wt. % or less, about 20 wt % or less, about 10 wt % or less, about 5 wt % or less, about 1 wt % or less, about 0.75 wt % or less, about 0.5 wt % or less, about 0.25 wt % or less, about 0.1 wt % or less, about 0.05 wt % or less or about 0.01 wt % or less.

For example, this may be accomplished by reducing the pressure of hydrogen in the system. In one embodiment, no heating is required in order to release the hydrogen from the metal hydride. For example, a valve in the storage system may be opened to allow hydrogen gas to escape from the system, thus decreasing the pressure in the storage system. In one embodiment, about 100% of the stored hydrogen is released. In additional embodiments, greater than about 50%, greater than about 55%, greater than about 60%, greater than about 70%, greater than about 75%, greater than about 80%, greater than about 90%, greater than about 95%, greater than about 97.5%, greater than about 99% or greater than about 99.5% of the hydrogen is released. The step of releasing the hydrogen pressure in the system may be carried out by allowing hydrogen gas to escape from the system, thus decreasing the hydrogen pressure. For instance, the step of releasing the hydrogen pressure may decrease the hydrogen pressure in the system to 100 atm or less (such as to 50 atm or less, 30 atm or less, or 20 atm or less). In another embodiment, the hydrogen is released from the storage system by increasing the temperature of the system.</p><p id="p-0528" num="0524">Hydrogen may be added or released from the system at any point throughout the entire pressure gradient of the system without any adverse effects to the storage capacity of the system.

For example, the system can be filled with hydrogen and emptied of hydrogen at least 100, such as at least 200, at least 500, at least 1000 or at least 1500 times without a significant decrease in the storage capacity of the system.</p><p id="p-0529" num="0525">In one embodiment, the storage system (e.g. pressure vessel) is a fuel tank in a vehicle, such as a truck or automobile.</p><p id="p-0530" num="0526"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of a storage system useful in the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of the storage system attached to a hydrogen fuel cell.
