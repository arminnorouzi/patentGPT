In one aspect, a device includes a cartridge structured to include one or more chambers containing one or more scented substances contained in a corresponding chamber, a housing structured to include a compartment to hold the cartridge, an opening to allow the scented sub stances to dispense to an outer environment from the device, and one or more transporting channels formed between the compartment and the opening, in which each of the one or more transporting channels is configured to accelerate a scented substance from the corresponding chamber to the opening, and an actuator switch arranged in a corresponding transporting channel and operable to move between an open position and a closed position based on an applied signal to selectively allow passage of the scented substance from the corresponding transporting path.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="127.68mm" wi="141.22mm"

Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Disclosed are highly scalable techniques, systems, and devices for on-demand dispensing and delivery of scented substances, e.g., including liquids, vapors or gas. Scent delivery devices of the disclosed technology include convenient, remote, electrically actuatable scent-release components based on, e.g., latchable magnetic, piezoelectric, or thermally actuatable switches and mechanisms. In some implementations, for example, the scent delivery devices include nanoscale and microscale material structures to control formation and/or delivery of fluids (e.g., such as liquids, vapors, or gases) to produce the scented substances. In some implementations, for example, the disclosed technology provides capability to selectively release one or more of many different types of gases or liquids, e.g., using X-Y matrix operational release systems. The present technology offers the miniaturization of the scent delivery mechanism while maximizing the number of different scents that can be stored, dispensed, and cycled or sequenced in an automated fashion and/or on demand. Applications of the present technology include, but are not limited to, the delivery of a scented gas into a localized space (e.g., such as the headspace of an individual) that is highly suited, among other things, to virtual, sensory, or augmented reality experiences and entertainment.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">By increasing the potential number of different scents for relatively rapid sequential delivery, e.g., the disclosed scent delivery devices offer the possibility of more complex and sophisticated sensory (olfactory) communication, sampling, branding or advertising, as well as greater dramatic possibilities and/or enhanced realism within a virtual or augmented reality or sensory experience. For example, in some cases, the disclosed devices can be used as an olfactory display or as a caller identifier in a mobile phone. In other examples, the disclosed devices can be used in motion pictures or videogames (e.g., by way of a wide range of multi-scent tracks available for delivery timed coincident with scenes, actions or elements of drama). Other exemplary applications of nano- or micro-device control and on demand delivery of scented gas or liquids include, for example, (a) point of sale or augmented reality advertising; (b) scented packaging; (c) fragrance-emitting jewelry embedded with the mechanism/device to dispense and cycle different perfumes, selected, set by or reacting to biofeedback of the wearer, in which the mechanism generates an invisible cloud of scent in or around the immediate space near or around the wearer; (d) air fresheners in small, enclosed spaces such as shelving or other furnishings, or that can be attached to fixtures; (e) olfactory branding or signaling; (f) military applications for control or influence of individual behavior; (g) aromatherapy; (h) medical therapy, drug delivery or remote or virtual surgery; (i) hygiene; (j) education; and/or (k) use in multi-sensory apparatuses providing neurological, multi-modal effects, among other applications.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The disclosed technology provides several advantages. One exemplary advantage of the present technology is the versatile design using a simplified valve-containing dispensing or valveless dispensing that allows the choice of scents (e.g., including chemicals in a carrier gas) by the user on demand. Such designs include exemplary &#x2018;latachable-switch gating&#x2019; mechanisms of the disclosed technology. For example, these exemplary gating mechanisms not only replaces the need for complicated mechanical valves, but also minimizes the electrical input necessary to control the gating, and is also scalable to small dimensions, e.g., including on a millimeter scale, thereby adding to the reduction in size and weight (and portability, placement or wearability) of a device or apparatus embodying the technology.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Some existing systems utilize a valveless system capable of dispensing small volumes of scents into a localized space, however, the technical requirements of the dimensions of the delivery capillaries diameters and lengths are, in themselves, limiting. An advantage of the present technology is that there are no such limitations. Some other existing systems that use a valveless technology employ a primary method of evaporating and dispensing a scented gas via a heating element whose time required to create a required volume of scented gas is comparatively disadvantaged to the present technology whose mechanisms enable the rapid generation of a scented gas. These and other existing scent generating devices also have limitations in terms speed, dimension, selectivity and durability. Also, existing technologies currently employed to selectively release scents into a localized space, or headspace, are limited by the number of different scents capable of being cycled or sequenced, timed and controlled for on-demand precision delivery. Moreover, machines that do have scalable multi-scenting capability and precision timed control and delivery of scented gas into a headspace (or to the nose) such as olfactomers are relatively large in size and are not portable or wearable.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The disclosed technology can also include the use of &#x2018;cold diffusion&#x2019; technology, which, for example, generates a scented gas without the use of heating as a primary mechanism to evaporate a scent-carrying liquid. Delivery of evaporated scent via the present technology also obviates the inherent deposition and other disadvantages and risks in delivering atomized scent at close range to an object or individual. Cold diffusion also avoids certain limitations or drawbacks associated with using heating as the primary mechanism to evaporate a liquid, including the energy required to achieve fast evaporation for rapid gas formation and delivery, and undesirably altering the properties or behavior of the scent-generating chemical components by heating.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Other primary mechanisms for generating an evaporated (e.g., completely evaporated) scented gas can include the passage of air on the surface of a scented solvent or other material, or through a porous solid, gel or other scented substance. In the present technology, for example in one embodiment, microbubbles of air are created and pumped through a solvent or oil containing scented material and generating a scented gas upon exit at the surface of the solvent or oil. The use of microbubbles in such a way maximizes the potential for large surface area contact of air (or gas) within the scented solvent or oil, thereby increasing potential diffusion, and as a result reducing the time necessary to deliver a desired volume of scented air.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Most examples of existing selective scent releasing and delivery systems introduced to-date are limited by either ineffective control, lack of precision timing deliverable to the intended target, unwanted mix of scents during sequenced delivery, lingering scent in the environment, the mechanical reliability, energy efficiency and/or the cost and size of the delivery apparatus. Diffusion of a large volume of scent into a large area is comparatively difficult to quickly clear from the air (or dissipate), thereby limiting the rapidity with which a succeeding scent can be delivered &#x2018;cleanly&#x2019; to individuals within the space. For entertainment applications, for example, in many instances scented air is released into the general space of a theater via the ventilation system or fans, or in and around seating. Such conventional delivery mechanisms inherently have limited or no multiplexing capabilities, nor can they provide rapid scent delivery capability precision-timed to the headspaces of individuals. Further, the existing systems have difficulty providing simultaneous scented air delivery (of uniform distribution) to each member of an audience, in synchrony with a specific event or time within an audiovisual presentation such as a motion picture or videogame. Examples of existing systems that can release scent within seating area include the Sensorama game system from which a scent is released from the chair according to the displayed scene and the steering wheel can provide mechanical vibrations. In movies such as those in the AMLUX theatre, scents were released in conjunction with visual images. Scent release by evaporating or spraying a scented material has been utilized for the training of fire-fighters and scent-emitting collars have been employed for the training of soldiers. However, many of these known approaches are impractical, operationally unreliable, or limited in their capacity for precision-timed, multiplexing scent delivery. Therefore, there is a need for a reliable scent release and delivery system having rapidly switchable, automated and/or remote, actuatable and multi-cycle durable characteristics, that incorporate x-y matrix operational systems enabling controlled, timed scent release from many different sources of scents (with a minimal number of controlling mechanisms).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a block diagram of an exemplary scent delivery device <b>100</b> of the disclosed technology. The device <b>100</b> includes a housing or casing unit <b>110</b> structured to include a compartment <b>111</b> to hold a cartridge <b>120</b> containing one or a plurality of scented substances. The scented substances can include any of a variety of fluids, e.g., including a liquid, a gas, or a vapor. The housing <b>110</b> of the device <b>100</b> is structured to include one or more openings <b>113</b> to allow the scented substances to dispense to an outer environment from the device <b>100</b>. The housing <b>110</b> of the device <b>100</b> is structured to include one or more transporting channels <b>115</b> formed between the compartment <b>111</b> and the opening(s) <b>113</b>. In various exemplary embodiments of the device <b>100</b>, a transporting channel <b>115</b> is configured to deliver or accelerate a scented substance from a storage chamber, e.g., of the cartridge <b>120</b>, to the opening <b>113</b>. The cartridge <b>120</b> supplying the scented substances to the scent delivery device <b>100</b> can be structured to include one or more chambers <b>121</b> containing the one or more scented substances, for example, where a particular scented substance can be contained in a particular corresponding chamber. The device <b>100</b> can be implemented to control the delivery of one or more of the scented substances to the outer environment, e.g., including a headspace of a user. To provide such control, the device <b>100</b> includes one or more actuator switches <b>130</b>, in which an actuator switch <b>130</b> is arranged in a corresponding transporting channel <b>115</b> and operable to move between an open position and a closed position based on an applied signal to selectively allow passage of the scented substance to flow through and/or from the corresponding transporting path <b>115</b>. The actuator switches <b>130</b> of the device <b>100</b> can include a magnetic actuated gating switch mechanism, a piezoelectric actuated gating switch mechanism, and/or a thermal actuated gating switch mechanism or device of the disclosed technology. Examples of the magnetic, piezoelectric, and thermal actuated switch mechanisms and devices are described herein.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a schematic illustration of an exemplary magnetically actuated latchable switch <b>200</b> of the disclosed technology. For example, the magnetically actuated latchable switch <b>200</b> can be positioned in the device <b>100</b>, e.g., in the transporting channel <b>115</b>, so that the flow of the scented substance can be regulated by actuation of the switch <b>200</b>. The magnetically latchable switch <b>200</b> includes a latchable (square M-H loop) magnetic alloy cantilever <b>203</b>, which is surrounded by a solenoid <b>201</b> to supply a pulse current to instantaneously magnetize the cantilever <b>203</b>. For example, the latchable square M-H loop cantilever <b>203</b> can be configured to be 0.05-0.5 mm thick, 0.1-2 mm wide, 1.0-5 mm long). For example, the mini solenoid <b>201</b> can be configured around the cantilever <b>203</b> including 1000 turns. The magnetically latchable switch <b>200</b> includes a mating cantilever <b>202</b> that contacts the cantilever <b>203</b> in a closed position (e.g., at a first magnetic state) and moves away from the cantilever <b>203</b> in an open position to provide an opening or orifice (e.g., at a second magnetic state).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The exemplary magnetically latchable switch <b>200</b> can open or close with a single pulse magnetic field, e.g., supplied with a pulse current. The latchable (square M-H loop) magnetic alloy cantilever <b>203</b> is placed inside a mini solenoid to supply the pulse current to instantaneously magnetize the cantilever. For operation of the magnetic latchable switch <b>200</b>, the mating magnetic cantilever <b>202</b> is arranged to couple to the cantilever <b>203</b> in the closed position, and can be configured as a stationary magnet or as a movable cantilever. The mating magnetic material <b>202</b> can be a soft magnet (e.g., a permalloy, for example, having 80% Ni-20% Fe in weight % or 45% Ni-55% Fe, or a silicon steel, or other), a semi-hard magnet (e.g., Fe&#x2014;Cr, Fe&#x2014;Ni, and other magnetic alloys), or a permanent magnet (e.g., Fe&#x2014;Cr&#x2014;Co, Vicalloy, Sm&#x2014;Co coated cantilever).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The magnetic properties of a magnetic material can be described by several parameters, e.g., including a saturation magnetization (Bs) that indicates the highest possible magnetization value in the given material, the remanent magnetization (Br) that indicates the remaining magnetization value after the applied field is removed to zero field, and the coercive force (Hc) which is an indication of a required external applied magnetic field that needs to be applied to reduce/force the magnetization of the material to zero, which indicates how hard or soft the magnetic material is.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref> show schematic diagrams of another exemplary magnetically latchable switch <b>210</b> for closing and opening of an orifice to control dispensing of a scent. The magnetically actuated latchable switch <b>210</b> can be composed of two mating magnetic components that can be independently controlled by externally applied pulse magnetic field, for example, by sending an electric current through a solenoid to cause one of the magnetic component to move from one position to another, e.g., to and from an open and a closed position. For example, the magnetically actuated latchable switch <b>200</b> can be positioned in the device <b>100</b>, e.g., in the transporting channel <b>115</b>, so that the flow of the scented substance can be regulated by actuation of the switch <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the two magnetic mating components <b>211</b> and <b>214</b> of the magnetically latchable switch <b>210</b>.

The switch <b>210</b> includes a tip or plug <b>212</b> attached to the magnetic component arm <b>211</b>, which contacts a ring or component <b>213</b> having an orifice to allow passage of the scented substance. The tip <b>212</b> contacts the plug <b>213</b> in the closed position such that the tip <b>212</b> blocks the orifice and prevents the scented substance from flowing through. The tip <b>212</b> is moved out of contact with the plug <b>212</b> when the magnetic component arm <b>211</b> is moved.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, when the square loop, magnetically latchable wire or ribbon of the magnetic component <b>214</b> is pulse magnetized to the high-magnetization remanent state of Br, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the magnetized member in the solenoid attracts the soft magnet (or hard magnet) cantilever <b>211</b> so that the exemplary mechanically soft, elastomer-tip <b>212</b> of the cantilever <b>211</b> is moved down to contact the plug <b>213</b> and block the orifice from allowing the scent to flow through, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. For example, the tip <b>212</b> can be formed of a mechanically soft material including a suitable elastomeric material, e.g., such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). When the magnetically latchable wire or ribbon in the solenoid is demagnetized, e.g., by a short 60 Hz gradually diminishing field applied by the solenoid (e.g., using gradually reduced current, for example, 0.1-1 second), the magnetization of the wire or ribbon in the solenoid is reduced to near zero, which is represented at the origin of the plot in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The magnetic attractive force between the two mating cantilevers <b>211</b> and <b>214</b> is reduced well below the critical force required to overcome the mechanical spring force that tends to keep the cantilevers straight.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The magnetic cantilever <b>211</b> is then released and the orifice is opened. In some implementations, for example, the magnetic cantilever <b>211</b>, if it is made of a soft magnet alloy, can be pre-curvatured or positioned spaced apart (e.g., such that the two cantilevers can be parallel pre-positioned with a spacing gap of 0.1-2 mm), and the two cantilevers can be separated (switch open) by the elastic restoring spring force. Alternatively, if the magnetic cantilever <b>211</b> is made of permanent magnet, the cantilever <b>214</b> in the solenoid is magnetized to an opposite magnetic polarity by applied pulse magnetic field (e.g., by DC pulse electric current applied to the surrounding solenoid) to actively repel each other. There are several exemplary variations of switch open vs. close operations that can be utilized depending on the specific operational needs and the nature of the magnetic cantilever materials utilized.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The exemplary magnetically latchable, scent release switch that can open or close with a single DC pulse magnetic field is highly practical and energy-saving, as a continuous supply of electric current to keep the valve open or closed would consume much energy and can also cause undesirable heating of the scent delivery device <b>100</b>. For example, an exemplary DC pulse of the applied current can be configured to be shorter than 1 second, e.g., in some implementations shorter than 0.1 second, and in other implementations, for example, less than 0.01 second. For example, the magnitude of the applied magnetic field can be configured to be at least 30% higher than the coercive force of the core magnetic material within the solenoid, e.g. in some implementations at least 50% higher, and in other implementations, for example, at least 100% higher than the coercive force of the magnetic material within the solenoid.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some implementations of the exemplary latchable-switch gating mechanism, a brief pulse type magnetic field (e.g., generated by applied current to the solenoid) can be utilized to produce the latchable magnetic response of the magnetically actuated latchable switch, e.g., such as the exemplary switch <b>200</b> and <b>210</b>. Notably, such operation can be implemented instead of a continuous application of the energy-consuming electric current and hence a continuous application of the magnetic field. For example, the pulse magnetic field needs only to be applied just once for magnetization. However, for the sake of ensuring the proper magnetization, the DC current pulse may optionally be applied more than once. An application of multiple pulses less than 10 times can be acceptable, in which the multiple pulses can be applied to ensure the magnetic switching.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows a magnetization plot of an exemplary square loop magnetic material with optimally low magnetic coercivity suitable for the exemplary magnetically actuated latchable switch. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C</figref> show images of exemplary square loop magnetic material structures by spinodal decomposition of Fe&#x2014;Cr&#x2014;Co alloy to produce spherical Fe-rich, strongly magnetic phase followed by uniaxial plastic deformation to elongate the phase to impart shape anisotropy.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, an important feature for the exemplary solenoid configuration of the magnetic latchable switch is the square loop of the magnetic element in the solenoid. The latchable nature of the scent release/close switch is important for practical applications. As such, in such exemplary implementations, a switch open/close operation can be performed with a single short DC pulse of e.g., 0.01-5 milliseconds: the electrical energy used is relatively small since the electrical current does not need to be supplied once the switch open/close operation is done in a millisecond level time frame. The demagnetization to remove much of the previous magnetization, for example, to male two magnetically attached components to be separated, can be accomplished by gradually diminishing the AC magnetic field applied by the solenoid current, which can also be very fast, requiring between a 0.1-1 second time frame, for example, for 60 Hz AC current signals. For example, to minimize solenoid heating and magnetic material heating on AC current and AC magnetic field application, the number of demagnetizing cycle can be performed in less than 1 second, and in some implementations, for example, preferably less than 0.3 seconds.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to the disclosed technology, for example, the desired squareness of the B-H loop (the Br/Bs ratio of the remanent magnetization Br in the absence of applied field vs. the magnetic saturation magnetization Bs) in the latchable magnetic cantilever material can be configured to be at least 0.8 for efficient operation of latchable scent release or scent blockage functionality of the magnetically latchable switch. In some implementations, for example, the squareness of the B-H loop can be configured to be at least 0.9, or in some implementations, for example, at least 0.95.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">For example, to guard against inadvertent magnetic switching by stray field and unintended scent release, the coercive force Hc can be configured to be at least 10 Oe, and in some implementations, for example, at least 20 Oe, and even in some implementations, for example, at least 40 Oe. In order to perform the magnetization and magnetic switching with a reasonable, overly excessive magnetic field, the desired Hc should also be preferably less than 100 Oe, and in some exemplary cases, less than 50 Oe.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, in order to obtain such a latchable magnetic material, a magnetic alloy, preferably ductile and plastically formable alloy, can be subjected to materials processing of anisotropic uniaxial deformation, e.g., such as wire drawing, swaging, extrusion, and cold working. An example is an Fe-25-35% Cr-6-12% Co alloy that can be spinodally decomposed to have a two phase structure including near-spherical Fe, Co-rich, stronger magnetic phase nanoparticles, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, embedded in a weakly magnetic or nonmagnetic matrix phase, so that subsequent processing can produce desirable switchable magnetic behavior of the material. The spherical magnetic phase can then be elongated by uniaxial plastic deformation of the alloy wire or rod, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, which provides a shape anisotropy and square loop with the Br/Bs squareness ratio in excess of 0.8-0.9. The coercive force Hc can also be enhanced to any value from 30-500 Oe depending on the duration of heat treatment. As the preferred Hc is an intermediate value, it is desirable to shorten the heat treatment process in such a way to provide Hc of less than 100 Oe, and in some implementations, for example, less than 50 Oe. The exemplary spinodal alloys such as Fe&#x2014;Cr&#x2014;Co also respond to the magnetic field heat treatment in the presence of magnetic field of, e.g., 300-100 Oe, and provides square loop magnetic properties.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Other latchable magnet alloys can also be designed and fabricated, for example, alloys such as Fe-20% Cr, Fe-20% Cr-4% Ni, Fe-15% Cr-3% Mo can be uniaxially deformed to produce latchable semi-hard magnet alloys.

As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the magnetization change from the demagnetized state (the origin) follows the dotted curve as the applied magnetic field is increased. From the oppositely magnetized state (the &#x2212;Br state), the magnetization change upon applying a positive magnetic field follows the solid curve. Therefore, the applied field H<sub>1 </sub>cannot switch the magnetization direction from the zero magnetization (the origin) or from &#x2212;Br state to +Br state while the applied field H<sub>2</sub>, being larger than the coercive force Hc, can switch the magnetization.

The magnetic actuator switch includes a magnetically latchable and vertically-movable component <b>501</b>, e.g., such as a pole, rod, or other shaped structure, aligned vertically within the channel <b>506</b>. In some examples, the vertically-moveable component can be configured with lubricated guide. The magnetic actuator switch includes a solenoid wrapped around the component <b>501</b> to pulse magnetize the component <b>501</b>. The magnetic actuator switch includes a complaint tip <b>503</b> on one end of the component <b>501</b>. In some implementations, for example, the compliant tip <b>503</b> can be formed of PDMS. The magnetic actuator switch includes a soft orifice-having structure <b>504</b> configured in the transport channel and structured to include an orifice that allows the scented substance to flow through the channel. For example, the soft orifice-having structure <b>504</b> can be formed of PDMS. The component <b>501</b> is positioned on one side of the structure <b>504</b> such that the tip <b>503</b> is aligned with the orifice of the structure <b>504</b>.

For example, the solenoid (or ribbon) <b>502</b> of the magnetic component <b>501</b> can be connected to a conduit to supply an applied signal to magnetize the magnetic component <b>501</b>. In some implementations, for example, the solenoid <b>502</b> can be connected to the wall of the channel path <b>506</b>. For example, when the applied field is greater than the coercive force Hc, the magnetization polarity switching can activate and the latchable magnet position is obtained for closure or opening of the orifice.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, operation of the magnetically switchable and latchable gates require only a small amount of energy as the switch ON or OFF process takes a very short pulse current to complete the magnetic attraction or repulsion, e.g., such as 0.001 second to 1.0 second of electrical current application. Therefore, the use of energy by the exemplary device is minimal, and also such a short pulse operation allows the sending of a larger current, if needed, without excessively heating or burning the electrical circuits. The electric current or voltage can be supplied by other energy source, e.g., such as by using DC or AC electrical connections, batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, or other energy-providing devices.

The exemplary vertical arranged thermal actuator switch can be latchable in exemplary designs including a mechanical latch saw-tooth structure. For example, the degree of thermal expansion can be intentionally adjusted so as to make the moving portion click on a step-like mechanical latch, while additional thermal expansion, e.g., by a short period increased electrical heater operation to a higher temperature to move the spring part further to the left (e.g., this is allowable since the material is surrounded by mechanically soft and compliant PDMS elastomer) and release of the mechanical step saw-tooth latch so that the thermal contraction on ceased current flow brings back the moving part back to the right to open the valve.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of a piezoelectric actuator switch <b>700</b> in a horizontal configuration in a transporting channel.

For a relatively small number of different scents (e.g., less than 50), each of the scent release chambers can be independently addressed by an on-off command mechanism. However, as the available total possible number of different scents increases in a multiplexing system, individual control becomes increasingly complicated and cumbersome (e.g., a multiplexing system of up to 10,000 different scent chambers). According to the disclosed technology, for example, an X-Y matrix operation incorporating the latchable magnetic scent release mechanism and other switching is described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>18</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a illustrative diagram of the exemplary magnetic latchable switch <b>500</b> that may be opened by demagnetizing the remanent magnetization in the core of the electromagnet using a transistor-based control circuit to control the application of the signal to cause actuation. As shown in the exemplary diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, both transistors T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> must be turned &#x201c;on&#x201d; for current to flow through the wire <b>1301</b> wound around the core and for the latch to open allowing the odorant to escape.

The scented substance (e.g, gas odor) can be loaded into the lower chamber and subject to pressurized, pumped, or fan-assisted air. This scented air cannot escape the chamber so long as the magnetic latch remains closed due to remanent magnetization of the electromagnets core. For example, once both transistors are turned on by grounding the otherwise open circuit connected to the base (e.g., a transistor switch setup), current is allowed to flow through the circuit, including the solenoid to operate with the doubled current (e.g., equivalent to H<sub>2 </sub>field in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) to induce the magnetic switching and the scent gate open or close activation. If the electric current equivalent to the magnetic field strength H<sub>1 </sub>is applied (e.g., without combining the X-current and Y-current), the field strength is not sufficient to activate the core of the solenoid to magnetically switch. A gradually diminishing field cycle may then be used to demagnetize the core and open the latch. To close the latch again, a pulse current can be applied and then removed leaving remanent magnetization behind to hold the latch closed.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> shows a schematic of an exemplary 3&#xd7;3 matrix of magnetic latches and transistors in a transistor-based control circuit for controlling the row and column of a selected latch.

For example, once both transistors are turned on by grounding the otherwise open circuit connected to the transistor base (e.g., a transistor switch setup), voltage is applied and current is allowed to flow through the circuit, including the actuator. The piezoelectric effect is contraction, thereby opening the pore and allowing scented gas to flow.
