Refrigerant flows to the evaporator <b>108</b> from other components of the refrigeration system through fluid channels <b>136</b> (best seen on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). The refrigerant flows through the evaporator <b>108</b> in internal channels through the first portion <b>128</b>, the living hinge <b>132</b>, and the second portion <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The space <b>137</b> (best seen on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) between the outer wall of the evaporator <b>108</b> and the inner wall of the casing of the pod-machine interface <b>106</b> is filled with an insulating material to reduce heat exchange between the environment and the evaporator <b>108</b>. In the machine <b>100</b>, the space <b>137</b> is filled with an aerogel (not shown). Some machines use other insulating material, for example, an annulus (such as an airspace), insulating foams made of various polymers, or fiberglass wool.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The evaporator <b>108</b> has an open position and a closed position. In the open position, the gap <b>134</b> opens to provide an air gap between the first portion <b>128</b> and the second portion <b>130</b>. In the machine <b>100</b>, the first portion <b>128</b> and the second portion <b>130</b> are pressed together in the closed position. In some machines, the first and second portion are pressed towards each other and the gap is reduced, but still defined by a space between the first and second portions in the closed position.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The inner diameter ID of the evaporator <b>108</b> is slightly larger in the open position than in the closed position. Pods can be inserted into and removed from the evaporator <b>108</b> while the evaporator is in the open position. Transitioning the evaporator <b>108</b> from its open position to its closed position after a pod is inserted tightens the evaporator <b>108</b> around the outer diameter of the pod. For example, the machine <b>100</b> is configured to use pods with 2.085&#x2033; outer diameter. The evaporator <b>108</b> has an inner diameter of 2.115&#x2033; in the open position and an inner diameter inner diameter of 2.085&#x2033; in the closed position. Some machines have evaporators sized and configured to cool other pods. The pods can be formed from commercially available can sizes, for example, &#x201c;slim&#x201d; cans with diameters ranging from 2.080 inches-2.090 inches and volumes of 180 milliliters (ml)&#x2014; 300 ml, &#x201c;sleek&#x201d; cans with diameters ranging from 2.250 inches-2.400 inches and volumes of 180 ml-400 ml and &#x201c;standard&#x201d; size cans with diameters ranging from 2.500 inches-2.600 inches and volumes of 200 ml-500 ml. The machine <b>100</b> is configured to use pods with 2.085 inches outer diameter. The evaporator <b>108</b> has an inner diameter of 2.115 inches in its open position and an inner diameter inner diameter of 2.085 inches in its closed position. Some machines have evaporators sized and configured to cool other pods.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The closed position of evaporator <b>108</b> improves heat transfer between inserted pod <b>150</b> and the evaporator <b>108</b> by increasing the contact area between the pod <b>150</b> and the evaporator <b>108</b> and reducing or eliminating an air gap between the wall of the pod <b>150</b> and the evaporator <b>108</b>. In some pods, the pressure applied to the pod by the evaporator <b>108</b> is opposed by the mixing paddles, pressurized gases within the pod, or both to maintain the casing shape of the pod.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the evaporator <b>108</b>, the relative position of the first portion <b>128</b> and the second portion <b>130</b> and the size of the gap <b>134</b> between them is controlled by two bars <b>138</b> connected by a bolt <b>140</b> and two springs <b>142</b>. Each of the bars <b>138</b> has a threaded central hole through which the bolt <b>140</b> extends and two end holes engaging the pins <b>144</b>. Each of the two springs <b>142</b> is disposed around a pin <b>144</b> that extends between the bars <b>138</b>. Some machines use other systems to control the size of the gap <b>134</b>, for example, circumferential cable systems with cables that extend around the outer diameter of the evaporator <b>108</b> with the cable being tightened to close the evaporator <b>108</b> and loosened to open the evaporator <b>108</b>. In other evaporators, there are a plurality of bolts and end holes, one or more than two springs, and one or more than engaging pins.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">One bar <b>138</b> is mounted on the first portion <b>128</b> of the evaporator <b>108</b> and the other bar <b>138</b> is mounted on the second portion <b>130</b> of the evaporator <b>108</b>. In some evaporators, the bars <b>138</b> are integral to the body of the evaporator <b>108</b> rather than being mounted on the body of the evaporator. The springs <b>142</b> press the bars <b>138</b> away from each other. The spring force biases the first portion <b>128</b> and the second portion <b>130</b> of the evaporator <b>108</b> away from each at the gap <b>134</b>. Rotation of the bolt <b>140</b> in one direction increases a force pushing the bars <b>138</b> towards each and rotation of the bolt in the opposite direction decreases this force. When the force applied by the bolt <b>140</b> is greater than the spring force, the bars <b>138</b> bring the first portion <b>128</b> and the second portion <b>130</b> of the evaporator together.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The machine <b>100</b> includes an electric motor <b>146</b> (shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) that is operable to rotate the bolt <b>140</b> to control the size of the gap <b>134</b>. Some machines use other mechanisms to rotate the bolt <b>140</b>. For example, some machines use a mechanical linkage, for example, between the lid <b>112</b> and the bolt <b>140</b> to rotate the bolt <b>140</b> as the lid <b>112</b> is opened and closed. Some machines include a handle that can be attached to the bolt to manually tighten or loosen the bolt. Some machines have a wedge system that forces the bars into a closed position when the machine lid is shut. This approach may be used instead of the electric motor <b>146</b> or can be provided as a backup in case the motor fails.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The electric motor <b>146</b> is in communication with and controlled by the processor <b>122</b> of the machine <b>100</b>. Some electric drives include a torque sensor that sends torque measurements to the processor <b>122</b>. The processor <b>122</b> signals to the motor to rotate the bolt <b>140</b> in a first direction to press the bars <b>138</b> together, for example, when a pod sensor indicates that a pod is disposed in the receptacle <b>110</b> or when the latch sensor <b>120</b> indicates that the lid <b>112</b> and pod-machine interface <b>106</b> are engaged. It is desirable that the clamshell evaporator be shut and holding the pod in a tightly fixed position before the lid closes and the shaft pierces the pod and engages the mixing paddle. This positioning can be important for driveshaft-mixing paddle engagement. The processor <b>122</b> signals to the electric drive to rotate the bolt <b>140</b> in the second direction, for example, after the food or drink being produced has been cooled/frozen and dispensed from the machine <b>100</b>, thereby opening the evaporator gap <b>134</b> and allowing for easy removal of pod <b>150</b> from evaporator <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The base of the evaporator <b>108</b> has three bores <b>148</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) which are used to mount the evaporator <b>108</b> to the floor of the pod-machine interface <b>106</b>. All three of the bores <b>148</b> extend through the base of the second portion <b>130</b> of the evaporator <b>108</b>. The first portion <b>128</b> of the evaporator <b>108</b> is not directly attached to the floor of the pod-machine interface <b>106</b>. This configuration enables the opening and closing movement described above. Other configurations that enable the opening and closing movement of the evaporator <b>108</b> can also be used. Some machines have more or fewer than three bores <b>148</b>. Some evaporators are mounted to components other than the floor of the pod-machine interface, for example, the dispensing mechanism.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Many factors affect the performance of a refrigeration system. Important factors include mass velocity of refrigerant flowing through the system, the refrigerant wetted surface area, the refrigeration process, the area of the pod/evaporator heat transfer surface, the mass of the evaporator, and the thermal conductivity of the material of the heat transfer surface. Extensive modeling and empirical studies in the development of the prototype systems described in this specification have determined that appropriate choices for the mass velocity of refrigerant flowing through the system and the refrigerant wetted surface area are the most important parameters to balance to provide a system capable of freezing up to 12 ounces of confection in less than 2 minutes.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The evaporators described in this specification can have the following characteristics:</p><p id="p-0087" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Evaporator parameters</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Mass Velocity</entry><entry>60,000 to 180,000 lb/(hour feet</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>squared)</entry></row><row><entry>Refrigerant Wetted Surface Area</entry><entry>35 to 200 square inches</entry></row><row><entry>Pressure drop Through Refrigeration</entry><entry>less than 2 psi pressure drop</entry></row><row><entry>Process</entry><entry>across the evaporator</entry></row><row><entry>Pod/Evaporator Heat Transfer</entry><entry>15 to 50 square inches</entry></row><row><entry>Surface</entry></row><row><entry>Mass of Evaporator</entry><entry>0.100 to 1.50 pounds</entry></row><row><entry>Minimum Conductivity of the</entry><entry>160 W/mK</entry></row><row><entry>Material</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables><br/>The following paragraphs describe the significance of these parameters in more detail.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">Mass velocity accounts for the multi-phase nature or refrigerant flowing through an evaporator. The two-phase process takes advantage of the high amounts of heat absorbed and expended when a refrigerant fluid (e.g., R-290 propane) changes state from a liquid to gas and a gas to a liquid, respectively. The rate of heat transfer depends in part on exposing the evaporator inner surfaces with a new liquid refrigerant to vaporize and cool the liquid ice cream mix. To do this the velocity of the refrigerant fluid must be high enough for vapor to channel or flow down the center of the flow path within the walls of evaporator and for liquid refrigerant to be pushed thru these channel passages within the walls. One approximate measurement of fluid velocity in a refrigeration system is mass velocity&#x2014;the mass flow of refrigerant in a system per unit cross sectional area of the flow passage in units of lb/hr ft&#x2227;2. Velocity as measured in ft/s (a more familiar way to measure &#x201c;velocity&#x201d;) is difficult to apply in a two-phase system since the velocity (ft/s) is constantly changing as the fluid flow changes state from liquid to gas. If liquid refrigerant is constantly sweeping across the evaporator walls, it can be vaporized and new liquid can be pushed against the wall of the cooling channels by the &#x201c;core&#x201d; of vapor flowing down the middle of the passage. At low velocities, flow separates based on gravity and liquid remains on the bottom of the cooling passage within the evaporator and vapor rises to the top side of the cooling passage channels. If the amount of area exposed to liquid is reduced by half, for example, this could cut the amount of heat transfer almost half. According to the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), a mass velocity of 150,000 lb/hr ft&#x2227;2 maximizes performance for the majority of the evaporator flow path. Mass velocity is one of the parameters that must be balanced to optimize a refrigerant system. The parameters that affect the performance of the evaporator are mass flow rate, convective heat transfer coefficient, and pressure drop. The nominal operating pressure of the evaporator is determined by the required temperature of the evaporator and the properties of the refrigerant used in the system. The mass flow rate of refrigerant through the evaporator must be high enough for it to absorb the amount of thermal energy from the confection to freeze it, in a given amount of time. Mass flow rate is primarily determined by the size of the compressor. It is desirable to use the smallest possible compressor to reduce, cost, weight and size. The convective heat transfer coefficient is influenced by the mass velocity and wetted surface area of the evaporator. The convective heat transfer coefficient will increase with increased mass velocity. However, pressure drop will also increase with mass velocity. This in turn increases the power required to operate the compressor and reduces the mass flow rate the compressor can deliver. It is desirable to design the evaporator to meet performance objectives while using the smallest least expensive compressor possible. We have determined that evaporators with a mass velocity of 75,000-125,000 lb/hr ft&#x2227;2 are effective in helping provide a system capable of freezing up to 12 ounces of confection in less than 2 minutes. The latest prototype has a mass velocity of approximately 100,000 lb/hr ft&#x2227;2 and provides a good balance of high mass velocity, manageable pressure drop in the system, and a reasonable sized compressor.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">Another important factor that affects performance in an evaporator is the surface area wetted by refrigerant which is the area of all the cooling channels within the evaporator exposed to refrigerant. Increasing the wetted surface area can improve heat transfer characteristics of an evaporator. However, increasing the wetted surface area can increase the mass of the evaporator which would increase thermal inertia and degrade heat transfer characteristics of the evaporator.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">The amount of heat that can be transferred out of the liquid in a pod is proportional to the surface area of the pod/evaporator heat transfer surface. A larger surface area is desirable but increases in surface area can require increasing the mass of the evaporator which would degrade heat transfer characteristics of the evaporator. We have determined that evaporators in which the area of the pod/evaporator heat transfer surface is between 20 and 40 square inches are effectively combined with the other characteristics to help provide a system capable of freezing up to 12 ounces of confection in less than 2 minutes.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">Thermal conductivity is the intrinsic property of a material which relates its ability to conduct heat. Heat transfer by conduction involves transfer of energy within a material without any motion of the material as a whole. An evaporator with walls made of a high conductivity material (e.g., aluminum) reduces the temperature difference across the evaporator walls. Reducing this temperature difference reduces the work required for the refrigeration system to cool the evaporator to the right temperature.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">For the desired heat transfer to occur, the evaporator must be cooled. The greater the mass of the evaporator, the longer this cooling will take. Reducing evaporator mass reduces the amount of material that must be cooled during a freezing cycle. An evaporator with a large mass will increase the time require to freeze up to 12 ounces of confection.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">The effects of thermal conductivity and mass can be balanced by an appropriate choice of materials. There are materials with higher thermal conductivity than aluminum such as copper. However, the density of copper is greater that the density of aluminum. For this reason, some evaporators have been constructed that use high thermal conductive copper only on the heat exchange surfaces of the evaporator and use aluminum everywhere else.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F</figref> show components of the pod-machine interface <b>106</b> that are operable to open pods in the evaporator <b>108</b> to dispense the food or drink being produced by the machine <b>100</b>.

This configuration further assists with the columnar strength of the pod.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0104">The pod <b>150</b> is designed for good heat transfer from the evaporator to the contents of the pod. The body <b>158</b> of the pod <b>150</b> is made of aluminum and is between 5 and 50 microns thick. The bodies of some pods are made of other materials, for example, tin, stainless steel, and various polymers such as Polyethylene terephthalate (PTE).</p><p id="p-0107" num="0105">Pod <b>150</b> may be made from a combination of different materials to assist with the manufacturability and performance of the pod. In one embodiment, the pod walls and the second end <b>212</b> may be made of Aluminum <b>3104</b> while the base may be made of Aluminum <b>5182</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0106">In some pods, the internal components of the pod are coated with a lacquer to prevent corrosion of the pod as it comes into contact with the ingredients contained within pod. This lacquer also reduces the likelihood of &#x201c;off notes&#x201d; of the metal in the food and beverage ingredients contained within pod. For example, a pod made of aluminum may be internally coated with one or a combination of the following coatings: Sherwin Williams/Valspar V70Q11, V70Q05, 32SO2AD, 40Q60AJ; PPG Innovel 2012-823, 2012-820C; and/or Akzo Nobel Aqualure G1 50. Other coatings made by the same or other coating manufacturers may also be used.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107">Some mixing paddles are made of similar aluminum alloys and coated with similar lacquers/coatings. For example, Whitford/PPG coating <b>8870</b> may be used as a coating for mixing paddles. The mixing paddle lacquer may have additional non-stick and hardening benefits for mixing paddle.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref> illustrate the engagement between the driveshaft <b>126</b> of the machine <b>100</b> and the mixing paddle <b>160</b> of a pod <b>150</b> inserted in the machine <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref> are perspective views of the pod <b>150</b> and the driveshaft <b>126</b>.

The protrusion <b>165</b> of the base <b>162</b> can be formed, for example, by stamping, deep drawing, or heading a sheet of aluminum being used to form the base. The protrusion <b>165</b> is attached to the remainder of the base <b>162</b>, for example, by a weakened score line <b>173</b>. The scoring can be a vertical score into the base of the aluminum sheet or a horizontal score into the wall of the protrusion <b>165</b>.

In an alternative embodiment, there is no post-stamping scoring but rather the walls are intentionally thinned for ease of rupture. In another version, there is not variable wall thickness but rather the cap <b>166</b> combined with force of the machine dispensing mechanism engagement are enough to cut the 0.008 inches to 0.010 inches wall thickness on the protrusion <b>165</b>.

The second aperture <b>224</b> has a shape corresponding to two overlapping circles. One of the overlapping circles has a shape that corresponds to the shape of the protrusion <b>165</b> and the other of the overlapping circles is slightly smaller. A ramp <b>226</b> extends between the outer edges of the two overlapping circles. There is an additional 0.020&#x2033; material thickness at the top of the ramp transition.

In the pod <b>150</b>, the protrusion <b>165</b> has a head <b>167</b>, a stem <b>169</b>, and a foot <b>171</b> (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>G</figref>). The stem <b>169</b> extends between the head <b>167</b> and the foot <b>171</b> and has a smaller cross-section that the head <b>167</b> and the foot <b>171</b>. As rotation of the cap <b>166</b> separates the protrusion <b>165</b> from the remainder of the base <b>162</b>, the cap <b>166</b> presses laterally against the stem <b>169</b> with the head <b>167</b> and the foot <b>171</b> bracketing the cap <b>166</b> along the edges of one of the overlapping circles of the second aperture <b>224</b>. This configuration retains the protrusion <b>165</b> when the protrusion <b>165</b> is separated from the base <b>166</b>. Such a configuration reduces the likelihood that the protrusion falls into the waiting receptacle that when the protrusion <b>165</b> is removed from the base.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0115">Some pods include other approaches to separating the protrusion <b>165</b> from the remainder of the base <b>162</b>. For example, in some pods, the base has a rotatable cutting mechanism that is riveted to the base. The rotatable cutting mechanism has a shape similar to that described relative to cap <b>166</b> but this secondary piece is riveted to and located within the perimeter of base <b>162</b> rather than being mounted over and around base <b>162</b>. When the refrigeration cycle is complete, the processor <b>122</b> of the machine activates an arm of the machine to rotate the riveted cutting mechanism around a rivet. During rotation, the cutting mechanism engages, cuts and carries away the protrusion <b>165</b>, leaving the aperture <b>164</b> of base <b>162</b> in its place.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0116">In another example, some pods have caps with a sliding knife that moves across the base to remove the protrusion. The sliding knife is activated by the machine and, when triggered by the controller, slides across the base to separate, remove, and collect the protrusion <b>165</b>. The cap <b>166</b> has a guillotine feature that, when activated by the machine, may slide straight across and over the base <b>162</b>. The cap <b>166</b> engages, cuts, and carries away the protrusion <b>165</b>. In another embodiment, this guillotine feature may be central to the machine and not the cap <b>166</b> of pod <b>150</b>. In another embodiment, this guillotine feature may be mounted as a secondary piece within base <b>162</b> and not a secondary mounted piece as is the case with cap <b>166</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0117">Some pods have a dispensing mechanism that includes a pop top that can be engaged and released by the machine. When the refrigeration cycle is complete, an arm of the machine engages and lifts a tab of the pod, thereby pressing the puncturing the base and creating an aperture in the base. Chilled or frozen product is dispensed through the aperture. The punctured surface of the base remains hinged to base and is retained inside the pod during dispensing. The mixing avoids or rotates over the punctured surface or, in another embodiment, so that the mixing paddle continues to rotate without obstruction. In some pop tops, the arm of the machine separates the punctured surface from the base.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an enlarged schematic side view of the pod <b>150</b>. The mixing paddle <b>160</b> includes a central stem <b>228</b> and two blades <b>230</b> extending from the central stem <b>228</b>. The blades <b>230</b> are helical blades shaped to churn the contents of the pod <b>150</b> and to remove ingredients that adhere to inner surface of the body <b>158</b> of the pod <b>150</b>. Some mixing paddles have a single blade and some mixing paddles have more than two mixing paddles.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0119">Fluids (for example, liquid ingredients, air, or frozen confection) flow through openings <b>232</b> in the blades <b>230</b> when the mixing paddle <b>160</b> rotates. These openings reduce the force required to rotate the mixing paddle <b>160</b>. This reduction can be significant as the viscosity of the ingredients increases (e.g., as ice cream forms). The openings <b>232</b> further assist in mixing and aerating the ingredients within the pod.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0120">The lateral edges of the blades <b>230</b> define slots <b>234</b>. The slots <b>234</b> are offset so that most of the inner surface of the body <b>158</b> is cleared of ingredients that adhere to inner surface of the body by one of the blades <b>230</b> as the mixing paddle <b>160</b> rotates. Although the mixing paddle is <b>160</b> wider than the first end <b>210</b> of the body <b>158</b> of the pod <b>150</b>, the slots <b>234</b> are alternating slots that facilitate insertion of the mixing paddle <b>160</b> into the body <b>158</b> of the pod <b>150</b> by rotating the mixing paddle <b>160</b> during insertion so that the slots <b>234</b> are aligned with the first end <b>210</b>. In another embodiment, the outer diameter of the mixing paddle are less than the diameter of the pod <b>150</b> opening, allowing for a straight insertion (without rotation) into the pod <b>150</b>. In another embodiment, one blade on the mixing paddle has an outer-diameter that is wider than the second blade diameter, thus allowing for straight insertion (without rotation) into the pod <b>150</b>. In this mixing paddle configuration, one blade is intended to remove (e.g., scrape) ingredients from the sidewall while the second, shorter diameter blade, is intended to perform more of a churning operation.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0121">Some mixing paddles have one or more blades that are hinged to the central stem. During insertion, the blades can be hinged into a condensed formation and released into an expanded formation once inserted. Some hinged blades are fixed open while rotating in a first direction and collapsible when rotating in a second direction, opposite the first direction. Some hinged blades lock into a fixed, outward, position once inside the pod regardless of rotational directions. Some hinged blades are manually condensed, expanded, and locked.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">The mixing paddle <b>160</b> rotates clockwise and removes frozen confection build up from the pod <b>214</b> wall. Gravity forces the confection removed from the pod wall to fall towards first end <b>210</b>. In the counterclockwise direction, the mixing paddle <b>160</b> rotate, lift and churn the ingredients towards the second end <b>212</b>. When the paddle changes direction and rotates clockwise the ingredients are pushed towards the first end <b>210</b>. When the protrusion <b>165</b> of the base <b>162</b> is removed as shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref>, clockwise rotation of the mixing paddle dispenses produced food or drink from the pod <b>150</b> through the aperture <b>164</b>. Some paddles mix and dispense the contents of the pod by rotating a first direction. Some paddles mix by moving in a first direction and a second direction and dispense by moving in the second direction when the pod is opened.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0123">The central stem <b>228</b> defines a recess <b>236</b> that is sized to receive the driveshaft <b>126</b> of the machine <b>100</b>. The recess and driveshaft <b>126</b> have a square cross section so that the driveshaft <b>126</b> and the mixing paddle <b>160</b> are rotatably constrained. When the motor rotates the driveshaft <b>126</b>, the driveshaft rotates the mixing paddle <b>160</b>. In some embodiments, the cross section of the driveshaft is a different shape and the cross section of the recess is compatibly shaped. In some cases the driveshaft and recess are threadedly connected. In some pods, the recess contains a mating structure that grips the driveshaft to rotationally couple the driveshaft to the paddle.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a flow chart of a method <b>250</b> implemented on the processor <b>122</b> for operating the machine <b>100</b>.

The method <b>250</b> is described as producing soft serve ice cream but can also be used to produce other cooled or frozen drinks and foods.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0125">The first step of the method <b>250</b> is to turn the machine <b>100</b> on (step <b>260</b>) and turn on the compressor <b>186</b> and the fans associated with the condenser <b>180</b> (step <b>262</b>). The refrigeration system <b>109</b> then idles at regulated temperature (step <b>264</b>). In the method <b>250</b>, the evaporator <b>108</b> temperature is controlled to remain around 0.75&#xb0; C. but may fluctuate by &#xb1;0.25&#xb0; C. Some machines are operated at other idle temperatures, for example, from 0.75&#xb0; C. to room temperature (22.0&#xb0; C.). If the evaporator temperature is below 0.5&#xb0; C., the processor <b>122</b> opens the bypass valve <b>190</b> to increase the heat of the system (step <b>266</b>). When the evaporator temperature goes over 1&#xb0; C., the bypass valve <b>190</b> is closed to cool the evaporator (step <b>268</b>). From the idle state, the machine <b>100</b> can be operated to produce ice cream (step <b>270</b>) or can shut down (step <b>272</b>).</p><p id="p-0128" num="0126">After inserting a pod, the user presses the start button. When the user presses the start button, the bypass valve <b>190</b> closes, the evaporator <b>108</b> moves to its closed position, and the motor <b>124</b> is turned on (step <b>274</b>). In some machines, the evaporator is closed electronically using a motor. In some machines, the evaporator is closed mechanically, for example by the lid moving from the open position to the closed position. In some systems, a sensor confirms that a pod <b>150</b> is present in the evaporator <b>108</b> before these actions are taken.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0127">Some systems include radio frequency identification (RFID) tags or other intelligent bar codes such as UPC bar or QR codes. Identification information on pods can be used to trigger specific cooling and mixing algorithms for specific pods. These systems can optionally read the RFID, QR code, or barcode and identify the mixing motor speed profile and the mixing motor torque threshold (step <b>273</b>).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0128">The identification information can also be used to facilitate direct to consumer marketing (e.g., over the internet or using a subscription model). This approach and the systems described in this specification enable selling ice cream thru e-commerce because the pods are shelf stable. In the subscription mode, customers pay a monthly fee for a predetermined number of pods shipped to them each month. They can select their personalized pods from various categories (e.g., ice cream, healthy smoothies, frozen coffees or frozen cocktails) as well as their personalized flavors (e.g., chocolate or vanilla).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0129">The identification can also be used to track each pod used. In some systems, the machine is linked with a network and can be configured to inform a vendor as to which pods are being used and need to be replaced (e.g., through a weekly shipment). This method is more efficient than having the consumers go to the grocery store and purchase pods.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0130">These actions cool the pod <b>150</b> in the evaporator <b>108</b> while rotating the mixing paddle <b>160</b>. As the ice cream forms, the viscosity of the contents of the pod <b>150</b> increases. A torque sensor of the machine measures the torque of the motor <b>124</b> required to rotate the mixing paddle <b>160</b> within the pod <b>150</b>. Once the torque of the motor <b>124</b> measured by a torque sensor satisfies a predetermined threshold, the machine <b>100</b> moves into a dispensing mode (<b>276</b>). The dispensing port opens and the motor <b>124</b> reverses direction (step <b>278</b>) to press the frozen confection out of the pod <b>150</b>. This continues for approximately 1 to 10 seconds to dispense the contents of the pod <b>150</b> (step <b>280</b>). The machine <b>100</b> then switches to defrost mode (step <b>282</b>). Frost that builds up on the evaporator <b>108</b> can reduce the heat transfer efficiency of the evaporator <b>108</b>. In addition, the evaporator <b>108</b> can freeze to the pod <b>150</b>, the first portion <b>128</b> and second portion <b>130</b> of the evaporator can freeze together, and/or the pod can freeze to the evaporator. The evaporator can be defrosted between cycles to avoid these issues by opening the bypass valve <b>170</b>, opening the evaporator <b>108</b>, and turning off the motor <b>124</b> (step <b>282</b>). The machine then diverts gas through the bypass valve for about 1 to 10 seconds to defrost the evaporator (step <b>284</b>). The machine is programmed to defrost after every cycle, unless a thermocouple reports that the evaporator <b>108</b> is already above freezing. The pod can then be removed. The machine <b>100</b> then returns to idle mode (step <b>264</b>). In some machines, a thermometer measures the temperature of the contents of pod <b>150</b> and identifies when it is time to dispense the contents of the pod. In some machines, the dispensing mode begins when a predetermined time is achieved. In some machines, a combination of torque required to turn the mixing paddle, mixing motor current draw, temperature of the pod, and/or time determines when it is time to dispense the contents of the pod.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0131">If the idle time expires, the machine <b>100</b> automatically powers down (step <b>272</b>). A user can also power down the machine <b>100</b> by holding down the power button (<b>286</b>). When powering down, the processor opens the bypass valve <b>190</b> to equalize pressure across the valve (step <b>288</b>). The machine <b>100</b> waits ten seconds (step <b>290</b>) then turns off the compressor <b>186</b> and fans (step <b>292</b>). The machine is then off.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a schematic of a refrigeration system <b>310</b> that includes the evaporator <b>108</b> and an expansion sub-system <b>312</b>. The refrigeration system <b>310</b> is substantially similar to the refrigeration system <b>109</b>. However, the refrigeration system <b>310</b> includes the expansion sub-system <b>312</b> rather than the expansion valve <b>184</b> shown in the refrigeration system <b>109</b>. The refrigeration system <b>310</b> does not include the first bypass line <b>188</b> and the second bypass line <b>190</b> that are part of the refrigeration system <b>109</b>. However, some systems include the with the expansion sub-system <b>312</b>, the first bypass line, and the second bypass line.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0133">The expansion sub-system <b>312</b> includes multiple valves to control expansion of the refrigeration fluid. These valves include a first fixed orifice valve <b>314</b>, a second fixed orifice valve <b>316</b>, and a control valve <b>318</b>. The control valve <b>318</b> is upstream from the second fixed orifice valve <b>316</b>. The control valve <b>318</b> and second fixed orifice valve <b>316</b> are in parallel with the first fixed orifice valve <b>314</b>. The expansion device has two modes to control the temperature of the refrigerant entering the evaporator <b>108</b>. In the first mode, the control valve <b>318</b> is open allowing the refrigerant to flow to the second fixed orifice valve <b>316</b>. In the first mode, the refrigerant flows through both the first fixed orifice valves <b>314</b> and the second fixed orifice valves <b>316</b>. In the second mode, the control valve <b>318</b> is closed and the refrigerant does not flow through the second fixed orifice valve <b>316</b>. All refrigerant flows through the first fixed orifice valve <b>314</b>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0134">As discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the expansion valve <b>184</b> or expansion sub-system <b>312</b> receives a high-pressure refrigerant and releases low-pressure refrigerant. This pressure drop cools the refrigerant. Larger changes in pressure (&#x394;P) cause larger changes in temperature (&#x394;T). In the second mode (i.e., with control valve <b>318</b> closed), the pressure drop through the expansion sub-system <b>312</b> will be higher than in the first mode providing a lower evaporator pressure and associated lower evaporator temperature. The effect on heat transfer of the increased temperature differential between the refrigerant and the contents of a pod in the evaporator <b>108</b> is offset to some extent by the fact that this lower pressure refrigerant is less dense. Since the compressor moves a fixed volume of refrigerant each compression cycle, the mass flow per cycle is reduced, which lowers heat transfer. In the second mode of operation, there is a big temperature difference between the pod and evaporator, requiring large heat transfer, which increases the amount of mass flow needed.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0135">During initial operation, the refrigeration system <b>310</b> is in the first mode. The control valve <b>318</b> is open and the refrigerant flows through both the first fixed orifice valve <b>314</b> and second fixed orifice valve <b>316</b>. This results in the evaporator operating at around a temperature of &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. to &#x2212;10&#xb0; C. At this temperature, the cooling system provides more cooling capacity than it can at lower temperatures by taking advantage of the higher density refrigerant passing through the evaporator.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0136">The pod <b>150</b> is inserted into the evaporator <b>108</b> around room temperature (e.g., 22&#xb0; C.). The initial difference in temperature between the evaporator <b>108</b> and the pod <b>150</b> is high. As a result, the heat transfers rapidly from the pod <b>150</b> to the evaporator <b>108</b>. The difference between the temperature of the pod <b>150</b> and the evaporator <b>108</b> decreases as the pod <b>150</b> cools and the transfer of heat from the pod <b>150</b> to the evaporator <b>108</b> also slows.
