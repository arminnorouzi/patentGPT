Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An access point (AP) (or a wireless access device) indicates an electronic device which helps wireless devices connect to a network. Users may connect an electronic device such as a mobile electronic device, a computer, or a portable multimedia device to the network within a specific service area through the AP, and the electronic device connected to the network may transmit or receive data on a radio frequency.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As electronic devices connecting to the network using a wireless communication technology increase, data capacity transmitted or received through the radio frequency has rapidly increased. As the data capacity increases, a multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) technology for increasing the data capacity transmitted or received may be applied to recent APs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above information is presented as background information only to assist with an understanding of the disclosure. No determination has been made, and no assertion is made, as to whether any of the above might be applicable as prior art with regard to the disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To implement a multiple input/output (MIMO) technology, a plurality of antennas should be disposed within an electronic device (e.g., an access point). For example, four antennas should be disposed in the access point to implement a 4&#xd7;4 MIMO technology, and eight antennas should be disposed in the electronic device to implement an 8&#xd7;8 MIMO technology.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The electronic device may support a standard defined by an institute of electrical and electronics engineers (IEEE) for transmitting or receiving data on a radio frequency. According to the IEEE 802.11ax (or &#x201c;wireless-fidelity (Wi-Fi) 6&#x201d;) standard, the electronic device may support tri bands of 2.4 gigahertz (GHz), 5 GHz low band (LB), and/or 5 GHz high band (HB).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To implement the MIMO technology and to support up to the frequency band supported by the IEEE 802.11ax standard, the number of the antennas to be disposed in the electronic device may exponentially increase. In one example, as the number of the antennas to be disposed in the electronic device increases, a volume of the electronic device may increase. In another example, as the number of the antennas to be disposed in the electronic device increases, a space for mounting the antennas may reduce, the plurality of the antennas may be disposed closely in the electronic device, and thus interference may occur between the antennas to degrade performance (e.g., radiation performance) of the access point.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Aspects of the disclosure are to address at least the above-mentioned problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below. Accordingly, an aspect of the disclosure is to provide an electronic device (or an access point) for supporting the MIMO technology and the IEEE standard while reducing the number of antennas.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the presented embodiments.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, an electronic device is provided.
