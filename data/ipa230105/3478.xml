The barrel openings <b>15</b> may be manufactured as part of the shotgun or formed post-production as part of the making of the suppressor system <b>11</b>.

The barrel openings <b>15</b> and inner sleeve openings <b>16</b> line up (i.e., are positioned coaxially) to each other. This configuration allows improved noise attenuation by allowing the gaseous propellant discharged by the shotgun shells to expand in two different portions of the suppressor <b>12</b> through the different openings <b>15</b>/<b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> show sectional views of the suppressor system <b>11</b> along the lines A-A and B-B respectively. After the firing or striking of the shotgun shell (not shown) within the barrel <b>18</b>, the gaseous propellant &#x2018;G&#x2019; will travel along the barrel toward the muzzle end <b>20</b> of the barrel. The smaller arrows shown show the flowpath of the gaseous propellant G after a period of time &#x394;t after firing of the shotgun shell. The barrel openings <b>15</b> allow the gaseous propellant to travel and expand within the inner sleeve cavity <b>21</b> of the inner sleeve <b>14</b>. The inner sleeve openings <b>16</b> allow further expansion of the gases into the plurality of outer sleeve cavities <b>22</b>. The inner sleeve cavity <b>21</b> is not partitioned into a plurality of cavities like the cavities <b>22</b> found within the outer sleeve. The expansion of gases within the inner sleeve cavity <b>21</b> allows for interference areas <b>23</b>. The interference areas <b>23</b> are areas in which the gases interact and interfere with each other in order to slow down the gas velocity as a result of the collision of moving gases particles and/or molecules.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The barrel <b>18</b>, the inner sleeve <b>14</b>, and the outer sleeve <b>13</b> are fastened to each other at the muzzle end <b>20</b> through threaded interfaces <b>18</b><i>a, </i><b>14</b><i>a, </i><b>13</b><i>a, </i>and <b>13</b><i>b. </i>The threaded interface <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the barrel fastens to threaded interface <b>13</b><i>a, </i>and threaded interface <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the inner sleeve fastens to the threaded interface <b>13</b><i>b, </i>thus interlocking the barrel <b>18</b>, inner sleeve <b>14</b>, and outer sleeve <b>13</b> together. This interlocking configuration allows the suppressor system <b>11</b> to be utilized without any adapters or further extensions such as chokes that need to be attached to the end of the barrel <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The inner sleeve <b>14</b> also includes divider apertures <b>24</b> configured to hold the dividers <b>17</b> axially and circumferentially so that the dividers cannot move along the sleeves <b>13</b>/<b>14</b> and do not rotate relative to the sleeves <b>13</b>/<b>14</b>. The dividers <b>17</b> also aid in the directing of gases with the portion placed within the divider apertures <b>24</b>, which may be diamond shaped, rectangular, square, circular, oval, or any other shape capable of holding the dividers. Similarly, the shapes of the inner sleeve openings <b>16</b> can be circular, or any other shape that can be easily fabricated or manufactured onto the barrel. The thickness of the inner sleeve <b>14</b> and outer sleeve <b>13</b> may depend on the required noise attenuation and heat dissipation needed by the firearm. The dividers <b>17</b> may also be angled forward (i.e., the most radially outward portion leaning towards the muzzle or the exit of the firearm suppressor/barrel).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The divider apertures <b>24</b>, inner sleeve openings <b>16</b>, and barrel openings <b>15</b> are circumferentially disposed in a generally uniform pattern around the corresponding cylindrical structure (i.e., the inner sleeve and the barrel). Along the length of the inner sleeve <b>14</b>, the divider apertures <b>24</b> and the openings <b>16</b> are disposed in an alternating pattern. The spacing and pattern of the different apertures and/or openings can be varied depending on the dimensions of the barrel or the inner sleeve.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The inner sleeve cavity <b>21</b> circumferentially surrounds the barrel <b>18</b> and is unpartitioned. The inner sleeve cavity <b>21</b> is in fluid communication with the barrel <b>18</b> via barrel openings <b>15</b>. The outer sleeve cavities <b>22</b> are discrete cavities that circumferentially surrounds the inner sleeve <b>14</b> and are partitioned by dividers <b>17</b>. Each outer sleeve cavity <b>22</b> only extends axially between each divider <b>17</b> and are in fluid communication with the inner sleeve cavity <b>21</b> at different axial locations along the inner sleeve cavity via inner sleeve openings <b>16</b>. The number of dividers and the openings <b>15</b>/<b>16</b> can also be modified depending on the firearm length, the required noise attenuation, and projectile characteristics. The embodiment described above allows for a shorter overall length. The shorter length will allow easier use especially in confined areas such as in transport vehicles (cars, trucks, SUV's, helicopters, etc.) and in buildings (hall ways, doors, stair cases, elevators, etc.). The shorter length also allows quicker target acquisition especially in confined areas such as clearing rooms in a building.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows another embodiment in which the suppressor system <b>11</b> is configured as an extension of the barrel <b>26</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows an isometric view of this configuration.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i></figref>shows the section C-C as labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.

Baffles <b>30</b> further divide the inner sleeve to discrete circumferentially extending cavities <b>31</b>. The baffles created tortuous pathways for the hot gasses to travel through in order to slow the gasses down and attenuate sound.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a cross-section of an embodiment of a suppressor. This perspective view shows an exemplary interference point <b>32</b> of hot gasses at cavities <b>22</b> and <b>21</b>. The hot gas streams generated by the projectile propellant interact and interfere so that one or more gas stream interacts with another gas stream or streams at interference points <b>32</b>. This interaction and interference of the gas streams results in an attenuation of the noise resulting from the firing of the projectile.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> may be incorporated into the basic structure of the suppressor described above. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the annular cavity is configured so that the gases resulting from the firing of the bullet travel circumferentially in the annular cavity in a manner that results in multiple separate streams of gases and wherein at least two of the streams are traveling in opposite directions and collide thereby resulting in an attenuation of noise resulting from the firing of the bullet.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Materials utilized by the suppressor system may include titanium or titanium alloy. Titanium has a higher strength than steel and aluminum while also having a melting point higher than steel and a much higher melting point than aluminum.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In sum, an improved suppressor system is provided above with improved noise attenuation and heat dissipation. The inner sleeve cavity and outer sleeve cavities act as expansion chambers, which allows for better acoustic attenuation and acoustic absorption. Rather than relying on the cones to reduce the noise and gas pressure, the expansion chamber has a number of apertures allowing the gas pressure and sound to enter. The gases follow the tortuous path and fill the expansion chambers. The dividers further control the direction of the gas pressure. Portions of the dividers in the divider apertures also direct the gas and control the gas pressure waves and sound waves to collide a controlled manner using interference from collision of gases to attenuate sound. The configuration above also allows for easy assembly/disassembly. The addition of cavities provides expansion chambers to the suppressor system to significantly reduce the back pressure of gas in the barrel, which can be a major problem in conventional firearms. Conventional suppressors may increase back pressure and thus require substantial changes to the suppressing system. The same is true for any integrated suppressors on the barrel of the firearm.
