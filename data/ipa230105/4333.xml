For this reason, such devices have come to be more often used not only within the firewall, but also by being directly accessed from an external network, such as the Internet. Under such circumstances, the security model has changed from a boundary protection model which assumes that the boundary is protected against the outside by the firewall, to a zero-trust security model which assumes that nothing is trusted based on the ethical doctrine that human inborn nature is evil.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the zero-trust security, it is necessary to trust nothing and doubt everything. Therefore, there is a demand, for example, for an image forming apparatus that is capable of preventing occurrence of a situation, such as a case where a malicious user leaks confidential information to the outside. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2010-49520 proposes, as a technique for preventing the above-mentioned leakage of confidential information, a technique for performing, before printing data to be printed, processing for inspecting the data to be printed based on keywords registered in advance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in the above-described technique disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2010-49520, the inspection is executed also on print data which does not require the inspection, which causes a problem that a time period required to complete printing is increased.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides an image forming apparatus that is capable of controlling execution of inspection without increasing a time period required to complete printing, and a method of controlling the image forming apparatus.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an image forming apparatus that performs print processing of acquired data to be printed, including at least one processor, and a memory coupled to the at least one processor, the memory having instructions that, when executed by the processor, perform the operations as: a first setting unit configured to set whether or not to execute inspection of data to be printed, a registration unit configured to register keywords indicative of confidentiality, an extraction unit configured to extract text information from the data to be printed, a determination unit configured to determine whether or not any keyword matching the text information has been registered, and a print control unit configured to control execution of print processing of the data to be printed, based on a result of the determination performed by the determination unit, wherein when non-execution of inspection is set by the first setting unit, the print processing of the data to be printed is executed without executing the determination performed by the determination unit, whereas when execution of inspection is set by the first setting unit, the print processing of the data to be printed is controlled by the control unit based on a result of the determination performed by the determination unit.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of controlling an image forming apparatus that performs print processing of acquired data to be printed, including setting whether or not to execute inspection of data to be printed, registering keywords indicative of confidentiality, extracting text information from the data to be printed, determining whether or not any keyword matching the text information has been registered, controlling execution of print processing of the data to be printed based on a result of said determining, executing the print processing of the data to be printed without executing said determining when non-execution of inspection is set by said setting, and executing said determining and controlling the print processing of the data to be printed by said controlling when execution of inspection is set by said setting.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present invention, it is possible to reduce a time period required to perform inspection processing on data to be printed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments (with
