Japanese Patent Application Publication Tokukai No. 2004-85224 discloses a thermal analysis device including a heat treatment furnace.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some thermal analyses include the step of cooling a measurement target object after heating. For example, as a type of parameter used in a thermal analysis, a parameter referred to as a loss on ignition (LOI) is widely known. A loss on ignition is a value indicating a ratio between the mass of a sample before heating and the mass of the sample after the heating. More specifically, a loss on ignition is calculated on the basis of, for example, the following equation:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Loss on ignition(%)=[{(weight of sample before heating)&#x2212;(weight of sample after heating)}/(weight of sample before heating)]&#xd7;100<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">Loss on ignition is performed, for example, to specify the proportion or the amount of an impurity contained in foundry sand or cement or to specify the proportion or the amount of an organic substance contained in soil.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">For example, it is possible to specify the amount of a resin remaining in foundry sand which has been used in casting, from a value of a loss on ignition of the foundry sand. In a case where a loss on ignition of foundry sand is calculated, the foundry sand is dried and then heated at 1000&#xb0; C. for 60 minutes, for example.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">An equation for calculating the loss on ignition of the foundry sand is expressed by {(W0&#x2212;W60)/W0}&#xd7;100, where W0 is the weight of the foundry sand after drying and before heating, and W60 is the weight of the foundry sand after the heating.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a drawing illustrating a procedure for calculating a loss on ignition of foundry sand by a conventional weight measuring method. In preparation for this measurement, a measurer dries foundry sand. Further, at a given timing before a heat treatment (described later), the measurer preheats a furnace to a given temperature (e.g., 1000&#xb0; C.).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">First, the measurer measures the weight of a sample tray which is empty. This sample tray is a tray for putting therein the foundry sand. Next, the measurer puts the foundry sand in the sample tray, and carries out pre-heating weight measurement. As a result, it is possible to measure the &#x201c;weight of the sample tray with the foundry sand therein before heating&#x201d;. Subsequently, the measurer places, in the furnace which has been preheated, the sample tray with the foundry sand therein, and heats the sample tray with the foundry sand therein for a given time (e.g., 60 minutes).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">When the heating ends, the measurer cools, with use of a desiccator, the sample tray with the foundry sand therein so that the sample tray with the foundry sand therein is cooled to substantially ordinary temperature. After the sample tray with the foundry sand therein can be cooled to substantially ordinary temperature, the measurer carries out post-heating weight measurement. As a result, it is possible to measure the &#x201c;weight of the sample tray with the foundry sand therein after the heating&#x201d;. After the weight of the sample tray with the foundry sand therein can be measured before and after the heating, the measurer calculates a loss on ignition from the weight before and after the heating.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0011">In order to calculate a loss on ignition, it is necessary to measure the weight of a sample before and after heating. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, in order to measure the weight of the sample after the heating, it is necessary to have a time to cool, to substantially the same temperature (e.g., room temperature) as before the heating, the sample after the heating. Further, although a sample tray such as a ceramic withstands high temperature in a furnace, the sample tray may break when rapidly cooled. As such, in the conventional weight measuring method, it takes a time to cool the sample (and the sample tray). In addition, such a cooling time is a rate limiting factor, and results in a problem that it is impossible to reduce a time required for weight measurement.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">An aspect of the present disclosure has been made in view of the above problems, and the object thereof is to reduce a time required for weight measurement.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0013">A measuring device in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure is a measuring device which heats a measurement target object and which measures a weight of the measurement target object before heating and measures the weight of the measurement target object after the heating.

A measuring device in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure can be used, for example, to measure the weight of a measurement target object before and after heating.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">A measuring device in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure may have the function of calculating various parameters from the measured weight of a measurement target object. The &#x201c;various parameters&#x201d; indicate, for example, a loss on ignition, moisture, or a water content. The following description will discuss a measuring device in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure in detail, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>9</b></figref>.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0027">A measuring device in accordance with Embodiment 1 is a device which measures the weight of a sample (or the sample+a sample tray) before and after heating and calculates a loss on ignition of the sample from the weight. Note here that the term &#x201c;sample&#x201d; indicates, for example, foundry sand, cement, soil, textile goods, and the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">In Embodiment 1, an example in which the sample is foundry sand will be described. Note, however, that the measuring device in accordance with Embodiment 1 is not limited to a case where a loss on ignition of foundry sand is measured, and can be also applied to a case where a loss on ignition of an object (such as cement, soil, or textile goods) other than foundry sand is measured.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">Foundry sand is a raw material of a mold. Foundry sand is mixed with an additive(s) such as a resin, water glass, and/or a surfactant, and then formed into a mold. Further, foundry sand may be recovered and reused by crushing a used mold and removing an additive(s).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">In order to maintain the quality of foundry sand to be used in casting, it is necessary to appropriately set conditions concerning introduction of new sand, mixing, and recovery.

The measuring device <b>100</b> includes at least a support <b>4</b>, a furnace <b>1</b>, an elevating mechanism <b>2</b>, and an electronic balance <b>3</b>. Note that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>6</b></figref>, the direction of an arrow of a z-axis is referred to as &#x201c;up&#x201d; and the direction opposite from the direction of the arrow of the z-axis is referred to as &#x201c;down&#x201d;. Note also that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>6</b></figref>, the direction of an arrow of an x-axis is referred to as &#x201c;front&#x201d; and the direction opposite from the direction of the arrow of the x-axis is referred to as &#x201c;back&#x201d;.

The sample tray <b>90</b> is not limited to any particular shape, but preferably has a shape such that the sample <b>91</b> is exposed as much as possible in the furnace <b>1</b> so that thermal conduction with respect to the sample <b>91</b> is favorable. For example, the sample tray <b>90</b> may be a shallow ceramic tray.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">The support <b>4</b> is for supporting the measurement target object. The support <b>4</b> includes a supporting part <b>41</b> and a sample stage <b>42</b>. The supporting part <b>41</b> is a member which supports the sample stage <b>42</b>. For example, the supporting part <b>41</b> may have the shape of a cylinder or a prism. A lower portion of the supporting part <b>41</b> is fixed to the electronic balance <b>3</b>, and the sample stage <b>42</b> is fixed to an upper portion of the supporting part <b>41</b>. Note that the supporting part <b>41</b> is not limited to any particular shape or structure. For example, the supporting part <b>41</b> may be a frame constituted only by a framework or may be a member filled with a heat insulating material or the like.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">The furnace <b>1</b> has the functions of preheating a space inside the furnace <b>1</b> to a set temperature and heating the space inside the furnace <b>1</b> to the set temperature. Note, here, that the term &#x201c;preheating&#x201d; means heating the space inside the furnace <b>1</b> (inside of a heating part <b>12</b> (described later)) to a given temperature (e.g., 1000&#xb0; C.) in a state where the measurement target object is not put inside the furnace <b>1</b>. Note also that the term &#x201c;heating&#x201d; means (i) putting the measurement target object in the space inside the furnace <b>1</b> which has been preheated to the foregoing given temperature and (ii) calcining the measurement target object at the given temperature. In Embodiment 1, the furnace <b>1</b> heats the sample <b>91</b> and/or the sample tray <b>90</b> each of which is the measurement target object. The furnace <b>1</b> is physically connected to the elevating mechanism <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">Note that the furnace <b>1</b> is not limited to any particular type, provided that foundry sand can be heated at a temperature and in a time which are required for &#x201c;weight measurement for calculation of a loss on ignition&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">The furnace <b>1</b> may have an opening in at least a given direction. For example, the furnace <b>1</b> may be disposed such that the opening faces downward. Then, the support <b>4</b> may be disposed below the furnace <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">In a case where the measurement target object is housed in the furnace <b>1</b> through the opening of the furnace <b>1</b>, it is possible to prevent the temperature inside the furnace <b>1</b> from dropping due to external air while the measurement target object is being housed in the furnace <b>1</b>, as compared with, for example, a case where a door of the furnace <b>1</b> is opened and then the measurement target object is housed in the furnace <b>1</b>. That is, by configuring the furnace <b>1</b> such that the measurement target object is housed in the furnace <b>1</b> through the opening of the furnace <b>1</b>, it is possible to reduce loss of the temperature inside the furnace <b>1</b>. Therefore, it is possible to more accurately measure a loss on ignition. Note that the opening preferably has a size and a shape such that the supporting part <b>41</b>, the sample stage <b>42</b>, and the measurement target object can pass through the opening. Note that, regardless of whether the furnace <b>1</b> has the opening or not, the furnace <b>1</b> may have a thermostat function which makes it possible to keep the space inside the furnace <b>1</b> at a preset temperature.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">The sample stage <b>42</b> is a stage for placing thereon the sample <b>91</b> and/or the sample tray <b>90</b>. Note that the sample stage <b>42</b> is not limited to any particular shape or size. However, the sample stage <b>42</b> preferably has a size and a shape such that the sample stage <b>42</b> can be housed inside the furnace <b>1</b> through the opening of the furnace <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">The elevating mechanism <b>2</b> is an example of a moving mechanism which moves the furnace <b>1</b>. The elevating mechanism <b>2</b> adjusts the position of the furnace <b>1</b> by moving the furnace <b>1</b> up and down so that the measurement target object is housed inside the furnace <b>1</b>. The elevating mechanism <b>2</b> is not particularly limited, in terms of mechanical and electrical configurations concerning power and mechanical and electrical configurations concerning driving.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">The elevating mechanism <b>2</b> raises and lowers the furnace <b>1</b> so that the measurement target object can be put in and out of the furnace <b>1</b>. Therefore, with the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it is possible to prevent loss of the temperature inside the furnace <b>1</b>, and possible to house the measurement target object in the furnace <b>1</b> with minimal movement of the furnace <b>1</b>. Note that, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the elevating mechanism <b>2</b> may have a frame for supporting the furnace <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">The electronic balance <b>3</b> is an example of a measuring section which measures the weight of the measurement target object. In Embodiment 1, the electronic balance <b>3</b> is taken as an example of the measuring section, but the measuring section can be realized by a balance other than an electronic balance.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">The measuring device <b>100</b> may include a movable frame <b>24</b> which is slidable in the direction (i.e., frontward and backward directions, and rightward and leftward directions) perpendicular to the direction in which the furnace <b>1</b> is moved (i.e., upward and downward directions). The measuring device <b>100</b> may also include a plate <b>23</b> on which the measurement target object is placed and which, as the movable frame <b>24</b> slides, moves in the direction perpendicular to the direction in which the furnace <b>1</b> is moved.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">In an example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the movable frame <b>24</b> is provided as a part of the elevating mechanism <b>2</b>. A placement part <b>22</b> is attached to the movable frame <b>24</b>, and a pull-out part <b>25</b> is attached to the placement part <b>22</b>. The plate <b>23</b> is removably fitted in the placement part <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">Note that the placement part <b>22</b> and the pull-out part <b>25</b> do not necessarily need to move downward as the elevating mechanism <b>2</b> moves. In a case where the pull-out part <b>25</b> does not move downward, the attachment of the placement part <b>22</b> to the movable frame <b>24</b> is canceled when the elevating mechanism <b>2</b> moves the movable frame <b>24</b> downward.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">The placement part <b>22</b> is a member for holding the plate <b>23</b> when the pull-out part <b>25</b> is in a state of having been pulled out. A shape of the placement part <b>22</b> will be described later in detail. The plate <b>23</b> is a structure on which a user places the sample tray <b>90</b>, and is a structure for holding the sample tray <b>90</b> and carrying the sample tray <b>90</b> to the sample stage <b>42</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the plate <b>23</b> is in the form of a single plate. Furthermore, in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the plate <b>23</b> has a hole which is larger than the sample stage <b>42</b> and smaller than the sample tray <b>90</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">The pull-out part <b>25</b> is a mechanism which assists the user in placing the sample tray <b>90</b> on the plate <b>23</b>.

Note that although, in practice, the measuring device <b>100</b> may be covered by a housing (housing <b>7</b> (described later)) as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> (described later), the housing is not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> because <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is for illustrating the operations of the measuring device <b>100</b>. Movement of each part of the measuring device <b>100</b> is indicated by a gray arrow with a dotted line. For the sake of clarity, a numerical sign is appended to each member only in a figure on the left side (the first figure) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. However, the same numerical sign applies to each member of the measuring device <b>100</b> also in a figure in the middle (the second figure) and a figure on the right side (the third figure).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">In the measuring device <b>100</b>, the pull-out part <b>25</b> is initially in a state of having been pushed backward (i.e., housed in the housing). When the user pulls frontward the pull-out part <b>25</b> which is in the state of having been pushed backward, a frontward force acts on the pull-out part <b>25</b>. This force is transmitted to the movable frame <b>24</b> via the placement part <b>22</b>. Upon receipt of the frontward force, the movable frame <b>24</b> slides frontward. When the movable frame <b>24</b> slides frontward, the plate <b>23</b> is placed on the movable frame <b>24</b>, and moves frontward as the movable frame <b>24</b> slides. When the pull-out part <b>25</b> goes into the state of having been pulled out, the plate <b>23</b> goes into a state of having been fitted and held in the placement part <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">The first figure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a position and an operation of each part when the user pushes backward the pull-out part <b>25</b> which is in the state of having been pulled out frontward.

The plate <b>23</b> which has moved away from the placement part <b>22</b> is placed on the movable frame <b>24</b>. The movable frame <b>24</b> receives a backward force via the placement part <b>22</b>. Upon receipt of the backward force, the movable frame <b>24</b> slides backward. Accordingly, the plate <b>23</b> which is placed on the movable frame <b>24</b> also moves backward as the movable frame <b>24</b> slides. The elevating mechanism <b>2</b> starts to lower the furnace <b>1</b> in parallel with or after the sliding of the movable frame <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">The second figure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a position and an operation of each part when the pull-out part <b>25</b> is in the state of having been pushed backward and the furnace <b>1</b> is in the middle of being lowered. As illustrated in the second figure, when the pull-out part <b>25</b> goes into the state of having been fully pushed backward, the plate <b>23</b> is placed in a position such that a hole of the plate <b>23</b> is just above the sample stage <b>42</b>. The elevating mechanism <b>2</b> continues to lower the furnace <b>1</b>.

When the furnace <b>1</b> is lowered, the plate <b>23</b> moves downward as if the plate <b>23</b> was pushed by the furnace <b>1</b>. Note that, in so doing, the movable frame <b>24</b> may also move below the furnace <b>1</b> as the furnace <b>1</b> is lowered. In this case, the pull-out part <b>25</b> and the placement part <b>22</b> may be supported by a portion of the housing (not illustrated).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">As the furnace <b>1</b> is lowered, the sample stage <b>42</b> enters the furnace <b>1</b>. In so doing, the sample stage <b>42</b> passes through the hole of the plate <b>23</b>, and enters the furnace <b>1</b> while pushing up the sample tray <b>90</b> which has been placed in the hole. This causes the sample tray <b>90</b> to be transferred from the plate <b>23</b> to the sample stage <b>42</b> and housed inside the furnace <b>1</b> together with the sample stage <b>42</b> (and at least a portion of the supporting part <b>41</b>).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">According to the above operations, it is possible for the user to move the plate <b>23</b> frontward, which is a place where the sample tray <b>90</b> is set, by simply pulling the pull-out part <b>25</b> frontward. Thus, it is possible for the user to more easily and more accurately set the sample tray <b>90</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">Furthermore, according to the above operations, it is possible for the user to move the plate <b>23</b>, on which the sample tray <b>90</b> is placed, backward, i.e., toward the side on which the furnace <b>1</b> is located, by simply pushing backward the pull-out part <b>25</b> in which the sample tray <b>90</b> is set. Thus, it is possible for the user to set the sample tray <b>90</b> on the sample stage <b>42</b> with a simple operation. In addition, it is possible for the user to place the sample tray <b>90</b> on the sample stage <b>42</b> even in a case where the sample stage <b>42</b> is at a position where it is difficult to directly set the sample tray <b>90</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">Note that the movable frame <b>24</b> may be configured to be collapsible or separable upward and downward, in addition to being configured to slide frontward and backward. For example, when the pull-out part <b>25</b> is in the state of having been pushed backward, the movable frame <b>24</b> may be in a state of having been folded or separated upward and downward into two components. Then, when the pull-out part <b>25</b> is pulled out frontward, the folded movable frame <b>24</b> may be extended or the separated components may be reconnected so as to be a single frame. Then, when the movable frame <b>24</b> becomes a single frame, movement of sliding frontward may occur in at least a portion of the movable frame <b>24</b>, and the plate <b>23</b> may move, together with the pull-out part <b>25</b>, from below the furnace <b>1</b> along with such movement.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>6</b></figref> are drawings illustrating specific examples of appearance and an internal structure of the measuring device <b>100</b>, the configuration of the main part and the operations of which have been described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.

That is, the support <b>4</b> is provided so as to lie across both the first space <b>7</b>A and the second space <b>7</b>B. By separating the first space <b>7</b>A and the second space <b>7</b>B with use of the partition plate <b>8</b>, it is possible to protect the electronic balance <b>3</b> from heat generated by the furnace <b>1</b>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent a failure of the electronic balance <b>3</b> due to heat of the furnace <b>1</b>. Note that the partition plate <b>8</b> is not limited to any particular thickness or material, but the partition plate <b>8</b> preferably has heat insulating properties in view of application of the partition plate <b>8</b>.
