incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates to the field of tools/handicrafts/furniture/toys/jewelry, and more particularly, relates to splicing structure with certain plane shape/space shape/geometric three-dimensional structure formed by splicing the structures with one another, and the splicing structure may be used in splicing tools, handicrafts, furniture, jewelry, toys and the like.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A splicing structure is widely applied in various fields, such as the fields of tools, handicrafts, furniture and toys due to its convenience to assemble and reusability. Take the splicing structure used in the field of splicing toys as an example, splicing toys are very popular with large number of players due to its strong interestingness. Moreover, splicing structure also has a very positive effect on improving cognition, imagination, creativity and a manipulative ability, therefore splicing structures have been widely used as enlightenment education tool for children in recent years.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Splicing hole and splicing column are traditionally served as connecting-fixing structures in conventional splicing structures. During assembly, splicing column is inserted into splicing hole to achieve the positioning and fixation between splicing blocks only by means of the binding force between the splicing column and the splicing hole. Such kind of fixing mode is not only insecure, but also demands for higher machining precision. In addition, the positioning and fixation between the splicing blocks are achieved by the binding force between the splicing column and the splicing hole, as a result the material that may be used for manufacturing the splicing blocks are greatly limited; plastic is widely used as the manufacturing material of splicing blocks in conventional splicing structures, limiting the types of product that are applicable, and the incapability to apply on diversity of products.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Multiple splicing structures have been proposed in the prior arts, for example, the above discussed conventional splicing toys are disclosed in Chinese invention patents CN101132842A and CN105792905A. The splicing toys disclosed in these documents have a plurality of plastic splicing blocks. One of two splicing blocks spliced with each other is formed with a concave splicing hole, and one of the two splicing blocks is formed with a convex splicing column. Plurality of splicing blocks are connected by inserting the splicing column into the splicing hole.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another example of a splicing structure is disclosed in Chinese invention patent CN107982937A.
