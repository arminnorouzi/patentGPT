level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0086246 filed on Jul. 1, 2021, which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a transmission for a vehicle, and more particularly, to a vehicle transmission with a transmission shift unit, positions of which are adjusted based on a preset condition.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A transmission may vary gear ratios to maintain rotational speed of the engine of a vehicle over different vehicle speeds, enabling the driver to change the gear ratio of the transmission via manipulation of a shift lever.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a manual shift mode, the driver changes the shift stage, and in an automatic shift mode, the shift stage is automatically changed depending on the vehicle speed when the driver selects the drive stage (D). Further, in a sports mode type transmission, both manual shifting and automatic shifting can be performed in a single transmission system. The sports mode type transmission system may be provided with a manual transmission next to an automatic transmission, allowing the driver to perform manual shifting by increasing or decreasing the gear stage while the system performs automatic shifting by default.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The shift lever is exposed inside the vehicle for the driver's manipulation, and most shift levers are exposed between the center fascia and the console box in the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A driver normally selects a shift stage by moving the shift lever, which requires a space amounting to the movement trajectory of the shift lever, which in turn requires design endeavors to prevent the shift lever from interfering with the surroundings thereof.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Recently, a dial-type or button-type shift operation is available to reduce the space required for the shifting manipulation, thereby allowing more efficient use of the interior space of the vehicle and improving maneuverability of the transmissions.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Aspects of the present disclosure provide a transmission for a vehicle with a transmission shift unit, positions of which are adjusted based on a preset condition.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, aspects of the present disclosure are not restricted to those set forth herein. The above and other aspects of the present disclosure will become more apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art to which the present disclosure pertains by referencing the detailed description of the present disclosure given below.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to achieve the above object, a transmission for a vehicle according to an embodiment of the present invention may include a transmission shift unit configured to receive a shift command of the vehicle, a driving unit configured to generate a driving force for causing the transmission shift unit to be switched between positions, and a controller configured to control the driving unit for causing the transmission shift unit to be switched between the positions depending on whether a preset condition is satisfied. Further, the driving unit may include a first stator configured to generate magnetic flux, a first rotor including first inner permanent magnets and second inner permanent magnets that are disposed circumferentially at regular intervals along a rotational axis, and configured to be rotated by the magnetic flux transmitted to the first inner permanent magnets, outer permanent magnets that are provided in a different number than the second inner permanent magnets, a second rotor disposed between the second inner permanent magnets and the outer permanent magnets, and a clutch unit disposed between the first rotor and the second rotor.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, the clutch unit may include a base ring, one or more rollers disposed between the base ring and the second rotor, and one or more elastic parts provided on the base ring and configured to provide an elastic force to the rollers with respect to the base ring. The base ring may include seating surfaces configured to seat the rollers and to provide travel paths of the rollers, each of the elastic parts may be planar and elongated, and each of the seating surfaces may be inclined corresponding to a longitudinal direction of each elastic part and a travel path of each roller. The base ring may include seating surfaces configured to seat the one or more rollers and to provide the rollers with travel paths, respectively, and each of the one or more rollers may be pushed by the second rotor when rotating, toward a spot where the seating surface and an inner surface of the second rotor are spaced by decreasing distances.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first rotor may include a rotating body and catch portions that protrude from the rotating body, and the first rotor may be rotated by a rotational force of the second rotor transmitted to the catch portions through the rollers. The first rotor may include a rotating body and catch portions that protrude from the rotating body, and each of the one or more rollers may be pushed by the catch portions when the first rotor rotates, toward a spot where the seating surface and the inner surface of the second rotor are spaced by increasing distances. The catch portions may be disposed circumferentially, and each of the catch portions may be disposed between adjacent ones of the rollers.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, the first rotor may be coupled to a rotor shaft formed elongated along a rotation axis, the rotor shaft being provided with a magnet holder that is configured to hold a magnetic substance. A magnetic sensor may be further provided to detect a rotation angle of the first rotor by using a magnetic force distribution of the magnetic substance.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, the controller may be configured to control the driving unit to cause the shift unit to be switched to a parking stage position when a parking condition is satisfied, and to control the driving unit to cause the shift unit to be switched to a stowed position when a stowing condition is satisfied.

The shift lever <b>120</b> may be elongated in one direction from the shift body <b>110</b>. For example, the shift lever <b>120</b> may be elongated in a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis Ax. As the shift body <b>110</b> rotates, the longitudinal direction of the shift lever <b>120</b> may be changed or switched. A user (e.g., a driver) may operate the shift unit <b>100</b> to change the shift stage of the vehicle.

Further, the transmission <b>10</b> for a vehicle according to some embodiments of the present disclosure may have a stowed position. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the shift unit <b>100</b> may be switched from the parking stage position to the stowed position.

Specifically, when the parking condition is satisfied, the controller <b>300</b> may be configured to control the driving unit <b>200</b> for switching the shift unit <b>100</b> to the parking stage position. For example, when the vehicle is turned off or turned on, the controller <b>300</b> may be configured to control the driving unit <b>200</b> to switch the shift unit <b>100</b> to the parking position. Alternatively, when the stowing condition is satisfied, the controller <b>300</b> may be configured to control the driving unit <b>200</b> to switch the shift unit <b>100</b> to the stowed position. For example, when the vehicle is turned off or a separate user command is inputted by using a button or other input means, the controller <b>300</b> may be configured to control the driving unit <b>200</b> to cause the shift unit <b>100</b> to be switched to the stowed position.
