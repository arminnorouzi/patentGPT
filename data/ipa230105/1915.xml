In an embodiment, a parking map representative of a point of interest is selectively communicated to an autonomous vehicle, so that the autonomous vehicle may automatically park and summon at the point of interest.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Aspects of the present disclosure can be used to allow the public to benefit today from self-driving car technology by having their current vehicle drop them off and pick them up at points of interest which are mapped specifically to allow for this purpose. Aspects of the present disclosure can also be used to allow a point of interest to offer automatic valet services for those who visit the point of interest. This is so, at least in part, because the current disclosure describes systems and methods which can be used with substantially any point of interest, for example a point of interest having access to any ordinary parking lot or parking garage. Furthermore, this is so, at least in part, because mapping and usage of parking maps may be access controlled. For example, at a private point of interest, such as a residence, a parking map may be generated with an access datum indicating private usage of the parking map only by certain user's and/or autonomous vehicles. Alternatively, a public point of interest may have a parking map with an access datum indicating public usage of the parking map at the public point of interest.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Aspects of the present disclosure allow for controlled usage of parking maps for automatic parking. Exemplary embodiments illustrating aspects of the present disclosure are described below in the context of several specific examples.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an exemplary embodiment of a system <b>100</b> for controlling usage of parking maps for autonomous parking is illustrated. As used in this disclosure, &#x201c;mapping&#x201d; is a process of generating a symbolic representation, i.e., a map, of a geographic location, for example without limitation a parking lot and surrounding areas. Mapping may include generation of machine and/or human readable maps. In some cases, mapping may be performed with requisite specificity that it may be understood as world modeling. As used in this disclosure, &#x201c;world modeling&#x201d; is a process of generating a machine-readable model of a world surrounding a device, such that the device is able to function autonomously by using at least in part the model. As used in this disclosure, &#x201c;autonomous&#x201d; is an attributive term referring to an ability of a device, i.e., machine, to function without human intervention. The society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has defined six different levels (0-5) to categorize the type of automation a vehicle may be configured to perform. Levels 0-3 all require a driver and cannot travel from a first point to a second point without any human interaction during the trip. Level 4 vehicles are configured to perform all safety critical driving functions and monitor roadway conditions for an entire trip between a first point and a second point without any human interaction during the trip. However, level 4 vehicles are limited according to their corresponding operational design domain (ODD). Level 5 vehicles may perform all driving tasks under any conditions. The SAE levels for automated vehicles have been adopted by various entities including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. As used in this disclosure, an &#x201c;autonomous vehicle&#x201d; is fully autonomous and able to drive without human oversight; for example, in some cases, an autonomous vehicle may operate at a SAE automation level of 4. In some cases, an autonomous vehicle may operate without a human present within the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, system includes a computing device <b>104</b>.

For instance, computing device <b>104</b> may be configured to perform a single step or sequence repeatedly until a desired or commanded outcome is achieved; repetition of a step or a sequence of steps may be performed iteratively and/or recursively using outputs of previous repetitions as inputs to subsequent repetitions, aggregating inputs and/or outputs of repetitions to produce an aggregate result, reduction or decrement of one or more variables such as global variables, and/or division of a larger processing task into a set of iteratively addressed smaller processing tasks. Computing device <b>104</b> may perform any step or sequence of steps as described in this disclosure in parallel, such as simultaneously and/or substantially simultaneously performing a step two or more times using two or more parallel threads, processor cores, or the like; division of tasks between parallel threads and/or processes may be performed according to any protocol suitable for division of tasks between iterations. Persons skilled in the art, upon reviewing the entirety of this disclosure, will be aware of various ways in which steps, sequences of steps, processing tasks, and/or data may be subdivided, shared, or otherwise dealt with using iteration, recursion, and/or parallel processing.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, computing device <b>104</b> may be configured to receive a parking map <b>108</b>. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;parking map&#x201d; is a map associated with a point of interest. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;point of interest&#x201d; is geographic location, area, or point, to which a car may, generally speaking, be driven; for instance, a shop in a mall may be considered a point of interest, according to this disclosure, even though one would not drive their car into the mall to get to the shop but would instead park near the mall and walk to the shop. A parking map <b>108</b> may be used by an autonomous vehicle to drive (e.g., park and/or be summoned) autonomously, for instance at a point of interest associated with the parking map <b>108</b>. As described in greater detail below, a parking map <b>108</b> may include location data and corresponding designation data requisite to allow for automatic parking of an autonomous vehicle at a point of interest. For example, in some cases, a parking map <b>108</b> may include representations of one or more of geofences, waypoints, and or waypaths as well as designations indicating required information, such as parking location, pick-up location, drop-off location, and the like.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, parking map <b>108</b> may include an access datum <b>112</b>. As used in this disclosure, an &#x201c;access datum&#x201d; is at least an element of data that represents accessibility of a parking map. For example, in some cases, an access datum may indicate that a parking map is privately accessible, for example only to one user. Alternatively or additionally, in some cases, an access datum may indicate that a parking map is publicly accessible; for example, the parking map is widely accessible publicly to large audience. In still more cases, an access datum may indicate that a parking map is shared, for example, shared between a group of users. In some cases, a shared parking map may be able to be used by a plurality of users, such as without limitation at least a group of users, but the shared parking map is still not publicly accessible.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in some embodiments, parking map <b>108</b> may include at least a permission datum. In some cases, permission datum indicates which user and/or a group of users have permission to read (e.g., view), write (e.g., modify and/or survey), and/or access (e.g., access datum <b>112</b>) a parking map depending upon the permission datum. In some cases, parking map <b>108</b> may include at least an owner datum. An owner datum may indicate which user &#x201c;owns&#x201d; or controls parking map <b>108</b>. In some cases, a user who maps, such as a surveyor, parking map <b>108</b> may be indicated as the parking map <b>108</b> owner. Alternatively and/or additionally, in some cases, another user may be indicated as owner of a parking map <b>108</b>. In some other embodiments, substantially one user, a superuser, or no user may own substantially all parking maps <b>108</b>. In some cases, only a parking map owner may access, edit, modify, and/or delete parking map <b>108</b> and/or access datum <b>112</b>. In some cases parking map <b>108</b> may additionally include a group datum. In some cases, a group datum may indicate what group, for example what group of users, is associated with parking map <b>108</b>. In some cases, a user belonging to parking map <b>108</b> group may be able to access, edit, modify, and/or delete parking map.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in some embodiments, computing device <b>104</b> may be further configured to store parking map <b>108</b> on a map datastore. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;map datastore&#x201d; is a location, virtual, digital, and/or physical, within which a parking map is stored. Non-limiting exemplary map datastores include databases, database tables, filesystems, and the like. An exemplary database which in some embodiments may be used as a map datastore is NOSQL. In some cases, a different map datastore will be used to store parking maps <b>108</b> according to their access datum <b>112</b>. For example, in some cases, all publicly accessible parking maps may be stored on substantially the same map datastore. Likewise, private parking maps may be stored on one or more private map datastores. In some cases, map datastore may correspond to one or more of access datum <b>112</b>, permission datum, owner datum, and/or group datum.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, parking map <b>108</b> may include at least a survey designator <b>116</b>. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;survey designator&#x201d; is a designator or label associated with a point of interest. For example without limitation, at least a survey designator <b>116</b> may include one or more of a point of interest designator, drop-off location designator, parking location designator, parking path designator, pick-up location designator, and summoning path designator. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;point of interest designator&#x201d; is at least an element of data that symbolizes a point of interest. Non-limiting examples of point of interest (POI) designators include a POI name, a POI identification (i.e., serial) number, a POI positional coordinates, a POI descriptor, a POI characteristic, and the like. At least a survey designator <b>116</b> may include a drop-off location designator for a drop-off location associated with point of interest. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;drop-off location&#x201d; is a geographic location, area, or point, where an autonomous vehicle may be driven to and dropped off for automatic parking. In some embodiments, autonomous vehicle may be dropped off at a drop-off location and the autonomous vehicle may automatically park itself from the drop-off location without intervention from a human driver.
