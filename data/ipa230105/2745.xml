PMID: 22530743). Many genetic disorders have been identified as having specific nucleotide changes underlying the disorder (for example, a C to T change in a specific codon of a gene associated with a disease; Cargill et al., Nat Genet (1999) 22(3):231-8. PMID: 10391209). In addition, targeted editing can be used for a wide range of applications in plants, including modifying sequences to add or improve desirable characteristics. An ideal nucleic acid editing technology possesses three characteristics: (1) high efficiency of installing the desired modification; (2) minimal off-target activity; and (3) the ability to be programmed to precisely edit any site in a given nucleic acid. Therefore, precision gene editing would provide an effective tool to precisely modify proteins and would represent a powerful tool suitable for a wide range of applications in medical, industrial, agronomic, and research fields.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are a variety of current genome engineering tools that are able to cleave DNA of a particular sequence, including engineered zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs; Urnov et al., Nat Rev Genet (2010) 11(9):636-46. PMID: 20717154), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) (Joung and Sander, Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol (2013) 14(1):49-55. PMID: 23169466), and the RNA-guided DNA endonuclease Cas9 (Charpentier and Doudna, Nature (2013) 495, (7439):50-1. PMID: 23467164). These existing tools can be used to mutate the DNA at the cleavage site via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or to replace the DNA surrounding the cleavage site via homology-directed repair (HDR) (Pan et al., Mol Biotechnol (2013) 55(1):54-62. PMID: 23089945). NHEJ and HDR are both, however, stochastic processes that typically result in modest gene editing efficiencies as well as off-target gene alterations (Santiago et al., PNAS (2008) 105(15):5809-14. PMID: 18359850).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Because of this limited efficiency, research has focused on developing composite genome engineering tools. These composite tools include additional components, such as uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitors, to increase gene editing efficiency. In developing these systems, however, it has been found that Cas9 base-editing systems are limited in their ability to target some regions of the genome because Cas9 is highly dependent on the presence of a nearby protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Further, base-editing systems that have protein uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitors suffer from incomplete uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) inhibition, which decreases base-editing efficiency. Last, there exists the possibility that some organisms possess glycosylase variants that bind poorly to protein uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitors, and thus provide incomplete protection of deaminated cytosine bases.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There exists therefore a need for genome engineering tools able to edit a target nucleotide sequence at higher efficiency with a reduced amount of off-target alterations as compared to the current genome engineering tools. These tools would address a need for efficient and reliable precision genome editing in medical, industrial, agronomic, and research fields.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to meet these needs, the present disclosure is directed to base-editing systems including a fusion protein including a DNA-binding domain and a cytidine deaminase domain and a non-protein uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor (npUGI). The DNA-binding domains of base-editing systems of the present disclosure include domains with a variety of target region possibilities, which increase the number and type of sequences that can be edited. The npUGIs of the base-editing systems of the present disclosure improve UDG inhibition (e.g., UDG inhibition is more complete) and are suitable for use in a wide range of organisms.

The deamination of a nucleobase by a deaminase can lead to a point mutation at the respective residue, which is referred to herein as nucleic acid editing. A base-editing system including a DNA binding domain, a DNA editing domain, and a non-protein uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor can thus be used for the targeted editing of nucleic acid sequences. Such base-editing systems are useful for targeted editing of DNA in vitro (e.g., for the generation of mutant cells, animals, or plants); for the introduction of targeted mutations (e.g., for the correction of genetic defects in cells ex vivo, such as in cells obtained from a subject that are subsequently re-introduced into the same or another subject); and for the introduction of targeted mutations (e.g., the correction of genetic defects or the introduction of deactivating mutations in disease-associated genes in a subject). Typically, the DNA binding domain of the base-editing systems described herein is a Cas9 domain, a Cas12a domain, a Cas12h domain, a Cas12i domain, a CasX domain, a CasY domain, a C2c1 domain, a C2c2 domain, a C2c3 domain, a TALE domain, or a ZF domain.

In some embodiments, the DNA binding domain or DNA sequence-targeting component is a Cas DNA endonuclease (e.g., a Cas domain), a transcription activator-like effector (TALE) (e.g., a TALE domain), a Zinc Finger (ZF) (e.g., a ZF domain), a meganuclease (e.g., a meganuclease domain), or an Argonaute (e.g., an Argonaute domain). In some embodiments, the Cas domain is a Cas9 domain, a nuclease inactive Cas9 (dCas9) domain, a Cas9 nickase domain, a Cas12a domain, a nuclease inactive Cas12a (dCas12a) domain, a Cas12a nickase domain, a Cas12h domain, a Cas12i domain, a CasX domain, a CasY domain, a C2c1 domain, a C2c2 domain, or a C2c3 domain.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0057">In some embodiments, the DNA binding domain of any of the base-editing systems provided herein is a single effector of a microbial CRISPR-Cas system.

Typically, microbial CRISPR-Cas systems are divided into Class 1 and Class 2 systems. Class 1 systems have multisubunit effector complexes, while Class 2 systems have a single protein effector. Cas9 and Cas12a are Class 2 effectors.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0058">The term &#x201c;RNA-programmable nuclease,&#x201d; and &#x201c;RNA-guided nuclease&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein and refer to a nuclease that forms a complex with (e.g., binds or associates with) one or more RNA that is not a target for cleavage. In some embodiments, an RNA-programmable nuclease, when in a complex with an RNA, may be referred to as a nuclease:RNA complex. Typically, the bound RNA(s) is referred to as a guide RNA (gRNA). gRNAs can exist as a complex of two or more RNAs, or as a single RNA molecule. gRNAs that exist as a single RNA molecule may be referred to as single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), though &#x201c;gRNA&#x201d; is used interchangeably to refer to guide RNAs that exist as either single molecules or as a complex of two or more molecules. Typically, gRNAs that exist as single RNA species include two domains: (1) a domain that shares homology to a target nucleic acid and directs binding of a Cas complex (e.g., a Cas9 complex, Cas12a complex, a Cas12h complex, a Cas12i complex, a CasX complex, a CasY complex, a C2c1 complex, a C2c2 complex, or a C2c3 complex) to the target; and (2) a domain that binds a Cas protein (e.g., a Cas9 protein, a Cas12a protein, a Cas12h protein, a Cas12i protein, a CasX protein, a CasY protein, a C2c1 protein, a C2c2 protein, or a C2c3 protein). In some embodiments, domain (2) corresponds to a sequence known as a tracrRNA, and includes a stem-loop structure. For example, in some embodiments, domain (2) is identical or homologous to a tracrRNA as provided in Jinek et al., Science (2012) 337:816-821. Other examples of gRNAs (e.g., those including domain 2) can be found in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/874,682, filed Sep. 6, 2013; and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/874,746, filed Sep. 6, 2013. In some embodiments, a gRNA includes two or more of domains (1) and (2), and may be referred to as an &#x201c;extended gRNA.&#x201d; For example, an extended gRNA will, e.g., bind two or more Cas9 proteins and bind a target nucleic acid at two or more distinct regions, as described herein. The gRNA includes a nucleotide sequence that complements a target site, which mediates binding of the nuclease/RNA complex to said target site, providing the sequence specificity of the nuclease:RNA complex. In some embodiments, the RNA-programmable nuclease is the (CRISPR-associated system) Cas9 endonuclease, for example Cas9 (Csn1) from <i>S. pyogenes </i>(see, e.g., Ferretti et al., PNAS (2001) 98:4658-4663; Deltcheva et al., Nature (2011) 471:602-607; and Jinek et al., Science (2012) 337:816-821). In some embodiments, the RNA-programmable nuclease is the (CRISPR-associated system) Cas12a endonuclease, for example Cas12a from <i>Lachnospiraceae bacterium</i>. Cas domain containing base-editing systems can include one or more RNA sequences, or DNA sequences encoding the RNA sequences. The RNA sequences may be fused at least temporarily to the guide RNA (crRNA), or be expressed separately therefrom. Examples of such sequences can include pre-crRNAs, tracR sequences or putative tracR sequences, direct repeat RNAs of corresponding CRISPR arrays, RNA sequences mediating tethering, RNAi or siRNA sequences mediating silencing of one or more endogenous genes, as well as RNA-processing regions like tRNAs or ribozymes.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0059">Because RNA-programmable nucleases (e.g., Cas9, Cas12a, Cas12h, Cas12i, CasX, CasY, C2c1, C2c2, or C2c3) use RNA:DNA hybridization to target DNA cleavage sites, these proteins are able to be targeted, in principle, to any sequence specified by the guide RNA. Methods of using RNA-programmable nucleases, such as Cas (e.g., Cas9, Cas12a, Cas12h, Cas12i, CasX, CasY, C2c1, C2c2, or C2c3), for site-specific cleavage (e.g., to modify a genome) are known in the art (see e.g., Cong et al., Science 339 (2013), 819-823; Mali et al., Science (2013) 339, 823-826; Hwang, et al., Nat Biotechnol (2013) 31, 227-229; Jinek et al., eLife (2013) 2, e00471; Dicarlo et al., Nucleic Acids Res (2013); Jiang et al., Nat Biotechnol (2013) 31, 233-239).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0060">Any of the names of the Cas domains may be modified by the initials of the organism from which it has been derived.

CRISPR-Cas (CRISPR associated) systems are protein-RNA complexes that use an RNA molecule (sgRNA) as a guide to localize the complex to a target DNA sequence via base-pairing (Jore et al., Nat Struct Mol Biol (2011) 18(5):529-36. PMID: 21460843). In the natural systems, a Cas protein then acts as an endonuclease to cleave the targeted DNA sequence (Horvath and Barrangou, Science (2010) 327(5962): 167-70. PMID: 20056882). The target DNA sequence must be both complementary to the sgRNA, and also contain a &#x201c;protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) at the 3&#x2032;-end of the complementary region in order for the system to function (Wiedenheft et al., Nature (2012) 482(7385):331-8. PMID: 22337052).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0062">Among the known Cas proteins, <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9 has been mostly widely used as a tool for genome engineering (Gasiunas et al., Trends Microbiol (2013) 21(1.1):562-7. PMID: 24095303). Point mutations can be introduced into a Cas protein to abolish nuclease activity, resulting in a dead Cas (dCas) that still retains its ability to bind DNA in a sgRNA-programmed manner (Qi et al., Cell (2013) 152(5): 1173-83. PMID: 23452860). In principle, when fused to another protein or domain, a dCas can target that protein to virtually any DNA sequence simply by co-expression with an appropriate sgRNA (Mali et al, Nat Methods (2013) 10(10):957-63.

PMID: 23287722).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0063">In some embodiments, the present disclosure relates to Cas9 domains. The Cas9 domain may be a nuclease active Cas9 domain, a nuclease inactive Cas9 domain (dCas9), or a Cas9 nickase. The term &#x201c;Cas9&#x201d; or &#x201c;Cas9 nuclease&#x201d; refers to an RNA-guided nuclease including a Cas9 protein, or a portion thereof (e.g., a protein including an active, inactive, or partially active DNA cleavage domain of Cas9, and/or the gRNA binding domain of Cas9). A Cas9 nuclease is also referred to sometimes as a casn1 nuclease or a CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-associated nuclease (see, e.g., Charpentier and Doudna, Nature (2013) 495, (7439):50-1. PMID: 23467164). CRISPR is an adaptive immune system that provides protection against mobile genetic elements (viruses, transposable elements and conjugative plasmids). CRISPR clusters contain spacers, sequences complementary to antecedent mobile elements, and target invading nucleic acids. CRISPR clusters are transcribed and processed into CRISPR RNA (crRNA). In type II CRISPR systems, correct processing of pre-crRNA requires a trans-encoded small RNA (tracrRNA), endogenous ribonuclease 3 (rnc) and a Cas9 protein. The tracrRNA serves as a guide for ribonuclease 3-aided processing of pre-crRNA. Subsequently, Cas9/crRNA/tracrRNA endonucleolytically cleaves linear or circular dsDNA target complementary to the spacer. The target strand not complementary to crRNA is first cut endonucleolytically, then trimmed 3&#x2032;-5&#x2032; exonucleolytically. In nature, DNA-binding and cleavage typically requires protein and both RNAs. However, single guide RNAs (&#x201c;sgRNA&#x201d;, or simply &#x201c;gNRA&#x201d;) can be engineered so as to incorporate aspects of both the crRNA and tracrRNA into a single RNA species (see, e.g., Jinek et al, Science (2012) 337:816-821). Cas9 recognizes a short motif in the CRISPR repeat sequences (the PAM or protospacer adjacent motif) to help distinguish self versus non-self Cas9 nuclease sequences and structures are well known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Ferretti et al, PNAS (2001) 98:4658-4663; Deltcheva et al., Nature (2011) 471:602-607; and Jinek et al., Science (2012) 337:816-821). Cas9 orthologs have been described in various species, including, but not limited to, <i>Streptococcus pyogenes </i>and <i>S. thermophilus</i>. Additional suitable Cas9 nucleases and sequences will be apparent to those of skill in the art based on this disclosure, and such Cas9 nucleases and sequences include Cas9 sequences from the organisms and loci disclosed in Chylinski et al., RNA Biology (2013) 10:5, 726-737. In some embodiments, a Cas9 nuclease has an inactive (e.g., an inactivated) DNA cleavage domain, that is, the Cas9 is a nickase.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0064">A nuclease-inactivated Cas9 domain, or deactivated Cas9 domain, may interchangeably be referred to as a &#x201c;dCas9&#x201d; domain (for nuclease-&#x201c;dead&#x201d; Cas9). Methods for generating a Cas9 protein (or a portion thereof) having an inactive DNA cleavage domain are known (See, e.g., Jinek et al., Science (2012) 337:816-821; Qi et al., Cell (2013) 28; 152(5): 1173-83). For example, the DNA cleavage domain of Cas9 is known to include two subdomains, the HNH nuclease subdomain and the RuvCl subdomain. The HNH subdomain cleaves the strand complementary to the gRNA, whereas the RuvCl subdomain cleaves the non-complementary strand. Mutations within these subdomains can silence the nuclease activity of Cas9. For example, the mutations D10A and H840A completely inactivate the nuclease activity of <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9 (Jinek et al., Science (2012) 337:816-821; Qi et al, Cell (2013) 28; 152(5): 1173-83).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0065">In some embodiments, the Cas9 domain is a nuclease active domain. For example, the Cas9 domain may be a Cas9 domain that cuts both strands of a duplexed nucleic acid (e.g., both strands of a duplexed DNA molecule).

For example, the dCas9 domain may bind to a duplexed nucleic acid molecule (e.g., via a gRNA molecule) without cleaving either strand of the duplexed nucleic acid molecule. In some embodiments, dCas9 corresponds to, in part or in whole, a Cas9 amino acid sequence having one or more mutations that inactivate the Cas9 nuclease activity. For example, in some embodiments, a dCas9 domain includes a D10A and/or a H840A mutation (SEQ ID NO: 9). In some embodiments, the nuclease inactive dCas9 domain includes a DIOX mutation and a H840X mutation of the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 10, or a corresponding mutation in any of the Cas9 sequences provided herein, wherein X is any amino acid change. In some embodiments, the nuclease inactive dCas9 domain includes a D10A mutation and a H840A mutation of the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 10, or a corresponding mutation in any of the Cas9 sequences provided herein. As one example, a nuclease inactive Cas9 domain includes the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 263 (Cloning vector pPlatTET-gRNA2, Accession No. BAV54124; see, e.g., Qi et al., Cell (2013) 152(5): 1173-83).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0067">In other embodiments, dCas9 variants having mutations other than D10A and H840A are provided, which, e.g., result in nuclease inactivated Cas9 (dCas9). Such mutations, by way of example, include other amino acid substitutions at D10 and H820, or other substitutions within the nuclease domains of Cas9 (e.g., substitutions in the UNH nuclease subdomain and/or the RuvCl subdomain). In some embodiments, variants or homologues of dCas9 (e.g., variants of SEQ ID NO: 10) are provided which are at least 70% identical, at least 72.5% identical, at least 75% identical, at least 77.5% identical, at least 80% identical, at least 82.5% identical, at least 85% identical, at least 87.5% identical, at least 90% identical, at least 91% identical, at least 92% identical, at least 93% identical, at least 94% identical, at least 95% identical, at least 96% identical, at least 97% identical, at least 98% identical, at least 99% identical, at least 99.5% identical, or at least 99.9% identical to SEQ ID NO: 10. In some embodiments, variants of dCas9 (e.g., variants of SEQ ID NO: 10) are provided having amino acid sequences which are shorter or longer than SEQ ID NO: 10 by about 5 or more, by about or more, by about 15 or more, by about 20 or more, by about 25 or more, by about 30 or more, by about 40 or more, by about 50 or more, by about 75 or more, or by about 100 or more amino acids.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0068">Additional suitable dCas9 domains will be apparent to those of skill in the art based on this disclosure and knowledge in the field, and are within the scope of this disclosure. Such additional exemplary suitable dCas9 domains include, but are not limited to, D10A/H840A, D10A/D839A/H840A, and D10A/D839A/H840A/N863A mutant domains (See, e.g., Prashant et al., Nat Biotechnol (2013) 31(9): 833-838). In some embodiments, the dCas9 domain includes an amino acid sequence that is at least 60% identical, at least 65% identical, at least 70% identical, at least 72.5% identical, at least 75% identical, at least 77.5% identical, at least 80% identical, at least 82.5% identical, at least 85% identical, at least 87.5% identical, at least 90% identical, at least 91% identical, at least 92% identical, at least 93% identical, at least 94% identical, at least 95% identical, at least 96% identical, at least 97% identical, at least 98% identical, at least 99% identical, at least 99.5% identical, or at least 99.9% identical to any one of the dCas9 domains provided herein.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0069">In some embodiments, the Cas9 domain is a Cas9 nickase. The Cas9 nickase may be a Cas9 protein that is capable of cleaving only one strand of a duplexed nucleic acid molecule (e.g., a duplexed DNA molecule). In some embodiments, the Cas9 nickase cleaves the target strand of a duplexed nucleic acid molecule, meaning that the Cas9 nickase cleaves the strand that is base paired to (complementary to) a gRNA (e.g., an sgRNA) that is bound to the Cas9. In some embodiments, a Cas9 nickase includes a D10A mutation and has a histidine at position 840 of SEQ ID NO: 10, or a mutation in or a corresponding mutation in any of the Cas9 sequences provided herein. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the presence of the catalytic residue H840 restores the activity of the Cas9 to cleave the non-edited (e.g., non-deaminated) strand containing a G opposite the targeted C. Restoration of H840 (e.g., from A840) does not result in the cleavage of the target strand containing the C. For example, a Cas9 nickase may include the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 674. In some embodiments, a Cas9 nickase has an active UNH nuclease domain and is able to cleave the non-targeted strand of DNA, i.e., the strand bound by the gRNA. In further embodiments, a Cas9 nickase has an inactive RuvC nuclease domain and is not able to cleave the targeted strand of the DNA, i.e., the strand where base editing is desired. In some embodiments the Cas9 nickase cleaves the non-target, non-base-edited strand of a duplexed nucleic acid molecule, meaning that the Cas9 nickase cleaves the strand that is not base paired to a gRNA (e.g., an sgRNA) that is bound to the Cas9. In some embodiments, a Cas9 nickase includes an H840A mutation and has an aspartic acid residue at position 10 of SEQ ID NO: 10, or a corresponding mutation in any of the Cas9 sequences provided herein. In some embodiments the Cas9 nickase includes an amino acid sequence that is at least 60% identical, at least 65% identical, at least 70% identical, at least 72.5% identical, at least 75% identical, at least 77.5% identical, at least 80% identical, at least 82.5% identical, at least 85% identical, at least 87.5% identical, at least 90% identical, at least 91% identical, at least 92% identical, at least 93% identical, at least 94% identical, at least 95% identical, at least 96% identical, at least 97% identical, at least 98% identical, at least 99% identical, at least 99.5% identical, or at least 99.9% identical to any one of the Cas9 nickases provided herein. Additional suitable Cas9 nickases will be apparent to those of skill in the art based on this disclosure and knowledge in the field, and are within the scope of this disclosure. Cas9 nickases of the present disclosure are able to generate a single-strand DNA break (nick) at a specific location based on the gRNA-defined target sequence, leading to repair of the non-edited strand, ultimately resulting in a G to A change on the non-edited strand. Briefly, the base-editing system of the present disclosure allows the C of a C-G basepair to be deaminated to a U by a deaminase, e.g., an APOBEC deaminase. Nicking the non-edited strand, having the G, facilitates removal of the G via mismatch repair mechanisms. The npUGI of the base-editing system inhibits UDG, which prevents removal of the U.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0070">In some embodiments, base-editing systems as provided herein include the full-length amino acid sequence of a Cas9 protein, e.g., one of the Cas9 sequences provided herein.

For example, in some embodiments, a base-editing system provided herein includes a portion of a Cas9 protein, wherein the portion binds crRNA and tracrRNA or sgRNA, but does not include a functional nuclease domain, e.g., the portion of the Cas9 protein includes only a truncated version of a nuclease domain or no nuclease domain at all.

For example, a dCas12a domain may be produced by inactivating the RuvC-like domain of Cas12a, as described in Zetsche et al., Cell (2015) 163, 759-771. PMID: 26422227. For example, mutations corresponding to D917A, E1006A, E1028A, D1227A, D1255A, or N1257A in <i>Francisella novicida </i>Cas12a (SEQ ID NO: 356) inactivate Cas12a nuclease activity. In some embodiments, the dCas12a includes mutations corresponding to D917A, E1006A, D1255A, D917A/E1006A, D917A/D1255A, E1006A/D1255A, or D917A/E1006A/D1255A in SEQ ID NO: 350. In some embodiments, the inactivated Cas12a domains include enzymes mutated in amino acid positions 908, 993, 1263 of AsCas12a or corresponding positions in Cas12a orthologs. More particularly, the inactivated Cas12a domains include domains including one or more of mutations D908A, E993A, D1263A of AsCas12a or corresponding mutations in Cas12a orthologs.

More particularly, the inactivated Cas12a domains include domains including one or more of mutations D832A, E925A, D947A or D1180A of LbCas12a or corresponding mutations in Cas12a orthologs. Mutations can also be made at neighboring residues, e.g., at amino acids near those indicated above that participate in the nuclease activity. In some embodiments, only the RuvC domain is inactivated, while in other embodiments, another putative nuclease domain is inactivated, wherein the effector protein complex functions as a nickase and cleaves only one DNA strand. In some embodiments, the dCas12a is a nuclease inactive SEQ ID NO: 359. In some embodiments, the dCas12a includes a D832X mutation relative to SEQ ID NO: 359, wherein X is any amino acid except for D. In some embodiments, the dCas12a includes a D832A mutation relative to SEQ ID NO: 359. Additional dCas12a proteins have been described (see, e.g., Li et al., Nat. Biotech. (2018) DOI: 10.1038/nbt.4102). In some embodiments, the dCas12a includes 1, 2, or 3 of the point mutations D832A, E1006A, D1125A of the Cas12a described in Li et al., Nat. Biotech.

Additional suitable dCas12a domains will be apparent to those of skill in the art based on this disclosure and knowledge in the field, and are within the scope of this disclosure. In some embodiments, the dCas12a domain includes an amino acid sequence that is at least 60% identical, at least 65% identical, at least 70% identical, at least 72.5% identical, at least 75% identical, at least 77.5% identical, at least 80% identical, at least 82.5% identical, at least 85% identical, at least 87.5% identical, at least 90% identical, at least 91% identical, at least 92% identical, at least 93% identical, at least 94% identical, at least 95% identical, at least 96% identical, at least 97% identical, at least 98% identical, at least 99% identical, at least 99.5% identical, or at least 99.9% identical to any one of the dCas12a domains provided herein.

In some embodiments, the Cas12a nickase includes a R836X mutation relative to SEQ ID NO: 359, wherein X is any amino acid except for R. In some embodiments, the Cas12a nickase includes a R836A mutation relative to SEQ ID NO: 359. In some embodiments, the Cas12a nickase includes a R1138A mutation relative to SEQ ID NO: 359. In some embodiments, the Cas12a nickase includes a R912A mutation relative to SEQ ID NO: 358. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, residue R836 of SEQ ID NO: 359 and residue R912 of SEQ ID NO: 358 are examples of corresponding (e.g., homologous) residues. In some embodiments, the Cas12a nickase includes a R1226A mutation relative to SEQ ID NO: 350 (AsCas12a). In some embodiments, the Cas12a nickase includes a mutation at residues R1218 relative to SEQ ID NO: 390 (FnCas12a). In some embodiments, the Cas12a nickase includes a mutation at residue R1293 relative to SEQ ID NO: 400 (MbCas12a). It will be understood by the skilled person that a mutation may be made at a residue in a corresponding position to the positions described herein in a Cas12a ortholog. In some embodiments, the Cas12a nickase may be a Cas12a protein that is capable of cleaving only one strand of a duplexed nucleic acid molecule (e.g., a duplexed DNA molecule). In some embodiments the Cas12a nickase cleaves the target strand of a duplexed nucleic acid molecule, meaning that the Cas12a nickase cleaves the strand that is base paired to (complementary to) a gRNA (e.g., an sgRNA) that is bound to the Cas12a. In some embodiments the Cas12a nickase includes an amino acid sequence that is at least 60% identical, at least 65% identical, at least 70% identical, at least 72.5% identical, at least 75% identical, at least 77.5% identical, at least 80% identical, at least 82.5% identical, at least 85% identical, at least 87.5% identical, at least 90% identical, at least 91% identical, at least 92% identical, at least 93% identical, at least 94% identical, at least 95% identical, at least 96% identical, at least 97% identical, at least 98% identical, at least 99% identical, at least 99.5% identical, or at least 99.9% identical to any one of the Cas12a nickases provided herein. In some embodiments, any of the Cas12a proteins provided herein includes one or more amino acid deletions. Additional suitable Cas12a nickases will be apparent to those of skill in the art based on this disclosure and knowledge in the field, and are within the scope of this disclosure. In some embodiments, the inactivated Cas12a or Cas12a nickase may have associated (e.g., via fusion protein) one or more functional domains, including for example, a cytidine deaminase or catalytic domain thereof. In some embodiments, the Cas12a nickase includes a Cas12a nickase that cleaves the non-target strand, as described in Yamano et al., Cell (2016) 165(4): 949-962. PMID: 27114038. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, Cas12a nickase cuts the target strand more efficiently than the non-target strand.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0087">In some embodiments, the Cas12a domain of any of the base-editing systems provided herein is a modified Cas12a domain. Several small stretches of unstructured regions are predicted within the Cas12a primary structure. Without wishing to be bound by theory, unstructured regions, which are exposed to the solvent and not conserved within different Cas12a orthologs, are preferred sites for splits and insertions of small protein sequences. In addition, these sites can be used to generate chimeric proteins between Cas12a orthologs. Based on the above information, mutants can be generated which lead to inactivation of the Cas12a or which modify the double strand nuclease to nickase activity. In some embodiments, this information is used to develop Cas12a domains with reduced off-target effects.

Codon-optimized Cas12a sequences may be used when the fusion protein of the present disclosure is administered as a nucleic acid. An example of a codon-optimized sequence, is for example, a sequence optimized for expression in a eukaryote (e.g., a mammal such as a human, a plant such as corn, etc.). Information regarding codon usage in different organisms is readily available. Similarly, there are a variety of tools that may be used (e.g., codon usage tables, algorithms, programs, etc.) for codon-optimizing sequences.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0091">In some embodiments, base-editing systems as provided herein include the full-length amino acid sequence of a Cas12a protein, e.g., one of the Cas12a sequences provided herein.

For example, in some embodiments, a base-editing system provided herein includes a portion of a Cas12a protein, wherein the portion binds crRNA and tracrRNA or sgRNA, but does not include a functional nuclease domain, e.g., in that it includes only a truncated version of a nuclease domain or no nuclease domain at all.

Accordingly, aspects of the disclosure provide Cas12a proteins including mutations (e.g., deletions) that disrupt this helical region in Cas12a. In some embodiments, the Cas12a protein includes one or more deletions of the residues K661, K662, T663, G664, D665, Q666, and K667 in SEQ ID NO: 358, or one or more corresponding deletions in another Cas12a protein.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0092">In some embodiments, a base-editing system provided herein includes a &#x201c;split Cas12a&#x201d; protein.

For example, a deaminase could be integrated at the split point of a split Cas12a protein. See, Nihongaki et al., Nat Chem Biol. (2019) (9):882-888. PMID: 31406371.

Cell (2015) 60(3): 385-397. PMID: 26593719. Effectors of two of the systems, C2c1 and C2c3, contain RuvC-like endonuclease domains related to Cas12a. A third system, C2c2 contains an effector with two predicted HEPN RNase domains. Production of mature CRISPR RNA is tracrRNA-independent, unlike production of CRISPR RNA by C2c1. C2c1 depends on both CRISPR RNA and tracrRNA for DNA cleavage. Bacterial C2c2 has been shown to possess a unique RNase activity for CRISPR RNA maturation distinct from its RNA-activated single-stranded RNA degradation activity. These RNase functions are different from each other and from the CRISPR RNA-processing behavior of Cas12a (see, e.g., East-Seletsky, et al., Nature (2016) 538(7624):270-273. PMID: 27669025). In vitro biochemical analysis of C2c2 in <i>Leptotrichia shahii </i>has shown that C2c2 is guided by a single CRISPR RNA and can be programmed to cleave ssRNA targets carrying complementary protospacers. Catalytic residues in the two conserved HEPN domains mediate cleavage. Mutations in the catalytic residues generate catalytically inactive RNA-binding proteins (see, e.g., Abudayyeh et al., Science (2016) 353(6299). PMID: 27256883).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0105">The crystal structure of <i>Alicyclobaccillus acidoterrastris </i>C2c1 (AacC2c1) has been reported in complex with a chimeric single-molecule guide RNA (sgRNA) (see, e.g., Liu et al., Mol. Cell (2017) 65(2):310-322. PMID: 27989439). The crystal structure has also been reported for <i>A. acidoterrestris </i>C2c1 bound to target DNAs as ternary complexes (see, e.g., Yang et al., Cell (2016) 167(7): 1814-1828. PMID: 27984729). Catalytically competent conformations of AacC2c1, both with target and non-target DNA strands, have been captured independently positioned within a single RuvC catalytic pocket, with C2c1-mediated cleavage resulting in a staggered seven-nucleotide break of target DNA. Structural comparisons between C2c1 ternary complexes and previously identified Cas9 and Cas12a counterparts demonstrate the diversity of mechanisms used by CRISPR-Cas9 systems.

TALEs are DNA binding domains derived from various plant bacterial pathogens of the genus <i>Xanthomonas</i>, which secrete TALEs into the host plant cell during infection. The TALEs move to the nucleus, where they recognize and bind to a specific DNA sequence in the promoter region of a specific gene in the host genome. TALEs have a central DNA binding domain composed of 13-28 repeat monomers of 33-34 amino acids. The amino acids of each monomer are highly conserved, except for hypervariable amino acid residues at positions 12 and 13. The two hypervariable amino acids are called repeat-variable diresidues (RVDs). The amino acid pairs NI, NG, HD, and NN of RVDs preferentially recognize adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine/adenine, respectively, and modulation of RVDs can recognize consecutive DNA bases. This simple relationship between amino acid sequence and DNA recognition has allowed for the engineering of specific DNA binding domains by selecting a combination of repeat segments containing the appropriate RVDs. The transcription activator-like effector (TALE) DNA binding domain can be fused to a functional domain, such as a recombinase, a nuclease, a transposase or a helicase, thus conferring sequence specificity to the functional domain.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0112">The TALE disclosed herein, may be full-length or a portion thereof.

Recognition site specificity is conferred by the zinc finger domain, which typically includes two, three, or four zinc fingers, for example having a C2H2 structure, however other zinc finger structures are known and have been engineered. Zinc finger domains can be used for designing polypeptides which specifically bind a selected polynucleotide recognition sequence. Additional functionalities can be fused to the zinc finger binding domain, including transcriptional activator domains, transcription repressor domains, and methylases. In some examples, dimerization of nuclease domain is required for cleavage activity. Each zinc finger recognizes three consecutive base pairs in the target DNA. For example, a 3 finger domain recognizes a sequence of 9 contiguous nucleotides so that two sets of zinc finger triplets are used to bind a 18 nucleotide recognition sequence. Details of ZFs can be found in Urnov et al., Nat Rev Genet (2010) 11(9):636-46. PMID: 20717154.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0115">The DNA binding domain of a ZF is typically composed of 3-4 zinc fingers.

The apolipoprotein B editing complex 3 (APOBEC3) enzyme provides protection to human cells against a certain HIV-1 strain via the deamination of cytosines in reverse-transcribed viral ssDNA (Bhagwat, DNA Repair (Amst) (2004) 3(1):85-9. PMID: 14697763). These proteins all require a Zn2+-coordinating motif (His-X-Glu-X<sub>23-26</sub>-Pro-Cys-X<sub>2-4</sub>-Cys; SEQ ID NO: 598) and bound water molecule for catalytic activity. The Glu residue acts to activate the water molecule to a zinc hydroxide for nucleophilic attack in the deamination reaction. Each family member preferentially deaminates at its own particular &#x201c;hotspot&#x201d;, ranging from WRC (W is A or T, R is A or G) for hAID, to TTC for hAPOBEC3F (Navaratnam et al., Int J Hematol (2006) 83(3): 195-200. PMID: 16720547). A recent crystal structure of the catalytic domain of APOBEC3G revealed a secondary structure of a five-stranded &#x3b2;-sheet core flanked by six &#x3b1;-helices, which is believed to be conserved across the entire family (Holden et al., Nature (2008) 456(7218): 121-4. PMID: 18849968). The active center loops have been shown to be responsible for both ssDNA binding and in determining &#x201c;hotspot&#x201d; identity (Chelico et al., J Biol Chem (2009) 284(41). 27761-5. PMID: 19684020). Overexpression of these enzymes has been linked to genomic instability and cancer, thus highlighting the importance of sequence-specific targeting (Pham et al., Biochemistry (2005) 44(8):2703-15.

Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, advantages of using Cas9 as a recognition agent include (1) the sequence specificity of Cas9 can be easily altered by simply changing the sgRNA sequence; and (2) Cas9 binds to its target sequence by denaturing the dsDNA, resulting in a stretch of DNA that is single-stranded and therefore a viable substrate for the deaminase. Further, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, advantages of using Cas12a as a recognition agent over Cas9 include (1) Cas12a variants have been described that operate at lower temperatures than available Cas9 variants, and are therefore potentially more useful in plant systems than Cas9 variants; and (2) Cas12a has a different editing window (bases available for modification) than Cas9 targeting the same DNA sequence with the same deaminase (e.g., due to differences in the position and orientation of the deaminase domain and the accessibility of the R-loop substrate). Further still, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, advantages of using TALEs and ZFs include (1) the lack of any PAM preference, which enables editing at any base, and increased efficiency in regions of dense chromatin; and (2) TALEs and ZFs do not melt the DNA, and therefore must access targets in dsDNA, which changes the dynamics and likely sequence preferences of deamination.

It is to be understood that &#x201c;non-protein&#x201d; means without one or more amino acid, polypeptide, or protein components (i.e., without any amino acid, polypeptide, or protein components).</p><p id="p-0153" num="0146">Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, cellular DNA-repair response to the presence of U:G heteroduplex DNA may decrease nucleobase editing efficiency in cells. For example, uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) catalyzes removal of U from DNA in cells, which may initiate base excision repair, with reversion of the U:G pair to a C:G pair as the most common outcome. As demonstrated in the Examples below, non-protein uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitors (npUGI) inhibit UDG activity (e.g., completely inhibit UDG activity). It should be understood that the use of a npUGI increases the editing efficiency of a nucleic acid editing domain that is capable of catalyzing a C to U change. For example, systems including a npUGI may be more efficient in deaminating C residues.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0147">In some embodiments, the npUGI is an organochemical inhibitor of UDG.

Glycosylase</heading><p id="p-0192" num="0181">Several Cas family nucleases can accommodate 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; extensions to the spacer sequence, which may be engineered to contain additional natural or non-natural bases that lend novel functions to the base-editing system. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an extension including one or more deoxy-uracil (dU) residues can provide secondary substrates for uracil-DNA glycosylase, thereby reducing the likelihood that an exposed edited base will be bound and excised before being encoded by mismatch repair or replication machinery. The dU-extension can be further modified to resist glycosidic bond cleavage, enhance stability in vivo, or contain dU derivatives with enhanced ability to bind uracil-DNA glycosylase, all of which would produce more potent and longer-lived competitive inhibition of uracil-DNA glycosylase activity. Further, the uracil-containing extension may also be double-stranded (e.g., DNA) and contain one or more U:T, U:G, U:C, U:A, dU: T, dU: G, dU:C, or dU:A pairs. Useful dU analogs can include DNA lesions or repair pathway intermediates. For example, dU analogs are commercially available (from Sigma) in chemically synthesized oligos: 5-F-dU, 5-Br-dU, 5-I-dU, 2&#x2032;-deoxypseudouridine, and 5,6-dihydro-dU. 2&#x2032;-deoxypseudouridine is a non-cleavable substrate (Parikh et al., PNAS (2000) 97(10):5083-5088. doi:10.1073/pnas.97.10.5083).</p><p id="p-0193" num="0182">Extension of the crRNA with dU bases can be accomplished during chemical synthesis or enzymatically using polymerases (Kent et al., eLife (2016) 5:e13740. PMID:27311885). The inhibitor-containing DNA oligonucleotides can be synthesized (e.g., by IDT or Sigma) by standard phosphoramidate chemistry, just like a PCR primer. Alternatively, poly-dU oligonucleotides of precise length and composition can be attached directly to a chemically-modified crRNA using one of a number of different attachment reagents. For example, using a &#x201c;click&#x201d; reaction (Lee et al., eLife (2017) 6:e25312. PMID: 28462777). Further, T4 RNA ligase 1 can be used to ligate a DNA oligonucleotide to single stranded RNA. Additional details regarding RNA guides including poly dU extensions may be found in Ahn et al., Sci Rep (2019) 9(1): 13911. PMID: 31227798; Bin Moon et al., Nat Commun (2018) 9(1):3651.

For example, any of the base editors provided herein may be used to correct one or more mutations associated with any of the diseases or disorders provided herein. In some embodiments, the target DNA sequence includes a sequence associated with a disease or disorder. In some embodiments, the target DNA sequence includes a point mutation associated with a disease or disorder. In some embodiments, the activity of the DNA binding domain (e.g., a Cas9 domain, a Cas12a domain, a Cas12h domain, a Cas12i domain, a CasX domain, a CasY domain, a C2c1 domain, a C2c2 domain, a C2c3 domain, a TALE domain, or a ZF domain), the DNA binding base-editing system, or the complex results in a correction of the point mutation. In some embodiments, the target DNA sequence includes a T to C point mutation associated with a disease or disorder, wherein the deamination of the mutant C base results in a sequence that is not associated with a disease or disorder. In some embodiments, the target DNA sequence encodes a protein, the point mutation is in a codon, and the point mutation results in a change in the amino acid encoded by the mutant codon as compared to the wild-type codon. In some embodiments, the deamination of the mutant C results in a change of the amino acid encoded by the mutant codon. In some embodiments, the deamination of the mutant C results in the codon encoding the wild-type amino acid. In some embodiments, the base editor is used in vivo in a subject, e.g., a human subject. In some embodiments, the subject has a disease or disorder or has been diagnosed with a disease or disorder. In some embodiments, the disease or disorder is cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria, epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (EHK), Charcot-Marie-Toot disease type 4J, neuroblastoma (B), von Willebrand disease (vWD), myotonia congenital, hereditary renal amyloidosis, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hereditary lymphedema, familial Alzheimer's disease, HIV, Prion disease, chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous articular syndrome (CINCA), desmin-related myopathy (DRM), a neoplastic disease associated with a mutant PI3KCA protein, a mutant CTNNB 1 protein, a mutant HRAS protein, or a mutant p53 protein.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0187">Some embodiments provide methods for using the base-editing system provided herein. In some embodiments, the base-editing system is used to introduce a point mutation into a nucleic acid by deaminating a target nucleobase, e.g., a C residue. In some embodiments, the deamination of the target nucleobase results in the correction of a genetic defect, e.g., in the correction of a point mutation that leads to a loss of function in a gene product. In some embodiments, the genetic defect is associated with a disease or disorder, e.g., a lysosomal storage disorder or a metabolic disease, such as, for example, type I diabetes. In some embodiments, the methods provided herein are used to introduce a deactivating point mutation into a gene or allele that encodes a gene product that is associated with a disease or disorder. For example, in some embodiments, methods are provided herein that employ base-editing system to introduce a deactivating point mutation into an oncogene (e.g., in the treatment of a proliferative disease). A deactivating mutation may, in some embodiments, generate a premature stop codon in a coding sequence, which results in the expression of a truncated gene product, e.g., a truncated protein lacking the function of the full-length protein.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0188">In some embodiments, the purpose of the methods provide herein is to restore the function of a dysfunctional gene via genome editing. The base-editing systems provided herein can be validated for gene editing-based human therapeutics in vitro, e.g., by correcting a disease-associated mutation in human cell culture. It will be understood by the skilled artisan that the base-editing systems provided herein, e.g., the base-editing systems including DNA binding domain (e.g., a Cas9 domain, a Cas12a domain, a Cas12h domain, a Cas12i domain, a CasX domain, a CasY domain, a C2c1 domain, a C2c2 domain, a C2c3 domain, an Argonaute domain, a TALE domain, or a ZF domain) and a nucleic acid deaminase domain can be used to correct any single pointT-&#x3e;C or A-&#x3e;G mutation. In the first case, deamination of the mutant C back to U corrects the mutation, and in the latter case, deamination of the C that is base-paired with the mutant G, followed by a round of replication, corrects the mutation.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0189">An exemplary disease-relevant mutation that can be corrected by the provided base-editing systems in vitro or in vivo is the H1047R (A3140G) polymorphism in the PI3KCA protein. The phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic alpha subunit (PI3KCA) protein acts to phosphorylate the 3-OH group of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol. The PI3KCA gene has been found to be mutated in many different carcinomas, and thus it is considered to be a potent oncogene. In fact, the A3 140G mutation is present in several NCI-60 cancer cell lines, such as, for example, the HCT116, SKOV3, and T47D cell lines, which are readily available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).</p><p id="p-0201" num="0190">In some embodiments, a cell carrying a mutation to be corrected, e.g., a cell carrying a point mutation, e.g., an A3 140G point mutation in exon 20 of the PI3KCA gene, resulting in a H1047R substitution in the PI3KCA protein, is contacted with an expression construct encoding a DNA binding domain (e.g., a Cas9 domain, a Cas12a domain, a Cas12h domain, a Cas12i domain, a CasX domain, a CasY domain, a C2c1 domain, a C2c2 domain, a C2c3 domain, an Argonaute domain, a TALE domain, or a ZF domain) deaminase base-editing system and an appropriately designed sgRNA targeting the base-editing system to the respective mutation site in the encoding PI3KCA gene. Control experiments can be performed where the sgRNAs are designed to target the base-editing systems to non-C residues that are within the PI3KCA gene. Genomic DNA of the treated cells can be extracted, and the relevant sequence of the PI3KCA genes PCR amplified and sequenced to assess the activities of the base-editing systems in human cell culture.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0191">It will be understood that the example of correcting point mutations in PI3KCA is provided for illustration purposes and is not meant to limit the instant disclosure. The skilled artisan will understand that the instantly disclosed base-editing systems can be used to correct other point mutations and mutations associated with other cancers and with diseases other than cancer including other proliferative diseases.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0192">The successful correction of point mutations in disease-associated genes and alleles opens up new strategies for gene correction with applications in therapeutics and basic research. Site-specific single-base modification systems like the disclosed base-editing systems of DNA binding (e.g., a Cas9 domain, a Cas12a domain, a Cas12h domain, a Cas12i domain, a CasX domain, a CasY domain, a C2c1 domain, a C2c2 domain, a C2c3 domain, an Argonaute domain, a TALE domain, or a ZF domain) and deaminase enzymes or domains also have applications in &#x201c;reverse&#x201d; gene therapy, where certain gene functions are purposely suppressed or abolished. In these cases, site-specifically mutating Tip (TGG), Gin (CAA and CAG), or Arg (CGA) residues to premature stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) can be used to abolish protein function in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0193">The instant disclosure provides methods for the treatment of a subject diagnosed with a disease associated with or caused by a point mutation that can be corrected by a base-editing system provided herein. For example, in some embodiments, a method is provided that includes administering to a subject having such a disease, e.g., a cancer associated with a PI3KCA point mutation as described above, an effective amount of a DNA binding (e.g., a Cas9 domain, a Cas12a domain, a Cas12h domain, a Cas12i domain, a CasX domain, a CasY domain, a C2c1 domain, a C2c2 domain, a C2c3 domain, a TALE domain, or a ZF domain) deaminase base-editing system that corrects the point mutation or introduces a deactivating mutation into the disease-associated gene. In some embodiments, the disease is a proliferative disease. In some embodiments, the disease is a genetic disease. In some embodiments, the disease is a neoplastic disease. In some embodiments, the disease is a metabolic disease. In some embodiments, the disease is a lysosomal storage disease. Other diseases that can be treated by correcting a point mutation or introducing a deactivating mutation into a disease-associated gene will be known to those of skill in the art, and the disclosure is not limited in this respect.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0194">The instant disclosure provides methods for the treatment of additional diseases or disorders, e.g., diseases or disorders that are associated or caused by a point mutation that can be corrected by deaminase-mediated gene editing. Some such diseases are described herein, and additional suitable diseases that can be treated with the strategies and base-editing systems provided herein will be apparent to those of skill in the art based on the instant disclosure. Exemplary suitable diseases and disorders are listed below. It will be understood that the numbering of the specific positions or residues in the respective sequences depends on the particular protein and numbering scheme used. Numbering might be different, e.g., in precursors of a mature protein and the mature protein itself, and differences in sequences from species to species may affect numbering. One of skill in the art will be able to identify the respective residue in any homologous protein and in the respective encoding nucleic acid by methods well known in the art, e.g., by sequence alignment and determination of homologous residues.

Exemplary applications of the base-editing systems and methods of the present disclosure in plants may be to correct deleterious mutations, produce derivatives, modify sequences, insert sequences, and edit genomes of plants. These applications may be in coding sequences of plant genes or in non-coding sequences (e.g., regulatory sequences).</p><p id="p-0209" num="0198">The base-editing systems disclosed herein may be used to produce derivatives of coding sequences. These derivatives may result in increased levels of specific (e.g., preselected) amino acids in the encoded polypeptide. In some embodiments, these derivatives are of agriculturally important genes or the derivatives modify genes to increase their agricultural importance. For example, the gene encoding the barley high lysine polypeptide (BHL) is derived from barley chymotrypsin inhibitor (see, e.g., U.S. application Ser. No. 08/740,682 and WO 98/20133). Other exemplary target proteins include methionine-rich plant proteins such as from sunflower seed (Lilley et al., Proceedings of the World Congress on Vegetable Protein Utilization in Human Foods and Animal Feedstuffs, ed. Applewhite (American Oil Chemists Society, Champaign, Ill.) (1989) pp. 497-502), corn (Pedersen et al., J Biol Chem (1986) 261:6279; and Kirihara et al., Gene (1988) 71:359), and rice (Musumura et al., Plant Mol. Biol. (1989) 12:123). Other agronomically important genes include latex, Floury 2, growth factors, seed storage factors, and transcription factors.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0199">The base-editing systems disclosed herein can be used to modify herbicide resistance traits. Exemplary herbicide resistance traits include genes coding for resistance to herbicides that act to inhibit the action of acetolactate synthase (ALS), in particular the sulfonylurea-type herbicides (e.g., the acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene containing mutations leading to such resistance, in particular the S4 and/or Hra mutations), genes coding for resistance to herbicides that act to inhibit action of glutamine synthase, such as phosphinothricin or basta (e.g., the bar gene); glyphosate (e.g., the EPSPS gene and the GAT gene; see, e.g., U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 20040082770 and WO 03/092360); or other such genes known in the art. The bar gene encodes resistance to the herbicide basta, the nptII gene encodes resistance to the antibiotics kanamycin and geneticin, and the ALS-gene mutants encode resistance to the herbicide chlorsulfuron. Additional herbicide resistance traits are for example described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2016/0208243.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0200">Sterility genes can also be modified using base-editing systems of the present disclosure. Modified sterility genes provide an alternative to physical sterility modifications, e.g., physical detasseling in corn. Examples of genes used in such ways include male tissue-preferred genes and genes with male sterility phenotypes such as QM, described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,583,210. Other sterility genes include kinases and those encoding compounds toxic to either male or female gametophytic development. Additional sterility traits are described for example in U.S. Pat.

For example, the quality of grain can be altered by modifying genes encoding traits such as levels and types of oils, saturated and unsaturated, quality and quantity of essential amino acids, and levels of cellulose. In corn, modified hordothionin proteins are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,703,049, 5,885,801, 5,885,802, and 5,990,389. Commercial traits can also be altered using base-editing systems of the present disclosure by modifying a gene that could increase, for example, starch for ethanol production, or provide expression of proteins. An exemplary important commercial use of modified plants is the production of polymers and bioplastics such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,321. Genes such as &#x3b2;-Ketothiolase, PHBase (polyhydroxyburyrate synthase), and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (see Schubert et al., J Bacteriol (1988) 170:5837-5847) facilitate expression of polyhyroxyalkanoates (PHAs).</p><p id="p-0214" num="0203">In some embodiments, base-editing systems of the present disclosure can be used to alter exogenous products. Exogenous products include nucleic acids and proteins (e.g., enzymes or other protein-based products) that are not derived from the host organism species. Exogenous nucleic acids can be RNA, DNA, or RNA/DNA chimeras. Exogenous protein-based products can be from plants, prokaryotes, or other eukaryotes. Such protein products may include enzymes, cofactors, hormones, and the like. In some embodiments, the level of proteins, particularly modified proteins having improved amino acid distribution to improve the nutrient value of the plant, can be increased. In some embodiments, plants with improved nutrient value are achieved by the expression of such proteins having enhanced amino acid content.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0204">The base-editing systems disclosed herein can also be used for insertion of heterologous genes and/or modification of native plant gene expression to achieve desirable plant traits. Such traits include, for example, disease resistance, herbicide tolerance, drought tolerance, salt tolerance, insect resistance, resistance against parasitic weeds, improved plant nutritional value, improved forage digestibility, increased grain yield, cytoplasmic male sterility, altered fruit ripening, increased storage life of plants or plant parts, reduced allergen production, and increased or decreased lignin content.

In some embodiments, a linker joins a gRNA binding domain of an RNA-programmable nuclease, including a Cas nuclease domain (e.g., a Cas9 nuclease domain or a Cas12a nuclease domain), and the catalytic domain of a nucleic-acid editing protein. In some embodiments, a linker joins a dCas domain (e.g., a dCas9 domain or a dCas12a domain) and a nucleic-acid editing protein. Typically, the linker is positioned between, or flanked by, two groups, molecules, or other moieties and connected to each one via a covalent bond, thus connecting the two. In some embodiments, the linker is an amino acid or a plurality of amino acids (e.g., a peptide or protein). In some embodiments, the linker is an organic molecule, group, polymer, or chemical moiety. In some embodiments, the linker is in the range of 5-100 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, the linker is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 30-35, 35-40, 40-45, 45-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90-100, 100-150, or 150-200 amino acids in length.

The terms refer to a protein, peptide, or polypeptide of any size, structure, or function. Typically, a protein, peptide, or polypeptide will be at least three amino acids long. A protein, peptide, or polypeptide may refer to an individual protein or a collection of proteins. One or more of the amino acids in a protein, peptide, or polypeptide may be modified, for example, by the addition of a chemical entity such as a carbohydrate group, a hydroxyl group, a phosphate group, a farnesyl group, an isofarnesyl group, a fatty acid group, a linker for conjugation, functionalization, or other modification, etc. A protein, peptide, or polypeptide may also be a single molecule or may be a multi-molecular complex. A protein, peptide, or polypeptide may be just a portion of a naturally occurring protein or peptide. A protein, peptide, or polypeptide may be naturally occurring, recombinant, or synthetic, or any combination thereof. The term &#x201c;base-editing system&#x201d; as used herein refers to a hybrid molecule which includes protein domains from at least two different proteins, and non-protein domains that may or may not be chemically linked to the hybrid molecule. One protein may be located at the amino-terminal (N-terminal) portion of the base-editing system or at the carboxy-terminal (C-terminal) protein thus forming an &#x201c;amino-terminal base-editing system&#x201d; or a &#x201c;carboxy-terminal base-editing system,&#x201d; respectively. A base-editing system may include different domains, for example, a nucleic acid binding domain (e.g., the gRNA binding domain of Cas9 that directs the binding of the protein to a target site) and a nucleic acid cleavage domain or a catalytic domain of a nucleic-acid editing protein. In some embodiments, a base-editing system includes a proteinaceous part, e.g., an amino acid sequence constituting a nucleic acid binding domain, and an organic compound, e.g., a compound that can act as a nucleic acid cleavage agent. In some embodiments, a base-editing system is in a complex with, or is in association with, a nucleic acid, e.g., RNA. Any of the base-editing systems provided herein may be produced by any method known in the art. For example, the base-editing systems provided herein may be produced via recombinant expression and purification, which is especially suited for base-editing systems including a peptide linker.
