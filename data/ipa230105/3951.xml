Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of optical communication, and more particularly to an integrated optical assembly structure with an isolator, and a processing method therefor.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, with the increasing speed of data transmission, the traditional telecommunication is unable to meet the transmission needs in various fields. Optical communication technology makes up for the shortcomings of the traditional telecommunication technology, such as short transmission distance, large energy consumption, and slow transmission speed, so it is widely used in various data transmission. In an optical communication module, when light from a light source, such as a laser, passes through various optical components or optical fibers (or comes out from optical components or optical fibers), part of the light will be reflected or scattered at the end or inside of the various optical components or optical fibers. When the reflected or refracted light returns through the original path, it will interfere with the optical signal and affect the signal quality and stability of the optical communication. Therefore, the isolator in an optical module becomes an indispensable part of optical communication.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a conventional optical assembly comprises a front metal cover <b>1</b>, a ceramic sleeve <b>2</b>, a first pressing block <b>3</b>, a second pressing block <b>4</b>, a ceramic plug core <b>5</b>, an outer ring <b>6</b>, and an isolator chip <b>7</b>. The isolator <b>7</b> is a polarization-dependent free space isolator (FSI), and its structure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The isolator <b>7</b> is composed of a magnetic ring <b>71</b> and an isolator chip <b>72</b> installed in the magnetic ring <b>71</b>. The isolator chip <b>72</b> is composed of a Faraday rotator <b>722</b>, a polarizer <b>721</b> disposed on one side of the Faraday rotator <b>722</b> where light is incident, and an analyzer <b>723</b> disposed on the other side of the Faraday rotator <b>722</b>. When the Faraday rotator <b>722</b> is located in the magnetic field, the vibration plane of the incident light may be rotated by 45&#xb0;. Both the polarizer <b>721</b> and the analyzer <b>723</b> are polarizers to filter light outside the target direction, so as to unify the directions of the optical signals incident into the optical assembly to avoid interference. However, the installation of the magnetic ring <b>71</b> of the conventional optical assembly needs to cooperate with the second pressing block <b>4</b> through the outer ring <b>6</b>. The installation of the magnetic ring <b>71</b>, the cooperation between the isolator chip <b>72</b> and the magnetic ring <b>71</b>, and the installation between the second pressing block <b>4</b> and the outer ring <b>6</b> may cause errors. In order to ensure full coverage of the optical path by the isolator chip <b>72</b>, its area needs to be large enough to cover these installation errors. Therefore, the side length of the isolator chip <b>72</b> needs to be about 0.5 mm. (Due to the cutting process, the Faraday rotator is generally a square sheet). The Faraday rotator and polarizer are very expensive. How to reduce the area of the isolator chip to decrease the manufacturing cost of the optical assembly has become an extremely important issue.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, the mounting hole of the magnetic ring <b>71</b> for mounting the isolator chip <b>72</b> is a round hole, and the isolator chip <b>72</b> is cut to have a square shape. During the installation of the magnetic ring <b>71</b> and the isolator chip <b>72</b>, in order to keep the installation angle of the isolator chip <b>72</b>, several corrections are required, which reduces the assembly efficiency. The circular hole of the magnetic ring <b>71</b> may cause the isolator chip <b>72</b> to rotate, which increases the assembly difficulty and increases the production cost of the optical assembly greatly.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to further reduce the material usage of the optical assembly and reduce the production cost of the optical assembly, the inventor of the present invention has devoted himself based on his many years of practical experiences to solve these problems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One of the technical problems to be solved by the present invention is to provide a manufacturing apparatus for delaminating a bamboo into fiber.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">(1) Technical Problem to be Solved</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The primary object of the present invention is to provide an integrated optical assembly structure with an isolator and a processing method therefor, so as to improve the installation accuracy of the isolator chip and reduce the area of the isolator chip to decrease the production cost of the optical assembly.

That is, the connection surface of the positioning corners may be a single surface, multiple surfaces, a circular arc surface, or a multi-curved surface.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the chip accommodating hole <b>321</b> is disposed below the chip positioning hole <b>322</b>, having a square shape. The four corners of the square are defined as the positioning corners <b>321</b><i>a</i>. The size of the chip accommodating hole <b>321</b> is slightly greater than that of the isolator chip <b>50</b>, so that the installation angle of the isolator chip <b>50</b> is offset within &#xb1;8&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Error discussion in the first embodiment: comprehensive processing technology and cost. The side length of the chip accommodating hole <b>321</b> is 0.35 mm&#xb1;0.02 mm Assuming that the chip accommodating hole <b>321</b> is offset to one side by 0.02 mm under the condition of the limit error, 0.02 mm is the one-sided error when the isolator chip <b>50</b> is installed because the invention doesn't have the outer ring <b>6</b> and the magnetic ring <b>71</b> and uses the same pressing block <b>30</b> to simultaneously press the ceramic plug core <b>40</b> and accommodate the isolator chip <b>50</b> when compared with the prior art.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Error analysis of the prior art: The coaxiality error requirement of the outer ring <b>6</b> installed in the second pressing block <b>4</b> of the conventional optical assembly is &#x229a;0.06 mm. The coaxiality error requirement between the second pressing block <b>4</b> and the ceramic plug core <b>5</b> is &#x229a;0.02 mm. If the error of installing the isolator chip <b>72</b> in the magnetic ring <b>71</b> and the magnetic ring <b>71</b> in the outer ring <b>6</b> is added, the installation error of the isolator chip <b>72</b> may be 0.08 mm on one side.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Comparison of results: The error of the integrated optical assembly structure provided by the present invention is greatly reduced compared with the error of the conventional optical assembly at the laser incident end, so that the offset distance between the center of the isolator and the optical path is reduced, and the side length of the required isolator is reduced to 0.3 mm. Compared with the prior art, the area of the isolator chip is reduced greatly, which reduces the manufacturing cost of the isolator and the assembly difficulty of the optical assembly greatly.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the four positioning corners <b>321</b><i>a </i>of the chip accommodating hole <b>321</b> are connected through a circular arc surface, that is, the four positioning corners <b>321</b><i>a </i>are formed on the basis of a circular hole. The length of the straight side of the positioning corner <b>321</b><i>a </i>needs to ensure that the isolator chip <b>50</b> is still located among the four positioning corners <b>321</b><i>a </i>after being rotated by 8&#xb0;, without touching the circular arc surface. This structure is simple in processing and is easy in positioning, and can reduce the processing difficulty and processing cost of the chip accommodating hole <b>321</b> while ensuring that the installation angle of the isolator chip <b>50</b> is offset within &#xb1;8&#xb0;, further improving production efficiency and reducing the production cost of the optical assembly.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Since the pressing block of the present invention is extremely small in size, it is difficult to form the chip accommodating hole <b>321</b> and the plug core positioning hole <b>322</b> in the pressing block to meet the precision requirements. Besides, the output of the optical assembly is usually very large. The production time of a single part determines the production capacity of the optical assembly to a great degree. Therefore, the pressing block needs to be machined efficiently.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For this reason, the present invention further provides a processing method of an integrated optical assembly structure with an isolator, using a dual spindle CNC lathe, so as to solve the problems of low efficiency and low precision in the conventional processing method.

With the isolator chip having magnetism itself, that two-step assembly is changed to one-step assembly for installing the isolator chip, thereby improving the assembly accuracy, reducing the area of the isolator chip while ensuring full coverage of an optical path, and reducing the costs of materials greatly. Besides, in the invention, the chip accommodating hole for installing the isolator chip in the pressing block has the positioning corners, so that the positioning of the isolator chip is more accurate when the isolator chip is installed, so as to avoid the rotation of the isolator chip later on. There is no need to perform complex correction for the isolator chip. This reduces the assembly difficulty of the isolator chip greatly, reduces the assembly cost, and improves the production efficiency. The invention further provides a processing method of an integrated optical assembly structure with an isolator, using a double-spindle CNC lathe to cooperate with a broach. The entire pressing block is machined by one-time clamping, so the processing efficiency and precision of the optical assembly are improved.
