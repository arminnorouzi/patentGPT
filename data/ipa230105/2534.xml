id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0002">The present invention relates to an anionic polymerization initiator, an anionic polymerization initiator composition, and a production method therefor, and more specifically, relates to an anionic polymerization initiator for producing a polyolefin-polystyrene block copolymer, an anionic polymerization initiator composition, and a production method therefor.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0003">Currently, a market of hundreds of thousands of tons worldwide is formed for polyolefin-polystyrene block copolymers such as styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS) or styrene-ethylene/propylene-styrene (SEPS). Moreover, these block copolymers have the advantage that heat resistance and light resistance are excellent compared to styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) or styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS), and are used as a material for a soft and strong touch feeling of a grip and a handle, an elastic material of a diaper, an oil gel used in medical and communication materials, an impact modifier for an engineering plastic, a flexibilizer or toughener of transparent polypropylene, or the like. SEBS in the related art is produced through a two-step reaction in which SBS obtained by anionic polymerization of styrene and butadiene is subjected to a hydrogenation reaction. SEPS in the related art is also produced through a two-step reaction in which SIS obtained by anionic polymerization of styrene and isoprene is subjected to a hydrogenation reaction. As described above, the process of saturating all of double bonds included in a main chain of a polymer through a hydrogenation reaction has a high process cost, and thus the unit costs of SEBS and SEPS are significantly higher than those of SBS and SIS before the hydrogenation reaction. This may serve as a limit to market expansion. Furthermore, since it is virtually impossible to saturate all of double bonds in a chain of a polymer through a hydrogenation reaction, commercially available SEBS and SEPS include some residual double bonds, and the presence thereof often causes a problem (Journal of Polymer Science: Part A: Polymer Chemistry, 2002, 40, 1253; and Polymer Degradation and Stability, 2010, 95, 975).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0004">Accordingly, a technology for producing a polyolefin-polystyrene diblock copolymer from olefin or styrene monomers through a one-pot process has been developed (registered patent No. 1657925). According to the technology, coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) can uniformly grow a PO chain by adding an excessive amount of a chain transfer agent (CTA, for example, Et<sub>2</sub>Zn) using a transition metal-based catalyst capable of polymerizing either or both of ethylene and &#x3b1;-olefin, and can synthesize a polyolefin-polystyrene block copolymer by anionic polymerization of styrene. Here, as an initiator for the anionic polymerization of styrene, alkyl lithium and amine ligand are added.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0005">The inventors of the present invention have found that when an anionic initiator having a new structure is used as an initiator for the anionic polymerization of styrene, a PS chain can be more efficiently grown from a PO chain, and the growth range of the PS chain can be expanded, thereby completing the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0006">An object to be achieved in the present invention is to provide a novel anionic polymerization initiator.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">Another object to be achieved in the present invention is to provide a novel anionic polymerization initiator composition.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">Still another object to be achieved in the present invention is to provide a method for producing the novel anionic polymerization initiator.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0009">In order to achieve the above object, the present invention provides an anionic polymerization initiator represented by Formula 1 below:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="14.31mm" wi="52.32mm" file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0014" num="0010">in Formula 1,</p><p id="p-0015" num="0011">R<sub>1 </sub>is hydrogen or a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0012">A is represented by Formula 2 below,</p><p id="p-0017" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="19.39mm" wi="60.62mm" file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0018" num="0013">in Formula 2,</p><p id="p-0019" num="0014">R<sub>2 </sub>to R<sub>6 </sub>are each independently a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0015">a and b are each independently an integer of 0 to 3, and a and b are not 0 at the same time.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0016">Moreover, in order to achieve the above another object, the present invention provides an anionic polymerization initiator composition containing a compound represented by Formula 2 below and a compound represented by Formula 5 below.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-C00004" he="81.11mm" wi="60.62mm" file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0023" num="0017">In Formula 2,</p><p id="p-0024" num="0018">R<sub>2 </sub>to R<sub>6 </sub>are each independently a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and</p><p id="p-0025" num="0019">a and b are each independently an integer of 0 to 3, and a and b are not 0 at the same time;

The increase in the Mn value after the styrene polymerization was substantial and reasonable (&#x394;Mn of 22, 37, 11, and 20 kDa, respectively). By supplying twice the amount of styrene monomers under the same conditions, the &#x394;M value could be almost doubled from 22 kDa to 33 kDa and from 11 kDa to 20 kDa. By supplying twice the amount of the Zn compound through the CCTcoP polymerization under the same conditions, and accordingly supplying twice the amount of the lithium compound, the &#x394;M value could be reduced by almost half from 22 kDa to 11 kDa and from 37 kDa to 20 kDa. Moreover, the molecular weight distributions after the styrene polymerization were narrowed from the Mw/Mn values of 1.61, 1.61, 1.50, and 1.54, to the Mw/Mn values of 1.39, 1.30, 1.35, and 1.26, respectively (&#x394;PDI of 0.22, 0.31, 0.15, and 0.28).</p><p id="p-0215" num="0192">Homo-PS could be separated from the block copolymer by extraction with an acetone/chloroform mixed solvent. The extracted homo-PS was about &#x2153; (27% to 29%) of the total amount of the consumed styrene, and this made it possible to hypothesize that the PS chains were grown from polyolefinyl and pentylallyl groups in [(polyolefinyl)<sub>2</sub>(pentylallyl)Zn]<sup>&#x2212;</sup>[Li&#xb7;(PMDTA)]<sup>+</sup>, which is a zincate compound formed by the action of pentylallyl-Li&#xb7;(PMDTA) on (polyolefinyl)<sub>2</sub>Zn.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0193">The growth of the PS chain from the polyolefinyl group results in the generation of a desired poly(ethylene-co-propylene)-block-PS, while the growth of the PS chain from pentylallyl results in the generation of the homo-PS in an amount of &#x2153; of the total amount of the consumed styrene. However, the number of the PS chain-growing sites calculated by dividing the total weight of the consumed styrene by the measured Mn value of the homo-PS was not agreed with the value of &#x201c;3&#xd7;Zn (&#x3bc;mol)&#x201d;, contrary to the hypothesis. Meanwhile, the number of the PS chain-growing sites was close to the value of &#x201c;2&#xd7;Zn (&#x3bc;mol)&#x201d; (in the cases of Polymerization Examples A and B, 310 and 360 &#x3bc;mol vs. 2&#xd7;150=300 &#x3bc;mol; and in the case of Polymerization Example D, 630 &#x3bc;mol vs. 2&#xd7;300=600 &#x3bc;mol).</p><p id="p-0217" num="0194">Therefore, the present inventors hypothesized that the PS chains were grown mainly from polyolefinyl groups in [(polyolefinyl)<sub>2</sub>(pentylallyl)Zn]<sup>&#x2212;</sup>[Li&#xb7;(PMDTA)]<sup>+</sup>, which is the formed zincate, as shown in Reaction Formula 4 below.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00019" num="00019"><img id="EMI-C00019" he="71.63mm" wi="75.86mm" file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00019.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0219" num="0195">It is thought that the extracted homo-PS was attributed to the PS chains grown from the 1-hexyl group, which may remain intact during CCTP, or from the polyolefin group generated in CCTP. When the supplied amount of the Zn compound was large (300 &#x3bc;mol) and the supplied amount of the styrene monomers is too small (5.0 g) (Polymerization Example C), the number of the PS chain-growing sites did not exceed the value of &#x201c;2&#xd7;Zn&#x201d;, indicating that the PS chains were not grown from all the polyolefinyl-Zn groups (450 &#x3bc;mol vs. 2&#xd7;300=600 &#x3bc;mol). The molecular weight distribution of the extracted homo-PS was significantly narrow (Mw/Mn of 1.23 to 1.25), and thus it could be confirmed that the anionic styrene polymerization was well controlled.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0196">In the case of PhLi&#xb7;(PMDTA), as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the increases in the Mn values after the styrene polymerization were significant (&#x394;Mn of 12, 38, 10, and 21 kDa, Comparative Polymerization Examples D to G), and the molecular weight distributions Mw/Mn after the styrene polymerization were significantly narrowed from 1.65, 1.63, 1.58, and 1.64, to 1.49, 1.29, 1.41, and 1.34, respectively. However, the amount of the extracted homo-PS was larger (30% to 34% vs. 27% to 29%) than that of pentylallyl-Li&#xb7;(PMDTA), which is an initiator example, and the molecular weight distribution of the extracted homo-PS was wider than that in the case of using pentylallyl-Li&#xb7;(PMDTA).</p><p id="p-0221" num="0197">From the results, it could be confirmed that pentylallyl-Li&#xb7;(PMDTA), which is an initiator example, exhibits a superior effect to PhLi&#xb7;(PMDTA), which is a comparative initiator, in growing the PS chains from (polyolefinyl)<sub>2</sub>Zn.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0198">Meanwhile, it could be considered that in the PS polymerization from (1-hexyl)<sub>2</sub>Zn, no significant effect difference between pentylallyl-Li&#xb7;(PMDTA), which is an initiator example, and n-BuLi&#xb7;(PMDTA) and Me<sub>3</sub>SiCH<sub>2</sub>Li&#xb7;(PMDTA), which are comparative initiators, was observed (see Table 2), but in the results of the PS polymerization performed with (polyolefinyl)<sub>2</sub>Zn in which the block copolymer is actually produced, it could be confirmed that pentylallyl-Li&#xb7;(PMDTA), which is an initiator example, exhibits a superior effect. Specifically, in the case of Comparative Polymerization Example H in which n-BuLi&#xb7;(PMDTA) was used, a significant amount of homo-PS was generated (45%), and in the case of Comparative Polymerization Example I in which Me<sub>3</sub>SiCH<sub>2</sub>Li&#xb7;(PMDTA) was used, the increase in the Mn value after the styrene polymerization was smaller compared to the cases of Polymerization Examples in which the initiator examples were used.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00005" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00005.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00005.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00006" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00006.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00006.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00007" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00007.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00007.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00008" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00008.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00008.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00009" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00009.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00009.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00010" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00010.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00010.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00011" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00011.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00011.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00012" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00012.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00012.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00013" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00013.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00013.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00014" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00014.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00014.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00015" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00015.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00015.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00016" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00016.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00016.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00017" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00017.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00017.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00018" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00018.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00018.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00019" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00019.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00019.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00020" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00020.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00020.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00021" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00021.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00021.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00022" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00022.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00022.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00023" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00023.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00023.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00024" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00024.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00024.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00025" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00025.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00025.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00026" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00026.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00026.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00027" cdx-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00027.CDX" mol-file="US20230002535A1-20230105-C00027.MOL"/><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
