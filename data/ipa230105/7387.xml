Therefore, the loop-shaped ribs <b>22</b>, for example, may be formed to surround spaces of substantially square shapes or substantially right triangular shapes when viewed from the back. Alternatively, the loop-shaped ribs <b>22</b> may be formed so as to surround the spaces of shapes, different from L-shapes, obtained by partially removing single edge parts of rectangles when seen from the back.

In addition, in the present embodiment, the fourth cushion members <b>55</b> are not adhered to the back surfaces of the cover members <b>40</b>. Specifically, the surfaces of the fourth cushion members <b>55</b> at the circuit board <b>60</b> sides have double-sided tapes having adhesive forces at their both surfaces or have an adhesive coated on them. The surfaces of the fourth cushion members <b>55</b> at the cover member <b>40</b> sides are not provided with double-sided tapes or adhesives. Alternatively, the fourth cushion members <b>55</b> themselves may be formed as tapes having adhesive forces at single surfaces.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In the present embodiment, the fourth cushion members <b>55</b> are formed into flat plate shapes. The fourth cushion members <b>55</b> have thicknesses substantially the same as the clearances formed between the back surfaces of the cover member <b>40</b> and the front surface of the circuit board <b>60</b>, when the cover members <b>40</b> and the circuit board <b>60</b> are attached to the housing <b>2</b>. Therefore, the fourth cushion members <b>55</b> are configured so as to contact the cover members <b>40</b> and the circuit board <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Further, the fourth cushion members <b>55</b>, as shown by the broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, are arranged so as to be positioned near the third edge parts <b>41</b><i>c </i>of the cover members <b>40</b> when the cover members <b>40</b> and the circuit board <b>60</b> are attached to the front wall member <b>6</b>. Therefore, the fourth cushion members <b>55</b> are arranged so as to contact the cover members <b>40</b> at regions closer to the third edge parts <b>41</b><i>c </i>not fastened to the front wall member <b>6</b> than the first edge part <b>41</b><i>a </i>and the second edge part <b>41</b><i>b </i>fastened to the front wall member <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In this regard, the cover members <b>40</b> are fastened to the front wall member <b>6</b> near the first edge parts <b>41</b><i>a </i>and near the second edge parts <b>41</b><i>b</i>. The front wall member <b>6</b> is formed by a metal material and the cover members <b>40</b> are formed by a relatively hard plastic, therefore these are resistant to deformation, but even so there is a possibility of the cover members <b>40</b> or the front wall member <b>6</b> deforming and resulting in the state where the cover members <b>40</b> rise away from the front wall member <b>6</b> in regions near the third edge parts <b>41</b><i>c </i>where the cover members <b>40</b> are not fastened to the front wall member <b>6</b>. If resulting in a state where the cover members <b>40</b> rise up in this way, the sealability between the cover members <b>40</b> and the front wall member <b>6</b>, in particular between the cover members <b>40</b> and the loop-shaped ribs <b>22</b>, is liable to fall. If the cover members <b>40</b> and loop-shaped ribs <b>22</b> are no longer sealed, sound is liable to leak out from the clearances formed between the cover members <b>40</b> and the loop-shaped ribs <b>22</b> and accordingly the acoustic performance of the electronic device <b>1</b> is liable to fall.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In the present embodiment, fourth cushion members <b>55</b> are provided near the third edge parts <b>41</b><i>c </i>between the cover members <b>40</b> and the circuit board <b>60</b> so as to contact the same, and the circuit board <b>60</b> is fastened to the housing <b>2</b>. Therefore, even if the cover members <b>40</b> or the front wall member <b>6</b> tries to deform so that the cover members <b>40</b> rise up in the regions near the third edge parts <b>41</b><i>c</i>, the cover members <b>40</b> are kept from rising up due to the fourth cushion members <b>55</b>. Therefore, the acoustic performance of the electronic device <b>1</b> is kept from falling due to deformation of the cover members <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In particular, in the present embodiment, to facilitate the work of replacement of a speaker <b>30</b>, etc., the front wall member <b>6</b> and the cover members <b>40</b> are not attached by for example welding, etc., so as to be unable to be detached from each other, but are detachably adhered from each other. However, in the present embodiment, third cushion members <b>37</b> are provided between the front wall member <b>6</b> and the cover members <b>40</b> so as to form a tight seal between the front wall member <b>6</b> and the cover members <b>40</b>. Accordingly, leakage of sound from between the front wall member <b>6</b> and the cover members <b>40</b> is suppressed. In addition, as explained above, the state where the cover members <b>40</b> rise up along with deformation of the front wall member <b>6</b> and cover members <b>40</b> is kept from occurring by the fourth cushion members <b>55</b>. Therefore, according to the present embodiment, it is possible to secure work efficiency in replacement of a speaker <b>30</b>, etc., while maintaining the sealability of the front wall member <b>6</b> and cover members <b>40</b>, and accordingly possible to maintain the acoustic performance of the electronic device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Note that, the fourth cushion members <b>55</b> may have any thickness so long as able to contact the cover members <b>40</b> and the circuit board <b>60</b>. Therefore, the fourth cushion members <b>55</b> may have thicknesses greater than the clearances formed between the back surfaces of the cover members <b>40</b> and the front surface of the circuit board <b>60</b>, when the cover members <b>40</b> and the circuit board <b>60</b> are attached to the housing <b>2</b>.

However, the fourth cushion members <b>55</b> need not be provided at the first edge parts <b>41</b><i>a </i>and the second edge parts <b>41</b><i>b</i>. This is because there is a low possibility of the cover members <b>40</b> rising up at the first edge parts <b>41</b><i>a </i>and the second edge parts <b>41</b><i>b </i>fastened to the front wall member <b>6</b>. That is, the fourth cushion members <b>55</b> need not be arranged at the location where the cover members <b>40</b> are fastened to the front wall member <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Furthermore, a plurality of the fourth cushion members <b>55</b> may be provided between the cover members <b>40</b> and the circuit board <b>60</b>.

As explained above, the back wall member <b>7</b> is provided with the opening <b>72</b> so as to allow access to the slot <b>61</b>, but by providing the back wall ribs <b>71</b>, it becomes harder for air flowing into the surroundings of the slot <b>61</b> through the opening <b>72</b> to flow into the housing <b>2</b> any further, and accordingly dust or the like are kept from entering into the housing <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">Further, the back wall ribs <b>71</b> arranged at the back wall member <b>7</b> so as to face the circuit board <b>60</b> below the locations where the circuit board <b>60</b> is fastened to the front wall member <b>6</b> (that is, locations corresponding to the second screw holes <b>29</b>).
