A web browser, which operates on a user terminal <b>2</b>, executes a web application provided by a server <b>1</b>. The web application implements a chatbot that answers a user's question.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">(1) For example, a user who wants a catalog, a user who wants to know specifications of a product, or a user who does not know how to use a purchased product inputs a question to the user terminal <b>2</b> on which the web application is running.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">(2) The server <b>1</b> extracts one or more keywords from the question and interprets content of the question. The server <b>1</b> may be an artificial intelligence (AI) that has learned correspondence between a question and an answer.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">(3) The server <b>1</b> acquires an answer corresponding to the question from a question and answer information storage unit <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">(4) The server <b>1</b> transmits the answer to the user terminal <b>2</b> (an example of a first terminal) based on a dialog scenario, a number of answers including presence or absence of the answer, and the like.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">(5) The server <b>1</b> stores a log of inquiries, called inquiry history, such as the correspondence between questions and answers, in a chat history information storage unit <b>45</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">(6) On the other hand, when the server <b>1</b> did not find the answer (including a case where the user did not find an expected answer), the user inputs a request for manned support to the user terminal <b>2</b>. Content of past chat is transferred to an operator who can handle a particular category of questions in the chat.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this way, the chatbot system <b>100</b> automatically determines the operator corresponding to the category of questions the user is asking and transfers the chat.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">(7) Since the operator inputs the answer to the question into an operator terminal <b>5</b> by based on his or her own knowledge and researched content, the user terminal <b>2</b> can easily receive the answer expected by the user.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">(8) The administrator can edit the question and answer information in order to enhance the answer to the question by operating the administrator terminal <b>3</b> (an example of a second terminal). The category of the question and answer information for which an editing authority is assigned is set in advance for each administrator, and the administrator can edit the question and answer information belonging to the category for which the editing authority is assigned.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Since the category of question and answer information for which editing authority is assigned is fixed for each administrator, each administrator is not permitted to edit the question and answer information managed by departments other than his or her own department, and accidental editing of the question and answer information managed by other department is prevented.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this disclosure, conversation is a process of talking and listening to each other and proceeding a common story. The conversation may proceed with alternating questions and answers. A question is to ask a question or reason, or to provide information for that purpose. An answer is a reply to the question. Content of the conversation is not limited to the questions and answers.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A chat is a conversation, where multiple people enter characters in real time (either by using the keyboard or by voice). Conversations and chats do not have to be strictly distinguished.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A bot is an application or program for automating certain tasks or processes. In the present embodiment, the chatbot may be referred to as a bot.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A person who can edit the question and answer information is referred to as the administrator. As long as a person has editing authority, the person is referred to as the administrator. The editing authority may not be assigned for each administrator. The department to which the administrator belongs may be assigned with the editing authority for each category. For example, an administrator belonging to a personnel department has the editing authority of a personnel category.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of an overall configuration of the chatbot system <b>100</b>. The chatbot system <b>100</b> includes a server <b>1</b>. The server <b>1</b> may communicate with one or more of the user terminal <b>2</b>, the administrator terminal <b>3</b>, and an operator terminal through a network.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The server <b>1</b> is an example of an information processing apparatus that provides a chatbot service.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The server is a computer operating according to software, which functions to provide information and processing results in response to a request from a client. The server <b>1</b> may reside on the internet or may reside on-premises. In the present embodiment, the server <b>1</b> resides on-premises and includes a mechanism for transmitting a chat request from outside the company to the server <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, the server <b>1</b> may be implemented by cloud computing. Cloud is a term used when a particular hardware resource is not intended.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The server <b>1</b> may be implemented by one information processing apparatus or a plurality of information processing apparatuses. Hereinafter, an example in which one server <b>1</b> provides a service is described.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The user terminal <b>2</b> is an information processing apparatus in which a user inputs a question and browses an answer in the chatbot service. The user may be an employee or an outsider. A web browser or an application (referred to as a native application as opposed to the web application) is operating on the user terminal <b>2</b>.
