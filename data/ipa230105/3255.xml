The wheel bearing device includes an outer member fixed to a vehicle body. Further, at an inner side of the outer member, an inner member is disposed. The outer member and the inner member each have a raceway face. Between the raceway faces, a plurality of rolling elements are interposed. With this configuration, the wheel bearing device forms a rolling bearing structure, and rotatably supports the wheel that is attached to the inner member.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent Literature 1 discloses a wheel bearing device that includes an inner member including a spline hole, and a universal joint including a spline shaft; and the spline shaft is fitted into the spline hole. In the wheel bearing device, the spline hole has, on its surface, an uneven shape that is formed parallel to an axial direction. Thus, when an uneven shape of the spline shaft is circumferentially twisted, a twisting load is applied to the uneven shape of each of the spline hole and the spline shaft. As a result, circumferential looseness is reduced. With such a fitted structure, the spline shaft needs to have, at its tip, a bolt or the like attached. When the spline shaft is inserted into the spline hole, the bolt or the like attached needs to be turned to further pull the spline shaft into the spline hole.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the other hand, Patent Literature 2 discloses a wheel bearing device including a spline shaft, a tip of which has no bolt or the like attached, and the spline shaft is thus not pulled into the spline hole. With the wheel bearing device in this state, the spline shaft, too, needs to have its uneven shape formed parallel to an axial direction, and a certain degree of circumferential looseness needs to be allowed. With such a fitted structure, heat treatment is provided to each of the spline hole and the spline shaft. As a result, the uneven shape of the corresponding spline hole and the corresponding spline shaft are less prone to be worn or damaged.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the heat treatment is provided to the spline hole, the uneven shape of the spline hole is deformed, degrading initial machining accuracy. Thus, a countermeasure considered is to run a broach through the spline hole again after the heat treatment, and the uneven shape of the spline hole is finished at high accuracy. However, matching a phase of the broach to the uneven shape of the spline hole is difficult; and in an unmatched state, running the broach through the spline hole may hinder the spline hole from securing an appropriate cutting allowance and being finished at high accuracy. Further, a broached surface may be roughened, and the broach may be overloaded and reduced in service life.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATIONS LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Literature 1: JP-A 2017-47716 Gazette</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Literature 2: JP-A 2011-240755 Gazette</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problems</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a technique to easily match the phase of the broach to the uneven shape of the spline hole, and to finish the uneven shape of the spline hole at high accuracy by securing the appropriate cutting allowance.

In the wheel bearing device, a phase of the finishing broach is easily matched to an uneven shape of the spline hole.

The plurality of recesses are a part of recesses that form the uneven shape. In the wheel bearing device, when the spline hole is formed by running a forming broach, the guide groove is concurrently formed. This configuration simplifies a step of manufacturing the wheel bearing device.

With this configuration, as the guide plate goes into the guide groove, a gap between the cross-sectional face of the guide plate and the side face of the guide groove is gradually reduced. In the wheel bearing device, the guide plate goes into the guide groove in accordance with an inclination of the cross-sectional face, and the phase of the finishing broach is thereby tuned.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a method for manufacturing a wheel bearing device according to the fifth aspect of the present invention, a finishing step is included. The finishing step is a step of, after providing a heat treatment to a spline hole, running a finishing broach through the spline hole. In the method for manufacturing the wheel bearing device, it is possible to finish an uneven shape of the spline hole at high accuracy.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a method for manufacturing the wheel bearing device according to the sixth aspect of the present invention, the finishing step includes a step of fitting a guide plate of the finishing broach into a guide groove that is formed on an inner circumference of the spline hole.

This configuration simplifies a step of manufacturing the wheel bearing device. As a result, it is possible to suppress an increase of cost.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0085">In the wheel bearing device <b>1</b> according to this application, a phase matching portion <b>3</b>S is formed in a shape where an inner-side opening end of the guide groove <b>3</b>G spreads radially outward. In the wheel bearing device <b>1</b>, an operator grasps a position of the guide groove <b>3</b>G at a glance, and thus a step of fitting the guide plate <b>8</b>G of the finishing broach <b>8</b> into the guide groove <b>3</b>G is easily performed.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0086">Further, in the wheel bearing device <b>1</b> according to this application, the guide plate <b>8</b>G has a cross-sectional face <b>8</b><i>s </i>formed to be inclined toward a side face <b>3</b><i>s </i>of the guide groove <b>3</b>G. With this configuration, as the guide plate <b>8</b>G goes into the guide groove <b>3</b>G, a gap between the cross-sectional face <b>8</b><i>s </i>of the guide plate <b>8</b>G and the side face <b>3</b><i>s </i>of the guide groove <b>3</b>G is gradually reduced. In the wheel bearing device <b>1</b>, the guide plate <b>8</b>G goes into the guide groove <b>3</b>G in accordance with an inclination of the cross-sectional face, and the phase of the finishing broach <b>8</b> is thereby tuned.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0087">Additionally, in a method for manufacturing the wheel bearing device <b>1</b> according to this application, a finishing step includes a step of fitting the guide plate <b>8</b>G of the finishing broach <b>8</b> into the guide groove <b>3</b>G that is formed on the inner circumference of the spline hole <b>3</b><i>b</i>. In the method for manufacturing the wheel bearing device <b>1</b>, the phase of the finishing broach <b>8</b> is easily matched to the uneven shape of the spline hole <b>3</b><i>b</i>. Additionally, it is possible to finish the uneven shape of the spline hole <b>3</b><i>b </i>at high accuracy by securing an appropriate cutting allowance T. Further, it is possible to protect a broached surface of the spline hole <b>3</b><i>b </i>from being roughened, and to prevent the finishing broach <b>8</b> from being overloaded and reduced in service life.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0088">The wheel bearing device <b>1</b> according to this application has a typically called third generation structure formed of an outer member <b>2</b> and an inner member <b>3</b>, the outer member <b>2</b> including a knuckle flange <b>2</b><i>e </i>and the inner member <b>3</b> including a hub race <b>31</b> and an inner race <b>32</b> fitted to the hub race <b>31</b>; however, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, the wheel bearing device <b>1</b> may have a second generation structure formed of an outer member and an inner member, the outer member including a knuckle flange and the inner member formed of a pair of inner races; and the inner member is fitted to an outer circumference of a hub race. Alternatively, the wheel bearing device <b>1</b> may have a fourth generation structure formed of an outer member and an inner member, the outer member including a knuckle flange and the inner member as an assembly where a hub race and a universal joint are fitted to each other.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0089">Lastly, it is to be understood that the foregoing embodiments are merely illustrative, and not restrictive, of the invention according to this application; therefore, various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.
