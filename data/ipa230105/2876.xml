Invention</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Flat steel products are understood here as rolled products of which the length and width are each significantly greater than their thickness. Thus, when a flat steel product or a &#x201c;sheet metal product&#x201d; is mentioned below, this means rolled products such as steel strips or sheets, from which blanks or sheet metal blanks are separated for the production of bodywork components, for example.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">&#x201c;Shaped sheet metal parts&#x201d; or &#x201c;sheet metal components&#x201d; are made from such flat steel or sheet metal products, with the terms &#x201c;shaped sheet metal part&#x201d; and &#x201c;sheet metal component&#x201d; being used synonymously herein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The terms &#x201c;phosphating layer,&#x201d; &#x201c;phosphate layer,&#x201d; &#x201c;phosphate crystal layer&#x201d; and &#x201c;phosphate coating&#x201d; are also to be understood synonymously in the following.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As used herein, the term &#x201c;phosphorus crystal&#x201d; refers to all crystals formed from compounds containing phosphorus. These include, in particular, the zinc phosphate crystals which form during phosphating of a Zn coating.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">&#x201c;Protective zinc-based metal layer,&#x201d; &#x201c;Zn coating&#x201d; or &#x201c;Zn protective layer&#x201d; are used here to refer to all protective layers which are made of pure zinc in the technical sense or of a Zn alloy, in particular a Zn&#x2014;Al alloy, a Zn&#x2014;Mg alloy or a Zn&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;Al alloy.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Protective zinc-based metal layers are applied to the steel substrate of each flat steel product as protection against corrosion.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The production of a phosphate layer on a flat steel product provided with a so-called &#x201c;ZM coating&#x201d; is of particular importance for the application of the method according to the invention explained herein.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As explained in detail in the brochure &#x201c;ZINC-MAGNESIUM-ALUMINIUM COATINGS FOR AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,&#x201d; First Edition 2013, published by the Steel Institute VDEh, D&#xfc;sseldorf, and available for download at the URL https://www.stahl-online.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ZM-Coatings-for-Automotive-Industry.pdf, metal Zn&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;Al coatings, with which flat steel products of the type in question here are coated, typically contain in total up to 8 wt. % Mg and Al. Different phases such as Zn, MgZn2, Al-rich Zn, which each contribute to the protective effect of the protective coating, are present in such a protective layer, which is also referred to as a &#x201c;ZM protective coating&#x201d; or &#x201c;ZM coating&#x201d; in technical jargon and in the present text. The Al content typically varies from 0.3-5 wt. %, while the Mg content is typically 0.3-3 wt. %.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The optimized protective effect achieved through the special distribution of phases containing Zn, Mg and Al in the protective layer allows for minimized layer thicknesses while at the same time maximizing protection against corrosion. This not only contributes to improving the forming behavior, but also to conserving the resources required to produce corrosion protection. This opens up a multitude of applications for flat steel products provided with ZM coatings, for example in the field of producing vehicle bodywork and comparable applications in which ZM-coated metal sheets used as the starting product are formed into the relevant component at high degrees of forming.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A phosphating layer produced on Zn-coated flat steel products contributes to the protection against corrosion and improves the adhesion of a coat of paint which is applied to the flat steel product provided with the phosphating layer or to the component formed from such a flat steel product.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, in the case of flat steel products which are provided with a Zn coating produced by electrolytic deposition, the phosphating layer applied to the Zn coating is also used as a forming aid when forming the flat steel product into shaped sheet metal parts, such as those required for producing automobile bodywork. Here, phosphating ensures improved formability, since flat steel products which have phosphating on their protective metal layer leave behind less abrasion in the forming tool and exhibit improved sliding behavior.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The general procedure for phosphating steel products coated with an alloy layer is described, for example, in EP 0 454 211 B1, in the specialist book by Judith Pietschmann &#x201c;Industrial Powder Coating&#x2014;Basics&#x2014;Methods&#x2014;Practical Use,&#x201d; 4th Ed., Wiesbaden, Springer Vieweg, 2013, and in DE 37 34 596 A1. The methods explained therein provide for the sequence of work steps &#x201c;cleaning the surface of the steel product of production residues and oxides or the like using an alkaline or acidic cleaner,&#x201d; &#x201c;rinsing the cleaned surface of the steel product&#x201d; and &#x201c;activating the rinsed surface of the steel product.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">During phosphating, the zinc from the protective metal layer is converted to zinc phosphate in a redox reaction with the formation of hydrogen gas, with the zinc phosphate forming directly on the surface of the coating of the flat steel product and thus being joined to said surface in a particularly stable manner.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Conventionally, phosphating layers are produced in a two-stage process. In the first step of this process, the surface is activated by applying so-called activation particles to the flat steel product by means of contact with a suitable dispersion. The activation particles are intended to be used as crystallization nuclei for the zinc phosphate crystals produced in the following work step and lead to smaller and more densely packed crystals.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">So that zinc phosphate crystals can separate and grow, in the second step of conventional phosphating, a phosphating solution (consisting of, inter alia, phosphoric acid, water and zinc), which is close to solution equilibrium, is brought into contact with the surface of the protective coating on the relevant flat steel product. When the phosphoric acid solution comes into contact with the zinc surface, zinc dissolves from the surface of a Zn-coated flat steel product. As a result, the solubility of zinc phosphate in the phosphating solution is exceeded directly on the surface of the protective Zn coating and zinc phosphate crystals form. The resulting zinc phosphate crystals are homogeneously distributed over the surface of the protective zinc coating and follow the roughness of the steel substrate of the flat steel product.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">So far, in practice, it has only been possible to electrolytically phosphate surfaces provided with the Zn coating in a continuous process. Surfaces of flat steel products provided with the Zn coating by hot-dip coating (&#x201c;hot-dip galvanizing&#x201d;), however, could previously only be phosphated after they had been formed into sheet metal components. For example, when producing automobile bodywork, it has previously been customary for the hot-dip galvanized metal sheets to be delivered in the unphosphated state from the producer of the flat steel product to the producer of the automobile bodywork who forms the flat steel products into components and then provides the components obtained with the phosphating layer in a dipping process. This requires significantly longer process times than are possible during continuous phosphating of strip material. In addition, with this procedure, the phosphating layer is not available as a forming aid when forming the relevant sheet metal component.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the case of ZM coatings applied by hot-dip galvanizing, the reason why nowadays only electrolytically Zn-coated flat steel products are phosphated in a continuous process as strip material is that the aluminum and/or magnesium oxide layers are significantly more resistant to attack by the phosphating solution than a Zn coating produced by electrolytic galvanizing. Zinc oxide, which forms on the surface of a protective Zn layer produced by electrolytic galvanizing, is dissolved very quickly by the phosphating solution. As a result, the conversion process, in which metal zinc is dissolved from the surface and, together with phosphate from the phosphating solution, precipitates as zinc phosphate and begins to grow on the zinc surface, can start very quickly.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In contrast, in the case of a protective Zn layer applied by hot-dip coating and containing Mg and/or Al, the addition of a fluoride-containing component is necessary for dissolving the aluminum or magnesium oxides present on the surface of the protective layer. However, the process of dissolving the Al or Mg oxides takes several seconds, and therefore the conversion process which is crucial for the formation of the phosphating layer can only start comparatively late. Thus, in order to dissolve the Al and/or Mg oxide layer, it is typically necessary to expose the relevant flat steel product to the phosphating solution for a wetting period of more than 10 s. Such long wetting times cannot be achieved with conventional phosphating processes which are carried out continuously. Therefore, when processing hot-dip galvanized flat steel products, it has previously only been economically possible in industrial practice to form sheet metal components from non-phosphated flat steel products and then to phosphate the components obtained piece-by-piece using a dipping method.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">EP 2 824 213 A1 discloses a method for improving the adhesion of a steel sheet provided with a protective Zn&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;Al-based coating, in which method a protective Zn&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;Al-based coating is applied in a continuous process and then the oxide layer comprising Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and MgO is modified without pickling it.

Such Zn&#x2014;Al, Zn&#x2014;Mg or Zn&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;Al coatings can be produced particularly economically by hot dip coating on the steel substrate of the relevant flat steel product and have Al and/or Mg oxides on their surface, due to which, for the reasons explained above, flat steel products coated with such Zn alloy layers as a protective metal layer cannot be phosphated economically using conventional methods.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Work step b), in which the flat steel product provided in work step a) of the method according to the invention and provided with the Zn coating is treated with an acidic solution before the actual phosphating step (step e)), is crucial for the procedure according to the invention when phosphating a flat steel product. This ensures that the native oxide layer present on the free surface of the protective Zn layer of the provided flat steel product is removed. The aim is the complete removal of the oxide layer in the technical sense.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The pretreatment with the acidic solution provided according to the invention allows the zinc oxide components on the surface of the Zn coating to dissolve. Said pretreatment with an acidic solution also makes it possible to effectively remove the aluminum oxide and magnesium oxide components on the surface of the protective metal layer. After work step b) of the method according to the invention, the amounts of metal oxide components on the surface of the Zn coating of the flat steel product are at most so small that the conversion process required to form the phosphating layer can be started immediately during the subsequent phosphating (step e)). The phosphating solution applied in phosphating step e) comes into direct contact with the non-oxidized zinc on the surface of the protective metal layer so that the chemical conversion processes for forming the phosphate crystals forming the phosphating layer can start directly.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The pretreatment with the acidic solution provided according to the invention thus produces a status of the flat steel product to be covered with the phosphating layer according to the invention, which is otherwise only obtained when flat steel products of which the Zn coating has been deposited on the steel substrate of the flat steel product by electrolytic deposition are processed.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this way, the method according to the invention makes it possible, in the phosphating step (step e) of the method according to the invention, to produce a dense phosphate layer within the time periods typical of continuously run phosphating processes.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The procedure according to the invention therefore even makes it possible to phosphate the flat steel products which have been provided with a Zn coating, in particular a Zn&#x2014;Al, a Zn&#x2014;Mg or a Zn&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;Al coating, by means of hot-dip galvanizing economically and in a continuous process before they are deformed into sheet metal parts.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The short treatment times made possible by the invention in the phosphating step (work step e) of the method according to the invention) allow flat steel products, which are provided with a protective Zn-based metal layer and a phosphating layer thereon and in which the phosphate crystals of the phosphating layer are particularly small and densely distributed, to be produced.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">A flat steel product according to the invention having a protective zinc-based metal layer and a phosphating layer produced on a surface of the protective metal layer is characterized in that its phosphating layer consists of phosphate crystals having an average crystal diameter of from 0.5-5 &#x3bc;m. In this case, flat steel products according to the invention can be produced in particular using a method according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Their small size makes the phosphate crystals mechanically more stable with regard to their connection to the protective Zn layer. In addition, the phosphate crystals of the phosphating layer created or produced according to the invention have a larger total surface area than the coarser crystal structures which result from conventional batch phosphating of components. As a result, flat steel products provided with a phosphating layer according to the invention have better adhesion for painting or gluing components formed from the flat steel products according to the invention than conventionally phosphated components. At the same time, the small phosphate crystals of a phosphating layer produced on a flat steel product according to the invention bring about a homogenization of the surface of the flat steel product and, associated therewith, improved behavior during cold forming in a forming tool.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Since the metal oxides deposited on the surface of the Zn coating are removed according to the invention by the pretreatment with the acidic solution (work step b) of the method according to the invention), there is no need to add environmentally harmful fluorides and other additives to the phosphating solution. In addition, the content of heavy metals such as nickel and manganese in the phosphating solution can be reduced because smaller zinc phosphate crystals are formed. The procedure according to the invention is therefore also characterized by improved environmental compatibility and simpler handling.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">If components produced by forming flat steel products which are coated with a phosphating layer according to the invention are to be subjected to phosphating using the conventional production process after being formed, this phosphating of the component can be aimed at compensating for damage or imperfections in the phosphating layer produced according to the invention on the flat steel product before it is formed into the component so that an optimal surface condition is achieved for subsequent processing, in particular painting or gluing. For this purpose, the phosphating of the component can be designed in a resource-saving manner in such a way that the phosphating layer is closed only in portions of the surface of the protective metal layer which may not be coated or are no longer optimally coated with it.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">All acids which are sufficiently water-soluble and at the same time capable of dissolving the native oxide layer on the surface of the Zn coating are suitable as the acid for the acidic solution used in work step b) of the method according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The acids from the group &#x201c;sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, phosphonic acid, nitric acid, nitrous acid and hydrofluoric acid&#x201d; are particularly suitable for this purpose. A particularly good removal of the native oxide layer can be achieved with diluted sulfuric acid as an acidic solution, which is also available at a particularly low price.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">However, organic acids can also be used for the acidic solution as long as they are sufficiently strong proton donors. Organic acids from the group &#x201c;formic acid, oxalic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, malic acid and tartaric acid&#x201d; are also suitable for the method according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The surface of the Zn-coated flat steel product to be provided with the phosphating layer can be wetted with the acidic solution in work step a) in any suitable manner. Particularly suitable methods for applying the acidic solution to the surface to be provided with the phosphating layer are spraying methods, coating methods or dipping methods, with the use of a conventional coating or spraying method making the method particularly efficient and economical.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The length of time that the surface of the Zn coating to be phosphated must be exposed to the acidic solution in order to remove the oxides can be influenced by varying the acid concentration of the acidic solution and the temperature of the acidic solution, as well as by the method of application.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">This shows that the removal of the native oxide layer of the Zn coating according to the invention can be achieved within a wetting time of typically 1-60 s, in particular 1-30 s or 1-15 s, with a wetting time of at least 5 s proving particularly advantageous in practice. A maximum wetting time of 10 s can be achieved by using an acid that is sufficiently aggressive and present in a sufficient concentration, by using suitable system engineering or by suitably temperature-controlling the acidic solution. In any case, the wetting time required for work step b) is so short that work step b) can be integrated together with the other work steps of the method according to the invention in a continuously completed work sequence.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Suitable ranges for the concentration of the acid in an acidic solution used according to the invention can be described via the pH of the acidic solution. In order to achieve efficient removal of the native oxide layer without attacking the metal surface of the Zn coating at the same time, an acidic solution having a pH of 1-3.5 is used. If the acidic solution has a pH of more than 3.5, the acidic solution will need to be left to act for a longer period of time to dissolve the native oxide layer. Therefore, the pH is preferably limited to at most 2 or less in order to be able to remove the oxide film in a sufficiently quick time. pH values of the acidic solution in the range of from 1-1.5 have proven to be optimal.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">By temperature-controlling the acidic solution when wetting the flat steel product, dissolving of the native oxide layer on the Zn coating of the flat steel product can be accelerated. Wetting temperatures of the acidic solution of from 20-95&#xb0; C. are suitable for this. Suitable wetting temperatures can be determined depending on the concentration of the acidic solution and the speed at which the flat steel product runs through the section in which said product is wetted by the solution such that the native oxide layer can be removed within the available wetting time resulting from the length of the wetting path and the conveying speed. In practice, wetting temperatures of in particular 20-80&#xb0; C. have proven to be particularly suitable for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The removal of the oxides from the surface of the Zn coating of the flat steel product according to the invention is optionally followed by a rinsing step c), in which the surface of the protective metal layer wetted with the acidic solution is rinsed with an aqueous rinsing solution in order to remove any residues of the acidic solution. Tap water, process water or deionized water are suitable here as rinsing agents in the conventional manner.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The flat steel product pretreated by wetting with the acidic solution (work step b)) and the optional rinsing (optional step c)) undergoes activation of the surface of the flat steel product to be provided with the phosphating layer before phosphating (work step e)). For this purpose, an aqueous activation solution is applied to the surface of the protective metal layer to be provided with the phosphating layer (work step d)). All activation solutions already used for this purpose in the prior art are suitable as agents for the activation. These include, for example, powder activations based on sodium titanyl phosphates (titanyl phosphates) or liquid activations based on zinc phosphate/titanium phosphate/iron oxide.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A particularly finely crystalline phosphating layer is formed, which leads to a Zn-coated flat steel product having particularly good surface properties, in particular if the aqueous activation solution used for activation contains 0.8-25 g/l, in particular up to 16 g/l or up to 12 g/l, titanium salt selected from the group &#x201c;titanium dioxide, titanium dioxide hydrate, dipotassium hexafluorotitanate, hexafluorotitanic acid, titanium sulfate, titanium disulfate, titanyl sulfate, titanium oxide sulfate, titanyl chloride, titanium potassium fluoride, titanium tetrachloride, titanium tetrafluoride, titanium trichloride, titanium hydroxide, titanium nitrite, titanium nitrate, potassium titanium oxide oxalate and titanium carbide.&#x201d; Titanium salts are particularly good crystal nuclei for the crystallization of metal phosphates such as zinc phosphate. Alternatively or additionally, the aqueous activation solution can contain at least one compound from the group &#x201c;oxalic acid, Zn3(PO4)2, Zn2Fe(PO4)2, Zn2Ni(PO4)2, Zn2Mn(PO4)2, Zn2Ca(PO4)2, nickel phosphate, manganese phosphate, Calcium phosphate, iron phosphate, aluminum phosphate, cobalt(I) phosphate, cobalt(III) phosphate, copper, copper sulfate, copper nitrate, copper chloride, copper carbonate, copper oxide, silver, cobalt, nickel, Jernsted salt, lead acetate, tin chloride, tin tetrachloride, arsenic oxide, zirconium chloride, zirconium sulfate, zirconium, iron, lithium, zinc phosphate, iron phosphate, zinc oxide and iron oxide.&#x201d; Contents of from 0.1-10 g/l of each salt or each compound have proven to be particularly practical.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">If the aqueous activation solution has a starting concentration of at least 0.1-10 g/l, the crystallization nuclei for the phosphate crystals which form in the subsequent phosphating step are formed on the surface of the protective Zn layer within a few seconds. The activation according to the invention can be carried out particularly effectively when the batch concentration is less than 10 g/l.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">An activation of the surface to be phosphated that is sufficient for the purposes according to the invention reliably succeeds if the surface to be activated is exposed to the aqueous activation solution for an application time of 1-60 s.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The final phosphating step (work step e)) of the method according to the invention can be carried out in any known manner. Thus, the phosphating solutions known to a person skilled in the art are suitable for the phosphating step. A trication phosphating solution, for example, as is also already known for this purpose from the prior art, has proven to be particularly favorable with regard to the formation of a phosphate layer which ensures high paint adhesion or corrosion resistance.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Phosphating of a flat steel product which is provided and pretreated according to the invention can be reliably carried out by using an aqueous phosphating solution which contains<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0074">5-20 g/l phosphoric acid,</li>        <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0075">1-20 g/l orthophosphate and/or dihydrogen phosphate,</li>        <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0076">0.5-6 g/l zinc salt,</li>        <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0077">0.5-2 g/l manganese salt,</li>        <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0078">0.5-2 g/l nickel salt,</li>        <li id="ul0003-0006" num="0079">and traces of water and unavoidable impurities.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0075" num="0080">It has proven advantageous here if the free acid content of the phosphating solution is kept within a range of from 4 to 8 points and the ratio of total acid to free acid is kept within a range of from 2.5 to 5 points. The finely crystalline phosphate crystals are particularly reliably formed with a free acid content in the range of from 5 to 7 points. It serves the same purpose if the ratio of total acid to free acid is kept within a range of from 2.8 to 4.5 points.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0081">The activation (work step c)) and the phosphating (work step d)) can be carried out independently of one another in a regular wet-on-wet or dry-on-wet application step. The process efficiency can be further increased by a wet-on-wet method, since an intermediate drying step can be omitted. The dry-on-wet method, on the other hand, can be used particularly flexibly.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0082">To ensure that an oxide layer does not form again on the surface of the Zn coating between the removal of the native oxide layer (work step a)) and the activation and phosphating of the Zn coating (work steps c) and d)), no more than a maximum of 300 s should elapse between the end of work step a) and the beginning of work step d).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0083">In principle, all steels which can be coated with a protective Zn-based metal layer by using methods from the prior art can be used as the steel which comprises the steel substrate of flat steel products treated according to the invention.
