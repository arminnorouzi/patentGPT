One category of high value delivery robots can operate at relatively high speed (e.g., exceeding sidewalk speeds) and is capable of operating in bike-lanes or roads. With a small footprint, these robots can fit several in the same form factor as a car or truck, thus improving congestion, and potentially reducing cost per vehicle compared with using a car or truck for the same job. Additionally, the lighter weight of such a purpose-built delivery robot can save energy per delivery, increase safety for pedestrians and other drivers, and decrease embodied energy per vehicle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, when combining relatively high speed with a relatively small footprint, the narrowness of trackwidth (wheel to wheel lateral spacing) directly competes against vehicle roll-over stability. A vehicle must have a certain trackwidth to be able to corner without rolling over. To counteract this rollover tendency, autonomous vehicle designers tend to increase track width, leading to an overall vehicle envelope which can match or exceed the width of a small car. Accordingly, there is a need for autonomous vehicles that can travel at relatively high speeds while remaining laterally stable, i.e., while avoiding roll-over.</p><heading id="h-0004"

vehicle, which may or may not include a suspension system and/or active steering, as well as related methods, are described below and illustrated in the associated drawings. Unless otherwise specified, an autonomous vehicle in accordance with the present teachings, and/or its various components, may contain at least one of the structures, components, functionalities, and/or variations described, illustrated, and/or incorporated herein. Furthermore, unless specifically excluded, the process steps, structures, components, functionalities, and/or variations described, illustrated, and/or incorporated herein in connection with the present teachings may be included in other similar devices and methods, including being interchangeable between disclosed embodiments. The following description of various examples is merely illustrative in nature and is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. Additionally, the advantages provided by the examples and embodiments described below are illustrative in nature and not all examples and embodiments provide the same advantages or the same degree of advantages.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">This Detailed Description includes the following sections, which follow immediately below: (1) Definitions; (2) Overview; (3) Examples, Components, and Alternatives; (4) Advantages, Features, and Benefits; and (5) Conclusion. The Examples, Components, and Alternatives section is further divided into subsections A through J, each of which is labeled accordingly.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The following definitions apply herein, unless otherwise indicated.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">&#x201c;Comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d; (and conjugations thereof) are used interchangeably to mean including but not necessarily limited to, and are open-ended terms not intended to exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Terms such as &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, and &#x201c;third&#x201d; are used to distinguish or identify various members of a group, or the like, and are not intended to show serial or numerical limitation.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">&#x201c;AKA&#x201d; means &#x201c;also known as,&#x201d; and may be used to indicate an alternative or corresponding term for a given element or elements.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">&#x201c;Elongate&#x201d; or &#x201c;elongated&#x201d; refers to an object or aperture that has a length greater than its own width, although the width need not be uniform. For example, an elongate slot may be elliptical or stadium-shaped, and an elongate candlestick may have a height greater than its tapering diameter. As a negative example, a circular aperture would not be considered an elongate aperture.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The terms &#x201c;inboard,&#x201d; &#x201c;outboard,&#x201d; &#x201c;forward,&#x201d; &#x201c;rearward,&#x201d; and the like are intended to be understood in the context of a host vehicle on which systems described herein may be mounted or otherwise attached. For example, &#x201c;outboard&#x201d; may indicate a relative position that is laterally farther from the centerline of the vehicle, or a direction that is away from the vehicle centerline. Conversely, &#x201c;inboard&#x201d; may indicate a direction toward the centerline, or a relative position that is closer to the centerline. Similarly, &#x201c;forward&#x201d; means toward the front portion of the vehicle, and &#x201c;rearward&#x201d; means toward the rear of the vehicle. In the absence of a host vehicle, the same directional terms may be used as if the vehicle were present. For example, even when viewed in isolation, a device may have a &#x201c;forward&#x201d; edge, based on the fact that the device would be installed with the edge in question facing in the direction of the front portion of the host vehicle.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">&#x201c;Coupled&#x201d; means connected, either permanently or releasably, whether directly or indirectly through intervening components.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">&#x201c;Resilient&#x201d; describes a material or structure configured to respond to normal operating loads (e.g., when compressed) by deforming elastically and returning to an original shape or position when unloaded.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">&#x201c;Rigid&#x201d; describes a material or structure configured to be stiff, non-deformable, or substantially lacking in flexibility under normal operating conditions.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">&#x201c;Elastic&#x201d; describes a material or structure configured to spontaneously resume its former shape after being stretched or expanded.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">&#x201c;Processing logic&#x201d; describes any suitable device(s) or hardware configured to process data by performing one or more logical and/or arithmetic operations (e.g., executing coded instructions). For example, processing logic may include one or more processors (e.g., central processing units (CPUs) and/or graphics processing units (GPUs)), microprocessors, clusters of processing cores, FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators, digital signal processors (DSPs), and/or any other suitable combination of logic hardware.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A &#x201c;controller&#x201d; or &#x201c;electronic controller&#x201d; includes processing logic programmed with instructions to carry out a controlling function with respect to a control element. For example, an electronic controller may be configured to receive an input signal, compare the input signal to a selected control value or setpoint value, and determine an output signal to a control element (e.g., a motor or actuator) to provide corrective action based on the comparison. In another example, an electronic controller may be configured to interface between a host device (e.g., a desktop computer, a mainframe, etc.) and a peripheral device (e.g., a memory device, an input/output device, etc.) to control and/or monitor input and output signals to and from the peripheral device.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Directional terms such as &#x201c;up,&#x201d; &#x201c;down,&#x201d; &#x201c;vertical,&#x201d; &#x201c;horizontal,&#x201d; and the like should be understood in the context of the particular object in question. For example, an object may be oriented around defined X, Y, and Z axes. In those examples, the X-Y plane will define horizontal, with up being defined as the positive Z direction and down being defined as the negative Z direction.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">&#x201c;Providing,&#x201d; in the context of a method, may include receiving, obtaining, purchasing, manufacturing, generating, processing, preprocessing, and/or the like, such that the object or material provided is in a state and configuration for other steps to be carried out.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In this disclosure, one or more publications, patents, and/or patent applications may be incorporated by reference. However, such material is only incorporated to the extent that no conflict exists between the incorporated material and the statements and drawings set forth herein. In the event of any such conflict, including any conflict in terminology, the present disclosure is controlling.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In general, an autonomous vehicle (AKA a robotic vehicle or a robot) in accordance with aspects of the present teachings includes a tilting front wheel linkage and a control system configured to tilt the vehicle in a manner that stabilizes the vehicle and/or at least partially determines a direction of travel of the vehicle. In some examples, the vehicle additionally includes a steering system configured to at least partially determine the direction of travel by directly steering at least one wheel of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In illustrative examples described below, the autonomous vehicle includes three wheels, with a pair of linked wheels at a first end of the vehicle and a third wheel at an opposing end of the vehicle. However, any suitable number and arrangement of wheels may be used. A propulsion system of the vehicle may be coupled to any suitable wheel(s) to drive the vehicle forward and/or backward. For example, in some cases, the vehicle has a pair of linked wheels at a front end, a single wheel at a rear end, and a motor configured to drive the rear wheel.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">A control system of the autonomous vehicle may include processing logic configured to automatically tilt the chassis of the vehicle and in some cases actively steer the wheels of the vehicle to guide the vehicle down a selected path while maintaining a median plane of the vehicle chassis in alignment with a net force vector resulting from gravity and centrifugal force (if any). The vehicle may be of any suitable design configured to result in a coordinated and similar or substantially identical tilting of the chassis and the wheels. For example, the vehicle may comprise a four-bar parallelogram linkage, coupling the left and right wheels to the central chassis. Examples of this type of linkage are described below.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Methods and systems of the present disclosure may, for example, provide for the delivery of articles, objects, products, or goods from one location to another location using the wheeled vehicle. Control methods may be computer implemented, either partially or totally. As described above, the wheeled vehicle may optionally be autonomous, remotely controlled, semiautonomous, or mixed autonomous. The vehicle may optionally be one or a plurality of wheeled vehicles, for example one of a plurality of identical wheeled vehicles. The system of the present disclosure may be referred to as a wheeled vehicle or robotic delivery system, a driverless vehicle or robotic delivery system, an autonomous vehicle or robotic delivery system, a driverless or autonomous delivery system or any combination of the foregoing. The method and system of the present disclosure may optionally be used on an indoor or an outdoor land transportation network, which may include roads, bike paths, sidewalks, alleys, paths, crosswalks, any route on which a wheeled vehicle may travel or any combination of the foregoing. The transportation network of the present disclosure may be referred to as an outdoor network, an outdoor transportation network, a land transportation network, or the like.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Electromechanically controllable variables of the vehicle may include chassis tilt with respect to the wheel linkage, steering of the wheels, throttle or vehicle speed, and braking. In general, the control system is configured to keep centrifugal and gravitational forces in equilibrium when turning, so that the combined centrifugal and gravitational vectors create a net force vector parallel to the chassis and wheel median planes. By directing the combined forces parallel to the chassis, stress on the vehicle suspension components (as well as any cargo, where applicable) is reduced, rollover risk is decreased, and traction in a turn is improved or maximized.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">An ideal leaning position of the chassis may be achieved through a combination of actuators and control software to create the desired performance. In some examples, tilt and steering angles are discretely controlled for a given turn. In general, the tilt to steer ratio is controlled, depending on speed and terrain, and higher speed leads to more vehicle chassis lean, less wheel steering. The tilt experienced at the chassis is a sum of the angle of the road surface plus the angle of the wheel linkage articulation. Detecting the level of the surface (or the chassis tilt displacement to correct) could in some cases be done using a suitable sensor near the road surface. However, it may be more effective to determine and maintain the absolute tilt angle of the chassis by measuring its relationship to the net force vector caused by gravity and any centrifugal forces.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some cases, the interaction of crowned tires with the terrain must be accounted for, as the crowned shape of some wheels may produce scrub when tracking along the side of the wheel in a given turn vector over uneven or slanted terrain. For tilting three-wheeled vehicles, understeering or oversteering may be needed, depending on terrain, to counter the natural effect of the crowned wheel to oversteer or understeer into the turn. Generally speaking, this tire scrub is preferable to loss of the desired path of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Control system(s) of the vehicle may include any suitable processing logic for controlling the propulsion system, tilt system, and/or steering system to cause the vehicle to automatically travel along a desired path in a stable manner. Any suitable control methods may be used, including, e.g., any suitable relationship(s) between vehicle lean and vehicle steering. The control system may be further configured to enable additional vehicle functions, such as automatic unloading of vehicle contents.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some examples, the autonomous vehicle is a delivery vehicle configured to carry cargo. Accordingly, a body of the vehicle may comprise any suitable component(s) for containing any suitable object(s) or material(s). For example, the vehicle body may include one or more platforms, bins, tanks, closeable compartments, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some examples, the autonomous vehicle is equipped with fleet-management features, such a communications system configured to transmit sensed vehicle information (e.g., vehicle location, tire pressure, battery charge, and/or any other suitable information) to another device, such as a remote computer system (e.g., a computer not located onboard the vehicle). This can allow for convenient monitoring and maintenance of the vehicle. In some examples, the vehicle is one of a fleet of autonomous vehicles each configured to transmit vehicle information to a central fleet management computer.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Aspects of the autonomous vehicles described herein may be embodied as a computer method, computer system, or computer program product. Accordingly, aspects of the autonomous vehicle may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, and the like), or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects, all of which may generally be referred to herein as a &#x201c;circuit,&#x201d; &#x201c;module,&#x201d; or &#x201c;system.&#x201d; Furthermore, aspects of the autonomous vehicle may take the form of a computer program product embodied in a computer-readable medium (or media) having computer-readable program code/instructions embodied thereon.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Any combination of computer-readable media may be utilized. Computer-readable media can be a computer-readable signal medium and/or a computer-readable storage medium. A computer-readable storage medium may include an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, and/or semiconductor system, apparatus, or device, or any suitable combination of these. More specific examples of a computer-readable storage medium may include the following: an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), an optical fiber, a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), an optical storage device, a magnetic storage device, and/or any suitable combination of these and/or the like. In the context of this disclosure, a computer-readable storage medium may include any suitable non-transitory, tangible medium that can contain or store a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">A computer-readable signal medium may include a propagated data signal with computer-readable program code embodied therein, for example, in baseband or as part of a carrier wave. Such a propagated signal may take any of a variety of forms, including, but not limited to, electro-magnetic, optical, and/or any suitable combination thereof. A computer-readable signal medium may include any computer-readable medium that is not a computer-readable storage medium and that is capable of communicating, propagating, or transporting a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Program code embodied on a computer-readable medium may be transmitted using any appropriate medium, including but not limited to wireless, wireline, optical fiber cable, RF, and/or the like, and/or any suitable combination of these.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Computer program code for carrying out operations for aspects of autonomous tilting vehicles may be written in one or any combination of programming languages, including an object-oriented programming language (such as Java, C++), conventional procedural programming languages (such as C), and functional programming languages (such as Haskell).

Autonomous Vehicle</heading><p id="p-0097" num="0096">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, this section describes an illustrative three-wheeled autonomous vehicle <b>100</b> configured to tilt or lean from side to side, e.g., while cornering. Vehicle <b>100</b> is an example of a tilting delivery vehicle or delivery robot, generally described above.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of vehicle <b>100</b>. As depicted, vehicle <b>100</b> has three wheels coupled to a body or chassis <b>102</b>, with a single drive wheel <b>104</b> in the rear and two wheels <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> in front. Rear wheel <b>104</b> is driven by a motor <b>110</b>, e.g., a hub motor, which is controlled by a motor controller <b>112</b> to propel the vehicle in forward and reverse directions. Front wheels <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are coupled to a front end of chassis <b>102</b> by a tilt linkage <b>114</b> configured to tilt the chassis of the vehicle as well as the front wheels, in a controlled manner. Tilt linkage <b>114</b> may include any suitable mechanical linkage, such as a four-bar linkage, configured to ensure a tilt of the front wheels corresponds to the tilt of the chassis. A tilt actuator <b>116</b> (also referred to as a lean actuator or roll actuator) is operatively connected to tilt linkage <b>114</b>, and may include any suitable electric motor (e.g., servo motor, step motor), rotary actuator, or other device configured to provide a rotational force for tilting the chassis and wheels.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Steering of the vehicle may be accomplished by tilting and/or by controlled steering of the front wheels, e.g., using a steering actuator <b>118</b> operationally connected to a steering linkage <b>120</b>. Various illustrative steering schemes are described further below. In this context, tilt or lean is defined as a lateral roll from side to side about a roll axis (e.g., axis A), while steering is performed by rotating the wheel or wheels about a yaw axis, such that the wheels point in a direction more to the left or right relative to their present orientation. At some vehicle speeds, steering may be performed entirely by way of tilting, while the front wheels are free to caster. At some vehicle speeds, steering may be performed entirely by actively steering the front wheels. At some vehicle speeds, a combination of methods may be utilized.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Steering actuator <b>118</b> may include any suitable electric motor (e.g., servo motor, step motor), rotary actuator, or other device configured to provide a rotational force for steering vehicle <b>100</b>. This force from the steering actuator is converted by the steering linkage into a linear force for turning the wheels. The steering linkage may, for example, include one or more tie rods configured to mechanically couple actuator <b>118</b> to wheels <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>. In some examples, steering linkage <b>120</b> is an Ackermann steering linkage, such that control of the front wheels automatically compensates for the inside and outside wheel needing to trace circles of different radii during a given turn.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some examples, vehicle <b>100</b> utilizes servo motors with planetary gearboxes for both the lean and the steer actuators. Other suitable actuators include worm gear boxes, linear actuators connecting linkage elements, hydraulic actuators, harmonic drive units, stepper motors, direct torque actuators, and/or the like. Generally, the tilt actuator has a higher load requirement, and must generate more force than the steering actuator, such that different types of actuators may be used for each.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">A suspension system <b>122</b> may be integrated into tilt linkage <b>114</b>, steering linkage <b>120</b>, and/or coupled to wheels <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>. A separate suspension system may be provided for rear wheel <b>104</b>. Suspension system <b>122</b> may include any suitable biasing and/or damping device(s) configured to facilitate travel over a rough or bumpy terrain. For example, suspension system <b>122</b> may include one or more shock absorbers and/or springs. Suspension system <b>122</b> is configured to reduce shock and vibration loads to cargo as well as to the sensing and control systems and vehicle chassis. There are several possible approaches to suspending the vehicle in a shock absorbing manner, including but not limited to: four-bar linkages, leading links, A-arms, linear/telescoping direct suspension, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">A control system <b>124</b> (e.g., an onboard control system) of vehicle <b>100</b> may include any suitable processing logic <b>126</b> configured to control the various actuators in view of information from one or more vehicle sensors <b>128</b> and/or in response to commands received from a navigation control system <b>130</b>. Navigation control system <b>130</b> may include any suitable navigation system configured to direct vehicle <b>100</b> along a path toward a destination, and disposed either onboard vehicle <b>100</b>, remotely (e.g., a remote-control unit), or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Sensors <b>128</b> may include any suitable devices configured to determine information regarding vehicle <b>100</b> and/or its physical operating environment. For example, sensors <b>128</b> may include sensing units typically found on autonomous vehicles. Example sensors may include temperature sensors, tire pressure sensors, tilt or other orientation sensors (e.g., accelerometers), speed sensors, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Additionally, or alternatively, sensors <b>128</b> may include at least one orientation-dependent sensor <b>128</b>A configured to sense information (e.g., regarding a surrounding environment) in an orientation-dependent manner. In other words, information sensed by sensor <b>128</b>A tends to be affected, in at least some circumstances, by the orientation and/or position of the sensor with respect to at least one axis. Example orientation-dependent sensors may include, e.g., LIDAR, radar, laser range-finders, optical imaging sensors, thermal imaging sensors, a computer vision system, proximity sensors, etc. The information sensed by these types of sensors generally depends on sensor orientation. For instance, the orientation of an image acquired by an imaging sensor is determined by the orientation of the imaging sensor, and the information obtained by a LIDAR sensor depends on the position and direction of the light source. Accordingly, if the orientation-dependent sensor is tilted (e.g., as the vehicle chassis and/or linkage is tilted), the data acquired by the sensor is generally altered relative to data that would be acquired by an untilted sensor. This can adversely impact the use of the data by control systems of the vehicle (e.g., navigation control system <b>130</b>, a collision-avoidance system, etc.). Accordingly, orientation-dependent sensor <b>128</b>A may be coupled to chassis <b>102</b> (and/or another suitable part of the vehicle) by a tilt-compensating mount system <b>131</b> configured to compensate for vehicle tilt (at least on the roll axis), such that sensor <b>128</b>A remains partially or completely untilted as the vehicle tilts. For example, tilt-compensating mount system <b>131</b> may comprise a gimbal mount.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Tilt-compensating mount system <b>131</b> may comprise an active tilt-compensation system and/or a passive tilt-compensation system. An active tilt-compensation system includes at least one motor or other actuator configured to adjust an orientation of sensor <b>128</b>A based on a detected tilt of the sensor (e.g., as detected by a tilt sensor coupled to the sensor or to the gimbal mount), and/or based on an anticipated tilt of the vehicle (e.g., based on a control signal to the tilt actuator and/or steering actuator, which apprises system <b>131</b> that sensor <b>128</b>A will imminently tilt without intervention). A passive tilt-compensation system may include a gyroscope or other suitable device configured to attach sensor <b>128</b>A to the chassis such that the sensor does not tend to tilt as the vehicle tilts. In some examples, the tilt-compensation system may include a mechanical linkage slaved to the tilt linkage <b>114</b>, such that a corresponding counter-lean is automatically produced in the tilt-compensation system.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Tilt-compensating mount system <b>131</b> may be configured to compensate for tilt about any suitable axis or combination of axes. In some examples, system <b>131</b> is configured to compensate for tilt about the vehicle roll axis only. Accordingly, in these examples, sensor <b>128</b>A is effectively stabilized about the roll axis, such that it does not tilt with respect to horizontal when the vehicle is caused to tilt, but is not prevented from tilting with the vehicle about a pitch axis or a yaw axis.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Processing logic <b>126</b> may include any suitable modules or hardware configured to carry out control algorithms with respect to the operation of vehicle <b>100</b>. For example, processing logic <b>126</b> may include motor controller <b>112</b>, a steering controller <b>132</b> configured to control steering actuator <b>118</b>, and/or a tilt controller <b>134</b> configured to control tilt actuator <b>116</b>, as well as processing logic configured to coordinate the activities of any or all of these controllers.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Control system <b>124</b> may be in wireless communication with a remote system, e.g., a remote portion of navigation control <b>130</b>, and therefore may include a wireless radio system configured to transmit and receive information, e.g., as represented by a transceiver <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Turning now to a discussion of illustrative steering schemes that may be implemented by the control system and vehicle <b>100</b>, there are several possible relationships of lean (i.e., tilt) to steering in a tilting robot, such as autonomous vehicle <b>100</b>. Selected relationships and related control system configurations are discussed below:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0110">a. Mechanically Linked Lean to Steer</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0111" num="0111">In this case, the mechanical linkages result in a fixed ratio to cause the wheels of the vehicle to be turned when they lean. In embodiments of this type, it may be desirable to dynamically change the lean-to-steer ratio with respect to speed, to provide both low speed maneuverability and high speed stability.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0112">b. Electrically Linked Lean to Steer</p><p id="p-0113" num="0113">In this case, lean angle is the primary control vector utilized to determine how much to actively steer the vehicle. Steering is controlled by the steering controller and actuator, based on the lean angle, vehicle speed, and other factors.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0114">c. Free to Caster (FTC)</p><p id="p-0115" num="0115">In this case, lean angle is the primary control vector for the vehicle, and the steering system is left free to assume any position. In other words, active steering is discontinued, and the wheels are freed to swivel or caster based entirely on ground forces and lean angle. Based on a trail/caster angle, the vehicle will mechanically select an optimum steering angle for the lean angle. This technique works well at higher speeds.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0116">In FTC operation, the vehicle geometry is designed so that when tilt is initiated, the front wheels will caster or swivel to the proper steering angle for any given combination of lean and speed. This relationship can be roughly expressed as S=T/V, where S is steer angle, T is tilt angle, and V is velocity. In a given turn, if the maximum lean has already been achieved, but the vehicle needs to turn more tightly, reducing speed will cause the turn radius to decrease in accordance with the FTC dynamics.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0117">With FTC, a vehicle will also counter-steer when entering a drift from loss of rear wheel traction, and will also counter-steer in the case of one front wheel coming off the ground during the initiation of tilt with a high center of gravity (CG) or a very narrow wheelbase. A tilting three-wheeled vehicle utilizing an FTC control scheme is resistant to flipping over for this reason.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0118">d. Free Leaning</p><p id="p-0119" num="0119">In this case, the steering angle is the primary control vector and the vehicle is free to lean. Embodiments of this type may use a tilt-locking mechanism to prevent undesirable instabilities, maintaining the vehicle at a set angle (e.g., vertical) or range of angles. Furthermore, the steering angle may operate under closed-loop control to balance the vehicle, similar to the way a bicyclist or motorcyclist balances their vehicle using a combination of body lean, counter-steering, and other inputs.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0120">e. IMU-Based Lean Follows Steer</p><p id="p-0121" num="0121">In this case, steering angle is the primary control vector for the vehicle. Accelerometer and/or gyro sensors sense the lateral forces on the vehicle, and the tilt actuator runs a control loop to minimize the component of lateral acceleration showing a tendency to slide the vehicle out of the turn.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0122">f. Combination Methods</p><p id="p-0123" num="0123">In some cases, the above techniques can be used in combination with clutches/brakes on either the steer or lean actuators or both, or the actuators can be programmed into a &#x201c;simulated low-inertia control mode&#x201d; where they act as followers. This can be turned on and off (gradually) at certain vehicle speed breakpoints to provide optimal handling in both the low and high-speed domains. Additionally, control rules may need to be modified when the vehicle is operating in reverse.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0124">For any of the above control schemes, a desired tilt angle for the vehicle in question is in general derived by determining what side-to-side lean or tilt angle results in a net force vector aligned with the central vertical plane of the chassis, also referred to as the median plane, i.e., a plane through the vertical centerline of the vehicle dividing or bisecting the chassis into left and right portions. The net force vector is defined as the combined force vector resulting from downward gravity and lateral centrifugal force. A sensor (e.g., an accelerometer) on the vehicle detects lateral deflection of the force vector on the chassis (e.g., due to centrifugal forces from initiating a steered turn, or lateral forces from uneven terrain during a turn or during normal operation). In response, a tilting actuator and in some cases a steering actuator are adjusted to return the net force vector to substantial alignment with the median plane of the chassis. Lean angle changes with speed and tightness of turn radius. Given the desired or optimum tilt angle for a given turn radius and/or speed, (i.e., the angle that keeps the net force vector in alignment with the chassis) the tilt linkage may be altered to maintain that tilt angle, and also to keep the tilt angle regardless of uneven/changing ground surface.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0125">Lean (AKA tilt) to steer ratios are calculated to maintain the summary force vector (with respect to centrifugal force and the force due to gravity) in alignment with the median plane of the tilting vehicle. Generally speaking, the faster the vehicle goes for any given turn radius, the more the vehicle chassis needs to lean in order to keep this summary force vector in alignment with the median plane of the tiltable chassis. Higher speed or decreased turning radius results in an increase to the desired lean angle.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0126">Control system <b>124</b> may include any suitable processing logic configured to carry out algorithms such as those described herein. For example, a PID (proportional integral derivative) controller may be utilized, having a control loop feedback mechanism to control tilt/steer variables based on force vector measurement.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0127">For example, during the turning of vehicle <b>100</b>, while lateral accelerations and/or centrifugal forces are exerted on chassis <b>102</b>, vehicle control system <b>124</b> may direct the one or more tilt actuators <b>116</b> to pivot and/or tilt chassis <b>102</b> so as to compensate in whole or in part for such lateral accelerations and/or centrifugal forces. Processing logic <b>126</b> may receive input from one or more of sensors <b>128</b>, to measure such accelerations, centrifugal forces and/or other characteristics of chassis <b>102</b> so as to determine the degree, amount, and/or angle to which the chassis should be pivoted and/or tilted by the one or more tilt actuators <b>116</b>. For example, an IMU sensor, which may be included in the one or more sensors <b>128</b>, and may optionally include a solid-state accelerometer, may be utilized for measuring any suitable acceleration and/or force in this regard. The degree, amount, and/or angle of such tilt may be sensed and/or measured by any suitable sensor, and directed back to processing logic <b>126</b> and/or other aspects of the control system as feedback. Any suitable algorithm may be programmed into the control system, either as firmware, software or both, for analyzing the input signals provided by one or more sensors and for instructing and/or controlling the one or more tilt actuators.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0128">One or more braking mechanisms of vehicle <b>100</b> may be controllable by control system <b>124</b> to cause slowing of the vehicle along its direction or path of travel.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0129">In some examples, vehicle <b>100</b> is directed by control system <b>124</b> to travel over a transportation network from a first location to a second location. Instructions regarding the second location and/or path(s) between the first and second locations may be stored in a memory of the vehicle control system, received by the vehicle control system from another source (e.g., a remote control), determined by the vehicle control system, and/or derived in any other suitable way. In some examples, such instructions are relayed to the vehicle from another location during the course of travel from the first location to the second location. In some examples, vehicle controller receives GPS information (e.g., from an onboard GPS receiver, or indirectly from another source) for use in charting the course of travel from the first location to the second location. In some examples, the vehicle control system determines and/or adapts the course of travel based on readings from an onboard camera, LIDAR system, computer-vision system, proximity sensor, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0130">In some examples, a course of travel between the first and second location is determined in advance (i.e., before the vehicle begins to travel), and may optionally be updated during travel (e.g., for collision avoidance). In some examples, the course of travel is determined as the vehicle travels, such that at any given time, the vehicle control system only knows a small portion of the travel path it will imminently take.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0131">Based on the instructions, control system <b>124</b> sends appropriate commands to the motor, tilt actuator, and/or steer actuator to control the speed and direction of travel of the vehicle. Depending on the mode in which the vehicle is operating, the tilt actuator and steer actuator do not necessarily each receive instructions. For example, in a free-to-caster mode, the steering actuator is not used. In a free-leaning mode, the tilt actuator is not used.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0132">Processing logic <b>126</b> receives input signals from one or more of sensors <b>128</b> that indicating lateral accelerations and/or centrifugal forces exerted on the vehicle (e.g., during turns). In response, the processing logic sends appropriate commands to the one or more tilt actuators <b>116</b> to pivot and/or tilt chassis <b>102</b> of the vehicle relative to the travel surface and/or appropriate reference line or plane into a turn so as to compensate for such lateral accelerations and/or centrifugal forces.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0133">In some examples, a PID loop of the control system is configured to automatically modulate a speed of the vehicle to attain desired turn radii. For example, if a tighter turn is needed, the vehicle may slow automatically, rather than steering or tilting, thereby reducing the turn radius.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">B.

This results in an acceptable suspension solution. However, the trail dimension and scrub radius change slightly when the suspension is compressed between the kingpin and the wheel.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0144">This can be addressed by using an A-arm suspension system. However, in this example, the direction of suspension travel is (in hard leans) tangential to the plane of the wheel, and causes &#x201c;mushiness&#x201d; and alignment issues.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0145">The situation may also be remedied by mounting the kingpin directly to the front suspension swingarm. However, the rotary motion of the swingarm (either leading link or trailing link) during suspension travel changes the caster angle (i.e., rake) of the kingpins and can dramatically change the FTC handling characteristics of the steering suspension.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0146">To eliminate the change in trail and scrub radius during suspension compression, a linear rail suspension system is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, where there is no suspension movement between the kingpin and the wheel. This system creates suspension travel between the tilting pivots and the steering kingpins, while keeping suspension travel direction within the plane of the wheel and the kingpin and wheel relationship fixed. To prevent twisting, the linear rail solution may include two non-splined shafts fixed in parallel with each other, or one (or more) splined shaft.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0147">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, a four-bar linkage <b>270</b> is partially depicted, with an upper bar <b>272</b> and a lower bar <b>274</b>.

When used for tilting vehicles, A-arm pivots can be used as the tilting pivots and for suspension travel. Accordingly, to actuate the tilt directly in this configuration, the tilt actuator acts through the springs of the suspension rather than directly on the A-arm pivot. On four-bar designs, the tilt actuator (e.g., motor) can actuate the four bar pivot directly, because the four bar is only controlling tilt. Suspension travel does not affect the four bar articulation, because the springs are disposed between the four-bar linkage and the wheels. With respect to tilting A-Arm suspensions, the tilt actuator motor connects either directly to the shock, or connects to a rocker which connects the shocks.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0150">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, an illustrative vehicle <b>310</b>, which is an example of vehicle <b>100</b>, includes a single shock <b>312</b> having a collar <b>314</b> coupled to a tilt actuator <b>316</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows vehicle <b>310</b> in an untilted state, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows vehicle <b>310</b> in a tilted state.

Tilt-locking the motor in this manner can allow the vehicle to be restrained against unwanted tilt without the inclusion of dedicated tilt-lock mechanisms, such as those described above. In examples of vehicles that do include dedicated tilt-lock mechanisms, the motor can also be tilt-lockable (e.g., for redundancy). In some examples, the tilt actuator may comprise a motor configured to have maximum torque when the motor is off. In other words, a motor with low or no back-drive capability may function as a primary or supplementary tilt locking device.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">E.

Illustrative Autonomous Unloading System</heading><p id="p-0192" num="0192">In some examples, the tilting suspension system of an autonomous vehicle enables the vehicle to unload cargo autonomously (e.g., without intervention from a human or from other another device). In general, autonomous loading is facilitated by a tilting vehicle suspension (e.g., as described above with reference to vehicle <b>100</b>) and a vehicle body configured to carry cargo and to allow the cargo to be released when the vehicle is tilted in a certain manner. For example, the vehicle body may be configured such that, when the vehicle is tilted to a certain angle and/or at a certain angular velocity, cargo item(s) fall from the vehicle body.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0193">An illustrative method of autonomously unloading cargo is described below, and depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>44</b>-<b>45</b></figref>, with reference to autonomous delivery robot <b>1800</b>, described above. However, in general any suitable tilting vehicle may be configured for autonomous unloading.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0194"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>44</b>-<b>45</b></figref> depict autonomous tilting vehicle <b>1800</b> automatically unloading cargo (here, package <b>1812</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref> is an isometric side view of vehicle <b>1800</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref> is a rear view of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0195">Prior to unloading (e.g., during transport of package <b>1812</b>), the package sits on floor <b>1816</b> inside cargo compartment <b>1808</b>, and door <b>1820</b> is typically closed. To unload package <b>1812</b>, processing logic of vehicle <b>1800</b> causes door <b>1820</b> to open and causes vehicle body <b>1804</b> to tilt. With vehicle body <b>1804</b> tilted, compartment floor <b>1816</b> is angled, such that one side of the floor is lower than the other. Accordingly, it is possible for package <b>1812</b> to slide down the inclined floor and out of compartment <b>1808</b>.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0196">Door <b>1820</b> is configured to be opened automatically (e.g., in response to a command from processing logic of the vehicle). For example, door <b>1820</b> may be coupled to one or more suitable actuators configured to pivot the door about the hinge. In some examples, door <b>1820</b> is biased open, and the vehicle controller is configured to actuate a latch to permit the door to transition to the open position. Although door <b>1820</b> in this example is a gullwing door, compartment <b>1808</b> can in general have any suitable closure(s) for selectively allowing cargo to be ejected from the compartment. In some examples, the closure of the cargo compartment does not fully enclose the compartment when closed. For example, the closure may comprise a bar or gate configured to selectively retain the cargo in a compartment or on a platform.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0197">The vehicle control system can be configured to modulate a tilt angle of the vehicle to achieve smooth unloading (e.g., to achieve a desired unload velocity, to prevent the cargo from tipping or rolling, etc.) For example, the control system may be configured to execute servo control algorithm(s) to control vehicle tilt angle in a manner that achieves a desired position, velocity, acceleration, and/or mechanical agitation of the discharged cargo. In some examples, properties of the cargo (e.g., lateral or vertical velocity, acceleration, etc.) are measured by vehicle sensor(s) and used as input to a control algorithm. Alternatively, or additionally, the vehicle controller may be programmed to modulate the tilt with predetermined angles, angular velocities, angular accelerations, etc., which have been previously determined to be suitable for discharging the cargo in a desired manner. In some examples, the vehicle controller may select respective values for parameters such as tilt angle based on a sensed weight and/or volume of the cargo. (See, e.g., a description of an illustrative payload weight estimation method below.) For example, the values may be calculated by the controller based on sensed cargo data, selected from a plurality of values stored in a memory of the controller based on the sensed data, and/or selected in any other suitable manner.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0198">In some examples, the vehicle control system is configured to discharge cargo by tilting to a high angle (i.e., far from level) to overcome static friction. This allows the cargo to start moving along the inclined floor. Once the cargo has begun to move, the vehicle controller reduces the tilt angle to a lower value (e.g., closer to level). The cargo generally remains in motion even after the tilt angle has been reduced from the initial value because static friction exceeds dynamic friction. In some examples, the vehicle controller is configured to gradually reduce the tilt angle (e.g., gradually bringing the floor closer to level), which tends to slow the velocity of the cargo. Slowing the cargo's velocity in this manner helps to prevent damage and/or to ensure that the cargo is discharged at a desired location. Depending on the height of the floor of the cargo area, the unload algorithm(s) of the vehicle control system may accept higher/lower cargo lateral velocities.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0199">In some examples, the tilt angle is reduced in a manner that tends to keep the cargo moving along the floor at a desired constant speed. The constant speed may be determined by, e.g., a coefficient of kinetic friction between the floor and the cargo, the tilt angle of the vehicle, the vertical displacement of the cargo as it travels along the floor, and/or any other suitable factors.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0200">In some examples, the initial high tilt angle commanded by the vehicle control system is selected to achieve the condition of the floor edge being very close to the ground (e.g., as close as possible). Accordingly, even after the tilt angle has been reduced, the discharged cargo falls a relatively short distance from the vehicle to the ground, which helps to prevent damage caused by impact with the ground. The short drop distance may also help to prevent the cargo from tipping, which is useful in cases wherein tipping may cause damage, or wherein the cargo is unloaded onto an automated system configured to receive the cargo in a specific orientation.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0201">The floor of the cargo area may be a low-friction material (ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW) plastic, polyoxymethylene(s) (e.g., including those sold the under the names Delrin, Ultraform, Celcon, etc.), polytetrafluoroethylene(PTFE), and/or any other suitable materials). Additionally, or alternatively, the cargo area may include rollers, ball transfers, a system configured to blow air or another suitable fluid across the floor, and/or any other suitable devices configured to actively or passively reduce friction.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0202">The autonomous unloading systems and methods described herein allow cargo to be unloaded from the autonomous tilting vehicle automatically. Additionally, the autonomous unloading can in at least some examples be achieved using only the existing tilting mechanisms of the vehicle (e.g., without the addition of dedicated unloading actuators). This provides significant labor savings compared to a robot that requires manual unloading and also simplifies the vehicle design/BOM because it does not require additional unload actuators. However, in some examples, additional unload actuators may be included. For example, one or more additional actuators may be disposed within the cargo compartment and configured to urge cargo out of the compartment (e.g., when the door is opened). Suitable additional actuators may include motorized rollers in the floor, linear actuator(s) attached to the vehicle body and configured to push the cargo out of the compartment, and so on.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">G. Illustrative Systems and Methods Related to Sensor Tilt and Displacement</heading><p id="p-0203" num="0203">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>46</b>-<b>47</b></figref>, this section describes illustrative systems and methods relating to accounting for and/or preventing certain effects of tilt and/or lateral displacement of sensors of a tilting autonomous vehicle, such as vehicle <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0204">As described above, an autonomous tilting vehicle may include one or more sensors, at least some of which may be mounted to a tilting part of the vehicle chassis. Unless configured otherwise, a sensor mounted to the tilting chassis would be expected to tilt during vehicle operation. For some types of sensors, this tilting can adversely affect data acquired by the sensor (e.g., by interfering with sensor function, by causing the sensed data to be different than data that would be acquired by an untilted sensor, etc.). As an example, an autonomous tilting vehicle may include one or more cameras, radar devices, LIDAR devices, and/or the like mounted to the tilting vehicle frame. Data sensed by these devices may be input to processing logic of the vehicle for navigation, pathfinding, determining information about the vehicle environment, and so on. However, if the sensor is tilted, the sensed data may be difficult for the processing logic to use as intended. For example, a computer-vision algorithm configured to determine a direction of travel for the vehicle may produce inaccurate results if the input data is a tilted image of the scene in front of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0205">An example method for preventing problems associated with tilted sensors is to correct the sensed data based on vehicle tilt, producing corrected data approximating data that would have been acquired by an untilted sensor. For example, processing logic of the vehicle may receive information about vehicle tilt (e.g., tilt angle, angular velocity, and/or the like), and determine, based on the tilt information, a rotational transform and/or other factor(s) or method(s) suitable for correcting and/or compensating the sensed data for vehicle tilt. The processing logic is further configured to correct the sensed data using the determined compensation factor(s) and/or method(s). Correcting the sensed data may include using at least one rotational matrix, machine learning algorithm, and/or any other suitable method for correcting the effect of sensor tilt on the sensed data.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0206">Suitable tilt information usable by the processing logic to determine correction factor(s) and/or method(s) may include information about the setting of one or more tilt actuators; relative positioning of two or more vehicle components; tilt information obtained from an accelerometer, inclinometer, IMU, gyroscope, etc.; and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0207">The vehicle processing logic may use any suitable method for selecting sensor data to be corrected. For example, the processing logic may tilt-correct all data sensed by certain sensors, or may tilt-correct data sensed by certain sensors only when vehicle tilt information indicates that the sensor in question is tilted beyond a certain threshold angle. Sensed data may be tilt-corrected automatically when acquired and/or on-demand when the data is accessed by certain control algorithms. Corrected data may be used by vehicle processing logic, recorded in vehicle memory, transmitted to another location, used as training data for machine learning, and/or the like. For example, the corrected sensor output may be used as input to vehicle-control algorithms designed to use data generated by a non-tilting vehicle.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0208">Alternatively, or additionally, one or more sensors may be mounted to the tilting vehicle in a manner that at least partly prevents the physical sensor itself from tilting with the vehicle. For example, one or more sensors may be mounted to the vehicle by a gimbal, linkage, or robotic mechanism configured to allow a gimbaling of the sensors, thereby reducing or eliminating any sensor distortion caused by vehicle tilt. For example, a sensor module may be attached to the vehicle by a gyroscope, such that the sensor module does not tilt along with the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0209">In some examples, a sensor module is attached to the vehicle by a mounting system capable of allowing the module to tilt, and the mounting system includes a control system configured to actively correct module tilt such that the module effectively remains untilted. For example, the mounting system can include one or more tilt sensors configured to detect sensor module tilt, and one or more actuators and/or motors configured to adjust the sensor module tilt to restore the sensor module to an upright (e.g., untilted) position. By adjusting sensor module position based on sensed module tilt, the mounting system effectively maintains the sensor module in an untilted position.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0210">In examples including a mounting system configured to reduce or eliminate sensor module tilt, processing logic of the vehicle may optionally still be configured to correct sensed data for module tilt, as described above. Data correction may be helpful in cases where the mounting system does not fully prevent module tilt, where the mounting system has malfunctioned or is inoperable (which can occur if, e.g., the vehicle overturns), and/or in any other suitable situation.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0211"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>46</b>-<b>47</b></figref> are front views of an example autonomous tilting vehicle <b>2000</b> having an illustrative tilt-compensating mount system <b>2004</b> configured to maintain an illustrative sensor module <b>2008</b> in a substantially untilted position.

Based on the sensed tilt of the module, an actuator of gimbal <b>2012</b> rotates support <b>2024</b> such that module <b>2008</b> is positioned upright (i.e., substantially untilted).

This lateral displacement also tends to occur for sensor modules not attached to the chassis by mount system <b>2004</b> or similar (that is, in examples wherein sensor modules do tilt along with the vehicle chassis). The lateral displacement can, in some cases, impact the use of data sensed by sensor module <b>2008</b> (e.g., in algorithms of processing logic of the vehicle).</p><p id="p-0215" num="0215">For example, in some cases module <b>2008</b> includes a LIDAR module used by navigation and/or computer-vision algorithms, and these algorithms may expect the LIDAR data to correspond to a LIDAR module positioned at a lateral center line of the vehicle. The lateral displacement of the sensor module due to vehicle tilt therefore tends to cause the algorithms to fail.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0216">Accordingly, in some examples, lateral displacement of the sensor module due to vehicle tilt is corrected after data acquisition by processing logic of the vehicle, in a manner similar to the tilt correction of sensed data described above. For example, a lateral-displacement sensor may be disposed on sensor module <b>2008</b> (and/or on any other suitable part of the vehicle) and configured to detect lateral displacement of sensor module <b>2008</b>. Processing logic of the vehicle may use the sensed lateral-displacement information to correct and/or compensate for the lateral displacement of the sensor module. For example, in some cases it is possible to correct the output of sensor module <b>2008</b> to approximate output of a sensor that has not been displaced (i.e., a sensor positioned at a lateral center of the vehicle).

If only two tilt sensors were included, and one of those sensors failed in a manner that caused it to output faulty data, it could be difficult for the controller to determine which sensor was accurate. With three sensors, however, the faulty sensor is easily identified, because the other two sensors produce similar and/or identical readings. Another advantage of having three of each type of sensor is that, when the sensors are operating normally, their outputs can be combined (e.g., by averaging, error correction algorithms, etc.) for increased precision and/or accuracy. However, in some examples a fail-operational vehicle can include only two of each type of sensor.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0223">As another example of fail-operational functionality, a vehicle having steer motor(s) (or other suitable steering actuators) can be configured to be operable even if the steer motor fails. A steer motor that is configured to be back-driven allows the wheels to tilt when the vehicle chassis is tilted. Accordingly, in the case of failure of the steer motor (or motor controller, or certain aspects of the steering linkage), the vehicle can be operated in a free-to-caster (FTC) mode, wherein the vehicle turns when commanded by the tilt control system, and the back-driven steer motor allows the wheels to be turned. A steer control motor configured to be back-driven in this manner may, for example, include no gearbox between the motor and the steered wheel(s).</p><p id="p-0224" num="0224">In some examples, processing logic of the vehicle is configured to perform certain actions in the event that certain system component(s) fail. For example, in response to failure of the tilting system, the vehicle controller may be programmed to use the steering system to steer to a suitable location where the vehicle can safely stop and await repair.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0225">b. Wireless Charging</p><p id="p-0226" num="0226">In some examples, an autonomous tilting vehicle includes wireless charging components configured to allow a battery of the vehicle to be charged without a mechanical connection to a power source. For example, wireless induction coil(s) may be disposed in a portion of the vehicle chassis, tilt linkage, steering linkage, and/or any other suitable location. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>36</b>-<b>37</b></figref>, described above with reference to an example tilt-lock device, depict an example wherein wireless charging coils <b>1460</b> are disposed on a projection of a lower bar of a four-bar tilting linkage. Wireless charging can allow the vehicle to recharge in a partly or fully autonomous manner, without requiring human intervention to swap batteries or connect/disconnect a charging plug.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0227">c. Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) with Regenerative Braking</p><p id="p-0228" num="0228">Vehicles can be designed to incorporate ABS brakes and/or regenerative braking capability using the propulsion system (e.g., a hub motor driving a rear vehicle wheel) for braking power. For example, a braking system having anti-lock and regenerative functionality may be configured to detect nonlinearities in motor deceleration, which indicate traction loss, using external wheel speed sensors (e.g., on non-braked wheels) and/or using commutation sensors of the motor. In response to sensed data indicating loss of traction, the motor controller causes the motor to partially or completely reduce braking torque until traction is regained, and then to reapply regenerative torque.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0229">d. Payload Weight Estimation</p><p id="p-0230" num="0230">In some examples, an autonomous vehicle is configured to determine the weight of its payload (e.g., cargo carried on or in the vehicle chassis) without inclusion of dedicated sensors such as load cells, strain gauges, and/or the like. Estimated payload weight may be used by processing logic of the vehicle to, e.g., adjust aspects of vehicle control algorithms, adjust vehicle suspension, adjust motor control (e.g, acceleration curves), automatically determine an amount to bill a delivery customer, to identify a problem such as loss of cargo or presence of unexpected objects, and/or for any other suitable purpose. Payload weight estimation can be particularly useful for a lightweight delivery vehicle, for which the payload mass fraction may be significant.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0231">An automatic payload weight estimation method may include determining total vehicle weight (i.e., including the weight of the payload) and subtracting known vehicle curb weight (i.e., the weight of the unloaded vehicle) to estimate payload weight. Total vehicle weight may be determined in any suitable manner. For example, the vehicle controller may be configured to determine the power input to traction motor(s) and determine vehicle acceleration (e.g., by measuring a change in wheel speed, or by directly measuring acceleration using an accelerometer). Based on the input power and acceleration, and accounting for motor efficiency and any other relevant factors, the vehicle controller can estimate the total weight of the vehicle. A known tare weight of the vehicle is subtracted from the total weight to obtain an estimate of the payload weight.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0232">In addition to motor efficiency, other relevant factors that may be accounted for in the payload weight estimation may include wind resistance, rolling resistance, incline of the surface on which the vehicle is traveling (e.g., uphill, downhill, level, etc.), and/or any other suitable factors. Incline of the travel surface may be determined by using an accelerometer or gyroscope of the vehicle to estimate vehicle pitch angle, by using a GPS reading to determine vehicle elevation changes, and/or by using map data (e.g., in conjunction with GPS or other positional data) to identify elevation gradients in the vehicle's location. In some cases, the payload estimation calculations are simplest when the vehicle is traveling on a level surface, and so the estimate of the incline of the travel surface can be used primarily to identify whether the surface is level (indicating that conditions are good for a payload estimation).</p><p id="p-0233" num="0233">Other measurements that may be used in the estimation of total vehicle weight (i.e., in addition to motor input power) may include braking power required to stop the vehicle and/or to decelerate it by a certain amount, and power generated by a regenerative braking system.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0234">Although the foregoing examples describe methods of estimating payload weight without the presence of dedicated weight sensors, dedicated weight sensors may optionally be included.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0235">e. Fleet Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)</p><p id="p-0236" num="0236">In some examples, one or more wheels of an autonomous vehicle may include pneumatic tires. The vehicle may include pressure sensor(s) configured to sense tire pressure, and a controller of the vehicle may be configured to take certain actions if the sensed tire pressure is too low. For example, the vehicle controller may, in response to a low pressure reading, transmit an error signal, slow vehicle speed, and/or attempt to direct the vehicle to a safe location. In some examples, the sensed tire pressure is periodically or continuously telemetered to another location (e.g., a remote computer, another nearby vehicle, a cloud-based data store, and/or any other suitable location). This can allow for convenient monitoring and maintenance of the vehicle tires, particularly for a fleet of autonomous vehicles.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0237">f. Replaceable Skid Plate Bottom</p><p id="p-0238" num="0238">A replaceable skid plate may be incorporated on an underside of the vehicle (e.g., on a bottom surface of the chassis). A skid plate tends to protect the chassis and/or other vehicle parts, thereby increasing longevity of the vehicle and/or increasing the time between vehicle repairs. The skid plate may be made of metal, plastic, and/or any other suitable materials. The replaceable skid plate may be attached to the vehicle chassis in an easily releasable manner, facilitating removal of a first skid plate and attachment of a new one (e.g., because the first one has been damaged or needs to be inspected or repaired).</p><p id="p-0239" num="0239">g. Rollover Recovery</p><p id="p-0240" num="0240">Autonomous vehicles according to aspects of the present teachings allow for significant articulation of the vehicle linkage(s). In some examples, this articulation can be used to correct the vehicle orientation following an accident or collision. For example, the chassis and/or linkages of the vehicle can be configured to allow for righting the vehicle from a completely inverted state through a combination of coordinated linkage and drivetrain actuation. Such a rollover recovery capability greatly reduces the lost operational time that can otherwise result from minor accidents resulting in rollover, as well as the human time otherwise required to respond to minor accidents.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0241">In some cases, vehicles capable of automatic rollover recovery require no human intervention at all after an accident. For example, an automated vehicle as described herein may have a relatively small size and weight, such that most accidents involving the vehicles will be minor (i.e., not resulting in significant damage to other vehicles, objects, or people, and not rendering the vehicle inoperable once it has been righted). Accordingly, if the vehicle is capable of restoring itself to an upright position following an accident, no action may need to be taken at the accident site.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="2">I. Illustrative Control Methods</heading><p id="p-0242" num="0242">This section describes steps of illustrative methods for controlling an autonomous tiltable vehicle; see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>48</b>-<b>49</b></figref>. Aspects of vehicles described above may be utilized in the method steps described below. Where appropriate, reference may be made to components and systems that may be used in carrying out each step. These references are for illustration, and are not intended to limit the possible ways of carrying out any particular step of the method.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0243">In general, an autonomous vehicle controller determines and/or receives a desired vehicle path. Proper lean to steer ratios are then calculated based on the given speed. Chassis tilt and/or steering are then actuated in parallel accordingly, to maintain the net force vector in line with the median plane of the chassis. Terrain adjustments can be made based on feedback from the measured chassis tilt.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0244">a. Lean-Follows-Steer</p><p id="p-0245" num="0245">In a lean-follows-steer control scheme (LFS), vehicle tilt follows vehicle steering. In other words, the wheels are steered first when entering a turn, and the vehicle chassis tilts automatically in response to the centrifugal force, such that the forces balance and the net force vector due to gravity and centrifugal force remains in line with the median plane of the tilting chassis.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0246"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating steps performed in an illustrative method <b>3500</b> implementing an LFS control scheme, and may not recite the complete process or all steps of the method. Although various steps of method <b>3500</b> are described below and depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref>, the steps need not necessarily all be performed, and in some cases may be performed simultaneously or in a different order than the order shown.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0247">Step <b>3502</b> of method <b>3500</b> includes operating the vehicle (e.g., vehicle <b>100</b>) along a straight path on a level surface. In this situation, the net force vector is substantially equal to the force of gravity, and is aligned with the vehicle chassis.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0248">Step <b>3504</b> of method <b>3500</b> includes causing the wheels of the vehicle to turn using a steering actuator coupled to a steering linkage, thereby imparting a centrifugal force and causing a change in the net force vector on the vehicle. Accordingly, the net force vector is no longer aligned with the median plane of the chassis.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0249">Step <b>3506</b> of method <b>3500</b> includes sensing the misalignment between the median plane of the vehicle and the net force vector due to the centrifugal force and gravity. This step may be carried out by the tilt sensor on board the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0250">Step <b>3508</b> of method <b>3500</b> includes causing the chassis to tilt to compensate for the increased centrifugal force, i.e., aligning the chassis such that the net force vector is in line with the median plane. In this example, a tilt linkage of the vehicle automatically causes the wheels to tilt with the chassis (e.g., to the same degree).</p><p id="p-0251" num="0251">Step <b>3510</b> of method <b>3500</b> optionally includes sensing orientation-dependent information using a sensor coupled to the tilted chassis by a gimbal, such that even after the chassis has been tilted in step <b>3508</b>, the sensor remains in an upright position (e.g., the same position as in step <b>3502</b>). The sensor may comprise, e.g., a LIDAR unit, a radar unit, an optical imager, a thermal imager, and/or any other device configured to sense environmental information in an orientation-dependent manner. The gimbal mount compensates for chassis tilt such that the sensed information is not adversely impacted by vehicle tilt. For example, if the sensor is configured to acquire an image of the vehicle's environment, the acquired image is untilted.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0252">Step <b>3512</b> of method <b>3500</b> includes causing the wheels of the vehicle to return to a neutral position to come out of the turn begun in step <b>3504</b>. As in that step, the wheels are steered using a steering actuator responding to signals from a vehicle control system. This action causes the centrifugal force to be reduced or eliminated, thereby causing another misalignment of the net force vector with respect to the still-leaning chassis.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0253">Step <b>3514</b> of method <b>3500</b> includes causing the chassis to tilt in an upright direction to compensate for the mismatch between the force vector and the median plane, using a tilt actuator commanded by the vehicle's control system.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0254">b. Steer Follows Lean (SFL)</p><p id="p-0255" num="0255">In another illustrative control scheme, vehicle steering follows vehicle tilt. In other words, the vehicle is actively tilted when entering a turn, and in response the wheels naturally steer and/or are caused to steer, such that the forces balance and the net force vector due to gravity and centrifugal force remains in line with the median plane of the tilting chassis. In other words, the chassis tilts first, or at least simultaneously with the wheels turning, and the wheels turn to a determined value that takes into account vehicle speed and tilt angle.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0256">At higher speeds, steering may be in a &#x201c;free-to-caster&#x201d; (FTC) mode, meaning no torque is applied and the wheels are left to move to a steering angle naturally. At lower speeds, steering may be completely controlled by a steering actuator (e.g., a servo motor). A transition zone or range between the lower speeds and the higher speeds, may also be defined, in which steering control is gradually transitioned from full torque to no torque, either linearly or nonlinearly. For example, below approximately 10 miles per hour (mph), wheels of the vehicle may be completely controlled by applying torque from a steering actuator. In this example, above approximately 20 mph the wheels may be completely FTC. Between approximately 10 mph and approximately 20 mph, control is transitioned from full-torque to zero-torque, e.g., using a clutch mechanism or the like. At extremely low speeds (e.g., less than one mph), vehicle tilting may be locked (using, e.g., one of the illustrative tilt-lock devices described herein). These speeds are for illustration only, and any suitable speeds may be selected, depending on desired characteristics, vehicle capabilities, and operating conditions.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0257"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating steps performed in an illustrative method <b>3600</b> implementing an SFL control scheme, and may not recite the complete process or all steps of the method. Although various steps of method <b>3600</b> are described below and depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b></figref>, the steps need not necessarily all be performed, and in some cases may be performed simultaneously or in a different order than the order shown.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0258">As explained above, an SFL control scheme may include three stages, depending on vehicle speed and/or other factors (e.g., vehicle loading). In this example, step <b>3602</b> of method <b>3600</b> includes operating the vehicle (e.g., vehicle <b>100</b>) along a straight path on a level surface at a given speed. In this situation, the net force vector is substantially equal to the force of gravity, and is aligned with the chassis.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0259">Step <b>3604</b> of method <b>3600</b> includes responding causing the chassis to tilt (e.g., using a tilt actuator commanded by the vehicle control system) in a direction opposing the expected centrifugal force that will be caused by the turn and in an amount calculated to at least partially cause the turn to occur. A mismatch will occur between the net force vector (due to centrifugal force and gravity) and the median plane of the chassis.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0260">Step <b>3606</b> of method <b>3600</b> optionally includes sensing orientation-dependent information using a sensor coupled to the tilted chassis by a gimbal, such that even after the chassis has been tilted, the sensor remains in an upright position.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0261">If the speed of the vehicle is below a selected first threshold, then step <b>3608</b> of method <b>3600</b> may include causing the wheels to be steered (e.g., by issuing commands from a controller to a steering actuator) such that the net force vector aligns with the median plane, and the desired turning path is substantially followed. Below the selected first speed threshold, the vehicle may be referred to as operating in a dual control mode (i.e., tilt and steering are both controlled actively).</p><p id="p-0262" num="0262">If the speed of the vehicle is above a selected second threshold, then step <b>3610</b> of method <b>3600</b> may include allowing the wheels to freely caster, i.e., applying zero additional torque to the wheels, thereby permitting the wheels to find their natural positions as a result of the vehicle's tilt. Above the selected second speed threshold, the vehicle may be referred to as operating in a free-to-caster or FTC mode (i.e., only tilt is controlled actively).</p><p id="p-0263" num="0263">If the speed of the vehicle is between the first and second thresholds, then step <b>3612</b> of method <b>3600</b> may include applying a selected amount of torque to the steering system to maintain the turn and at least partially prevent wheel scrub with respect to the support surface. In this transition zone or transition range from full torque to zero torque, the level of torque applied to the steering may be proportional to vehicle speed (e.g., linearly related to speed or nonlinearly related to speed), depending on desired characteristics.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0264">Step <b>3614</b> of method <b>3600</b> includes causing the tilt of the vehicle to return to a neutral (e.g., upright) position to come out of the turn begun in step <b>3604</b>. Depending on speed, as described above, the wheels may be steered more or less actively to maintain alignment of the net force vector.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0265">At very low speeds, e.g., below a third threshold (lower than the first and second thresholds), chassis tilt may be held constant or locked in place, such that only wheel steering may be utilized to achieve a selected vehicle path.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0266">In some examples, aspects of methods <b>3500</b> and <b>3600</b> may be combined, e.g., such that the vehicle follows an LFS scheme when below the first speed threshold and a FTC scheme above the second threshold.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0267">c. Correcting for Terrain</p><p id="p-0268" num="0268">Regardless of the control scheme, vehicles and control systems as described herein may be configured to handle (automatically) terrain changes and minor obstacles, i.e., non-planar travel surfaces.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0269">In general, a vehicle encountering an obstacle under one wheel or the other will be caused to tilt out of its commanded tilt value or range, causing instability of the vehicle. Vehicle stability is maintained and controlled by leaning a chassis of the vehicle relative to a wheel linkage of the vehicle, thereby permitting the wheel linkage to tilt as a result of the obstacle, while maintaining the angle of the chassis with respect to a horizontal plane (e.g., a plane orthogonal to the force of gravity, or the idealized planar travel surface). This is accomplished by maintaining an alignment between the net force vector and the median plane of the chassis, as measured by the tilt sensor(s) of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0270">For example, the vehicle may be traveling either in a straight line or in a turn when an obstacle is encountered by one wheel. In either case, the obstacle initially causes the chassis to tilt out of alignment with the net force vector. The controller of the vehicle compensates for this misalignment by adjusting the tilt angle of the chassis until the net force vector again aligns with the median plane. An initial angle of the chassis with respect to horizontal is maintained by the control system, while a linkage tilt angle is changed based on the terrain. Once the obstacle is overcome (e.g., after the vehicle has passed the obstacle and is again on substantially level terrain), the chassis will tilt again, and the control system will adjust the tilt to compensate, returning to the original configuration.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0271">Terrain compensation may result in difficulty maintaining a desired path. Accordingly, the control system may be configured to selectively apply torque to the steering system to handle the dynamic conditions, even if operating in a mode wherein active steering is not typically used (e.g., a free-to-caster mode).</p><heading id="h-0019" level="2">J. Illustrative Data Processing System</heading><p id="p-0272" num="0272">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>, this example describes a data processing system <b>4000</b> (also referred to as a computer, computing system, and/or computer system) in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.

This type of hardware may perform operations without needing program code <b>4018</b> to be loaded into a memory from a storage device to be configured to perform the operations. For example, processor unit <b>4004</b> may be a circuit system, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a programmable logic device, or some other suitable type of hardware configured (e.g., preconfigured or reconfigured) to perform a number of operations. With a programmable logic device, for example, the device is configured to perform the number of operations and may be reconfigured at a later time. Examples of programmable logic devices include, a programmable logic array, a field programmable logic array, a field programmable gate array (FPGA), and other suitable hardware devices. With this type of implementation, executable instructions (e.g., program code <b>4018</b>) may be implemented as hardware, e.g., by specifying an FPGA configuration using a hardware description language (HDL) and then using a resulting binary file to (re)configure the FPGA.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0292">In another example, data processing system <b>4000</b> may be implemented as an FPGA-based (or in some cases ASIC-based), dedicated-purpose set of state machines (e.g., Finite State Machines (FSM)), which may allow critical tasks to be isolated and run on custom hardware. Whereas a processor such as a CPU can be described as a shared-use, general purpose state machine that executes instructions provided to it, FPGA-based state machine(s) are constructed for a special purpose, and may execute hardware-coded logic without sharing resources. Such systems are often utilized for safety-related and mission-critical tasks.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0293">In still another illustrative example, processor unit <b>4004</b> may be implemented using a combination of processors found in computers and hardware units. Processor unit <b>4004</b> may have a number of hardware units and a number of processors that are configured to run program code <b>4018</b>.

Of course, the bus system may be implemented using any suitable type of architecture that provides for a transfer of data between different components or devices attached to the bus system. System bus <b>4002</b> may include several types of bus structure(s) including memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus or external bus, and/or a local bus using any variety of available bus architectures (e.g., Industrial Standard Architecture (ISA), Micro-Channel Architecture (MSA), Extended ISA (EISA), Intelligent Drive Electronics (IDE), VESA Local Bus (VLB), Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI), Card Bus, Universal Serial Bus (USB), Advanced Graphics Port (AGP), Personal Computer Memory Card International Association bus (PCMCIA), Firewire (IEEE 1394), and Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI)).</p><p id="p-0295" num="0295">Additionally, communications unit <b>4010</b> may include a number of devices that transmit data, receive data, or both transmit and receive data.

This type of door typically does not extend far beyond the footprint of the vehicle when opened, and in some examples does not extend beyond the footprint of the vehicle at all when opened. This saves space and may simplify any determination by the vehicle controller as to whether the door can safely be opened or closed in a given situation.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0301">No known system or device can perform these functions, particularly in an autonomous vehicle. Thus, the illustrative embodiments and examples described herein are particularly useful for autonomous deliver vehicles which are intended to operate without a human operator riding or driving the vehicle.
