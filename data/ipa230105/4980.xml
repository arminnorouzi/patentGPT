level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to the identification of fraud risk ratings for an electronic transaction based on an associated computing device, specifically the identification of the past transaction history for the computing device to identify the number of transaction accounts that have used that computing device for use in fraud modeling and determinations regarding likelihood of risk.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The use of computing devices by consumers to initiate and carry out payment transactions has greatly increased over time. In many instances, consumers may elect to purchase products using their desktop computer, tablet computer, smart phone, television, or other computing device. The use of a computing device can provide a number of benefits, such as convenience by not having to travel to a merchant's physical location, accessibility for products that may not be locally available to the consumer, or anonymity with regards to the product being purchased and the consumer behind the purchase, such as may be beneficial in the purchasing of surprise gifts.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, while anonymity and convenience may be beneficial for genuine consumers, the anonymity provided by using a computing device to initiate and carry out a payment transaction may be taken advantage of by nefarious parties wishing to engage in fraud. In such cases, the fraudster may often choose a computing device that is public or otherwise shared among a large number of users that may conduct payment transactions, such as at a public library, Internet caf&#xe9;, etc. As a result, it may be more difficult for the fraudster to be detected and differentiated among the large number of users. Accordingly, payment transactions conducted using public or shared computing devices may be at a greater risk for fraud.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, there is currently a lack of methods available to payment networks, merchants, and financial institutions in detecting when a computing device used in a payment transaction may be public or otherwise shared by a large number of users. Instead, many financial institutions attempt to increase their ability to identify the consumer behind the transaction as an authorized user of the transaction account being used, such as by the use of one-time passwords, security questions, and other authentication mechanisms. Unfortunately, such methods only seek to authenticate the user themselves, and do not identify the usage of the underlying computing device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there is a need for a technical solution to identify the number of transaction accounts and/or users associated with a computing device for use in fraud modeling for an attempted payment transaction.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides a description of systems and methods for fraud modeling based on shared computing device usage. Such a technological solution as discussed herein may provide for more accurate determinations regarding the likelihood of fraud of a payment transaction, without requiring a consumer to provide additional information by way of authentication and thus maintaining a high level of consumer convenience while protecting account security.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method for fraud modeling based on shared computing device usage includes: storing, in a transaction database of a processing server, a plurality of transaction data entries, wherein each transaction data entry is a structured data set related to a payment transaction including at least a transaction date and/or time, an account identifier, and a device identifier associated with a computing device involved in the related payment transaction; receiving, by a receiving device of the processing server, a transaction message for a payment transaction, wherein the transaction message is formatted based on one or more standards and includes at least a plurality of data elements including at least a first data element configured to store a specific device identifier, a second data element configured to store a primary account number, and one or more additional data elements configured to store additional transaction data; executing, by a querying module of the processing server, a query on the transaction database to identify one or more transaction data entries where the included device identifier corresponds to the specific device identifier stored in the first data element included in the received transaction message; determining, by a determination module of the processing server, a fraud risk rating based on at least a number of unique account identifiers included in the identified one or more transaction data entries over a predetermined period of time and the primary account number stored in the second data element included in the received transaction message; and electronically transmitting, by a transmitting device of the processing server, at least the received transaction message and the determined fraud risk rating to a financial institution associated with the primary account number stored in the second data element included in the received transaction message.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A system for fraud modeling based on shared computing device usage includes: a transaction database of a processing server configured to store a plurality of transaction data entries, wherein each transaction data entry is a structured data set related to a payment transaction including at least a transaction date and/or time, an account identifier, and a device identifier associated with a computing device involved in the related payment transaction; a receiving device of the processing server configured to receive a transaction message for a payment transaction, wherein the transaction message is formatted based on one or more standards and includes at least a plurality of data elements including at least a first data element configured to store a specific device identifier, a second data element configured to store a primary account number, and one or more additional data elements configured to store additional transaction data; a querying module of the processing server configured to execute a query on the transaction database to identify one or more transaction data entries where the included device identifier corresponds to the specific device identifier stored in the first data element included in the received transaction message; a determination module of the processing server configured to determine a fraud risk rating based on at least a number of unique account identifiers included in the identified one or more transaction data entries over a predetermined period of time and the primary account number stored in the second data element included in the received transaction message; and a transmitting device of the processing server configured to electronically transmit at least the received transaction message and the determined fraud risk rating to a financial institution associated with the primary account number stored in the second data element included in the received transaction message.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The scope of the present disclosure is best understood from the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The processing server <b>102</b> may then determine a fraud risk rating for the payment transaction that is based on at least the number of transaction accounts that have used the computing device <b>104</b> in prior payment transactions, as indicated via the identified past payment transactions. In some instances, the determination may take into account the date and/or time of the prior payment transactions. For example, the risk may be greater if a higher number of transaction accounts are used in a shorter period of time, which may indicate a public or shared computing device <b>104</b>. In another example, if several different transaction accounts are used, but over a significant period of time, such as where each transaction account is the only one used for several weeks until a new one is used. In such an example, it may indicate the rotating usage of different transaction accounts by a single consumer <b>106</b>, or the transfer of ownership or possession of the computing device <b>104</b> among consumers <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, the fraud risk rating may take into account additional determinations regarding the potential for fraud, such as geographic location, transaction amount, transaction frequency, and other traditional fraud risk factors that will be apparent to persons having skill in the relevant art.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The processing server <b>102</b> may then forward the transaction message and the fraud risk rating to the issuing institution <b>108</b> associated with the transaction account used in the payment transaction. In some embodiments, the fraud risk rating may be stored in a data element included in the transaction message prior to transmission of the transaction message. The issuing institution <b>108</b> may then authorize or decline the payment transaction based on the fraud risk rating and traditional factors, such as the transaction amount and the transaction account's current balance and/or available credit, etc. The issuing institution <b>108</b> may return an authorization response for the payment transaction to the payment network <b>112</b> (e.g., via the processing server <b>102</b>, if applicable), which may continue processing the payment transaction using traditional methods.

In other embodiments, a public standard may be used, such as the International Organization for Standardization's ISO 8583 standard. The standard may indicate the types of data that may be included, the formatting of the data, how the data is to be stored and transmitted, and other criteria for the transmission of the transaction data to the gateway processor <b>508</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In step <b>528</b>, the gateway processor <b>508</b> may parse the transaction data signal to obtain the transaction data superimposed thereon and may format the transaction data as necessary. The formatting of the transaction data may be performed by the gateway processor <b>508</b> based on the proprietary standards of the gateway processor <b>508</b> or an acquiring financial institution <b>510</b> associated with the payment transaction. The proprietary standards may specify the type of data included in the transaction data and the format for storage and transmission of the data. The acquiring financial institution <b>510</b> may be identified by the gateway processor <b>508</b> using the transaction data, such as by parsing the transaction data (e.g., deconstructing into data elements) to obtain an account identifier included therein associated with the acquiring financial institution <b>510</b>. In some instances, the gateway processor <b>508</b> may then format the transaction data based on the identified acquiring financial institution <b>510</b>, such as to comply with standards of formatting specified by the acquiring financial institution <b>510</b>. In some embodiments, the identified acquiring financial institution <b>510</b> may be associated with the merchant <b>506</b> involved in the payment transaction, and, in some cases, may manage a transaction account associated with the merchant <b>506</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In step <b>530</b>, the gateway processor <b>508</b> may electronically transmit a data signal superimposed with the formatted transaction data to the identified acquiring financial institution <b>510</b>. The acquiring financial institution <b>510</b> may receive the data signal and parse the signal to obtain the formatted transaction data superimposed thereon. In step <b>532</b>, the acquiring financial institution may generate an authorization request for the payment transaction based on the formatted transaction data. The authorization request may be a specially formatted transaction message that is formatted pursuant to one or more standards, such as the ISO 8583 standard and standards set forth by a payment processor used to process the payment transaction, such as a payment network. The authorization request may be a transaction message that includes a message type indicator indicative of an authorization request, which may indicate that the merchant <b>506</b> involved in the payment transaction is requesting payment or a promise of payment from the issuing financial institution <b>502</b> for the transaction. The authorization request may include a plurality of data elements, each data element being configured to store data as set forth in the associated standards, such as for storing an account number, application cryptogram, transaction amount, issuing financial institution <b>502</b> information, etc.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In step <b>534</b>, the acquiring financial institution <b>510</b> may electronically transmit the authorization request to a transaction processing server <b>512</b> for processing. The transaction processing server <b>512</b> may be comprised of one or more computing devices as part of a payment network configured to process payment transactions. In some embodiments, the authorization request may be transmitted by a transaction processor at the acquiring financial institution <b>510</b> or other entity associated with the acquiring financial institution. The transaction processor may be one or more computing devices that include a plurality of communication channels for communication with the transaction processing server <b>512</b> for the transmission of transaction messages and other data to and from the transaction processing server <b>512</b>. In some embodiments, the payment network associated with the transaction processing server <b>512</b> may own or operate each transaction processor such that the payment network may maintain control over the communication of transaction messages to and from the transaction processing server <b>512</b> for network and informational security.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In step <b>536</b>, the transaction processing server <b>512</b> may perform value-added services for the payment transaction. Value-added services may be services specified by the issuing financial institution <b>502</b> that may provide additional value to the issuing financial institution <b>502</b> or the consumer <b>504</b> in the processing of payment transactions. Value-added services may include, for example, fraud scoring, transaction or account controls, account number mapping, offer redemption, loyalty processing, etc. For instance, when the transaction processing server <b>512</b> receives the transaction, a fraud score for the transaction may be calculated based on the data included therein and one or more fraud scoring algorithms and/or engines. In some instances, the transaction processing server <b>512</b> may first identify the issuing financial institution <b>502</b> associated with the transaction, and then identify any services indicated by the issuing financial institution <b>502</b> to be performed. The issuing financial institution <b>502</b> may be identified, for example, by data included in a specific data element included in the authorization request, such as an issuer identification number. In another example, the issuing financial institution <b>502</b> may be identified by the primary account number stored in the authorization request, such as by using a portion of the primary account number (e.g., a bank identification number) for identification.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In step <b>538</b>, the transaction processing server <b>512</b> may electronically transmit the authorization request to the issuing financial institution <b>502</b>. In some instances, the authorization request may be modified, or additional data included in or transmitted accompanying the authorization request as a result of the performance of value-added services by the transaction processing server <b>512</b>. In some embodiments, the authorization request may be transmitted to a transaction processor (e.g., owned or operated by the transaction processing server <b>512</b>) situated at the issuing financial institution <b>502</b> or an entity associated thereof, which may forward the authorization request to the issuing financial institution <b>502</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In step <b>540</b>, the issuing financial institution <b>502</b> may authorize the transaction account for payment of the payment transaction. The authorization may be based on an available credit amount for the transaction account and the transaction amount for the payment transaction, fraud scores provided by the transaction processing server <b>512</b>, and other considerations that will be apparent to persons having skill in the relevant art. The issuing financial institution <b>502</b> may modify the authorization request to include a response code indicating approval (e.g., or denial if the transaction is to be denied) of the payment transaction. The issuing financial institution <b>502</b> may also modify a message type indicator for the transaction message to indicate that the transaction message is changed to be an authorization response. In step <b>542</b>, the issuing financial institution <b>502</b> may transmit (e.g., via a transaction processor) the authorization response to the transaction processing server <b>512</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In step <b>544</b>, the transaction processing server <b>512</b> may forward the authorization response to the acquiring financial institution <b>510</b> (e.g., via a transaction processor). In step <b>546</b>, the acquiring financial institution may generate a response message indicating approval or denial of the payment transaction as indicated in the response code of the authorization response, and may transmit the response message to the gateway processor <b>508</b> using the standards and protocols set forth by the gateway processor <b>508</b>. In step <b>548</b>, the gateway processor <b>508</b> may forward the response message to the merchant <b>506</b> using the appropriate standards and protocols. In step <b>550</b>, assuming the transaction was approved, the merchant <b>506</b> may then provide the products purchased by the consumer <b>504</b> as part of the payment transaction to the consumer <b>504</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, once the process <b>500</b> has completed, payment from the issuing financial institution <b>502</b> to the acquiring financial institution <b>510</b> may be performed. In some instances, the payment may be made immediately or within one business day. In other instances, the payment may be made after a period of time, and in response to the submission of a clearing request from the acquiring financial institution <b>510</b> to the issuing financial institution <b>502</b> via the transaction processing server <b>502</b>. In such instances, clearing requests for multiple payment transactions may be aggregated into a single clearing request, which may be used by the transaction processing server <b>512</b> to identify overall payments to be made by whom and to whom for settlement of payment transactions.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some instances, the system may also be configured to perform the processing of payment transactions in instances where communication paths may be unavailable. For example, if the issuing financial institution is unavailable to perform authorization of the transaction account (e.g., in step <b>540</b>), the transaction processing server <b>512</b> may be configured to perform authorization of transactions on behalf of the issuing financial institution <b>502</b>. Such actions may be referred to as &#x201c;stand-in processing,&#x201d; where the transaction processing server &#x201c;stands in&#x201d; as the issuing financial institution <b>502</b>. In such instances, the transaction processing server <b>512</b> may utilize rules set forth by the issuing financial institution <b>502</b> to determine approval or denial of the payment transaction, and may modify the transaction message accordingly prior to forwarding to the acquiring financial institution <b>510</b> in step <b>544</b>. The transaction processing server <b>512</b> may retain data associated with transactions for which the transaction processing server <b>512</b> stands in, and may transmit the retained data to the issuing financial institution <b>502</b> once communication is reestablished. The issuing financial institution <b>502</b> may then process transaction accounts accordingly to accommodate for the time of lost communication.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In another example, if the transaction processing server <b>512</b> is unavailable for submission of the authorization request by the acquiring financial institution <b>510</b>, then the transaction processor at the acquiring financial institution <b>510</b> may be configured to perform the processing of the transaction processing server <b>512</b> and the issuing financial institution <b>502</b>. The transaction processor may include rules and data suitable for use in making a determination of approval or denial of the payment transaction based on the data included therein. For instance, the issuing financial institution <b>502</b> and/or transaction processing server <b>512</b> may set limits on transaction type, transaction amount, etc. that may be stored in the transaction processor and used to determine approval or denial of a payment transaction based thereon. In such instances, the acquiring financial institution <b>510</b> may receive an authorization response for the payment transaction even if the transaction processing server <b>512</b> is unavailable, ensuring that transactions are processed and no downtime is experienced even in instances where communication is unavailable. In such cases, the transaction processor may store transaction details for the payment transactions, which may be transmitted to the transaction processing server <b>512</b> (e.g., and from there to the associated issuing financial institutions <b>502</b>) once communication is reestablished.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, transaction processors may be configured to include a plurality of different communication channels, which may utilize multiple communication cards and/or devices, to communicate with the transaction processing server <b>512</b> for the sending and receiving of transaction messages. For example, a transaction processor may be comprised of multiple computing devices, each having multiple communication ports that are connected to the transaction processing server <b>512</b>. In such embodiments, the transaction processor may cycle through the communication channels when transmitting transaction messages to the transaction processing server <b>512</b>, to alleviate network congestion and ensure faster, smoother communications. Furthermore, in instances where a communication channel may be interrupted or otherwise unavailable, alternative communication channels may thereby be available, to further increase the uptime of the network.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, transaction processors may be configured to communicate directly with other transaction processors. For example, a transaction processor at an acquiring financial institution <b>510</b> may identify that an authorization request involves an issuing financial institution <b>502</b> (e.g., via the bank identification number included in the transaction message) for which no value-added services are required. The transaction processor at the acquiring financial institution <b>510</b> may then transmit the authorization request directly to the transaction processor at the issuing financial institution <b>502</b> (e.g., without the authorization request passing through the transaction processing server <b>512</b>), where the issuing financial institution <b>502</b> may process the transaction accordingly.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The methods discussed above for the processing of payment transactions that utilize multiple methods of communication using multiple communication channels, and includes fail safes to provide for the processing of payment transactions at multiple points in the process and at multiple locations in the system, as well as redundancies to ensure that communications arrive at their destination successfully even in instances of interruptions, may provide for a robust system that ensures that payment transactions are always processed successfully with minimal error and interruption. This advanced network and its infrastructure and topology may be commonly referred to as &#x201c;payment rails,&#x201d; where transaction data may be submitted to the payment rails from merchants at millions of different points of sale, to be routed through the infrastructure to the appropriate transaction processing servers <b>512</b> for processing. The payment rails may be such that a general purpose computing device may be unable to properly format or submit communications to the rails, without specialized programming and/or configuration. Through the specialized purposing of a computing device, the computing device may be configured to submit transaction data to the appropriate entity (e.g., a gateway processor <b>508</b>, acquiring financial institution <b>510</b>, etc.) for processing using this advanced network, and to quickly and efficiently receive a response regarding the ability for a consumer <b>504</b> to fund the payment transaction.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Computer System Architecture</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a computer system <b>600</b> in which embodiments of the present disclosure, or portions thereof, may be implemented as computer-readable code.
