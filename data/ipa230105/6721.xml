The multi-link devices may establish different links using these different radios over different bands and different channels. In some embodiments, these multi-link devices may communicate simultaneously with each other over these different links. For example, if the device <b>104</b> and the access point <b>106</b> are both multi-link devices, the device <b>104</b> and the access point <b>106</b> may communicate with each other over multiple links simultaneously. The device <b>104</b> may transmit messages to the access point <b>106</b> over one link while the access point <b>106</b> transmits messages to the device <b>104</b> over another link. Although the radios in the device <b>104</b> or the access point <b>106</b> communicate over different bands or channels, the radios in the device <b>104</b> or the radios in the access point <b>106</b> may still interfere with one another due to their physical proximity to each other. For example, because the radios in the device <b>104</b> are close to one another, power leakage from one radio may interfere with another one of the radios.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The device <b>104</b> and/or the access point <b>106</b> measure the interference between two radios and take remedial action if the interference exceeds a threshold, impacting performance. For example, the device <b>104</b> and/or the access point <b>106</b> may repeatedly narrow a transmission beam width of a radio until the interference caused by that radio falls below the threshold. Additionally, the device <b>104</b> and/or the access point <b>106</b> may physically tilt the radio and/or reduce a transmission power of the radio. In this manner, the interference caused by the radio is reduced, which improves the performance of the device <b>104</b> and/or the access point <b>106</b> in particular embodiments.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example multi-link device <b>200</b> of the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

The radios <b>206</b> operate over different bands and different channels. For example, the radio <b>206</b>A may use a frequency that is different from the radio <b>206</b>B. In some embodiments, the radios <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B are WiFi radios that communicate over different bands such as the 2.4 gigahertz band and the 5 gigahertz band. The multi-link device <b>200</b> may establish links simultaneously using the radios <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B. The multi-link device <b>200</b> may then communicate messages over both links simultaneously. For example, if the multi-link device <b>200</b> is the access point <b>106</b> in the system <b>100</b>, then the access point <b>106</b> may use the radios <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B to establish two links with the device <b>104</b> simultaneously.

Alternatively or additionally, the access point <b>106</b> may transmit messages to the device <b>104</b> using both radios <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B simultaneously.

For example, the radio <b>206</b>A may transmit messages using a beam <b>208</b>A, and the radio <b>206</b>B may receive messages over a beam <b>208</b>B that was formed by a transmitting device. Although the beams <b>208</b>A and <b>208</b>B may use different bands or channels, due to the physical proximity of the radios <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B, the beams <b>208</b>A and <b>208</b>B may interfere with one another. For example, power leakage or spectrum leakage may occur between the beams <b>208</b>A and <b>208</b>B, which may negatively impact the transmission or reception of messages using the beams <b>208</b>A and <b>208</b>B.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The multi-link device <b>200</b> measures an interference <b>210</b> between the beams <b>208</b>A and <b>208</b>B in any suitable manner. In some embodiments, the multi-link device <b>200</b> measures a signal strength over the radio <b>206</b>B or the beam <b>208</b>B. If the signal strength drops, it may indicate that the beam <b>208</b>A is interfering (e.g., by power leakage or spectrum leakage) with the beam <b>208</b>B. The amount that the signal strength drops may be proportional to the level of interference <b>210</b>. In certain embodiments, the multi-link device <b>200</b> monitors or samples activity (e.g., signal strength) of an auxiliary radio over a pin <b>216</b> of the multi-link device <b>200</b>. The pin <b>216</b> may be a general purpose input/output pin. If the signal strength of the auxiliary radio drops, it may indicate that interference is occurring. The amount that the signal strength drops may be proportional to the level of interference <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The multi-link device <b>200</b> compares the interference <b>210</b> with an interference threshold <b>212</b> to determine whether the measured interference <b>210</b> is at an acceptable level. If the interference <b>210</b> meets or exceeds the interference threshold <b>212</b>, the multi-link device <b>200</b> takes remedial action to reduce the interference <b>210</b>. For example, the multi-link device <b>200</b> may narrow a width of the beam <b>208</b>A or the beam <b>208</b>B to reduce the interference <b>210</b>. The multi-link device <b>200</b> may then compare the reduced interference <b>210</b> with the interference threshold <b>212</b> to determine if the reduced interference <b>210</b> falls below the interference threshold <b>212</b>. The multi-link device <b>200</b> may narrow the width of the beam <b>208</b>A or the beam <b>208</b>B again until the interference <b>210</b> is reduced below the interference threshold <b>212</b>. By reducing the width of the beam <b>208</b>A or the beam <b>208</b>B the multi-link device <b>200</b> reduces the spectrum leakage or power leakage caused by the beam <b>208</b>A or the beam <b>208</b>B, which reduces the interference <b>210</b>. For example, if the radio <b>206</b>A is transmitting messages by forming the beam <b>208</b>A, the multi-link device <b>200</b> may reduce the width of the beam <b>208</b>A to reduce the interference <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the multi-link device <b>200</b> compares the width of the beam <b>208</b>A or the beam <b>208</b>B to a beam width threshold <b>214</b> after the width of the beam <b>208</b>A or the beam <b>208</b>B has been reduced. The beam width threshold <b>214</b> indicates a minimum beam width below which the width of the beams <b>208</b>A or <b>208</b>B should not fall. After reducing the width of the beam <b>208</b>A or the beam <b>208</b>B, the multi-link device <b>200</b> determines if the width falls below the beam width threshold <b>214</b>. If the width of the beam <b>208</b>A or the beam <b>208</b>B falls below the beam width threshold <b>214</b>, the multi-link device <b>200</b> incrementally increases the width of the beam <b>208</b>A or the beam <b>208</b>B until the width of the beam <b>208</b>A or the beam <b>208</b>B meets or exceeds the beam width threshold <b>214</b>. In this embodiment, the multi-link device <b>200</b> produces a beam <b>208</b> with a width that exceeds the beam width threshold <b>214</b> but causes an interference <b>210</b> that falls below the interference threshold <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In particular embodiments, after the multi-link device <b>200</b> narrows the beam width, the multi-link device <b>200</b> determines whether the narrowed beam width reduces a number of devices within line of sight of the multi-link device <b>200</b> below a device threshold <b>218</b>. If the narrowed beam width reduces the number of devices below the device threshold <b>218</b>, the multi-link device <b>200</b> increases the beam width until the number of devices meets or exceeds the device threshold <b>218</b>. In this manner, the multi-link device <b>200</b> does not narrow the beam width so much that the multi-link device <b>200</b> cannot use the beams <b>208</b> to effectively communicate with other devices.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In certain embodiments, after the multi-link device <b>200</b> determines an appropriate beam width, the multi-link device <b>200</b> sets that beam width for the entire multi-link operation of the multi-link device <b>200</b>.
