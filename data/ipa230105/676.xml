A significant challenge that most therapeutic agents face is their inability to be delivered to the specific area in an effective manner. In traditional therapeutic agent delivery systems such as oral ingestion (e.g., solid or liquid forms), inhalants, or intravascular injection, the therapeutic agent is distributed systemically through the body via the circulatory, pulmonary, or lymphatic system. For most therapeutic agents, only a small portion of the agent reaches the specific area or diseased tissue to be affected, such as in chemotherapy where a substantial portion (e.g., about 99%) of the therapeutic agent administered to a patient does not reach the tumor site.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In contrast to traditional systemic delivery systems, targeted therapeutic agent delivery seeks to concentrate the agent in the area or tissues of interest while reducing the relative concentration of the agent in the remaining tissues. The goal of a targeted therapeutic agent delivery system is to prolong, localize, target and have a protected therapeutic agent interaction with the diseased tissue (specific part of the body). Some diseases, however, are difficult to treat with currently available therapies and/or require administration of drugs to anatomical regions to which access is difficult to achieve. A patient's eye is a prime example of a difficult-to-reach anatomical region, and many ocular diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma, are difficult to treat with many of the currently available therapies.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Over the last several decades a multitude of approaches involving both therapeutic agent formulation and delivery system development have been undertaken to address these ocular diseases. Despite significant advances in the development of therapeutic agents, the currently available devices and systems for delivery of the therapeutic agents are limited to two primary routes of administration: 1) topical eye drops, and 2) intravitreal needle injection. Both of these administration options, while effective if regimens are strictly maintained, ultimately fail in providing long-term curative outcomes for patients, primarily due to deficiencies in maintaining localization of the therapeutic agent at the treatment site of the eye and a lack of compliance by the patient in administration of the therapeutic agent. Accordingly, improved methods of ocular therapeutic agent delivery are required to address the shortcomings of topical eye drops and intravitreal injections.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In various embodiments, a method is provided that comprises receiving, at a controller of a therapeutic agent release and delivery device, a first command signal for delivery of a dose of a therapeutic agent based on a dosing time window; upon receipt of the first command signal, the controller determines whether one or more compliance conditions are satisfied; when the one or more conditions are not satisfied, the controller determines whether the dosing time window is still active based on a therapy regimen; when the dosing time window is not still active, the controller skips delivery of the dose of the therapeutic agent and records the skip as a negative compliance event; and when the one or more conditions are satisfied, the controller initiate a release and delivery protocol that commands a signal generator to generate and send a second command signal causing a capacitor or one or more circuits to deliver an actuation signal causing one or more therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms to open and release the dose of the therapeutic agent from one or more reservoirs.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the first command signal is received by the controller from an algorithm or data table stored in the controller or memory of the therapeutic agent delivery device.

Introduction</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The following disclosure describes systems and methods for on-demand delivery (active delivery) of a therapeutic agent from an eye mounted device. Various embodiments of systems and/or methods described herein are directed toward control methods, timing and algorithms for programmed targeted delivery of one or multiple therapeutic agents (different or same types). As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;targeted&#x201d; or &#x201c;targeted delivery&#x201d; refers to a technique of delivering a therapeutic agent to a subject in a localized manner that increases a concentration of the therapeutic agent at a treatment site of the subject relative to areas outside of the treatment site. As used herein, the term &#x201c;controlled&#x201d; or &#x201c;controlled delivery&#x201d; refers to a technique of delivering a therapeutic agent to a subject locally or systemically at a predetermined rate for a specified period of time. As used herein, the term &#x201c;therapeutic agent&#x201d; or &#x201c;agent&#x201d; comprises any desired pharmaceutical agent or mixture of individual pharmaceutical agents or the like, for the administration of one or more active agents to a region of a patient. In various embodiments, the devices or systems are designed to be placed on a surface (e.g., a corneal or scleral surface) of the eye for targeted and controlled delivery of a therapeutic agent to a treatment site of an eye. The devices or systems comprise reservoir(s) housing a therapeutic agent in one or more physical forms including aqueous (liquid), gel, dry (powder), or other combinations thereof. The reservoir(s) provide a means for temporary storage of the therapeutic agent prior to release and delivery to a treatment site. In some embodiments, the release and delivery of the therapeutic agent is actively, passively, or a combination thereof, controlled by one or more mechanisms to achieve fully customizable targeted therapeutic agent delivery regimes that drastically increase residence time of the therapeutic agent in the region of interest (e.g., the sclera, outer cornea, posterior segment, etc.) from about 30 seconds to greater than 30 minutes when compared to topical administration such as eye drops.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A problem associated with conventional systems and devices for targeted ocular therapeutic agent delivery (i.e., 1) topical eye drops and 2) intravitreal needle injection), is compliance and customized delivery profiles. For example, conventional systems and devices for targeted ocular therapeutic agent delivery ultimately fail in providing long-term curative outcomes for patients, primarily due to a lack of compliance, and assistive agent administration technologies that help patients achieve compliance are needed. Moreover, conventional systems and devices rely on patient assisted procedures (e.g., eye drops) or out-patient procedures (e.g., needle injections) with no active control of dosage or delivery, and thus lack the ability to implement patient-specific treatment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a diagram depicting topical, injection, and active drug delivery modalities. Compared to conventional agent administration approaches, the active delivery is ideally suited to maintaining physiologically relevant concentrations in the therapeutic window. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows a diagram depicting topical, injection, and active drug delivery modalities with a dynamic therapeutic window. Compared to conventional agent administration approaches, active delivery is the only method capable of maintaining physiologically relevant concentrations in conditions with a time-varying therapeutic window.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">To address these problems, the present invention is directed to devices or systems that have a reservoir of therapeutic agent and one or more therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms for on-demand delivery of the therapeutic agent to a target region such as the vitreous humor. In some embodiments, the devices or systems provide the on-demand delivery of the therapeutic agent using an open control system or open-loop system where the output signal or condition is neither measured nor fed back for comparison with the input signal or system set point. For example, a burst or periodic release of a therapeutic agent from the one or more therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms can be triggered by a command signal. In other embodiments, the devices or systems provide the on-demand delivery of the therapeutic agent using a closed control system or closed-loop system (feedback control) where an open loop system is used as the forward path but one or more feedback loops or paths are included between the output signal and the input signal. For example, a burst or periodic release of a therapeutic agent from one or more therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms can be triggered based on one or more parameters obtained from one or more sensors. As used herein, when an action is &#x201c;triggered by&#x201d; or &#x201c;based on&#x201d; something, this means the action is triggered or based at least in part on at least a part of the something.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">One illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure comprises: receiving, at a controller of a therapeutic agent release and delivery device, a first command signal for delivery of a dose of a therapeutic agent based on a dosing time window; upon receipt of the first command signal, the controller determines whether one or more compliance conditions are satisfied; and when the one or more conditions are satisfied, the controller initiateS a release and delivery protocol that commands a signal generator to generate and send a second command signal causing a capacitor or one or more circuits to deliver an actuation signal causing one or more therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms to open and release the dose of the therapeutic agent from one or more reservoirs.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Another illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure comprises: monitoring, at a controller of a therapeutic agent release and delivery device, a physiological parameter via one or more sensors connected to a target tissue; determining, by the controller, whether the physiological parameter is abnormal; and when the physiological parameter is abnormal, initiating, by the controller, a release and delivery protocol that commands a signal generator to generate and send a first command signal causing a capacitor or one or more circuits to deliver an actuation signal causing one or more therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms to open and release a dose of a therapeutic agent from one or more reservoirs.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Another illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure comprises: obtaining, by a controller of a therapeutic agent release and delivery device, one or more parameters set by a health care provider; monitoring, at the controller, a physiological parameter via one or more sensors connected to a target tissue; determining, by the controller, whether the physiological parameter is abnormal based on the one or more parameters set by the health care provider; when the physiological parameter is abnormal, obtaining, by the controller, a therapy regimen specific for a patient based on the one or more parameters, where the therapy regimen includes therapeutic agent classes, recommended dosing, and dosing time windows; determining, by the controller, whether the therapy regimen should be adjusted based on the monitoring of the physiologic parameter; when the therapy regimen should be adjusted, adjusting, by the controller, the therapy regimen based on: (i) the one or more parameters, and (ii) the monitoring of the physiologic parameter; and initiating, by the controller, a release and delivery protocol that commands a signal generator to generate and send a first command signal causing a capacitor or one or more circuits to deliver an actuation signal causing one or more therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms to open and release a dose of at least one therapeutic agent from one or more reservoirs, where the release and delivery protocol is selected by the controller based on the adjusted therapy regimen.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Advantageously, these approaches allow for on-demand therapeutic agent delivery capable of achieving fully customizable drug release regimes from first-order constant release profiles to on-demand pulsatile release (e.g., burst, periodic, or continuous), which delivers acceptable concentrations of agent to intraocular tissue safely, while minimizing the systemic exposure to the agent.

The device <b>200</b> includes a polymeric substrate <b>205</b> comprising one or more reservoirs <b>210</b> and one or more therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms <b>215</b>. The polymeric substrate <b>205</b> may be formed of polyimide, liquid crystal polymer, parylene, polyether ether ketone, polyethylene terephthalate, poly(methyl methacrylate), polyurethane, rigid gas permeable fluorosilicone acrylate, a silicon-based polymer, a silicone acrylate, cyclic olefin co-polymer (COP/COC), a hydrogel, or a combination thereof. The polymeric substrate <b>205</b> has a shape and sufficient flexibility for mounting to the contour of the tissue such as the eye. In certain embodiments, the shape is a semi-circle shape. In other embodiments, the shape is a circle or donate shape (e.g., the shape of a contact lens), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In various embodiments, the one or more reservoirs <b>210</b> are integrated with or formed within the one or more layers of the polymer. The one or more reservoirs <b>210</b> may comprise a holding chamber <b>220</b> for a therapeutic agent <b>225</b> and an egress <b>230</b> for release of the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> from the holding chamber <b>220</b>. The one or more reservoirs <b>210</b> are compatible with various physical forms of therapeutic agents including aqueous (liquid), gel, dry (powder), or other combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the one or more reservoirs <b>210</b> provide a means for temporary storage of one or more types of therapeutic agents <b>225</b> to allow for on-demand release and delivery of the therapeutic agents at a programmed time with a controlled rate thereby providing a therapeutic effect on the eye via transscleral absorption. In some embodiments, each reservoir <b>210</b> holds a single type of therapeutic agent <b>225</b> (same or different from other reservoirs). Type of therapeutic agent as used herein refers to the chemical make-up of the pharmaceutical agent or mixture of individual pharmaceutical agents or the like, the dose of the pharmaceutical agent or mixture of individual pharmaceutical agents or the like, or the combination of the chemical make-up and the dose. In other embodiments, each reservoir <b>210</b> holds multiple types of therapeutic agents <b>225</b> (same or different from other reservoirs). In other embodiments, a first type of therapeutic agent <b>225</b> is disposed within a first subset of the plurality of reservoirs <b>210</b> and a second type of therapeutic agent <b>225</b> is disposed within a second subset of the plurality of reservoirs <b>215</b>. The one or more reservoirs <b>210</b> may have a volume from 0.01 nL to 100 &#x3bc;L, for example from 0.01 nL to 10 &#x3bc;L or about 1.0 &#x3bc;L, and stores a known quantity or volume of therapeutic agent. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; and &#x201c;about&#x201d; are defined as being largely but not necessarily wholly what is specified (and include wholly what is specified) as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. In any disclosed embodiment, the term &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; or &#x201c;about&#x201d; may be substituted with &#x201c;within [a percentage] of&#x201d; what is specified, where the percentage includes 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 percent. The one or more reservoirs <b>210</b> may be lined with a passive, hermetic, insulator, and/or inert coating such as a dielectric (e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), or other approved agent-contacting material.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In various embodiments, the device <b>200</b> achieves release of the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> from the one or more reservoirs <b>210</b> to the tissue via the one or more therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms <b>215</b>. In some embodiments, the one or more therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms <b>215</b> are active devices or a combination of active and passive devices. In some embodiments, the one or more reservoirs <b>210</b> comprises the holding chamber <b>220</b> for the therapeutic agent <b>225</b>, the egress <b>230</b>, and the active devices or combination of active and passive devices that temporarily blocks passage of the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> from the holding chamber <b>220</b> through the egress <b>230</b>. In some embodiments, a single therapeutic agent delivery mechanism <b>215</b> is provided for each of the one or more reservoirs (same or different mechanism provide for each reservoir). In other embodiments, a plurality of therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms <b>215</b> are provided for each of the one or more reservoirs (same or different mechanisms provide for each reservoir). In other embodiments, a single therapeutic agent delivery mechanism <b>215</b> is provided for some of the one or more reservoirs, while a plurality of therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms <b>215</b> are provided for others of the one or more reservoirs (same or different mechanism(s) provide for each reservoir). While the arrangement of the therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms, reservoirs, and therapeutic agents are described herein in particular detail with respect to several described embodiments, it should be understood that other arrangements have been contemplated without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, different arrangements of the therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms, reservoirs, and therapeutic agents are contemplated herein such that the release and delivery of a therapeutic agent(s) is targeted both temporally and spatially to a surface of the tissue (e.g., the scleral surface of the eye) where optimal therapeutic agent transfer into the tissue may occur.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the one or more therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms <b>215</b> is active. As used herein, &#x201c;active&#x201d; means that an external stimulus is being applied to cause the opening/closing of the mechanism for release of the therapeutic agent. For example, the device <b>200</b> may achieve on-demand drug release through electronic control of at least one valve (therapeutic agent delivery mechanism <b>215</b>) that is physically coupled to the one or more reservoirs <b>210</b> within the device <b>200</b>. In certain embodiments, a circuit is formed on the polymeric substrate <b>205</b>, and the circuit comprises a current source and at least one valve (the therapeutic agent delivery mechanism <b>215</b>) such that a stimulus may be applied to open/close the at least one valve. A single reservoir may contain several &#x201c;valves&#x201d; which can be activated at selected times to increase the effective surface area available for diffusion to the tissue surface. This increases the effective dose provided at a given time. Alternatively, valves may be activated over time thereby maintaining a constant effective therapeutic dosage level over time. Alternatively, multiple discrete reservoirs with valves may be implemented, each with a discrete volume of drug for discretized bolus delivery.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The valves may be single use and opened on-demand electronically to allow therapeutic agent within the reservoir to pass through the valve opening towards the tissue, e.g., the scleral surface. Alternatively, the valves may be multi-use and opened/closed on-demand electronically to allow therapeutic agent within the reservoir to pass through the valve opening towards the tissue, e.g., the scleral surface. The valve opening action initiates therapeutic agent release into the thin post-device tear film located between the device and the sclera. The distance between the valve opening and the sclera is filled by the tear film (&#x3c;20 &#x3bc;m), providing a short distance for a therapeutic agent to diffuse to the scleral surface. The combination of a thin tear film, subtarsal device placement and preferential therapeutic agent release to the scleral surface provides a quasi-static environment that promotes an increased therapeutic agent residence time (&#x3e;30 minutes vs &#x2dc;30 seconds for topical administration) and greater availability of therapeutic agent at the scleral surface, thus maximizing transscleral absorption and posterior segment bioavailability.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In certain embodiments, the therapeutic agent delivery mechanism <b>215</b> includes an active polymer device (or device constructed of a similar material). For example, an active polymer device may be used as a part of the control release mechanism to provide controlled release of the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> in constant doses over long periods, in accordance with first-order constant release profiles, or in accordance with on-demand pulsatile signals/commands. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent may be encapsulated or provided behind a polymer membrane (e.g., encapsulated or closed off within the reservoir by a polymer layer that acts as a valve). The polymer membrane may be an environmentally-controlled device with the ability to undergo a physical or chemical behavioral change in response to an external stimulus. For example, a temperature or pH change may be used to trigger the behavioral change of the polymer but other stimuli, such as ultrasound, ionic strength, redox potential, electromagnetic radiation, and chemical or biochemical agents, may be used. Types of behavioral change can include transitions in solubility, hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance, and conformation. Upon receiving the stimuli and undergoing the behavior change, the environmentally-controlled device may release the therapeutic agent from the reservoir(s). The polymer for the environmentally-controlled device may include hydrogels, micelles, polyplexes, polymer-drug conjugates, or combinations thereof. Hydrogels are hydrophilic (co)polymeric networks capable of imbibing large amounts of water or biological fluids. Physical or covalent crosslinks may render hydrogels insoluble in water. Various hydrogels can be engineered in accordance with aspects of the present invention to respond to numerous stimuli.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In certain embodiments, the therapeutic agent delivery mechanism <b>215</b> includes an active metal device (or device constructed of a similar material). For example, an active metal device may be used as a part of the control release mechanism to provide controlled release of the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> in constant doses over long periods, in accordance with first-order constant release profiles, or in accordance with on-demand pulsatile signals/commands. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent may be encapsulated or provided behind a metallic film (e.g., encapsulated or closed off within the reservoir by a metal layer that acts as a valve). Therapeutic agent release may be activated electronically through application of a potential or low-level voltage stimulus to a metallic thin film comprising the valve. In some embodiments, the thin film forms a seal on a side of the reservoir, which may be positioned against the tissue (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). The metallic film undergoes electrodissolution when a potential is applied under presence of the environmental fluid (e.g., a tear film). The release mechanism may be described through the following equilibrium equations (1) Au+2Cl&#x2212;&#x21c4;(AuCl<sub>2</sub>&#x2212;)ads+e and (2) (AuCl<sub>2</sub>&#x2212;)ads&#x2192;AuCl<sub>2</sub>&#x2212; (soln) with the rate limiting step being the activated desorption of the gold complex from the surface.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, gold is used as the metal film material because it is easily deposited and patterned, has a low reactivity with other substances and resists spontaneous corrosion in many solutions over the entire pH range. Gold has also been shown to be a biocompatible material. However, the presence of a small amount of chloride ion, as is naturally found in tear fluid, creates an electric potential region which favors the formation of soluble gold chloride complexes. Holding the anode potential in this corrosion region between 0.8 and 1.2 V, for example at about 1.0 V, enables reproducible gold dissolution of films having a thickness of between about 50 nm and about 500 nm. Potentials below this region are too low to cause appreciable corrosion, whereas potentials above this region result in gas evolution and formation of a passivating gold oxide layer that causes corrosion to slow or stop. Other metals such as copper or titanium tend to dissolve spontaneously under these conditions or do not form soluble materials on application of an electric potential. Although gold is used in some embodiments, it should understood that other materials may be used to achieve similar electrodissolution-mediated agent release.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent delivery mechanism <b>215</b> includes a combination of one or more passive devices and one or more active devices. In certain embodiments, the therapeutic agent delivery mechanism <b>215</b> is a passive polymer device (or device constructed of a similar material) and an active polymer or metal device. For example, an active polymer or metal device may be used as a part of the control release mechanism to provide controlled release of the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> from the one or more reservoirs <b>210</b>. The therapeutic agent <b>225</b> may be encapsulated or provided behind a polymeric or metallic layer (e.g., encapsulated or closed off within the reservoir by a polymeric or metallic layer that acts as a valve). Once the active polymer or metal device is opened via external stimulus, the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> may be released out of the holding chamber <b>220</b> through the egress <b>230</b> into a passive polymer device such a polymeric matrix or hydrogel. Once the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> passes through the passive polymer device (e.g., via diffusion or osmotic pump), the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> may be released and delivered to a surface of a target tissue (e.g., the scleral surface). Alternatively, a passive polymer device may be used as a part of the control release mechanism to provide controlled release of the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> from the one or more reservoirs <b>210</b>. The therapeutic agent <b>225</b> may be encapsulated or provided behind a polymeric layer (e.g., encapsulated or closed off within the reservoir by a polymeric layer that acts as a valve). Once the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> passes through the passive polymer device (e.g., via diffusion or osmotic pump), the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> may be released out of the holding chamber <b>220</b> through the egress <b>230</b> into an active polymer or metal device such as encapsulated or provided behind a polymeric or metallic layer. Once the active polymer or metal device is opened via external stimulus, the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> may be released and delivered to a surface of a target tissue (e.g., the scleral surface).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent delivery mechanism <b>215</b> includes an iontophoretic electrode system to facilitate delivery of the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> into the tissue. Iontophoresis is a local non-invasive technique in which an electric field is applied to enhance ionized therapeutic agent penetration into tissue. In certain embodiments, an iontophoretic electrode system such as an Ag&#x2014;Ag/Cl electrode system is used for its ability to maintain local pH levels and eliminate soluble bulk electrode species. However, the iontophoretic electrode system may comprise other electrode materials such as platinum, platinum/iridium (PtIr) and alloys thereof, carbon, zinc/zinc chloride, gold, other suitable insoluble and inert metals that resist electrodissolution in solution over a given pH range, and combinations thereof. The anodal chamber contains an ionizable therapeutic agent D+ with its counter-ion A&#x2212; and NaCl (tear film). Application of an electric potential to a electrode (e.g., an anode) causes a current to flow through the circuit. At the electrode solution interface, the Ag+ and Cl&#x2212; react to form insoluble AgCl which is deposited on the electrode surface. Electromigration transports the cations, including the ionizable agent D+, from the anodal compartment and into the tissue. At the same time, endogenous anions, primarily Cl&#x2212;, move into the anodal compartment. In the cathodal chamber, Cl&#x2212; ions are released from an electrode (e.g., a cathode) surface and electroneutrality requires that either an anion is lost from the cathodal chamber or that a cation enters the cathodal chamber from the tissue. The extent and penetration depth of iontophoretic delivery is related to the electric field and the duration of application.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the iontophoretic electrode system includes one or more chambers or compartments <b>235</b> (e.g., an anode chamber) that comprise a first iontophoresis electrode <b>240</b> (e.g., an anode) for transport of the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> from a release point of the active devices or combination of active and passive devices into a target tissue (e.g., the vitreous humor) via electromigration. In certain embodiments, the first iontophoresis electrode <b>240</b> is located under the one or more reservoirs <b>210</b> formed within the polymeric substrate <b>205</b>. Moreover, at least a portion of the one or more chambers or compartments <b>235</b> is exposed to an environment external to the polymeric substrate <b>205</b>. The one or more chambers or compartments <b>235</b> are capable of receiving the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> from the reservoir upon release of the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> via the active or combination of active and controlled release devices. The therapeutic agent <b>225</b> may be ionizable, and a counter ion (the counter ion has a charge opposite that of the therapeutic agent <b>225</b>) may be disposed within the one or more reservoirs <b>210</b> or the one or more chambers or compartments <b>235</b>. In embodiments in which multiple types of therapeutic agents are used, multiple types of counter ions may also be used (e.g., a first type of therapeutic agent may be ionized and a first type of counter ion has a charge opposite that of the first type of therapeutic agent and a second type of therapeutic agent may be ionized and the second type of counter ion has a charge opposite that of the second type of therapeutic agent. The iontophoretic electrode system further includes one or more chambers or compartments <b>245</b> (e.g., a cathode chamber) that comprise a second iontophoresis electrode <b>250</b> (e.g., a cathode) for maintaining electroneutrality within the tissue (e.g., the sclera). In some embodiments, one or more chambers or compartments <b>245</b> are formed within the one or more layers of polymer and at least a portion of one or more chambers or compartments <b>245</b> is exposed to an environment external to the polymeric substrate <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the device <b>200</b> may further include an overmold polymeric layer <b>255</b> formed around substantially an entirety of the polymeric substrate <b>205</b>.

The overmold polymeric layer <b>255</b> may be formed of polymethylmethacrylate, polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate, a hydrogel, a silicon-based polymer, a silicone elastomer, or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the overmold polymeric layer <b>255</b> has a water content between 30% and 50%, for example about 45% water content. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent delivery mechanism <b>215</b> is a combination of active device(s) (e.g., a polymeric or metallic active device and the iontophoretic electrode system) and the overmold polymer layer <b>255</b> (a polymeric passive device). The therapeutic agent <b>225</b> may be encapsulated or provided behind the polymeric or metallic active device (e.g., encapsulated or closed off within the reservoir by a metallic layer that acts as a valve). Once the polymeric or metallic active device is opened via external stimulus and dissolution, the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> may be released out of the holding chamber <b>220</b> of the reservoir <b>210</b> through the egress <b>230</b> into the overmold polymeric layer, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>. Once the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> passes through the passive polymer device (e.g., via diffusion or osmotic pump), the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> may be released and delivered to a surface of a target tissue (e.g., the scleral surface) via the iontophoresis electrode system including the first electrode <b>240</b> and the second electrode <b>250</b>. This mechanism for release and delivery of the therapeutic agent may be used to achieve agent release kinetics similar to passive load-and-release drug-eluting approaches albeit with a fully-programmable and customizable active release and delivery initiation.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In other embodiments, the device <b>200</b> includes exposed access points or openings in the overmold polymeric layer <b>255</b> (e.g., hydrogel), which exposes a surface of the one or more reservoirs <b>210</b>.

Upon release of the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> from the chamber <b>220</b>, the therapeutic agent <b>225</b> permeates directly into the post-device tear film or tissue with facilitated delivery from the iontophoresis electrode system including the first electrode <b>240</b> and the second electrode <b>250</b>. This mechanism for release and delivery may be used to achieve alternative release kinetics with fully-programmable and customizable active release and delivery similar to topical application of eye drops however with the benefit of drastically increased residence times, increased bioavailability and minimal drug loss.

In some embodiments, dosing of multiple therapeutic agents discretely or in combination is enabled through electronically controlled agent release and delivery (e.g., via one or more therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms). The agent release and delivery may be programmed to follow one or more delivery profiles that can be specified by an administrator (e.g., a health care provider) to adhere to one or more dosing regimens. For example, standard dosing schedules currently used in clinical practice for the treatment of glaucoma are shown in Table 1. This is only for illustrative purposes as other diseases/conditions may require their own specific dosing schedules and are contemplated by the present embodiments. Each drug class targets a unique mechanism of action in the treatment of glaucoma (e.g., aqueous humour production vs ocular drainage), and the drug classes can be used individually (monotherapy) or in combination (e.g., bi-, tri-, quad-therapy) when the biological effects of multiple agents are understood to be additive. The specific times suggested may be tailored to the individual user so long as the health care provider recommended dosing regimen is adhered to by the user. Therefore customized or programmed release and delivery profiles can be specified for a single therapy regimen such as delivery of beta-blockers up to two times each day, which may then be executed by the processes described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Recommended</entry><entry>Exemplary Device</entry></row><row><entry>Drug Class</entry><entry>Dosing</entry><entry>Programmed Regimen</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Prostaglandin</entry><entry>One drop per day</entry><entry>7 PM</entry></row><row><entry>analogues</entry></row><row><entry>Beta-blockers</entry><entry>Up to two drops</entry><entry>10 AM and (7 PM based</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>per day</entry><entry>on provider assessment)</entry></row><row><entry>Alpha-agonists</entry><entry>Two or three drops</entry><entry>10 AM, 7 PM, and (2 PM based</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>per day</entry><entry>on provider assessment)</entry></row><row><entry>Carbonic</entry><entry>Two or three drops</entry><entry>10 AM, 7 PM, and (2 PM based</entry></row><row><entry>anhydrase</entry><entry>per day</entry><entry>on provider assessment)</entry></row><row><entry>inhibitors</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">Additionally or alternatively, customized or programmed release and delivery profiles can be specified for a multi-therapy regimen.

In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent delivery is automatically performed by the system without requiring any intervention by the patient or health care provider. These techniques are capable of controlling the timing and rate of therapeutic agent delivery, sustaining the duration of therapeutic activity, and targeting the delivery of a therapeutic agent to a specific region or tissue of the patient. This can eliminate the need for the patient to schedule a subsequent visit to the health care provider for administration of a therapeutic agent or self-administering an agent, thereby providing a convenient route of administration and potentially increasing patient compliance. In these embodiments, the system (e.g., system <b>200</b> as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may include one or more therapeutic agent delivery devices (e.g., device <b>100</b> as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>), which includes a polymeric substrate comprising one or more reservoirs, one or more therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms, and a controller.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0065">In step <b>405</b>, the controller of the therapeutic agent release and delivery system receives a first command signal for the delivery of a therapeutic agent. The first command signal may be received as a wireless or wired command signal or manually by a manipulatable device (&#x201c;manipulandum&#x201d;) such as a user button. In some embodiments, the first command signal may be received by the controller from a remote device such as a health care provider terminal, a patient controlled device such as a smart phone, a biosensor such as an intraocular pressure sensor, an independent implantable controller, etc. In other embodiments, the first command signal may be received by the controller from an internal component such as an algorithm or data table stored in the controller or memory of the therapeutic agent delivery device. For example, a treatment protocol may be stored in an algorithm or data table, which includes instructions for generating a first command signal to cause the delivery of a therapeutic agent in accordance with a therapy regimen, e.g., a predetermined schedule or table that specifies when a programmed dosing time window is opened/closed.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0066">In step <b>410</b>, upon receipt of the first command signal, the controller determines whether one or more compliance conditions are satisfied. In some embodiments, the one or more compliance conditions are stored in the controller or memory of the therapeutic agent delivery device. The one or more compliance conditions may include positioning of the device in contact with the target tissue. For example, the controller may determine whether the therapeutic agent delivery device is in contact with the target tissue using a contact sensor.

In some embodiments, the controller may determine whether the dosing time window is still active by comparing a present time to the time boundaries of the dosing time window (e.g., the start and close times) in the stored therapy regimen. When the dosing time window is not still active, the process continues to step <b>420</b>, where the controller skips delivery of the dosage of the therapeutic agent and records the skip as a negative compliance event. In some embodiments, skipping the delivery of the dosage of the therapeutic agent means that the controller does not initiate a release and delivery protocol to send a signal that releases and delivers the therapeutic agent from one or more reservoirs. Instead, the controller records the skipping of delivery of the dosage of the therapeutic agent as a negative compliance event for compliance tracking purposes. The recording of the negative compliance may be stored in the controller or memory of the therapeutic agent delivery device for record keeping/tracking, and subsequent retrieval and reporting.

In various embodiments, the detecting and monitoring of physiological parameters includes the measurement and recording of intraocular pressure (IOP<sub>actual</sub>) from one or more intraocular pressure sensors that are in contact with the fluid or tissue of the eye. The controller may record the date and time of all detections and therapeutic agent release and delivery, and stores segments of the data for further analysis and processing. Physiological data recording may be continuous or triggered by detection, responsive stimulation, scheduled time of the day, magnet (used by the patient to indicate an event), and/or other events as programmed by the health care team. The detection algorithms in the therapeutic agent release and delivery system may be computationally efficient and optimized in order to perform real-time detection within the constraints of currently available technology, such as limited power and processing capabilities. In some embodiments, the parameters for the detection algorithms are configurable and may be selected by the health care team to adjust the sensitivity, specificity, and latency of the detection. In certain embodiments, the detection algorithms detect spikes and rhythmic activity occurring in the physiological parameters, identify changes in both amplitude and frequency of the physiological parameters, identify changes in the physiological parameters without regard for frequency, and/or detect changes in physiological parameters depending on time resolution of the physiological parameter measurement data. These detection algorithms are efficient (requiring low computational power), and can be configured to detect physiological events within a fraction of a second or to detect more subtle changes in amplitude, frequency, power, blood flow, inflammation, fluidic pressure, etc. that occur over several seconds.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0071">In step <b>510</b>, the controller of the therapeutic agent release and delivery system determines whether the detected physiological parameter is abnormal.

In certain embodiments, the target or baseline values for intraocular pressure (IOP<sub>Target</sub>) are recorded in the controller or memory of the therapeutic agent delivery device. In some embodiments, once monitoring begins on the patient, the values recorded for the physiological parameter may be compared respectively to the target or baseline values to determine the extent of change in the physiological parameter. The determined extent of change for the physiological parameter may then be compared to predetermined threshold values or ranges of values set for the physiological parameter to determine whether abnormal physiology is detected.

In various embodiments, the health care provider will provide to the controller a therapeutic agent treatment hierarchy that include multiple therapeutic agents, a maximum daily dosage for each therapeutic agent in the therapeutic agent treatment hierarchy, and one or more target profiles for one or more physiological parameters based on the patient's current medical state and treatment goals.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0077">In step <b>610</b>, the controller detects and monitors one or more physiological parameters via one or more sensors connected to the target tissue based on the one or more parameters obtained in step <b>605</b>. The one or more sensors may be on-board the device, external of the patient, or implanted within the patient. In various embodiments, the detecting and monitoring of one or more physiological parameters includes the measurement and recording of intraocular pressure (IOP<sub>actual</sub>) from one or more intraocular pressure sensors that are in contact with the fluid or tissue of the eye. The controller may record the date and time of all detections and therapeutic agent release and delivery, and stores segments of the data for further analysis and processing. Physiological data recording may be continuous or triggered by detection, responsive stimulation, scheduled time of the day, magnet (used by the patient to indicate an event), and/or other events as programmed by the health care team. The detection algorithms in the therapeutic agent release and delivery system may be computationally efficient and optimized in order to perform real-time detection within the constraints of currently available technology, such as limited power and processing capabilities. In some embodiments, the parameters for the detection algorithms are configurable and may be selected by the health care team to adjust the sensitivity, specificity, and latency of the detection. In certain embodiments, the detection algorithms detect spikes and rhythmic activity occurring in the physiological parameters, identify changes in both amplitude and frequency of the physiological parameters, identify changes in the physiological parameters without regard for frequency, and/or detect changes in physiological parameters depending on time resolution of the physiological parameter measurement data. These detection algorithms are efficient (requiring low computational power), and can be configured to detect physiological events within a fraction of a second or to detect more subtle changes in amplitude, frequency, power, blood flow, inflammation, fluidic pressure, etc. that occur over several seconds.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0078">In step <b>615</b>, the controller of the therapeutic agent release and delivery system determines whether the detected one or more physiological parameters are abnormal based on the one or more parameters obtained in step <b>605</b>. In various embodiments, the target or baseline values for each of the desired physiological parameters are obtained and recorded for a patient (e.g., obtained and recorded in step <b>605</b>). In some embodiments, the target or baseline values may be obtained from a health care provider and recorded in the controller or memory of the therapeutic agent delivery device. In certain embodiments, the target or baseline values for intraocular pressure (IOP<sub>Target</sub>) are recorded in the controller or memory of the therapeutic agent delivery device. In some embodiments, once monitoring begins on the patient, the values recorded for the physiological parameter may be compared respectively to the target or baseline values to determine the extent of change in the physiological parameter. The determined extent of change for the physiological parameter may then be compared to predetermined threshold values or ranges of values set for the physiological parameter to determine whether abnormal physiology is detected. For example, a physiology such as the intraocular pressure may be determined to be abnormal when the extent of change between the IOP<sub>Target </sub>and the IOP<sub>Actual </sub>exceeds or falls below the predetermined threshold value set or remains within our outside of a predetermined threshold value range set, and the intraocular pressure may be determined to be normal when the extent of change between the IOP<sub>Target </sub>and the IOP<sub>Actual </sub>is the opposite of abnormal, e.g., falls below or exceeds the predetermined threshold value set or remains within our outside of a predetermined threshold value range set.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0079">In other embodiments, once monitoring begins on the patient, the values recorded for the physiological parameter may be compared respectively to the target or baseline values to determine a magnitude and direction of deviation error in the physiological parameter. The determined magnitude and direction of deviation error for the physiological parameter may then be compared to predetermined threshold values or ranges of values set for the physiological parameter to determine whether abnormal physiology is detected. For example, a physiology such as the intraocular pressure may be determined to be abnormal when the magnitude and direction of deviation error for the IOP<sub>Actual </sub>from the IOP<sub>Target </sub>exceeds or falls below the predetermined threshold value set or remains within our outside of a predetermined threshold value range set, and the intraocular pressure may be determined to be normal when the magnitude and direction of deviation error for the IOP<sub>Actual </sub>from the IOP<sub>Target </sub>is the opposite of abnormal, e.g., falls below or exceeds the predetermined threshold value set or remains within our outside of a predetermined threshold value range set.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0080">When the detected one or more physiological parameter are determined to be abnormal, the process proceeds to step <b>620</b>. When the one or more physiological parameters are determined to be normal, the process proceeds to step <b>610</b> to monitor the one or more physiological parameters through-out the remainder of the therapy. When multiple physiological parameters are being monitored, in some embodiments, the determination of an overall abnormal or normal status may be determined based on a combination of physiological parameters being abnormal or normal. For example, if two of three physiological parameters are determined to be abnormal then the overall status may be determined to be abnormal. In other embodiments, the determination of an overall abnormal or normal status may be determined based on a combination of physiological parameters and a hierarchical nature of the physiological parameters. For example, if a primary physiological parameter is normal but one secondary physiological parameter is abnormal then the overall status may be determined to be normal; however, if a primary physiological parameter is normal but two secondary physiological parameters are abnormal then the overall status may be determined to be abnormal or if a primary physiological parameter is abnormal but two secondary physiological parameters are normal then the overall status may be determined to be abnormal.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0081">In step <b>620</b>, the controller obtains a therapy regimen specific for the patient based on the one or more parameters obtained in step <b>605</b>. The therapy regimen includes therapeutic agent classes, recommended dosing, and dosing time windows. In some embodiments, the therapy regimen is provided by the healthcare provider as the one or more parameters. In other embodiments, the therapy regimen is generated by the controller using the one or more parameters obtained in step <b>605</b>. In some embodiments, the therapy regimen is a revised therapy regimen that the controller has generated by adjusting therapeutic agent classes, recommended dosing, and/or dosing time windows obtained from an initial therapy regimen received from the healthcare provider. In step <b>625</b>, the controller determined whether the therapy regimen should be adjusted. In some embodiments, a determination algorithm uses the physiologic parameter data, patient health factors, and personalization factors to generate therapy regimen updates (agent type/combination, agent dosage (amount), and/or timing of dosing) to determine whether the therapy regimen should be adjusted. The health factors may include medications currently taken by the patient, hormone levels, sleep cycle, etc. The personalization factors may include a device wearing schedule, patient travel, patient activity, etc. When the therapy regimen is to be adjusted, the process proceeds to step <b>630</b>. When the therapy regimen is not to be adjusted, the process proceeds to step <b>635</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0082">In step <b>630</b>, the controller adjusts the therapy regimen based on: (i) the one or more parameters obtained in step <b>605</b> and (ii) the physiologic parameter data. In some embodiments, the controller adjusts the therapy regimen based on: (i) the one or more parameters obtained in step <b>605</b>, (ii) the physiologic parameter data, and (iii) the patient health factors, the personalization factors, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the controller utilize the additional factors (e.g., the health and/or personalization factors) to apply weights to known drug pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic behavior. For example, if a patient is overweight, has larger aqueous humor volume, or uses blood thinners the impact of regimen changes to specific drugs can be weighted differently to achieve optimum titration of individual agents. This optimization of the therapy regimen may be accomplished via constrained-optimization algorithms, adaptive neural networks, machine learning optimization or other techniques. It is expected that the system may also interact with external hardware (e.g., a charging station) which will enable off-board processing if required for these optimizations. It should also be understood the frequency of optimization may be dependent on the quantity and frequency of the physical parameter data that the system receives from the one or more sensors. The adjusted or updated therapy regimen is stored in the controller or memory of the therapeutic agent delivery device.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0083">In step <b>635</b>, the controller initiates a release and delivery protocol that commands the signal generator to generate and send a first command signal causing the capacitor or the one or more circuits to deliver an actuation signal such as a voltage, potential, current, optical signal, or ultrasonic signal causing one or more therapeutic agent delivery mechanisms to open and release at least one therapeutic agent from one or more reservoirs. In some embodiments, the release and delivery protocol further includes commanding the signal generator to generate and send a second command signal causing the capacitor or the one or more circuits to deliver an actuation signal such as a voltage, potential, current, optical signal, or ultrasonic signal causing the iontophoretic electrode system to deliver the at least one therapeutic agent into a target tissue using an electric field. In some embodiments, the release and delivery protocol is selected based on the stored therapy regimen (e.g., an initial therapy regimen or an updated/adjusted therapy regimen). For example, the release and delivery protocol determines the therapeutic agent type and dose to be released for a present situation based on the stored therapy regimen, and commands the signal generator to open reservoirs that store the determined therapeutic agent type and dose and optionally activate electrodes of the iontophoretic electrode system associated with the opened reservoirs to deliver the determined therapeutic agent type and dose into a target tissue using the electric field. The present situation is the detection of the abnormal physiological parameter. In some embodiments, the present situation further includes the measured extent of change for the physiological parameter or the measured magnitude and direction of deviation for the physiological parameter, and the release and delivery protocol initiated by the controller may determine the therapeutic agent type and dose to be released specific for the measured extent of change for the physiological parameter or the measured magnitude and direction of deviation for the physiological parameter. Accordingly, the controller is capable of adjusting the dose (amount) and type of therapeutic agent delivered proportional to extent of change for the physiological. parameter or the measured magnitude and direction of deviation for the physiological parameter</p><p id="p-0088" num="0084">In step <b>640</b>, once the therapeutic agent is delivered to the patient, the process proceeds to step <b>610</b> to detect and monitor the one or more physiological parameters via one or more sensors connected to the target tissue through-out the remainder of the therapy. The controller may further refine control over the course of hours to days depending on time-resolution of physiological parameter measurement data provided to the system. Optionally, the controller records the release and delivery of the dosage of the therapeutic agent. In some embodiments, prior to recording the delivery, the controller confirms release and delivery of the dosage of the therapeutic agent. The confirming may include receiving an acknowledgment from the signal generator of generating and sending the first command signal and optionally the second command single. Additionally or alternatively, the confirming may include receiving a signal from one or more sensors that detect release and optionally delivery of the dosage of the therapeutic agent. In some embodiments, the controller records the release and delivery of the dosage of the therapeutic agent for tracking purposes. The recording of the delivery may be stored in the controller or memory of the therapeutic agent delivery device for record keeping/tracking, and subsequent retrieval and reporting. Once the controller records the release and delivery of the dosage of the therapeutic agent, the process returns to step <b>505</b> to detect and monitor the physiological parameter via one or more sensors connected to the target tissue through-out the remainder of the therapy.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0085">While the invention has been described in detail, modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan.
