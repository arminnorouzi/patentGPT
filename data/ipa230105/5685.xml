The second circuit <b>16</b> includes a full-wave rectifier <b>41</b>, a smoothing circuit <b>42</b>, a constant current circuit <b>43</b>, and a photocoupler <b>44</b>. When a voltage difference is generated between the first line <b>21</b> and the second line <b>22</b>, the photocoupler <b>44</b> is turned from off to on via the full-wave rectifier <b>41</b>, the smoothing circuit <b>42</b>, and the constant current circuit <b>43</b>. When the photocoupler <b>44</b> is turned on, the transistor <b>31</b> located in the first circuit <b>12</b> is short-circuited between G-S, and the transistor <b>31</b> is turned from on to off. As a result, the first circuit <b>12</b> is cut off.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the operation of the welding detection device <b>10</b> for detecting welding in the main relay <b>3</b><i>a </i>when the power supply to be connected to the load <b>2</b> is switched from the commercial power supply A to the independent power supply B will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a timing chart showing the timings at which the main relay <b>3</b><i>a, </i>the first relay <b>12</b><i>a, </i>and the second relay <b>12</b><i>b </i>operate. The control unit <b>5</b> controls the first relay <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the second relay <b>12</b><i>b </i>to be in a closed state from an open state after controlling the main relay <b>3</b><i>a </i>to be in an open state from a closed state. As a result, the first circuit <b>12</b> is connected to the power line L<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown by the broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, if welding occurs in the main relay <b>3</b><i>a, </i>the direct current from the first circuit power supply <b>14</b> flows from the third line <b>23</b> to the detection element <b>30</b> through the main relay <b>3</b><i>a. </i>As a result, the detection element <b>30</b> outputs a low signal, and a notification means such as an alarm notifies the welding.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">If no welding occurs in the main relay <b>3</b><i>a, </i>the direct current from the first circuit power supply <b>14</b> does not flow to the detection element <b>30</b>. Accordingly, the detection element <b>30</b> remains in the off state, and the high signal is continuously output from the detection element <b>30</b>. As a result, the control unit <b>5</b> determines that no welding occurs in the main relay <b>3</b><i>a, </i>controls the main relay <b>4</b><i>a </i>to be in the closed state from the open state, and switches the power supply to be connected to the load <b>2</b> from the commercial power supply A to the independent power supply B. Note that, in practice, regarding the main relay <b>3</b><i>b </i>as well, the power supply to be connected to the load <b>2</b> is switched after the welding detection device <b>10</b> determines that no welding occurs in the main relay <b>3</b><i>b </i>by a similar method.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Here, when no welding occurs in the main relay <b>3</b><i>b </i>and a voltage of 100 V is applied to the power line L<b>1</b> with reference to the neutral line N, a voltage difference of AC100 V is generated between the first line <b>21</b> and the second line <b>22</b>. Thus, when the first circuit <b>12</b> is connected to the power line L<b>1</b>, the AC100 V current may flow backward from the second line <b>22</b> side to the third line <b>23</b> of the first circuit <b>12</b> as shown by the two-dot chain line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The current may further flow to the detection element <b>30</b>, resulting in erroneous detection of welding in the main relay <b>3</b><i>a </i>by the welding detection device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In order to prevent such erroneous detection, when a voltage difference of 100 V is generated between the first line <b>21</b> and the second line <b>22</b>, the first circuit <b>12</b> is cut off by the second circuit <b>16</b>. Specifically, when a voltage difference (here, for example, a voltage difference of 100 V) is generated between the first line <b>21</b> and the second line <b>22</b>, the photocoupler <b>44</b> of the second circuit <b>16</b> is turned on. Then, the turning on of the photocoupler <b>44</b> forces the transistor <b>31</b> to be turned on from off, so that the first circuit <b>12</b> is cut off. As a result, the current of AC100 V can be limited from flowing into the detection element <b>30</b>. That is, the detection element <b>30</b> is kept in the off state and continuously outputs a high signal, and thereby any erroneous detection of welding in the main relay <b>3</b><i>a </i>by the welding detection device <b>10</b> can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">If no voltage difference is generated between the first line <b>21</b> and the second line <b>22</b>, the current of AC100 V does not flow backward from the second line <b>22</b> side to the first circuit <b>12</b>. Thus, as described above, the first circuit <b>12</b> is used to detect welding in the main relay <b>3</b><i>a </i>based on whether or not the direct current from the first circuit power supply <b>14</b> has flowed to the detection element <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The operation of the welding detection device <b>10</b> when switching the power supply to be connected to the load <b>2</b> from the independent power supply B to the commercial power supply A is the same as that in the case of welding detection in the main relay <b>3</b><i>a, </i>except for the main relays for detecting welding (in this case, the main relays <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>), and thereby description thereof will be omitted.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">One embodiment of a welding detection device according to one aspect of the present invention has been described above, but the present invention is not limited to the above embodiment, and various modifications can be made without departing from the gist of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the above embodiment, welding in the main relay <b>3</b><i>a </i>is detected by a current flowing through the detection element <b>30</b>, but for example, the welding detection device <b>10</b> may be configured so that welding in the main relay <b>3</b><i>a </i>can be detected by the absence of a current flowing through the detection element <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the above embodiment, a configuration is illustrated in which the power supply switching device <b>1</b> switches the power supply for supplying AC power to the load <b>2</b> from one of the commercial power supply A and the independent power supply B to the other, but the power supplies switched by the power supply switching device <b>1</b> are not limited to those in the above embodiment.
