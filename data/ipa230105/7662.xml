Targeting requirements for lower target BLER of URLLC traffic, a new Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) table has been defined in 3rd Generation Partner Project (3GPP) New Radio (NR) Release 15. For the purpose of supporting more demanding Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communication (URLLC) traffics in 5G system, for example, with higher reliability (e.g., a target BLER is 10{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}-6) or with lower delay (e.g., 0.5-1 ms), in 3GPP NR Release 16, a DCI signaling can indicate a scheduled PDSCH is of Low Priority or High Priority, where the Low Priority corresponds to URLLC traffics, while the High Priority corresponds to eMBB traffics. When a low-priority transmission overlaps with a high-priority transmission in time domain, the high-priority one is performed, while the low-priority one is dropped. In NR system, a number of Resource Element(s) (RE(s)) occupied by uplink control information on an uplink physical-layer data channel can be dynamically adjusted by an uplink scheduling signaling, so as to meet different requirements of different application scenarios on the transmission reliability of the physical layer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A Work Item (WI) of URLLC enhancement in NR Release 17 was approved at 3GPP RAN #86 Plenary, where multiplexing of services of different intra-User Equipment (UE) priorities is a focus to be studied.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Inventors have found through researches that when a scheduling signaling corresponding to control information appears after a scheduling signaling of a physical-layer data channel, the demand of the control information may not be taken into account in the scheduling signaling of the physical-layer data channel.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the radio protocol architecture for a first communication node (UE, gNB or an RSU in V2X) and a second communication node (gNB, UE or an RSU in V2X), or between two UEs is represented by three layers, which are a layer 1, a layer 2 and a layer 3, respectively. The layer 1 (L1) is the lowest layer and performs signal processing functions of various PHY layers. The L1 is called PHY <b>301</b> in the present application. The layer 2 (L2) <b>305</b> is above the PHY <b>301</b>, and is in charge of a link between a first communication node and a second communication node, as well as two UEs via the PHY <b>301</b>. L2 <b>305</b> comprises a Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer <b>302</b>, a Radio Link Control (RLC) sublayer <b>303</b> and a Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) sublayer <b>304</b>. All the three sublayers terminate at the second communication node. The PDCP sublayer <b>304</b> provides multiplexing among variable radio bearers and logical channels. The PDCP sublayer <b>304</b> provides security by encrypting a packet and provides support for a first communication node handover between second communication nodes. The RLC sublayer <b>303</b> provides segmentation and reassembling of a higher-layer packet, retransmission of a lost packet, and reordering of a data packet so as to compensate the disordered receiving caused by HARQ. The MAC sublayer <b>302</b> provides multiplexing between a logical channel and a transport channel. The MAC sublayer <b>302</b> is also responsible for allocating between first communication nodes various radio resources (i.e., resource block) in a cell. The MAC sublayer <b>302</b> is also in charge of HARQ operation. The Radio Resource Control (RRC) sublayer <b>306</b> in layer 3 (L3) of the control plane <b>300</b> is responsible for acquiring radio resources (i.e., radio bearer) and configuring the lower layer with an RRC signaling between a second communication node and a first communication node device. The radio protocol architecture of the user plane <b>350</b> comprises layer 1 (L1) and layer 2 (L2). In the user plane <b>350</b>, the radio protocol architecture for the first communication node and the second communication node is almost the same as the corresponding layer and sublayer in the control plane <b>300</b> for physical layer <b>351</b>, PDCP sublayer <b>354</b>, RLC sublayer <b>353</b> and MAC sublayer <b>352</b> in L2 layer <b>355</b>, but the PDCP sublayer <b>354</b> also provides a header compression for a higher-layer packet so as to reduce a radio transmission overhead. The L2 layer <b>355</b> in the user plane <b>350</b> also includes Service Data Adaptation Protocol (SDAP) sublayer <b>356</b>, which is responsible for the mapping between QoS flow and Data Radio Bearer (DRB) to support the diversity of traffic.

device <b>450</b>, at the first communication device <b>410</b>, a higher layer packet from the core network is provided to a controller/processor <b>475</b>. The controller/processor <b>475</b> provides a function of the L2 layer. In the transmission from the first communication device <b>410</b> to the first communication device <b>450</b>, the controller/processor <b>475</b> provides header compression, encryption, packet segmentation and reordering, and multiplexing between a logical channel and a transport channel, and radio resources allocation to the second communication device <b>450</b> based on various priorities. The controller/processor <b>475</b> is also responsible for retransmission of a lost packet and a signaling to the second communication device <b>450</b>.

The transmitting processor <b>416</b> performs coding and interleaving so as to ensure an FEC (Forward Error Correction) at the second communication device <b>450</b>, and the mapping to signal clusters corresponding to each modulation scheme (i.e., BPSK, QPSK, M-PSK, M-QAM, etc.). The multi-antenna transmitting processor <b>471</b> performs digital spatial precoding, including codebook-based precoding and non-codebook-based precoding, and beamforming on encoded and modulated symbols to generate one or more spatial streams. The transmitting processor <b>416</b> then maps each spatial stream into a subcarrier. The mapped symbols are multiplexed with a reference signal (i.e., pilot frequency) in time domain and/or frequency domain, and then they are assembled through Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) to generate a physical channel carrying time-domain multi-carrier symbol streams. After that the multi-antenna transmitting processor <b>471</b> performs transmission analog precoding/beamforming on the time-domain multi-carrier symbol streams.

In frequency domain, a physical layer data signal and a reference signal are de-multiplexed by the receiving processor <b>456</b>, wherein the reference signal is used for channel estimation, while the data signal is subjected to multi-antenna detection in the multi-antenna receiving processor <b>458</b> to recover any the second communication device-targeted spatial stream. Symbols on each spatial stream are demodulated and recovered in the receiving processor <b>456</b> to generate a soft decision.
