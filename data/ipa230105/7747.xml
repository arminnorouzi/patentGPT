Indeed, the novel methods and systems described herein may be embodied in a variety of other forms. Furthermore, various omissions, substitutions, and changes in the form of the methods and systems described herein may be made without departing from the scope of protection.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The headings provided herein are for convenience only and do not necessarily affect the scope or meaning of the claims. Disclosed herein are example configurations and embodiments relating to control circuits for visual (e.g., illuminated) indicators used with data storage devices.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A new industry-wide standard for solid-state storage devices (e.g., solid state drives (SSDs)), titled &#x201c;Enterprise and Datacenter Standard Form Factor Pin and Signal Specification,&#x201d; SFF-TA-1009, Rev. 3.0, Mar. 19, 2021, includes a new requirement of having an illuminated bi-color status indicator as part of the form factor of the devices. A novel circuit is disclosed herein for controlling the operation of the bi-color indicator specified, which may be implemented as a pair of light emitting diodes (LEDs). The new circuit provides that each color of the indicator (or illuminating element of the indicator, e.g., LED) is illuminated according to a control signal at a pin (e.g., LED_PinA<b>10</b>) of the drive connector. A source voltage of 12V is also supplied to the circuit at another pin of the drive connector. The specification further requires a current limiting resistor as part of the circuit to limit overcurrent. In an embodiment, the circuit is limited to not more than 20 mA current draw at the LED drive control pin of the drive connector.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The required indicator states are shown in the table at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and are based on the voltage presented at the drive control signal pin. When the drive control pin is asserted, meaning driven at a higher voltage (e.g., 3.3 volts), the first indicator is illuminated, and the second indicator is not. When the drive control pin is de-asserted, meaning driven at a lower voltage (e.g., 1.0 volts), the second indicator is illuminated, and the first indicator is not. In a high impedance state, when the drive control pin is not driven, neither indicator is illuminated.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments of a novel circuit are disclosed that meet the new requirements of the Form Factor Specification, including the states of the illuminated status indicator(s), make use of a minimum number of discrete components, are robust, and can be implemented at a low cost. Additionally, in some described embodiments, a first lead of the indicator control circuit is coupled to a common anode of the first and second status indicators. The embodiments are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Example Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a novel control circuit <b>100</b> for controlling the illumination states of a pair of visual indicators, according to a first embodiment. While LEDs are shown and discussed herein, it is not intended to be limiting and any other indicators are also within the scope of the disclosure. In an implementation, the circuit <b>100</b> fulfills the requirements of controlling the LEDs in accordance with the form factor specification using a minimum quantity of discrete components. For example, in the embodiment shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the discrete components consist of one dual LED package with common anode, one dual NPN bipolar junction transistor (BJT), four resistors, and one diode.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the embodiment, the host driver of the storage device controls the voltage at the drive control pin (e.g., LED_PinA<b>10</b>), thereby controlling the state of LED<b>1</b> and LED<b>2</b> (as shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). As the voltage at the drive control pin changes, the illumination state of the LEDs changes accordingly.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, when the drive control pin (LED_PinA<b>10</b>) is asserted, meaning driven high by the host driver, the voltage at the drive control pin may be between 1.5 and 3.5 volts in some cases. In alternate embodiments, the &#x201c;high&#x201d; state may include voltages at the drive control pin of less than 1.5 volts and/or more than 3.5 volts.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the asserted state, transistor Q<b>2</b> is turned on via resistor R<b>4</b>, turning off transistor Q<b>1</b>. The second LED (LED<b>2</b>) is energized through the blocking diode D<b>3</b>, illuminating LED<b>2</b>. The resistor R<b>2</b> limits the current through LED<b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the resistor R<b>2</b> may have a resistance value of approximately 50 ohms. The anode voltage of the first LED (LED<b>1</b>) is less than the voltage at the cathode, so LED<b>1</b> is de-energized (not illuminated).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">When the drive control pin (LED_PinA<b>10</b>) is de-asserted, meaning driven low by the host driver, the voltage at the drive control pin may be between 0.7 and 1.5 volts in some cases. In alternate embodiments, the &#x201c;low&#x201d; state may include voltages less than 0.7 volts and/or more than 1.5 volts.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the de-asserted state, transistor Q<b>2</b> is turned off via resistor R<b>4</b>, turning on transistor Q<b>1</b>. Consequently, the second LED (LED<b>2</b>) is de-energized (not illuminated). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the resistor R<b>4</b> may have a resistance value of approximately 2.45 kilo-ohms. The host driver sinks the current through LED<b>1</b>, driving the net low, so LED<b>1</b> is energized (illuminated). Resistor R<b>1</b> limits the current through LED<b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the resistor R<b>1</b> may have a resistance value of approximately 800 ohms.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">When the drive control pin is in a high impedance state (e.g., not driven by the host driver), this turns off transistor Q<b>2</b> and turns on transistor Q<b>1</b>. The leakage current can be about &#x2212;2.11 uA, which generates a 5 mV drop across resistor R<b>4</b>. This can raise the net voltage at the drive control pin (LED_PinA<b>10</b>) to about &#x2212;705 mV (e.g., R<b>4</b>'s 5 mV drop+Q<b>2</b>'s 700 mV base-emitter drop). Under these conditions, neither the first (LED<b>1</b>) or the second (LED<b>2</b>) LED is energized or illuminated. For example, the current through LED<b>1</b> can be under 2.11 uA and the current through LED<b>2</b> is approximately &#x2212;0 A.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment, the function of the second LED (LED<b>2</b>) is independent of the 12V source voltage feeding the circuit <b>100</b>. For instance, if the 12V source is turned off, the second LED (LED<b>2</b>) functions as indicated in the table at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. However, the first LED (LED<b>1</b>) may be de-energized so long as the source voltage is off.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The graph at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a state diagram of the first and second indicators (LED<b>1</b> and LED<b>2</b>) with the drive control pin (LED_PinA<b>10</b>) asserted and de-asserted. The voltage at the drive control pin (LED_PinA<b>10</b>) is shown with the dotted line. By way of example, the voltage at the pin is shown alternating between 0V and 3.3V for a period of 100 ms. The current through the first indicator (LED<b>1</b>) is shown with a solid line and the current through the second indicator (LED<b>2</b>) is shown with a dashed line. The approximate current through each indicator when it is illuminated is about 10.6 mA. The selection of the resistors in the circuit controls the current through the indicators, which maintains the specified low current draw. Note that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the resistor R<b>3</b> may have a resistance value of approximately 7.5 kilo-ohms.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, as shown in the state diagram, when the drive control pin is asserted, meaning driven at a relatively higher voltage (e.g., about 3.3 volts), the first indicator is illuminated, and the second indicator is not. When the drive control pin is de-asserted, meaning driven at a relatively lower voltage (e.g., between 0 and 0.7 volts), the second indicator is illuminated, and the first indicator is not. Only one of the first (LED<b>1</b>) and second (LED<b>2</b>) indicators is illuminated at a time, or neither is illuminated.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the embodiments shown herein, the first LED (LED<b>1</b>) is shown as having the color blue and the second LED (LED<b>2</b>) is shown as having the color yellow. This is not intended to be limiting either, as the circuit may be used to control indicators (e.g., LEDs) having any colors. In an alternate embodiment, the colors of the LEDs may be the same, and the first and second indication may be given by some other characteristics of the LEDs (such as position or location, an illuminated symbol or digit, or the like).</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Additional Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in some embodiments, other types of indicator control methods and systems can be implemented while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure.
