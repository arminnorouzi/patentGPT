id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to self-assembling proteins that are capable of being used to deliver cargo proteins to phagocytic cells, and the subsequent delivery and utility of these self-assembling proteins by the phagocytic cells at sites of disease. In particular, the invention relates inter alia to phagocytic cells comprising polyhedrin protein crystals, wherein the crystals themselves encapsulate therapeutic and/or diagnostic proteins. The invention also provides therapies using these cells.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Proteins, including antibodies, growth factors, hormones, enzymes and vaccines can be used therapeutically. For example, growth factors such as IL-2 have been shown to have therapeutic value in cancer (Andersen et al, 2016). However, upon systemic injection, proteins can be rapidly cleared and require doses that generate significant toxic side effects to non-target cells. For primary tumours, it may be possible to inject proteins directly into the tumour mass, but protein instability, particularly for growth factors, still creates challenges with this approach. Although therapy may be feasible by direct injection into the tumour mass, delivery of growth factors and other proteins to any widely disseminated disease cannot practically be achieved this way.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Phagocytic cells engulf microscopic particles through an active phagocytic process. A wide variety of different phagocytic cells types are present in mammals. Phagocytic cells are key to the immune system's response to infection and disease. For example, macrophages are specialized cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems which play a key role in defending against foreign pathogens, healing wounds, and regulating tissue homeostasis. Responding to subtle changes in the environment, macrophages are activated, also referred to as &#x201c;polarized&#x201d;, to a pro-inflammatory M1 or an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Activation can be transient and is non-binary with high levels of cell plasticity.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Stimuli such as IFN-&#x3b3;, LPS and GM-CSF result in polarization to the M1 phenotype, which is characterized by the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, IL-1&#x3b2; and IL-12) and chemokines (e.g. CCL5, CCL10 and CXL9), and the release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates&#x2014;the &#x201c;classical&#x201d; pathogen killing Th1 response. In contrast, M2 macrophages stimulated by the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-10 and TGF-&#x3b2;) and chemokines (e.g. CCL17 and CCL22).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When polarized macrophages encounter a foreign object such as microbes or other pathogens, uptake into the cell is initiated. Once phagocytosed the innate acidic phagolysosome normally efficiently degrades biological material including proteins. Subsequently, fragments of surface proteins of degraded pathogens are presented on the surface of macrophages for recognition by other cells of the immune system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Phagocytic cells may also infiltrate diseased tissue. However, phagocytic cells may be subverted and actively contribute to the genesis of diseases such as solid cancers (van Dalen et al 2019). For example, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) usually express an M2 phenotype (alternatively activated subset), which leads to them performing immunosuppressive and tumor promoting functions. Reprogramming of such cells towards an M1 phenotype (classically activated subset) may suppress their pro-cancer phenotype and unleash anti-tumor immunity.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Given their intimate association with disease and their ability to infiltrate diseased tissue, the ease with which they can be harvested for ex-vivo manipulation, and their alternative states, it has been proposed that (1) the phenotype of phagocytic cells may be modulated to impact disease outcome and (2) phagocytic cells may be used as &#x201c;trojan horses&#x201d; to deliver a drug preferentially or specifically to an area of disease, targeting other cells whilst reducing toxic side effects to non-target tissue (Choi et al 2007).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To date, several strategies have been developed to re-purpose monocytes and macrophages to deliver drugs to sites of infection, inflammation or solid tumors (Xu et al 2018; Pang et al 2017; Rosa et al 2017). However, the fragility of cargo therapeutic proteins has confounded attempts to use them in a Trojan horse strategy to treat disease. There are numerous challenges in successfully delivering therapeutic cargo proteins using phagocytic cells such as macrophages, with toxicity to the phagocytic cell, changes to their metabolism, efficiency of uptake and digestion of cargo to name but a few.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an aim of some embodiments of the present invention to mitigate some of the problems identified in the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention relates to the use of polyhedrin protein crystals (e.g. PODS&#xae; protein crystals) to deliver cargo proteins via phagocytic cells. PODS&#xae; are micron scale cubic co-crystals which may contain stabilized recombinant protein cargo which is sustainably released under the activity of proteases. Certain aspects of the present invention relate to the finding that such crystals are efficiently phagocytosed into the cells and, unexpectedly, secrete their cargo in a way that retains cargo bioactivity and also modulates the behavior of nearby cells.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Certain aspects of the invention relate to the finding that polyhedrin protein crystals are efficiently taken up by macrophage cells and, against expectations, proteins incorporated into these crystals are subsequently released from the cells in a bioactive form. Moreover, the uptake of these crystals neither affects macrophage cell viability nor interferes with key macrophage function such as following chemotactic signals secreted by tumor cells or migrating through narrow spaces, both important for efficient delivery of therapeutic cargo to sites of disease.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Certain aspects of the invention relate to improved methods of delivering therapeutic cargo proteins to sites of disease by infiltrating phagocytic cells such as macrophages to increase drug efficacy and reduce off-target side effects. Alternative aspects of the invention relate to methods of delivering diagnostic cargo proteins to sites of disease by infiltrating phagocytic cells such as macrophages in order to image a disease.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, the invention provides:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0014">a phagocytic cell comprising one or more polyhedrin protein crystals, wherein the crystals encapsulate one or more cargo proteins;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0015">a population comprising more than 1&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>phagocytic cells as described herein;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0016">a package comprising a phagocytic cell (or population thereof) as described herein;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0017">a method of producing a phagocytic cell (or population thereof) as described herein, comprising:        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0018">(a) contacting the one or more phagocytic cells with polyhedrin protein crystals; and</li>            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0019">(b) culturing the phagocytic cells under conditions which induce phagocytosis;</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0020">a pharmaceutical composition comprising:        <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0021">(a) a phagocytic cell (or population thereof) as described herein, wherein the phagocytic cell comprises one or more therapeutic agents; and</li>            <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0022">(b) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent;</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0023">a pharmaceutical composition as described herein for use in medicine;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0024">a pharmaceutical composition as described herein for use in treating a solid cancer; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0025">a method of imaging a solid cancer, comprising:        <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0026">(a) administering a phagocytic cell (or population thereof) as described herein, wherein the phagocytic cell comprises one or more detectable agents; and</li>            <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0027">(b) detecting the detectable agent, thereby imaging at least part of the cancer.</li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0028">Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example only, and with reference to the accompanying Figures in which:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows phagocytosis of PODS&#xae; protein crystals into professional phagocytes.

Numeric ranges are inclusive of the numbers defining the range.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0052">Phagocytic Cells</p><p id="p-0040" num="0053">The invention provides one or more phagocytic cells. Typically, the phagocytic cells are mammalian cells. For example, the phagocytic cells may be murine or human cells. Phagocytic cells of the invention include professional phagocytes such as monocytes, macrophages and glial cells. Phagocytic cells of the invention also include non-professional phagocytes, such as chondrocytes, fibroblasts, erythrocytes, lymphocytes, epithelial, myoblast and myocyte cells. Typically, the phagocytic cells of the invention are macrophages.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0054">In certain embodiments, the phagocytic cells of the invention are obtained from monocytes. For example, the phagocytic cells may be obtained from immortalized monocyte-like cell lines (e.g. THP-1 ATCC).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0055">In certain embodiments, pre-existing phagocytic cells are isolated from body cavity lavages (alveolar, peritoneal) of resident or elicited monocytes (Zhang et al, 2008).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0056">In certain embodiments, the phagocytic cells of the invention are obtained by differentiating monocytes from blood or extracted from bone marrow. For example, the phagocytic cells may be obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0057">In certain embodiments, monocytes may be differentiated by supplementing culture media with growth factors or signaling molecules such as cytokines. For example, the culture media may be supplemented with macrophage colony-stimulating factors (M-CSF). The cells may also be incubated with additional immune stimulators such as LPS and/or interferon gamma (IFN-&#x3b3;).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0058">Use of such stimulators may induce different polarizations that mimic in vivo phenotypes (Mosser et al, 2008).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0059">In certain embodiments, the phagocytic cells may comprise cargo proteins as described herein that do not have any effect on the phagocytic cells themselves but are secreted to affect the behavior of other cells.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0060">In certain embodiments, the phagocytic cells of the invention are autologous. In other words, the phagocytic cells may be derived from a subject to be treated and thereby reduce the risk of immunological rejection.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0061">Techniques are available in the art to generate phagocytic cells in large numbers for autologous cell-based therapies. Typically, phagocytic cells such as macrophages are produced from progenitor cells. For example, such progenitor cells may be established by overexpression of Hoxb8 in media supplemented with GM-CSF (Redecke et al., 2013). This results in rapidly proliferating, cloneable cells. Removal of Hoxb8 activity allows progenitors to differentiate in phagocytic cells (e.g. macrophages).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0062">The invention also provides populations of two or more phagocytic cells. Any number of cells may be present in the population. For example, the population may comprise more than about 10<sup>5</sup>, <b>10</b><sup>6</sup>, 10<sup>7 </sup>or 10<sup>8 </sup>phagocytic cells. In certain embodiments, the population comprises at least 10<sup>9</sup>, 10<sup>10</sup>, 10<sup>11 </sup>or 10<sup>12 </sup>phagocytic cells. The population is preferably homologous and/or autologous.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0063">The phagocytic cells may be isolated, substantially isolated, purified or substantially purified. The phagocytic cells are isolated or purified if they are completely free of any other components, such as culture medium, other cells or other cell types. The phagocytic cells are substantially isolated if mixed with carriers or diluents, such as culture medium, which will not interfere with their intended use.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0064">The phagocytic cells may be isolated using any suitable technique. For example, the phagocytic cells may be isolated by leukapheresis and/or elutriation (Faradji et al, 1994; Andreeson et al. 1990). Typically, the phagocytic cells are isolated from peripheral blood of a subject as described herein. The phagocytic cells (e.g. monocytes) may then be collected from blood and isolated using a combination of leukapheresis and elutriation.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0065">As discussed in more detail below, the phagocytic cells are treated ex vivo. In particular, the phagocytic cells are loaded with polyhedrin protein crystals (themselves encapsulating one or more cargo proteins as described herein) and used therapeutically in the methods of the invention.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0066">In certain embodiments, the phagocytic cells are provided in frozen aliquots and substances such as DMSO may be present to facilitate survival during freezing. Such frozen cells will typically be thawed and then placed in a buffer or medium either for maintenance or for administration.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0067">In certain embodiments, the phagocytic cells are provided in a package. For example, the package may protect the cells from damage during collection, cell culture or transport. Suitable packages include, for example, Teflon bags or the like.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0068">Polyhedrin Protein Crystals</p><p id="p-0056" num="0069">The phagocytic cells of the invention comprise one or more polyhedrin protein crystals (e.g. PODS&#xae; protein crystals). Typically, the crystals are derived from viruses such as cypoviruses and baculoviruses. For example, the crystals may be derived from <i>Bombyx mori </i>cypovirus.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0070">In certain embodiments, polyhedrin protein crystals are generated in cells in which the polyhedrin protein is expressed at high levels under the control of a promoter. Co-crystals are formed when a second protein is co-expressed and incorporated into the crystal. This second protein is termed the active, or cargo, protein. Typically, the promoters are polyhedrin promoters. Typically, the crystals are generated in insect cells. For example, the crystals may be generated using <i>Spodoptera frugiperda </i>9 (sf9) cells.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0071">In certain embodiments, the cargo protein is tagged with a short peptide sequence which causes the cargo protein to bind to the growing polyhedrin crystal. As the crystal continues to grow, the cargo protein becomes encased. As such, the crystals encapsulate one or more cargo proteins.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0072">In certain embodiments, the polyhedrin protein comprises the <i>Bombyx mori </i>cypovirus polyhedrin sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1. Alternatively, the polyhedrin protein may comprise a sequence which has at least about 70%. 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 based on amino acid identify over the entire sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0073">In certain embodiments, the one or more cargo proteins comprise a polyhedrin binding tag selected from the H1-tag sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2. Alternatively, the polyhedrin binding tag may comprise a sequence which has at least about 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 based on amino acid identify over the entire sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0074">In certain embodiments, the one or more cargo proteins comprise a polyhedrin binding tag selected from the VP3-tag sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:3. Alternatively, the polyhedrin binding tag may comprise a sequence which has at least about 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3 based on amino acid identify over the entire sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0075">In certain embodiments, the one or more cargo proteins comprise a polyhedrin binding tag selected from the PH-tag sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:4. Alternatively, the polyhedrin binding tag may comprise a sequence which has at least about 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4 based on amino acid identify over the entire sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0076">In certain embodiments, the crystals are internalized within (e.g. inside) the phagocytic cell. For example, the crystals may be situated internally within a phagosome or phagolysosome or within the cytoplasm or nucleus of the cell rather than externally on the cell membrane.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0077">In certain embodiments, intact crystals are capable of secreting the cargo proteins from within the phagocytic cell. In other words, a cargo protein may be released from the crystals and retain its natural conformation and/or function. Typically, the cargo proteins are released through the action of proteases (e.g. matrix metalloproteases) within the cell.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0078">In certain embodiments, the cargo proteins have a desired phenotypic effect upon the phagocytic cell in which they are secreted. For example, cargo proteins may be capable of repolarizing the phagocytic cell (e.g. to a M1 macrophage phenotype).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0079">In certain embodiments, the cargo proteins are released from the phagocytic cells over a sustained period of time. For example, the cargo proteins may be released from the cell across the cell membrane. Unexpectedly, the cargo proteins are capable of modifying the behavior of neighboring cells that may not themselves contain any crystals. In certain embodiments, the cargo proteins are released from the cell via exosomes. These exosomes may be harvested for therapeutic or research applications.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0080">Typically, the cargo proteins are sustainably released over a period of time that is longer than that required for the phagocytic cell to reach and/or infiltrate its intended target. For example, the cargo proteins may be sustainably released from the phagocytic cells over a period of at least 2 days, 5 days, 7 days, 10 days, 14 days, 20 days, 21 days, one month or more.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0081">Typically, the crystals are regular arrays of polyhedrin protein assembled in a crystal lattice. The crystals may be cubic or any other shape. The crystals of the invention are typically isolated from cells, such as insect cells, which have been infected with virus, typically baculovirus or cypovirus. The crystals are typically smaller than 10 microns, for example 0.1 to 6 microns (measured as the maximum distance inside the crystal between different surfaces or the maximum length of an edge). The crystals may be treated prior to use to modify their shape and/or reduce their size.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0082">In certain embodiments, the crystals are isolated from the cells e.g. by centrifugation. Typically, the crystals are prepared in an aqueous suspension. For example, the concentration of the crystal suspension may be more than 10<sup>4 </sup>crystals per millilitre volume, typically from 10<sup>4 </sup>to 10<sup>7 </sup>crystals per millilitre volume, preferably from 5&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>to 5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>or 10<sup>5 </sup>to 10<sup>6 </sup>crystals per millilitre volume. Crystals can be applied to (contacted with) the culture system/medium at these concentrations. These can be used in therapy at concentrations of 10<sup>5 </sup>to 10<sup>7 </sup>crystals per microliter, for example at 3&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>crystals per millilitre.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0083">Advantageously, the crystals are highly stable and rigid. The crystals may be attached (e.g. dried to a solid support). Typically, high levels of bioactivity are maintained after 6 months storage in protease-free solution at 37&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0084">Cargo Proteins</p><p id="p-0072" num="0085">The polyhedrin protein crystals as described herein encapsulate one or more cargo proteins.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0086">Any type of cargo protein may be used. The phagocytic cells may comprise polyhedrin protein crystals comprising a single type of cargo protein. Alternatively, the phagocytic cells may comprise polyhedrin protein crystals comprising different types of cargo protein (e.g. a combination of cargo proteins). For example, the phagocytic cells may comprise at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more different cargo proteins.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0087">As further described herein, the cargo proteins typically comprise a polyhedrin binding tag. The cargo proteins are typically secreted from the crystals intact. The cargo proteins are typically sustainably released from phagocytic cells. The cargo proteins may lead to a desired phenotypic effect within the phagocytic cell in which they are secreted and/or in neighboring cells.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0088">In embodiments where there are more than one cargo proteins, each protein may have the same polyhedrin binding tag. Alternatively, each protein may have different polyhedrin binding tags.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0089">In certain embodiments, the crystals are coated with an agent that delays the release of polyhedrin and cargo protein.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0090">In certain embodiments, the cargo proteins comprise one or more therapeutic agents. For example, the cargo proteins may comprise one or more different antibodies, immunogens, enzymes, signaling proteins, hormones, growth factors and/or cytokines.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0091">In certain embodiments, the one or more therapeutic agents are capable of re-programming M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMS), inflammatory monocytes and/or myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) into M1 macrophage cells.

PODS&#xae; eGFP were adhered as a monolayer onto wells of a 12-well plate prior to seeding undifferentiated THP-1 cells (monocytes) on top of the crystals. In a different setup, PODS&#xae; eGFP were briefly mixed with monocytes before plating the mixture onto wells in a homogeneous manner. After a 24 h incubation period, cells were stained and imaged. In either experimental configuration, multiple PODS&#xae; proteins were successfully taken up by monocytes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> <i>a</i>-<i>d</i>). In some cases, over 35 individual crystals were ingested by a single cell. Phagocytosis of the crystalline protein depots was independent of the embedded cargo protein as different PODS&#xae; crystals containing either no protein (PODS&#xae; Empty), growth factors, cytokines, chemokines or fluorescence proteins were all taken up efficiently.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0159">THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into M0 macrophages by incubating cells in complete medium supplemented with PMA (Genin et al 2015, Del Arosa et al 2016). After incubating in differentiation medium for 24 hours, cells started to adhere and changed their morphology as well as their cytokine secretion pattern, e.g. increase of Activin A secretion, demonstrating differentiation into M0 macrophages. Subsequently, M0 macrophages were differentiated further into either M1 or M2 macrophages and PODS&#xae; eGFP protein crystals were added to the each of the M0, M1 and M2 cell cultures. Cultures were further incubated and phagocytosis of PODS&#xae; crystals were observed after 48 h (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> <i>a</i>-<i>c</i>). While M0 and M2 phagocytes exhibited similar levels of phagocytosis, with almost all PODS&#xae; protein crystals ingested (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <i>c</i></figref>, respectively), M1 macrophages were less efficient at ingesting the particles (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>). Our observations suggest that efficiency for ingesting PODS&#xae; crystals as M2&#x3e;M0&#x3e;M1.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0160">M0 macrophages were also assessed for their mobility and thus viability during and post phagocytosis. After the addition of PODS&#xae; eGFP protein crystals, an M0 culture was monitored for 48 hours with a real-time cell history recorder in both brightfield and fluorescence channels at a rate of 1 frame/minute (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i>-<b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>). Stills of the time-lapse recording demonstrate that many M0 macrophages were mobile and thus healthy during and after PODS&#xae; eGFP were phagocytosed. Successful phagocytosis could be detected by observing a change in the position of the green fluorescent PODS&#xae; from static (i.e. surface adhered) to mobile after being taken up into phagocytic cells. Furthermore, differentiated macrophages, i.e. M0, M1 and M2, typically are adherent when healthy and no detachment of cells was observed during the incubation period, even after many PODS&#xae; protein crystals were taken up into each of the cells.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example 2&#x2014;Phagocytosis of PODS&#xae; Protein Crystals into Non-Professional Phagocytes</heading><p id="p-0149" num="0161">It was next determined whether the shape and size of PODS&#xae; protein crystals would be equally conducive for phagocytosis into non-professional phagocytes, such as fibroblasts, osteochondrogenic cells, lymphocytes, erythrocytes, epithelial, myoblast or myocyte cells. Again, PODS&#xae; eGFP were seeded as a dense, single-layer into wells of a 96 well plate and dried on. Subsequently, either fibroblast cells or chondrocyte cells were seeded on top of the adhered crystals and cultured for up to 48 h. As with macrophages, most of the seeded PODS&#xae; protein crystals were taken up efficiently by both fibroblasts (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>) as well as chondrocytes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>), aggregating within the cells, and very few protein crystals could be found in the space between cells. Similar to differentiated macrophages, fibroblasts and chondrocytes are adherent cells and would detach when unhealthy or apoptotic. However, following ingestions of PODS&#xae; crystals, cells remained attached to the surface and continued to proliferate into an over-confluent state.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0162">It was next determined whether the PODS&#xae; had been ingested and not simply adhered to the surface of macrophages. Phagocytosis was demonstrated by incubating either undifferentiated THP-1 monocytes or M1 macrophages with PODS&#xae; Empty (pure polyhedrin protein crystals, without cargo), for 24 h and then fixing cells such that their membranes were impermeable to antibodies. Cells were then subjected to an anti-polyhedrin primary antibody, which would only recognize PODS&#xae; crystals that had not been phagocytosed and were attached to the cell surface or remained adhered to the TC plastic surface. Crystals recognized by the primary antibody were visualized using a FITC secondary antibody and a fluorescence microscope. When observing THP-1 monocytes using brightfield microscopy, almost all cells had ingested multiple PODS&#xae; crystals (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>). After switching to the fluorescence channel, an estimated 90% of crystals had no equivalent fluorescent signal compared to the brightfield image. This provided clear evidence that the polyhedrin crystals were located within THP-1 cells as PODS&#xae; were not recognized by the antibody pair. In the case of M1 macrophages, a different level of phagocytosis could be observed where many more protein crystals could be found outside the boundaries of cells. Consequently, these PODS&#xae; crystals were readily recognized by the antibody pair and thus clearly visible in the fluorescence channel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>). Lastly, phagocytosis into non-professional phagocytes could be demonstrated by first incubating chondrocytes with PODS&#xae; eGFP for 24 h. Cells were subsequently fixed, cytoskeleton and nuclei stained and imaged using confocal microscopy. Scanning through focal layers revealed that cytoskeleton, nucleus and PODS&#xae; eGFP crystals were all in the same focal plane (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c</i></figref>).</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 3&#x2014;PODS&#xae; Exhibit Specific Bioactivity after Phagocytosis</heading><p id="p-0151" num="0163">In order to assess whether phagocytosed PODS&#xae; growth factors PODS&#xae; GF still exhibit the specific bioactivity of the embedded cargo, a proliferation assay was performed using PODS&#xae; GM-CSF and PODS&#xae; SCF on undifferentiated monocytes (THP-1) in two different configurations. In the first configuration, PODS&#xae; GF were seeded into wells of a 24-well plate as a fairly uniform, single layer of protein crystals and adhered to the TC surface. Monocytes were then seeded on to the same surface (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a</i></figref>, I) and cultured for 4 days. In this configuration, PODS&#xae; GF crystals are readily phagocytosed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a</i></figref>, II). In contrast, in the second configuration, where PODS&#xae; GF crystals are adhered to the porous membrane of TC inserts and monocytes then seeded into wells, PODS&#xae; and cells are physically separated and thus phagocytosis is prevented (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a</i></figref>, III). Throughout the experiment, only cells are present on the surface of the well and are therefore unable to ingest protein crystals (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a</i></figref>, IV).

Irrespective of whether PODS&#xae; crystals were phagocytosed or not (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>b</i></figref>, solid grey bars and dotted bars, respectively), each growth factor cargo showed proliferation stimulation activity as cell numbers in their presence increased significantly compared to measurements of non-supplemented cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>b</i></figref>, horizontal line).

To test the ability of PODS&#xae; IL-2-loaded M0 cells to follow a chemotactic gradient, the experiment was repeated with a slight variation: after PODS&#xae; uptake, cells were taken into serum-free medium and transferred into chemotactic slides with two reservoirs. Reservoir 1 was filled with medium containing 10% serum, acting as a chemoattractant, and reservoir 2 was filled with serum free medium. The movement of unloaded- and PODS&#xae; IL-2-loaded cells was investigated by tracking 26 cells each as described above (Error! Reference source not found.a and b, respectively).

After a further 24 h incubation, both experimental chambers were analysed with brightfield and fluorescence microscopy. A large difference in cell numbers in the wells with and without chemoattractant demonstrated that, despite their PODS&#xae; cargo, loaded M0 cells not only were capable of passing through the narrow pores but actively migrated through the 8 &#x3bc;m pores to the chemotactic source.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0198">Importantly, macrophages are actively recruited by chemical signals from solid tumours (Dandenkar et al 2011), so it was tested if conditioned medium of a cancer cell line can attract PODS&#xae; eGFP loaded macrophages using the same cell chamber as described above.

To test if contact with and uptake of PODS&#xae; crystals by monocytes and macrophages influences their polarization status, the secretion of IL-6 was tested, a marker for M1 polarization, before and after PODS&#xae; uptake (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). First, it was confirmed that IL-6 can indeed be used as a proxy for polarization status, showing that M1 cells raised concentration levels of IL-6 in the cell culture media to more than 4 ng/ml directly after polarization, whereas neither non-activated THP-1 cells nor M0 and M1 cells raised IL-6 concentration above background level (Figure a). The polarization medium was then changed to medium containing PODS&#xae; FGF-2 and phagocytic uptake was allowed to proceed for 24 h. Within this incubation time, both loaded and unloaded M1 cells raised IL-6 concentrations to 200 &#x3bc;g/ml. Unchanged levels of the polarization marker IL-6 between M1 cells which have taken up PODS&#xae; crystals and M1 cells which have not been incubated with PODS&#xae; crystals suggest that the uptake of PODS&#xae; crystals did not alter the polarization status of M1 cells. Equally, the uptake of PODS&#xae; crystals did not induce IL-6 secretion of M0 and M2 cells, suggesting that phagocytosis of PODS&#xae; crystals does not change the polarization status of any macrophage type.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0200">To test if cargo protein of ingested PODS&#xae; is released from the macrophages into the medium, M0 cells were incubated with PODS&#xae; IL-6 for 24 h, washed twice and then incubated for a further 4 days in normal growth medium containing no additional PODS. Then, medium was collected and analyzed for the presence of IL-6 by ELISA (Figure a). Surprisingly, not only was the cargo protein IL-6 detected in the cell culture medium but levels of IL-6 were dose-dependent: the more PODS&#xae; IL-6 were loaded into M0 cells, the more could be detected in the medium after 4 days. As a comparison, the amount of IL-6 released from similar numbers of non-phagocytosed (naked) PODS&#xae; IL-6 (Figure b) was also measured. The amount of IL-6 released from naked PODS&#xae; was up to 10 times higher than from PODS&#xae; taken up by macrophages. As a further control, M0 cells were incubated with PODS&#xae; FGF-2 in the same way and levels of IL-6 in the medium were analyzed. Not only were IL-6 levels below background (&#x3c;10 &#x3bc;g/ml) but also their levels did not change in a dose-dependent manner.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0201">To investigate if PODS&#xae; cargo protein released by macrophages is bioactive, a proliferation assay using NIH-3T3 cells that are responsive to FGF-2 protein was performed.

Developing an effective particle which contains the drug, allows function of the macrophage and subsequent release has been challenging, particularly for protein drugs such as cytokines. Non-phagocytic cells also have potential for Trojan horse delivery. But here also, despite ongoing research, there is, to date, no cell-based delivery system approved for the clinic, although there are at least two therapeutics using red blood cells as drug vehicle are currently in phase III trials (NCT02770807, NCT03665441).

Following phagocytosis, release is shown from macrophages of protein that was encapsulated into PODS&#xae; crystals. Released cargo protein could be detected reliably and in a dose-dependent manner using ELISA in macrophage culture medium which had been conditioned with PODS-containing macrophages from as few as 5 PODS&#xae; per macrophage. Even more surprisingly, released protein was shown to be bioactive as verified by proliferation of an FGF-2 reactive cell line upon co-incubation with PODS&#xae; FGF-2 loaded macrophages.
