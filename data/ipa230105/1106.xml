An aperture plate (&#x201c;AP&#x201d;) is attached to a washer-shaped support on which there is an annular piezoelectric vibration generator. Power is provided via pins to the top of the piezo directly and via the washer to the bottom of the piezo. Such a nebulizer works very effectively.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, vibrating aperture plate nebulisers naturally tend to ingest air through the centre of the aperture plate when nebulising. These bubbles have a size in the micro-metre range and have the potential to migrate to the walls of the nebuliser throat over the aperture plate. Here they may stagnate, coalesce and form a larger air bubble. These larger air bubbles can reduce or interrupt nebulization. Sometimes it helps to tap the nebuliser to release the air bubble and recommence nebulisation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Our prior published patent specification WO2016151029A describes an approach to bubble prevention which involves providing physical features in the interior reservoir surface, to physically prevent bubbles from forming to be large. EP3560604 (Microbase) describes an aerosol generator with an inner gasket on an inner edge of a washer-shaped piezo element. WO2014/133273 (KTMED) describes a liquid medicine inhaler. US2015/0375252 (DELBio, INC) describes a spraying device, WO2019/214281 (TAIAN DALU) describes a medical nebulizer, and US2018/0193869 (United Therapeutics Corp) describes an adjustable aerosol delivery device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is directed towards achieving improvements in efficiency and consistency of conversion of the liquid into aerosol and/or more efficient robotic manufacture of the nebulizer.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention provides a nebuliser s set out in claims <b>1</b> and <b>40</b> and their dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">We describe a nebulizer comprising a liquid supply reservoir, an aerosol outlet, and an aerosol generator comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">a vibratable aperture plate,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">an annular support supporting the aperture plate,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0010">a vibration generator attached to the annular support,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0011">a power conductor for transferring power to the vibration generator,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0012">a downstream resilient seal mounted between a housing and the annular support on a side</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0013">of the aperture plate opposed to the liquid supply reservoir, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0014">an upstream resilient seal mounted between the annular support and the housing reservoir,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0015">and having an opening forming part of a throat over the aperture plate.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0016">In one example, the upstream resilient seal comprises a gasket having a body and a downstream-extending rim adjacent the opening, the body extending radially from said rim in a substantially annular shape.

Preferably, the retainer is snap-fitted within the aerosol outlet. Preferably, engagement between the retainer and the aerosol outlet is between toes of the retainer engaging in recesses of the housing, and engagement being assisted by compression and axial reactive force of the resilient seals. Preferably, the retainer comprises an annular seat for the downstream resilient seal; and wherein the support, the aperture plate, the vibration generator, and the gasket are supported over said downstream resilient seal. In one example, the retainer forms an annular seat for the upstream resilient seal, and preferably comprises circumferential and axially-directed tabs forming side walls of said seat.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0020">In various examples, the throat has an area in the plane of the aperture plate of at least 18 mm<sup>2</sup>, preferably at least 20 mm<sup>2</sup>, more preferably at least 25 mm<sup>2</sup>, more preferably at least 30 mm<sup>2</sup>, and more preferably in the range of about 32 mm<sup>2 </sup>to 40 mm<sup>2</sup>.

In one example, the upstream resilient seal opening has an axial dimension in the range of 1.8 mm and 3.0 mm, and preferably in excess of 2.0 mm.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0022">In one example, the nebulizer comprises a pair of conducting spring pins for driving the vibration generator, and one or both of said pins extends through an aperture in the gasket.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0023">In one example, the upstream resilient seal is of medical grade liquid silicone rubber supplied as two component compounds which are mixed together and injected into a hot mould to cure. In various examples, the upstream resilient seal has a Shore hardness in the range of 20 to 80 Shore A, preferably 30 to 60 Shore A.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0024">In various examples, the gasket comprises a plurality of downstream ridges.

The reservoir has features for reduction of bubble formation and consistent and predictable flow of liquid on the reservoir side of the AP. One such feature is a throat size which is too large for significant bubble formation. Preferably, the throat size has an area in the plane of the AP of at least 18 mm<sup>2</sup>, more preferably at least 20 mm<sup>2</sup>, more preferably at least 25 mm<sup>2</sup>, more preferably at least 30 mm<sup>2</sup>. In one example the throat area is about 34 mm<sup>2</sup>, and is preferably in the range of in the range of about 32 mm<sup>2 </sup>to 40 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0097">It is preferred that the throat area is at least twice the active area (the portion of the AP which vibrates, inside the attachment rim) of the aperture plate. In one example the AP is of electroformed metal with a diameter of 3.50 mm and an area of 9.6 mm<sup>2</sup>. In this case the throat area is preferably at least 20 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0098">The aerosol generator may be of the type having a washer-shaped support to which is attached an annular piezoelectric vibration generating device on either the upstream or downstream side, and the aperture plate is connected by, for example, brazing to the internal rim of the support. The attachment of the AP to the support washer may alternatively be by adhesive, as described in our published patent specification WO2019/115221, the contents of which are incorporated by reference. In general, the AP has a rim which is attached to the support, and inside the rim there is the active portion, i.e. the portion which vibrates.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0099">The aperture plate may have a main body (the vibratable, active, portion) with apertures of approximately 6 &#x3bc;m diameter and with a density of approximately 90 per mm in cross section (if the manufacturing uses photo-defined masking the density may be much higher, in the order of thousands per mm as described for example in WO2012/092163). Around this body there is the rim having a lower surface attached to the support washer. The AP is directly supported on the support washer laterally internally of the resilient seals and the vibratory drive piezo, without any mechanical clamping. There may be grooves in the surface of the AP rim, which assist adherence. The AP rim may be micro-machined in the lower surface to have multiple parallel anchor grooves each groove having a pair of side surfaces and a base surface, the base surface being substantially in the plane of the AP. The grooves are in the lower surface, extend generally in the radial direction, and have a zig-zag pattern as viewed in plan, with straight lengths between bends. In this example of adhesive attachment, in general, it is preferred to have as high a density of grooves as possible, consistent with maintaining sufficient mechanical strength in the aperture plate, especially at the rim where it is attached to the washer. For example, there may be 72 grooves in one example, and it is preferred that there are in the range of 30 to 130 grooves.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0100">In general, it is preferred that, where there is adhesive attachment instead of brazing, anchor grooves are provided having a depth in the range of 10 &#x3bc;m to 40 &#x3bc;m, a width in the range of 20 &#x3bc;m to 150 &#x3bc;m, an angular pitch in the range of 2.5&#xb0; to 12.5&#xb0;, and that they have at least one bend in direction, and each bend is at an angle in the range of 45&#xb0; to 120&#xb0;, and preferably in the range of 80&#xb0; to 105&#xb0;. Adhesive is applied to the rim on the underneath side between the rim and the washer. The washer is sloped away from the plane of the aperture plate with a convex curvature as viewed in cross-section. Advantageously, the adhesive forms a fillet where the washer bends away from the lower surface of the aperture plate. This provides excellent mechanical strength with integration of the washer to the aperture plate.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0101">There is a gasket between the vessel housing and the aerosol generator at the AP support on the upstream side, the gasket having a rim extending between the support and the housing in the axial/longitudinal direction (parallel to the axis of the aperture plate), and a lateral portion extending radially to overlie at least some of the support. The configuration is such what when axial pressure is applied during manufacture the gasket tends to deflect radially outwardly, creating a tapered slope on the inside surface of the central opening in the gasket. This provides a funnel shape around at least some of the circumference of the throat. The housing configuration preferably provides a reservoir internal surface which forms a continuation of the gasket opening internal surface. This provides a throat funnel shape formed by a combination of the gasket opening inner surface and the housing reservoir internal surface. Such a funnel shape may be provided by a top gasket which does not extend radially to a large extent, in some examples not extending as far as the piezo drive. In one such example it only extends radially to the extent of an inner rim which forms the gasket opening. This gasket internal liquid-contacting exposed surface is preferably not overhung by the housing and may be textured in a manner as described below for low propensity to bubble formation on the surface. Additionally or alternatively, there may be a hydrophilic coating on one or both of the gasket internal exposed surface and the reservoir surface.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0102">By having different components in contact with the liquid, the gasket and the housing, it is convenient to provide a combination of surface types to optimise liquid flow to the AP, with minimization of bubble formation.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0103">Preferably the gasket is supported together with the aerosol generator as a unitary assembly mounted on a retainer which engages as a unit with the remainder of the housing. This action is preferably movement towards the liquid supply chamber (reservoir) until a snap-fitting engagement of the retainer in place with the gasket axially compressed against the housing around the throat. The gasket is accurately and concentrically seated in an annular seat of the retainer, and this is preferably provided by resilient tabs which are arc-shaped and spaced-apart around the circumference of the gasket seat.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0104">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> the following main components of a nebulizer <b>1</b> are illustrated:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0105"><b>2</b>, integral plastics housing body,</li>    <li id="ul0009-0002" num="0106"><b>3</b>, liquid supply chamber (or &#x201c;reservoir&#x201d;),</li>    <li id="ul0009-0003" num="0107"><b>4</b>, aerosol delivery tubular outlet,</li>    <li id="ul0009-0004" num="0108"><b>5</b>, aerosol generator assembly,</li>    <li id="ul0009-0005" num="0109"><b>6</b>, retainer, supporting the aerosol generator <b>5</b> in the integral housing body <b>2</b>;</li>    <li id="ul0009-0006" num="0110"><b>20</b>, reservoir tubular top part,</li>    <li id="ul0009-0007" num="0111"><b>21</b>, reservoir funnel-shaped lower part (&#x201c;funnel&#x201d;),</li>    <li id="ul0009-0008" num="0112"><b>22</b>, liquid supply chamber cap;</li>    <li id="ul0009-0009" num="0113"><b>23</b>, cap tubular opening,</li>    <li id="ul0009-0010" num="0114"><b>24</b>, cap silicone plug,</li>    <li id="ul0009-0011" num="0115"><b>30</b>, power conducting pin support part of the housing body <b>2</b>;</li>    <li id="ul0009-0012" num="0116"><b>31</b>, <b>32</b> conducting pins extending through the pin support housing part <b>30</b>;</li></ul></p><p id="p-0075" num="0117">The reservoir top part <b>20</b> is in fluid communication with the inclined funnel-shaped lower part (&#x201c;funnel&#x201d;) <b>21</b> for delivering liquid onto the aperture plate (&#x201c;AP&#x201d;).

This assembly is supported by the retainer <b>6</b> and is surrounded by the aerosol delivery tube <b>4</b>. The piezo adhesive ring <b>47</b>, while shown for illustrative purposes as a discrete item is in fact bonded between the piezo <b>46</b> and the washer <b>40</b>, attaching the piezo to the washer in a manner which conducts electrical power to the underside of the piezo <b>46</b>. Likewise, the braze ring <b>42</b> is an integral part of the rim of the aperture plate (&#x201c;AP&#x201d;) <b>41</b> and the internal rim of the washer <b>40</b>, attaching the AP to the washer. In other examples the attachment of the AP may be bonded rather than brazed. This example involves an electroformed aperture plate <b>41</b> with &#x201c;hourglass&#x201d; shaped apertures. However, in other examples the aperture plate may be formed by photo-defined technology as described in our prior patent specification nos. WO2012/092163 or WO2013/186031. There may be a reservoir layer of liquid supply cavities over the aerosol-forming apertures, formed in a manner for example as described in WO2012/092163 or WO2013/186031, and these may have a diameter in the range of 20 &#x3bc;m to 400 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0120">The aperture plate <b>41</b> apertures have an outlet opening diameter in the range of 1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m, and in one example about 2 &#x3bc;m to 3 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0121">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the retainer <b>6</b> is configured so as to securely support and contain the components of the aerosol generator assembly <b>5</b>. It has a circumferential wall <b>60</b> with a top rim <b>61</b> and a pair of lower depending legs <b>62</b> with toes which snap fit as clips into corresponding recesses <b>67</b> of the aerosol outlet tube <b>4</b>. At the upper end, a series of circumferentially-extending elongate tabs <b>65</b> define the outer surface of a circular seat for the gasket <b>48</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the gasket <b>48</b> retained within the tabs <b>65</b> in a concentric position.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0122">The retainer <b>60</b> also forms an annular seat <b>68</b> for the downstream O-ring <b>43</b>, shown most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>. The washer <b>40</b> is supported underneath by the O-ring <b>43</b> housed within the groove <b>68</b> of the retainer <b>6</b>, the washer <b>40</b> resting on the O-ring <b>43</b> and itself supporting the piezo <b>46</b> adhered to the washer <b>40</b> top surface. The AP <b>41</b> is attached by the braze ring <b>42</b> to the washer <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0123">The liquid supply reservoir funnel <b>21</b> has an internal tapered surface <b>26</b> inclined inwardly towards the AP <b>41</b>, defining a throat <b>8</b> over the AP together with the gasket inner surface <b>72</b>. The latter is not overhung by the housing, forming a continuation of the housing surface. By having two components, the gasket and the housing forming a reservoir shape leading to the aperture plate, it is convenient and versatile to provide a combination of surface types to optimise liquid flow to the AP, with minimization of bubble formation.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0124">The housing <b>21</b> forms a continuation of the gasket <b>48</b> inner surface <b>72</b>, so that they together provide a liquid flow funnel towards the AP. As described in more detail below, this allows not only smooth and streamlined flow, but also allows the provision of a different surface near the AP, by for example a desired roughness of the gasket surface <b>72</b> for optimisation of flow characteristics and/or and bubble prevention. The reservoir <b>3</b> is tilted away from the axis of the AP, and forms a much greater angle to the AP axis on the lower side. On the lower side, the funnel wall <b>26</b> diverges away from the throat area at an angle to axial preferably greater than 45&#xb0; and more preferably greater than 50&#xb0; and still more preferably greater than 55&#xb0; for at least some of the circumference of the throat. In this particular example the angle is about 60&#xb0; at its greatest. This provides a maximum amount of space over the AP, thereby minimising surface area for bubble growth, as described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0125">The compressed axial (aperture plate central longitudinal axis) dimension distance between the plane of the rim of the aperture plate and the bend in the housing where it is splayed out is 2.3 mm, and is more generally preferably in the range of 1.8 mm and 3.0 mm. This provides splaying out a short enough distance from the AP to help minimise bubble prevention. The fact that about 1.8 mm of this dimension is provided by the gasket inner surface is helpful, as it may have a desired surface roughness to additionally prevent bubble formation. In general, it is preferred that the axial dimension of the gasket at the throat is in the range of 1.5 mm to 3.0 mm.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0126">The top (upstream) gasket <b>48</b> is sandwiched between and compressed by the washer <b>40</b> and the bottom surface of the housing body funnel <b>21</b>. The gasket <b>48</b> counterbalances the force from the O-ring <b>43</b> and from the pins <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0127">As shown particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> the gasket <b>48</b> comprises a body <b>70</b> of material moulded to form a downstream-depending circular rim <b>71</b> with the internal surface <b>72</b> forming an opening, which is part of the throat <b>8</b>, for liquid supply to the AP. The rim <b>71</b> provides a gasket depth which is greater than the depth of the remainder of the body <b>70</b>, and because it forms part of the opening surface <b>72</b>, it extends this opening surface in the downstream direction. In this example the depth of the rim <b>71</b> below the body <b>70</b> is 0.8 mm, and in general it is preferred that it is in the range of 0.5 mm to 1.1 mm. The body extends in the radial (lateral) direction to provide a washer annular shape in general outline, and so it thereby interfaces between a number of components, such as between the piezo <b>46</b> and the reservoir <b>21</b>, and between the support <b>40</b> and the housing <b>21</b>. It therefore provides sealing and balance within the aerosol generating core.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0128">The gasket body <b>70</b> is also an integral base for inner and outer concentric circular top ridges <b>74</b> and <b>75</b> extending in the upstream direction for contact with the housing reservoir. These have a height of 0.3 mm and in general it is preferred that they have a height in the range of 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm. There is a through hole <b>76</b> in the body <b>70</b> to receive the radially inner conducting pin <b>32</b>. There is also a slot <b>78</b> in the outer edge of the body <b>70</b> for mistake-proofing the assembly. It prevents the seal being loaded into the retainer if it is not in the correct annular orientation.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0129">The gasket <b>48</b> is of medical grade liquid silicone rubber supplied as two component compounds which are mixed together and injected into a hot mould to cure. In general, it is preferred that the gasket has a Shore hardness in the range of 20-80 Shore A, more preferably in the range of 30 to 60 Shore A.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0130">The dimensions of the gasket <b>48</b> are in this case, when relaxed:<ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0131">internal diameter, 6.2 mm;</li>        <li id="ul0011-0002" num="0132">external diameter, 14.7 mm;</li>        <li id="ul0011-0003" num="0133">maximum depth, 2.1 mm;</li>        <li id="ul0011-0004" num="0134">height of ridges <b>74</b> and <b>75</b>, 0.3 mm;</li>        <li id="ul0011-0005" num="0135">height of ridge <b>71</b> with respect to the body <b>70</b>, 0.6 mm.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0089" num="0136">In this example the throat <b>8</b> is about 6.0 mm diameter, as defined by the opening <b>72</b> of the gasket <b>48</b> at its lower end closest to the AP. This large diameter throat reduces risk of bubble entrapment due to air ingestion.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0137">The gasket <b>48</b> is tolerant to dimensional variation of plastics housing components from the point of view of sealing, protecting the piezo <b>46</b> and the electrical connections.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0138">The gasket <b>48</b> is located on the retainer <b>6</b> during automated assembly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. This allows accurate placement and automated manufacturing, which is particularly important for accurate location of the gasket relative to the aerosol generator <b>5</b> components.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0139">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the positions before and after full insertion of the retainer <b>6</b> are shown, in which the retainer <b>6</b> and the aerosol generator <b>5</b> are provided as a sub-assembly, and are pushed upwardly against the funnel <b>21</b> lower surface. As is clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in the final position the legs <b>62</b> are snap-fitted into the notches <b>67</b> of the aerosol outlet tube <b>5</b>, at which position the downstream O-ring <b>43</b> and the gasket <b>48</b> are slightly compressed axially. Hence, the manufacturing process can be efficient and tolerant of small placement variations. It is simple to axially load the components of the aerosol generator <b>5</b> (as best shown aligned for manufacture in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), and to then press them axially upwardly against the housing wall <b>21</b> lower surface. This is a robust method of seal location. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> also show a diverging surface <b>69</b> downstream of the throat <b>8</b>, for aerosol flow from the AP.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0140">The throat <b>8</b> diameter of about 6.2 mm is achieved through the opening <b>72</b> diameter of the gasket <b>48</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, there is a tapering of the opening due to the axial compression, providing a funnel shape. The diameter narrows and at the downstream extremity may be in the range of 0.1 mm to 0.3 mm less than the nominal 6.2 mm diameter when the gasket is relaxed.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0141">The tapering of the opening is contributed to by the rim <b>71</b> protruding downwardly and being much more deformable than the body <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0142">Physical Support and Sealing Benefits for the Aerosol Generator <b>5</b></p><p id="p-0096" num="0143">The aerosol generator <b>5</b> is under vertical compression across a large area, providing an excellent seal which is more tolerant to dimensional variation of the plastics housing components.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0144">The upper ridges <b>74</b> and <b>75</b> compress with the axial compression as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, providing grip and robust stability in the high frequency environment, in which the plate may be vibrating at for example 128 kHz. Moreover, the gasket <b>48</b> covers the piezo <b>46</b>, thereby limiting the potential for ingress of moisture from the funnel <b>21</b> at the throat <b>8</b> area to the electrically-conductive components <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>46</b>, and <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0145">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, it will be clear from this diagram that the gasket <b>48</b> provides a large degree of counterbalancing of forces which arise from pressing by the conducting pins <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> against the piezo <b>46</b> and the washer <b>40</b>. This is contributed to by the large bulk of the gasket's body <b>70</b> and large surface abutting the underside of the funnel <b>21</b>. Moreover, the gasket <b>48</b> acts as a cover over the piezo <b>46</b>, thereby helping to protect it from ingress of moisture in the highly humid and high-frequency environment.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0146">The pair of upper ridges <b>74</b> and <b>75</b> are particularly beneficial because they ensure uniform contact with the funnel <b>21</b> all around the gasket's periphery, but are not so high that they prevent contact by the remainder of the upper surface of the gasket when under axial compression.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0147">Bubble Prevention</p><p id="p-0101" num="0148">The gasket <b>48</b> has in this example a fine textured surface finish with arithmetic roughness average, Ra, in the range of 1.6 &#x3bc;m to 3.2 &#x3bc;m. The roughness average parameter Ra is defined in ISO4287:1998+A1:2009 at 4.2.1. Ra is calculated by measuring the average length between the peaks and valleys and the deviation from the mean line on the entire surface within the sampling length. Ra averages all peaks and valleys of the roughness profile and then neutralizes outlier points so that they have no significant impact on the final results. The Ra range of 1.6 &#x3bc;m to 3.2 &#x3bc;m is equivalent to 24 to 30 on the VDI 3400 (Charmilles) surface roughness scale (&#x201c;VDI&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0149">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> the surfaces of two gaskets are shown with a magnification of 1000. The gasket on the left has a surface finish roughness of average of about 1.8 &#x3bc;m, and the gasket on the right-hand side has a surface finish with a roughness average of about 2 &#x3bc;m to about 3 &#x3bc;m. The surface roughness is more visible in the surfaces facing the camera as they are in focus. It is possible to be more accurate about roughness of the left-hand gasket because it is moulded, and surface roughness of the mould steel is accurately known.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0150">Such a surface roughness helps to prevent small bubbles from adhering for a significant time to the internal gasket surface, and hence helps to prevent bubbles from combining. It is preferred that the scale of magnitude of the roughness is comparable to that of the bubbles which tend to congregate and coalesce above the rim of the AP (aperture size 2 &#x3bc;m to 6 &#x3bc;m, and vibration frequency of about 128 kHz. A surface roughness Ra value of 1.6 &#x3bc;m to 3.2 &#x3bc;m is particularly effective for an aperture plate aperture diameter in the range of about 1 &#x3bc;m to 6 &#x3bc;m, and/or a vibration frequency in the range of about 60 kHz to 200 kHz, more preferably in the range of 100 kHz to 160 kHz.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0151"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows bubbles which naturally develop on the upper surface of the AP, especially around its rim, due to air being drawn up thorough the apertures due to the AP vibration at a frequency of 128 kHz. We have found that a surface roughness value of Ra in the range of about 1.6 &#x3bc;m to 3.2 &#x3bc;m is better than a smoother surface. Bubbles rising from the AP tend to be less likely to stagnate on the surface of the gasket.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0152">The desired surface roughness may be achieved in any desired manner. The image on the left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is of a gasket formed by injection moulding, and on the right by 3D printing.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0153">The gasket may for example be moulded from a thermoplastics elastomer material such as those grades supplied by BASF, or as mentioned above by additive manufacturing technologies (3D printing).</p><p id="p-0107" num="0154">There is excellent liquid flow to the AP due to the reservoir having an internal smooth funnel surface leading into a softer material with a higher surface roughness.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0155">In other embodiments the gasket and/or the funnel are coated with a hydrophilic coating, to further reduce risk of bubble stagnation and coalescence. The hydrophilic coating would be thin enough not to affect the surface roughness, but would deter bubbles from coalescing. The hydrophilic coating preferably has a thickness in the range of 0.5 &#x3bc;m to 2.0 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0156">In various examples the hydrophilic coating may be of a monomer composition with vinyl acetate, hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) mixed with oxygen in a given ratio with more HMDSO than O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0157">Alternative Gasket Configurations</p><p id="p-0111" num="0158">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> a nebulizer <b>200</b> has a gasket <b>201</b> instead of the gasket <b>48</b>, and all other components are the same and are indicated by the same reference numerals. The gasket <b>201</b> has a downwardly-depending rim <b>202</b> around its outer edge, at a radial position between that of the two pins <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>. This has the benefit of increasing the extent of enclosure around the piezo, and of contact with the vibrating surfaces, both the washer and the funnel <b>21</b>. The enveloping on both radial sides and the top side of the piezo helps to ensure reliability even if there is a slight leak of moisture into the space over the washer due to a gap evolving between the retainer and the housing.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0159">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> to <b>14</b></figref> an alternative nebulizer, <b>300</b>, has a gasket <b>301</b> instead of the gasket <b>48</b>, and again the other components are the same and indicated by the same reference numerals. The gasket <b>301</b> has a body <b>302</b> extending further radially, and has an aperture <b>303</b> for the radially outer pin <b>31</b> in addition to an aperture <b>304</b> for the pin <b>32</b>. There are upstream ridges <b>305</b> and <b>306</b> which are similar to the ridges <b>74</b> and <b>75</b> of the gasket <b>48</b>. The gasket body <b>302</b> extends radially sufficiently far to engage at its peripheral edge the housing <b>5</b>. The gasket <b>301</b> has an opening surface <b>307</b> which forms part of the throat over the AP, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>14</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0160">This arrangement has the benefit of providing greater surface contact area on the top. Also, it provides a resilient seal between the two mating plastics parts, the retainer and the reservoir/housing.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0161">Alternative Retainer</p><p id="p-0115" num="0162">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref> an alternative nebulizer <b>400</b> has a housing <b>401</b> with an aerosol outlet conduit <b>410</b> with a pair of opposed recesses <b>411</b> with lower edges <b>412</b>. The retainer <b>402</b> has a tubular body <b>403</b> with a pair of opposed legs <b>404</b> with toes for snap-fitting in the opposed recesses <b>411</b>, as for the other embodiments. However, in this case each leg <b>404</b> additionally has a ramp <b>405</b> facing radially outwardly, thereby assisting insertion of the retainer <b>402</b> during manufacture. This reduces the impact when the body is placed down over the retainer during assembly.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0163"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows a retainer <b>500</b> having a main body <b>502</b> with opposed legs <b>504</b> with toes having ramps <b>505</b>. These snap-fit into recesses <b>511</b> with lower edges <b>512</b>. In this case the gasket is the gasket <b>201</b>, which extends fully radially over the piezo and as far as the housing and engages the support radially outwardly of the piezo.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0164">The manner of providing power to the piezo element may be different from that illustrated, without pins which engage the piezo element and support. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>19</b></figref> a nebulizer has a top housing <b>665</b> providing the funnel and a lower aerosol outlet part <b>660</b> which supports an aerosol generator assembly <b>600</b>. In this case there is a top gasket <b>601</b> which forms part of the throat over the AP and extends radially over part of a support washer <b>610</b>. An annular piezo <b>620</b> is adhered by conductive adhesive to the underneath (downstream) side of the support <b>610</b>, hence removing a component from above the support and leaving more scope for a wider throat area. The washer <b>610</b> is supported underneath by an O-ring <b>630</b>, in a manner broadly similar to that of the other embodiments. However, in this case power is provided by an annular spring clip assembly <b>650</b> having an annular body supporting a C-shaped clip which extends radially outwardly and back inwardly to engage the underside of the washer <b>610</b>. There is also a clip <b>652</b> in the general form of a leaf spring which engages the underside of the piezo element <b>620</b>. Hence power to the top surface of the piezo element <b>620</b> is provided via the washer <b>610</b> by the spring clip terminal <b>651</b>, and directly to the bottom surface of the piezo element by the spring terminal <b>652</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0165">It will be appreciated that the invention provides a nebulizer with many significant improvements arising form the upstream resilient seal. By this seal forming part of the throat in the reservoir and also acting as a seal it is a single part which performs two very important functions. It is particularly advantageous that there is no overhang by the housing over the exposed surface of the upstream resilient seal, providing a streamlined approach for liquid delivery to the aperture plate. Moreover, it is possible to modify the seal exposed surface to provide an enhanced benefit for bubble prevention, such as a roughened surface. It is particularly advantages in the examples of the seal exposed surface being funnel-shaped. Another major advantage is that the arrangement of the housing and the upstream seal allows a relatively wide throat, thereby contributing to predictable and efficient liquid flow to the aperture plate.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0166">The invention is not limited to the embodiments described but may be varied in construction and detail. For example, the throat area may have an area greater than 34 mm<sup>2</sup>. It is envisaged that in other examples the gasket may have a downwardly-depending rim akin to that of the gasket <b>201</b> and a top surface area and radial extent akin to that of the gasket <b>301</b>. The downstream resilient seal may not be in the form of an O-ring. It may be a ridge of resilient material extending from the housing, and it may be affixed to the housing. It may have some features of the gasket, such as a body which extends radially outwardly to an extent greater than the O-ring as illustrated. It is also envisaged that in other examples the top gasket downstream-extending rim is not necessarily at the gasket opening, but could be radially outward from it by a small extent.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0167">Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>19</b></figref> power may be supplied by contacts other than conducting pins. The power conductor may comprise at least one first spring contact engaging the support or vibration generator, and a second spring contact engaging the other of the vibration generator or support, said first and second spring contacts providing opposed electrical contacts for power delivery to the vibration generator. The support may extend further radially than the vibration generator, and the first spring contact engages a support surface laterally of the vibration generator. The second spring contact may directly contact the vibration generator. At least one of said spring contacts may be in the form of a resilient ridge which is arc-shaped in axial (longitudinal) view, and the terminal <b>652</b> is an example. The resilient ridge may extend at least partly around the aperture plate. The resilient ridge may extend in the upstream direction from a contact assembly base, and the base may also support a spring contact which extends radially outwardly and bends radially inwardly to engage a support or vibration generator surface. The bend may provide the resilience for the spring contact. A spring contact with a bend may engage the support radially outwardly of the vibration generator.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0168">The spring contacts may be mounted to a contact assembly which is mounted to the housing on either upstream or downstream sides, but preferably downstream as this allows more space for a wide throat area.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0169">It is also envisaged that the gasket may only have a very limited body extending radially, but provides excellent advantages by way of resilient upstream support and also preferably roughness of the surface in contact with the liquid where it forms part of the funnel throat. In one example the gasket body only extends to approximately the radial extent of the ridge <b>74</b>. In general, any of the features of nebulizers described herein may be employed in different combinations with other features than illustrated. Also, it is envisaged that the housing may be provided by a greater or lesser number of parts which interconnect together. For example, the aerosol outlet may be a discrete component which fits to the reservoir or to an intermediate housing component. Ultrasonic welds may for example be used to join parts together.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
