Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a process for the production of syngas, in particular via continuous partial oxidation of methane with CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O using metal oxides.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Syngas, or synthesis gas, is a fuel gas mixture consisting primarily of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which may be used for production of hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and importantly, synthetic hydrocarbon fuels. Syngas can be produced from many sources, including natural gas, coal, biomass, or virtually any hydrocarbon feedstock and H<sub>2</sub>O/CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In particular, the production of syngas from renewable sources is a sought-after approach as it would be a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel derived liquid fuels.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The synthesis of liquid fuels, e.g. via Fischer-Tropsch process is however best achieved from syngas when the molar ratio of the carbon monoxide and the hydrogen in the syngas is about 1:2.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The constituents of syngas may be produced via multiple known processes, such as for example steam reforming, where steam is reacted at high temperature and pressure with methane in the presence of a metal nickel catalyst at industrial scale. However, steam reforming yields carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a 1:3 molar ratio and is thus poorly suited for the production of liquid fuels. Other processes, which are known but have not yet seen application at an industrial scale because of durability issues are for example dry reforming and mixed reforming.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Dry reforming is represented via the reaction CO<sub>2</sub>+CH<sub>4</sub>&#x2192;<b>2</b>H<sub>2</sub>+2 CO, and thus yields carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a 1:1 molar ratio.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Mixed reforming is represented via the reaction 2/3 H<sub>2</sub>O+1/3 CO<sub>2</sub>+CH<sub>4</sub>&#x2192;8/3 H<sub>2</sub>+4/3 CO, and thus yields carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a 2:1 molar ratio.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In both dry and mixed reforming, the feed gas of methane, carbon dioxide and eventually steam is contacted with a metal catalyst at elevated temperatures in order for the formation of syngas to occur. While in principle, dry or mixed reforming constitute attractive processes that may be used in an industrial setting to produce syngas having a more favorable ratio of hydrogen and carbon monoxide for the subsequent liquid fuel synthesis when compared to steam reforming, they both suffer from carbon depositions, which are the result from unwanted side-reactions within the reactor that inactivate and ultimately irreversibly damage the metal catalysts.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">While it has been proposed to remove the carbon depositions from the catalyst via different measures, such measures are themselves accompanied by drawbacks, which hinder their adoption, especially at an industrial scale. For instance, it has been proposed to briefly burn off the carbon depositions by running the reactor on air or other gases, but the thermal stress generated on the catalyst in the reactor leads to sintering damage or phase changes in the material.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is therefore desirable to provide a process for the production of syngas that on one hand provides a syngas having the desired ratio between hydrogen and carbon monoxide for liquid fuel synthesis and on the other hand which can be carried out robustly such as to allow its use at an industrial scale without penalty in conversion and selectivity. &#x201c;Reforming of Biogas over Co&#x2014; and Cu-Promoted Ni Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-ZrO<sub>2</sub>Nanocatalyst Synthesized via Sequential Impregnation Method&#x201d;; M.Sharifi, M.

The hydrocarbon gas conversion can be boosted at lower temperatures by feeding excess regenerating gas. However, the excess regenerating gas will stay unconverted and remain in the produced syngas.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">When the process of the present invention is carried out using the feedstock gas having the claimed composition and mole fractions thereof under the claimed temperature conditions the process for the production of syngas relies on the metal oxide being locally cycled between a reduced non-stoichiometric state and an oxidized non-stoichiometric state. Because of the ability of the metal oxide to transport oxygen via its lattice structure, it is believed that the micro-fluctuations of the metal oxide between non-stoichiometric states are buffered by the metal oxide and that this buffering is also what allows to avoid carbon deposition by oxidation of the carbon towards carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. It has been surprisingly observed that by simultaneously providing a hydrocarbon, carbon dioxide and optionally steam to the reaction chamber comprising the metal oxide, these advantages may be obtained.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is to be noted that a part of the constituent hydrogen and/or carbon monoxide of the syngas is generated from the hydrocarbon gas comprised in the feed gas, which contacts the metal oxide in a first non-stoichiometric state M<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y&#x2212;&#x3b1;</sub>such as to reduce said metal oxide in a first non-stoichiometric state M<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y&#x2212;&#x3b1;

In addition, in the case of ceria, when a is about 0.1 or more, another side-reaction where non-stoichiometric ceria reacts with the generated hydrogen and/or carbon monoxide to yield steam and carbon dioxide can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0088">In a preferred embodiment of the process for the production of syngas according to the invention and in the case where the metal oxide is a nickel-ferrite (NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4&#x2212;&#x3b1;</sub>/NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4&#x2212;&#x3b2;</sub>), &#x3b2;&#x2212;&#x3b1; is in the range of 0.01 and 0.2 and can preferably be in the range of 0.02 to 0.05 or in the range of 0.05 to 0.2.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0089">In a preferred embodiment of the process for the production of syngas according to the invention and in the case where the metal oxide is a nickel-ferrite (NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), R is in 0.3 or more; or in the range of 0.3 and 0.5, and a is in the range of 0.3 or more, or in the range of 0.3 and 0.5.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0090">In a preferred embodiment of the process for the production of syngas according to the invention and in the case where the metal oxide is a solid solution of ceria and zirconia such as Ce<sub>0.85</sub>Zr<sub>0.15</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(Ce<sub>0.85</sub>Zr<sub>0.15</sub>O<sub>2&#x2212;&#x3b1;</sub>/Ce<sub>0.85</sub>Zr<sub>0.15</sub>O<sub>2&#x2212;&#x3b2;</sub>), &#x3b2;&#x2212;&#x3b1; is in the range of 0.01 and 0.1 and can preferably be in the range of 0.02 to 0.05 or in the range of 0.05 to 0.1.
