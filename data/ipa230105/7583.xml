More particularly, the following discussion relates to systems, devices, and automated processes that reduce power drawn by radio frequency (RF) radios based on commercial power interrupts or failures in 5G data networks or the like by smart bandwidth adaptation and traffic loading increasing the operating time of the switched backup uninterruptible power supply (UPS).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The 5G data standard and telephone networks were developed to provide greatly improved bandwidth and quality of service to mobile telephones, computers, internet-of-things (IoT) devices, and the like. The high-bandwidth 5G networks, however, face additional challenges that are now being recognized. In part, because of the high-bandwidth, the 5G base station is expected to consume roughly three times as much power as the legacy 4G base stations in use. Further, more 5G base stations are needed to cover the same area as the legacy 4G base stations. Hence, not only does each 5G base consume three times the power of the 4G base station, for coverage of the same area more 5G base stations are in use, and as a result, significant increases in power consumption will result.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, along with the increases in power usage, in the case of AC power outages, the 5G base stations are required to have a battery backup to ensure service offerings during AC power outages. These battery backup units are expensive, and the cost for the battery backup is in part determined by the amount of the power needed and subsequently consumed by the RF radio transmitters and receivers at the 5G base station; which in this case exceeds the legacy 4G base stations by both number in use and the power need for each 5G base station. In these cases in which significant amounts of power are needed and consumed by certain 5G base stations, there is needed several serially or parallelly connected backup power packs that result in multiple fold cost increases in the eventual configured 5G base stations for each cell site.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Slot is typical unit for transmission used by scheduling mechanism. New Radio allows transmission to start at any OFDM symbol and to last only as many symbols as required for communication. This is known as &#x201c;mini-slot&#x201d; transmission. This facilitates very low latency for critical data communication as well as minimizes interference to other RF links. Mini-slot helps to achieve lower latency in 5G new radio architecture.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore it is desired to provide a solution to implement a scheduler to reduce enabled slots (i.e., uplink or downlink), for example, implementing mini-slots that do not require all 14 symbols in a slot configuration for scheduling to manage power consumption without causing any cell site interruptions in service. Also, it is desirable to change the frequency in a time domain for scheduling as well the enabled/not enabled slots. The scheduler can implement scheduling based on the time domain, and the mini-slots are enabled or disabled to reduce the power requirements of all the operating carriers of cell sites in a network, particularly in case of an AC power outage or interruption for enhanced power management efficiencies of each cell site.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is, therefore, desirable to create systems, devices, and automated processes that can monitor commercial power interrupts and failures and allow different configurations of base station components to operate in the desired cell network. It is also desirable to improve connectivity and to the operating time for base station equipment operating in backup power modes using backup batteries at cell sites within 5G or similar networks.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The exemplary embodiments will hereinafter be described in conjunction with the following drawing figures, wherein like numerals denote like elements, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary diagram of components in a mini-slot scheduling and b power management system in a wireless data networking environment in accordance with various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary diagram of a feedback communication loop for power management of a base station responsive to a commercial power interrupt or failure of the base station power management system in a wireless data networking environment in accordance with various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary flowchart for power management of a base station responsive to a commercial power interrupt or failure of the base station power management system in accordance with various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a flowchart of an adaptive enabling slot scheduling solution for mini-slot scheduling in accordance with various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrates exemplary diagrams of an mini-slot architecture in accordance with various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary flowchart of scheduling mini-slots responsive to AC power outages, power interrupts, or channel usage in accordance with various embodiments; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a diagram of an example of user equipment (UE) and network architecture, for example, an automated process for reducing power consumption in accordance with various embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Systems, devices, and automated processes are provided to provide mini-slot patterns to reduce the power draw of a backup power supply to a cell site in response to a power loss or lack of channel congestion at a cell site.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an exemplary embodiment, a system for adaptive mini-slot management in a network is provided.

Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented in the preceding background or the following detailed description.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">When connecting a 5G base station to the power grid, this does not always guarantee that power is available and provided to the 5G base continuously all the time without interruption because of a plethora of environmental and operating reasons such as accidents, lightning strikes, rolling blackouts, etc. Therefore, for a robust and reliable 5G service made available from a 5G base station, carriers have to build in a backup power system. It is the norm to provide backup power to the macrocells in a 5G network, and often the macro level has sufficient service. However, the power-consuming small cell structure requires added power backup that is not usually available in legacy 4G cell tower power deployments. Hence, added backup power is essential to enable the proper functioning of the small cell rollout.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In 5G networks, the RF radio units are required to have a battery backup to ensure service offerings during an AC power outage. The battery backup units are expensive, and the cost for each battery backup is calculated by the power consumed by the radio unit, the backup duration, and how many operating carriers are at a base station or network.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Currently, there are a number of obstacles or drawbacks that prevent optimization of battery backup capacity when a power interrupt or outage occurs. It is a desire that the required battery backup capacity can be optimized as follows:</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">(1) Shut down Operating carriers: this is not a preferred option, as this impacts the user experience, lack of emergency calls, such as E911, resulting in users canceling their service and switching to operators who have battery backup services; (2) Reduce the operating carrier Bandwidth: this is not easily feasible in current operations as changing the operating carrier BW requires a new cell configuration on the same radio with lower channel BW, and (3) this will also cause service interruption as changing the operating BW will cause the site to restart for the new channel BW to be in effect.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The advanced capabilities of 5G small cells mean added power requirements. Increased data traffic requires more computational power. Although massive MIMO can help improve spectral efficiency, power efficiency is generally lower, and a typical three-sector small cell can require 200-1,000 watts of power.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">There is a need to receive power by a large number of small cells in a cost-effective and repeatable way that supports fast and efficient rollouts. The first step involves recognizing that the traditional model for powering macro cell sites does not apply to small cells.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A-frame has a duration of 10 ms, which consists of 10 subframes having 1 ms duration each similar to LTE technology. Each subframe can have 2&#x3bc; slots. Each slot consists of 14 Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexings (OFDM) symbols. The radio frame of 10 ms is transmitted continuously as per TDD topology one after the other. The subframe is of fixed duration (i.e., 1 ms), whereas slot length varies based on subcarrier spacing and number of slots per subframe. Each slot occupies either 14 OFDM symbols or 12 OFDM symbols based on normal Cyclic Prefix (CP) and extended CP, respectively.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A mini-slot is a minimum scheduling unit used in 5G NR. It occupies 2, 4, or 7 OFDM symbols (regardless of numerology), so a user can be allocated a mini-slot, which is less than the slot (14 symbols), and it is suitable for low latency communication. It enables what is called non-slot based scheduling that will have higher priority than normal Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) user, so it can preempt other eMBB transmissions as it has requirements for lower latency.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A slot can be classified as downlink (all symbols are dedicated for downlink) or uplink (all symbols are dedicated for uplink) or mixed uplink and downlink transmissions. In the case of Frequency Division Duplex (FDD), all symbols within a slot for a downlink carrier are used for downlink transmissions and all symbols within a slot for an uplink carrier are used for uplink transmissions.

When commercial power is interrupted, lost, or dramatically reduced, the RF radio is not able to receive notice to modulate its power consumption accordingly. In other words, the RF is not informed, nor is the RF radio configured to be advised of a commercial power loss and can change or drop its preconfigured input power requirements. The inability to change the input power requirements of the RF radio results in lower performance in its operation by causing a faster drain on its battery backup systems.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The 5G New Radio (NR) is the global standard for a unified, capable 5G wireless interface, can deliver a faster broadband experience, and is designed to have an initial bandwidth part (BWP) that is used by all the UE during initial access and dedicated BWP for a UE or group of UEs that will apply for data allocations. The BWP adaptation is controlled by a gNB node (radio access network (RAN)+distributed unit (DU)/centralized unit (CU) for 5G). There can be multiple smaller BWP(s) that will be predefined by the operator to be used during AC power outages (i.e., a RAN slicing architecture that has multiple sets of functional splits and function placement in one cell). In an exemplary embodiment, another option is to use a gradual reduction in the operating BWP. For (e.g., to start with only a 25% percent reduction in BW and then gradually move to lower numbers if the power is not restored). With this process, the user experience can avoid degradation in the case of short AC power outages. The network slicing can also be linked to the BWP, during an AC power outage or light network load operations, the minimization of the power consumption gNB can be done by control of the slice and BWP mutual association. For example, the operator can choose to merge all the available slices into the smaller BWP.

The period for each mini-slot can be changed (In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>) to vary the length. The subframe <b>505</b> is, in turn, divided into slots consisting of 14 OFDM symbols each, which means that the duration of the slot in milliseconds is dependent on the numerology. Having a longer transmission duration (setting a different frequency) helps to increase coverage or reduce the overhead due to switching (in TDD), the transmission of reference signals, and control information. The number of subcarriers is reduced by half, but the number of slots per time unit is doubled. The same frame structure can be used for MD, by enabling simultaneous reception and transmission (that is, DL and UL can overlap in time). In that case, the DL slot structure can be used by the device that is initiating (or scheduling) the transmission, and the UL slot structure can be used by the device responding to the transmission. In various exemplary embodiments, the scheduler can reduce enabled slots <b>525</b> (i.e., for either the UL or DL transmission), for example implementing mini-slots <b>510</b>, which do not require all 14 symbols in a slot <b>505</b> configuration for scheduling to manage power consumption without causing any cell site interruptions in service.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">For reduction of power, a latency of less than 1 ms means that the scheduling interval implemented by the scheduler should be reduced below 1 ms for various services. Using mixed numerologies, the mini-slot intervals (For example, <b>520</b>, <b>515</b>) are reduced (i.e., to reduce the time as the slot time is decreased with higher numerology). Therefore, the scheduler can change the reduce the mini-slot configuration period by changing the frequency and also reduce the latency time for the DL and UL transmissions by not enabling mini-slots that do not carry traffic. In an exemplary embodiment, the 5G NR, the UE can be configured with up to 4 BWPs of different numerologies, which can be used to reduce the latency for certain services. If a device is capable of simultaneous reception of multiple bandwidths parts, then on a single carrier, mixed transmissions of different numerologies for a single device can be performed.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the downlink, a device is not assumed to be able to receive downlink data transmissions, more specifically the PDCCH or PDSCH, outside the active bandwidth part. The numerology of the PDCCH and PDSCH are restricted to the numerology configured for the bandwidth part. In the uplink, a device transmits PUSCH and PUCCH in the active uplink bandwidth part only.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Also, since a slot is defined as a fixed number of OFDM symbols, a higher subcarrier spacing (At higher carrier frequency) leads to a shorter slot duration, which can be used to support lower-latency transmission. The NR allows for the transmission over a part of the slot by the mini-slot transmission, and this transmission can also preempt the other ongoing transmission allowing for immediate transmission of data requiring very low latency.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary flowchart of reassigning users allocating various patterns of mini-slots by the scheduler at different frequencies to reduce power usage responsive to AC power outages, power interrupts, or light channel traffic detected in accordance with various embodiments. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, at task <b>610</b>, an AC power outage is detected, or it is determined in response in a variety of ways, for example via feedback (i.e., messages) communicated and received by the Base Station controller of an impending AC power interrupt or AC power outage detected in another part of the network, from the monitoring of the input current to the current Base Station, or from monitoring traffic channel congestion at various slots and mini-slots in use for UL and DL transmissions.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As a result, at task <b>620</b>, the adaptive mini-slot scheduling pattern solution is executed by a scheduler for changing the current slot, and mini-slot configuration to a reduced set of mini-slots for UL and DL transmissions and also changing of the frequency to reduce power consumption at a node. For example, the Base Station may be currently operating via a carrier of a select frequency (e.g., 15 kHz) with a default slot configuration with mini-slots. Also, at the same time, a complementary BWP arrangement of four BWP parts of an initial BWP and other BWPs (1 to 3) may also be in use that make up the entire BWP in use for the UE (i.e., essentially all of the UEs in use) connected with the initial access in use for data allocation by the gNB (i.e., RAN+DU/CU). At task <b>630</b>, a multiple set of mini-slots are defined and patterned for use in the UL and DL transmissions. In each set of mini-slots in the UL and DL transmissions, some of the mini-slots in the mini-slot configuration period in the UL and DL are enabled and some disabled for better latency and less power consumption. At task <b>640</b>, the pattern of mini-slots for the UL and DL transmits is adapted as determined by traffic channel congestion on each mini-slots used. At task <b>650</b>, the scheduler may decide (or determine) to change the frequency for the slot configuration period from 1 ms to 0.5 ms etc. For example, the frequency can be increased from 15 mKHz, to 30 mKhz etc., and with each increase, the period is reduced in half and the number of mini-slots remains constant. The duration of each mini-slot is reduced. This supports a low latency and reduced power consumption for each mini-slot transmission by enabling UL and DL transmissions over variable periods for each mini-slot based on a set of frequencies, and a mini-slot is a fraction of a slot. Also, the UL and DL transmissions are not enabled to mini-slots to receive DL and UL data transmissions outside an active bandwidth part. Also, a frequency of the mini-slot configuration period by applying a set of time-domain scheduling periods to a select number of mini-slots is enabled in each time-domain scheduling period. The scheduler unit can also use a certain number of OFDM symbols to enable a dynamic set of mini-slots to send and receive data requests in scheduled operations and can allocate OFDM symbols to enable and disable a certain number of mini-slots in the slot configuration period to deliver channel traffic when a mini-slot allocation over a large bandwidth is deemed by the scheduler unit is unnecessary due to decreases in amounts of data transmitted that results and is indicative of less active mini-slots required at a cell site.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">At task <b>660</b>, the scheduler continues to adapt the mini-slot pattern to the outage or channel traffic levels by enabling or disabling certain mini-slots or allocating more or fewer mini-slots to the DL or UL transmissions and to change the frequency to reduce latency and power consumption in configured mini-slot periods. At task <b>670</b>, if the AC power is restored or the channel congestion levels increase, certain mini-slots are enabled in the DL and UL transmissions to an eventual normal operating state. Also, the frequency is decreased to a normal mini-slot configuration period of 1 ms at 15 kHz. The active BWPs may also be increased or decreased to keep a certain threshold of the QoS of the cell site during the changed power or load conditions.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an exemplary illustration of a UE and network configuration in accordance with an embodiment.

The UE <b>710</b> communicates with the network and reads broadcasted system information at a cell <b>810</b> in which the UE <b>810</b> is camped in an idle mode. For example, if the UE <b>710</b> is camped at a cell A, then the UE <b>710</b> would receive slice IDs and slice offset values for neighboring cells of cell A via the transceiver <b>720</b> and process the information via the processor <b>715</b> to perform measurements and calculate using cell reselection equations of the cell reselection module <b>725</b> (e.g., using a cell reselection logic or process) to select a next cell where the cell reselection process is based on a ranking of the neighboring cells.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The scheduling unit <b>755</b> can communicate (like the BW adaptation module <b>760</b>) via element management systems (EMS) <b>790</b> (i.e., control unit) to direct various logic components like a scheduler allocating slots, mini-slots and setting mini-slot configuration periods by managing a set of frequency settings by an automated workflow of the cell <b>810</b> of the parts (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the radio receiver, the UPS, battery circuit (i.e., DC power supply), the cell site (i.e., node) calls/dropped calls/throughput in operation, the server.

The automated workflow maintains the network availability and monitors the status of network devices, including the commercial power supplied to the network. The EMS <b>790</b> can also be connected to multiple eNodeB for power management. When an AC power outage in the network occurs, the automated workflow which is monitoring the network instructs the EMS <b>790</b> via various logic components to reduce the output power of the radio receiver and also takes into account other factors by communicating with the radio receiver, cell site via a router (or another communication link) connected to the server <b>820</b> in reducing the output power for transmission.
