ES cells are pluripotent, being capable of differentiating into all cells in the body. At the current time, human ES cells are able to be used in cell transplantation therapy for numerous diseases including Parkinson's disease, juvenile onset diabetes and leukemia. However, certain barriers exist against transplantation of ES cells. In particular, transplantation of ES cells can provoke immunorejection similar to the rejection encountered after unsuccessful organ transplantation. Moreover, there are many ethical considerations as well as critical and dissenting opinions against the use of ES cell lines that have been established by destruction of human embryos.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It was against this background that Professor Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University successfully established a line of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) by transferring four genes: Oct3/4, Klf4, c-Myc and Sox2, into somatic cells. For this, Professor Yamanaka received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2012 (see PTL 1, for example). iPS cells are ideal pluripotent cells which are free of issues of rejection or ethical problems. Therefore, iPS cells are considered promising for use in cell transplantation therapy. In recent years, techniques have also been established allowing creation of specific cells from other cells by transfer of specific genes into the cells. Such techniques are expected to be applicable for transplant medicine and drug screening, similar to iPS cells.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Numerous methods for altering iPS cells to somatic cells exist in the prior art. For utilization of iPS cells in transplantation therapy, however, it is important to establish highly efficient differentiation-inducing methods for iPS cells. Specifically, it is necessary to establish techniques to be used for inducing differentiation of iPS cells to somatic cells, improving the differentiation-inducing efficiency and precision and ensuring that the functionality of the created somatic cells is able to withstand transplantation therapy.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Methods for inducing differentiation of iPS cells or embryonic stem cells (ES cells) to somatic cells have included methods that imitate the process of development, by combining hormones or growth factors that are the determinants of the properties of the cells, as well as low molecular compounds, and varying their quantity ratios or concentrations with time. However, it is difficult to completely emulate the development process in vitro, and efficiency is also poor. Moreover, inducing differentiation of human somatic cells requires a much longer differentiation-inducing period than for mice, with 3 months or longer, for example, being necessary to prepare mature nerves. Another problem is that differentiation-inducing efficiency differs widely depending on the type of ES/iPS cells, while the properties of induced somatic cells are non-homogeneous.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Specifically, cells whose differentiation has been induced from human ES/iPS cells by methods utilizing hormones or chemical substances have been confirmed to be fetal-stage somatic cells in the initial stages. It is extremely difficult to induce differentiation of mature human somatic cells, and their culturing requires long periods of several months. However, for innovative drug development and transplant medicine for fully developed individuals, it is very important to prepare somatic cells that match the maturation level of the individual.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For neurons, which include cells of a variety of different subtypes, it is not possible to induce differentiation of neuronal subtypes in a uniform manner from ES/iPS cells by methods utilizing hormones or chemical substances. Therefore, innovative drug screening specific for designated neuronal subtypes is not possible. This lowers the efficiency for innovative drug screening. For transplant medicine as well, it is not possible to concentrate and transplant only specific diseased cells.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For this reason, methods have been proposed wherein genes for the properties of specific somatic cells are directly transferred into ES/iPS cells using viruses, to create the desired somatic cells. Methods using viruses allow specific creation of mature neurons in very short time periods compared to methods using hormones or chemical substances, such as 2 weeks, for example. Moreover, creating neurons by specific gene transfer allows excitatory nerves alone, for example, to be obtained in a homogeneous manner. Therefore, specific innovative drug screening for specific neuronal subtypes becomes possible, potentially making it possible to concentrate and transplant only cells specific to a disease, for transplant medicine.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">When iPS cells have been differentiated to somatic cells, there is a risk of undifferentiated iPS cells remaining among the differentiated somatic cells. Methods have therefore also been established for differentiating somatic cells into different somatic cells without requiring iPS cells. Specifically, methods have been developed for differentiating fibroblasts into myocardial cells or neurons. Such methods are known as direct reprogramming, and because they do not involve pluripotent stem cells such as iPS cells there is no risk of undifferentiated pluripotent cells remaining at the time of transplantation.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">[PTL 1]: Japanese Patent Publication No. 4183742</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Somatic cells are established by introducing inducing factors such as genes into cells which are then subjected to amplifying culturing, and cryopreserved if necessary. However, the following problems are involved in the preparation and industrialization of somatic cells for clinical use (for example, GLP or GMP grade).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">1) Cost</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Somatic cells for clinical use must be prepared and stored in a cleanroom kept in a state of very high cleanliness. The cost for maintaining the required level of cleanliness, however, is extremely high. The preparation of somatic cells for clinical use is therefore very costly, and this has been a great hindrance against industrialization.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">2) Quality</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The series of operations from establishment of somatic cells to their storage are complex, and many of them must be carried out by hand. Moreover, the preparation of somatic cells often depends on a personal level of skill. Therefore, the quality of somatic cells for clinical use varies depending on the preparer and on the particular experimental batch.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">3) Time</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to prevent cross-contamination with cells other than those of a particular donor in the cleanroom, somatic cells for clinical use from only a single individual are prepared in the same cleanroom over a prescribed period of time. In addition, long time periods are necessary to establish somatic cells for clinical use and evaluate their quality. However, since somatic cells for clinical use are only prepared once for a single individual in the cleanroom, a very long period of time becomes necessary to prepare somatic cells for clinical use for many different individuals.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">4) Personnel</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As mentioned above, currently the preparation of somatic cells for clinical use is for the most part carried out by hand. Nevertheless, few technicians have the skills necessary for them to prepare somatic cells for clinical use.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">To counter this problem, it is an object of the present invention to provide a somatic cell production system that allows production of somatic cells. Incidentally, the somatic cells are not limited to somatic cells for clinical use.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a somatic cell production system comprising a preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel through which a preintroduction cell-containing solution passes, a factor introducing device that is connected to the preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel and introduces a somatic cell inducing factor into preintroduction cells to prepare inducing factor-introduced cells, and a cell preparation device in which the inducing factor-introduced cells are cultured to prepare somatic cells.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The somatic cell production system may further comprise an enclosure that houses the preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel, factor introducing device and cell preparation device.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this somatic cell production system, somatic cells created by introduction of a somatic cell inducing factor may have the pluripotent stem cells removed.

Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0011" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0053">An embodiment of the invention will now be explained. In the accompanying drawings, identical or similar parts will be indicated by identical or similar reference numerals. However, the drawings are only schematic representations. The specific dimensions, therefore, should be judged in light of the following explanation. Furthermore, this naturally includes parts that have different dimensional relationships and proportions between drawings.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The present disclosure includes an invention that has been provisionally filed in the U.S. (62/356,199), and has already been issued a foreign application permit.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The somatic cell production system according to an embodiment of the invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, comprises a preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel <b>20</b> through which a preintroduction cell-containing solution passes, a factor introducing device <b>30</b> that is connected to the preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel <b>20</b> and introduces a somatic cell inducing factor into preintroduction cells to prepare inducing factor-introduced cells, a cell preparation device <b>40</b> in which the inducing factor-introduced cells are cultured to prepare somatic cells, and an enclosure <b>200</b> that houses the preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel <b>20</b>, factor introducing device <b>30</b> and cell preparation device <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The preintroduction cells are pluripotent stem cells, for example. ES cells and iPS cells may be used as pluripotent stem cells. Alternatively, the preintroduction cells may be differentiated cells, for example. Somatic cells differentiated from somatic stem cells, blood cells and fibroblasts may be used as differentiated cells. Somatic stem cells are also known as adult stem cells or tissue stem cells.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The somatic cells created by introduction of a somatic cell inducing factor exclude pluripotent stem cells. The somatic cells created by introduction of a somatic cell inducing factor are differentiated cells. Differentiated cells include somatic stem cells, nervous system cells, fibroblasts, myocardial cells, hepatocytes, retinal cells, cornea cells, blood cells, keratinocytes and chondrocytes. Nervous system cells may be neurons, neural stem cells or neural precursor cells. Neurons may be inhibitory neurons, excitatory neurons or dopamine-producing neurons. Alternatively, nervous system cells may be motor nerve cells, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells or oligodendrocytes. Nervous system cells may be MAP2-positive or &#x3b2;-III Tubulin-positive.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The somatic cell production system still further comprises an air purifier that purifies the gas in the enclosure <b>200</b>, a temperature regulating device that regulates the temperature of the gas in the enclosure <b>200</b>, and a carbon dioxide concentration control device that controls the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the gas in the enclosure <b>200</b>. The air purifier may also comprise a cleanliness sensor that monitors the cleanliness of the gas in the enclosure <b>200</b>. The air purifier purifies the air in the enclosure <b>200</b> using a HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filter or ULPA (Ultra Low Penetration Air) filter, for example. The air purifier purifies the air in the enclosure <b>200</b> to a cleanliness conforming to ISO standard 14644-1, class ISO1 to ISO6, for example. The temperature regulating device may also comprise a temperature sensor that monitors the temperature of the gas in the enclosure <b>200</b>. The CO<sub>2 </sub>concentration control device may also comprise a CO<sub>2 </sub>concentration sensor that monitors the CO<sub>2 </sub>concentration of the gas in the enclosure <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A door or the like is provided in the enclosure <b>200</b>, the interior being completely sealed when the door is closed, allowing constant cleanliness, temperature and CO<sub>2 </sub>concentration to be maintained for the air in the interior. The enclosure <b>200</b> is preferably transparent so as to allow observation of the state of the interior devices from the outside. The enclosure <b>200</b> may also be a glove box integrated with gloves, such as rubber gloves.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">An inlet communicating with the preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel <b>20</b> may also be provided in the enclosure <b>200</b>. A door or the like may also be provided at the opening. Alternatively, the inlet may be closeable with a removable sealing material. The preintroduction cells are accommodated in the preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel <b>20</b> through the inlet. Alternatively, a preintroduction cell-storing vessel that stores the preintroduction cells and communicates with the preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel <b>20</b>, may be disposed inside the enclosure <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As yet another alternative, the somatic cell production system may further comprise a separating device <b>10</b> that separates the preintroduction cells from blood, disposed inside the enclosure <b>200</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In this case the preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel <b>20</b> is connected to the separating device <b>10</b>. Preintroduction cell-containing solution that has been separated by the separating device <b>10</b> passes through the preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The separating device <b>10</b> in the enclosure <b>200</b> receives vials containing human blood, for example. The separating device <b>10</b> comprises an anticoagulant tank that stores anticoagulants such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), heparin and biologically standardized blood storage Solution A (ACD Solution A, product of Terumo Corp.), for example. The separating device <b>10</b> employs a pump or the like to add an anticoagulant to human blood from the anticoagulant tank.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition, the separating device <b>10</b> comprises a separating reagent tank that stores a mononuclear cell separating reagent such as Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM&#xae; (product of GE Healthcare, Japan). The separating device <b>10</b> employs a pump or the like to inject 5 mL of mononuclear cell separating reagent from the separating reagent tank into each of two 15 mL tubes, for example. Resin bags may be used instead of tubes.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The separating device <b>10</b> also comprises a buffering solution tank that stores a buffering solution such as phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The separating device <b>10</b> employs a pump to add 5 mL of buffering solution from the buffering solution tank to 5 mL of human blood, for example, to dilute it. The separating device <b>10</b> additionally employs a pump or the like to add 5 mL of the diluted human blood to each of the mononuclear cell separating reagents in the tubes.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The separating device <b>10</b> further comprises a temperature-adjustable centrifuge. The centrifuge may be set to 18&#xb0; C., for example. The separating device <b>10</b> employs a moving apparatus or the like to place the tubes in which the mononuclear cell separating reagent and human blood have been placed, into holders of the centrifuge. The centrifuge performs centrifugation of the solutions in the tubes for 30 minutes at 400&#xd7;g, for example. Resin bags may be centrifuged instead of tubes.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">After centrifugation, the separating device <b>10</b> collects the intermediate layers that have become turbid and white by the mononuclear cells in the solutions in the tubes, using a pump or the like. The separating device <b>10</b> employs a pump or the like to deliver the recovered mononuclear cell suspensions to the preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel <b>20</b>. Alternatively, the separating device <b>10</b> also adds 12 mL of PBS, for example, to 2 mL of the recovered mononuclear cell solutions, and places the tubes in holders of the centrifuge. The centrifuge performs centrifugation of the solutions in the tubes for 10 minutes at 200&#xd7;g, for example.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">After centrifugation, the separating device <b>10</b> employs a pump or the like to remove the supernatants of the solutions in the tubes by suction, and adds 3 mL of mononuclear cell culture medium such as X-VIVO 10&#xae; (Lonza, Japan) to the mononuclear cell solutions in the tubes to prepare suspensions. The blood cells may be cultured in a feeder-free manner using a basal membrane matrix such as Matrigel (Corning), CELLstart&#xae; (ThermoFisher) or Laminin 511 (Nippi). The separating device <b>10</b> employs a pump or the like to deliver the mononuclear cell suspension as preintroduction cells to the preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel <b>20</b>. The separating device <b>10</b> may also employ a dialysis membrane to separate the mononuclear cells from the blood. When previously prepared preintroduction cells are used, the separating device <b>10</b> may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The separating device <b>10</b> may also separate cells suitable for induction by a method other than centrifugal separation. For example, if the cells to be separated are T cells, cells that are CD3-, CD4- or CD8-positive may be separated by panning. If the cells to be separated are vascular endothelial precursor cells, then cells that are CD34-positive may be separated by panning. If the cells to be separated are B cells, cells that are CD10-, CD19- or CD20-positive may be separated by panning. The separation may also be carried out by a magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) method or flow cytometry, without limitation to panning.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The inner wall of the preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel <b>20</b> may be coated with poly-HEMA (poly 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) to render it non-cell-adherent, so that the preintroduction cells do not adhere. Alternatively, a material resistant to adhesion of the preintroduction cells may be used as the material for the preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel <b>20</b>. By using a material with good thermal diffusivity and CO<sub>2 </sub>permeability, for example, as the material of the preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel <b>20</b>, the conditions in the preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel <b>20</b> can be rendered equivalent to the controlled temperature and CO<sub>2 </sub>concentration in the enclosure <b>200</b>. In addition, a back-flow valve may be provided in the preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel <b>20</b> from the viewpoint of preventing contamination.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The inducing factor solution-feeding mechanism <b>21</b> in the enclosure <b>200</b> comprises, for example, an inducing factor-introducing reagent tank that stores an inducing factor-introducing reagent solution. The inducing factor solution-feeding mechanism <b>21</b> employs a micropump or the like to deliver the inducing factor-introducing reagent solution to the preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel <b>20</b> or factor introducing device <b>30</b> in the enclosure <b>200</b>, in such a manner that the suspension of preintroduction cells is suspended in the inducing factor-introducing reagent solution.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The inducing factor-introducing reagent solution, such as a gene transfer reagent solution, includes a set comprising somatic cell inducing factor RNA, RNA transfection solution and RNA transfection culture medium, for example. RNA transfection also includes RNA lipofection. The somatic cell inducing factor RNA set includes, for example, 100 ng each of ASCL1 mRNA, Myt1L mRNA and neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) mRNA. Ngn2 (neurogenin 2) is a switch protein necessary for nervous system cell differentiation.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The somatic cell inducing factor RNA may include mRNA corresponding to a drug resistance gene. A &#x201c;drug&#x201d; is, for example, an antibiotic such as puromycin, neomycin, blasticidin, G418, hygromycin or Zeocin. The cells into which mRNA corresponding to a drug resistance gene has been introduced will exhibit drug resistance. Somatic cell inducing factor RNA includes Ngn2-T2A-Puro mRNA (Trilink), for example. Cells transfected with Ngn2-T2A-Puro mRNA (Trilink) produce neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) and exhibit puromycin resistance.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The mRNA may be capped with Anti-Reverse Cap Analog (ARCA) and polyadenylated, and optionally substituted with 5-methylcytidine and pseudouridine. The ability of antibody to recognize mRNA is reduced by 5-methylcytidine and pseudouridine.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The RNA transfection solution includes small interfering RNA (siRNA) or a lipofection reagent, for example. An siRNA lipofection reagent or mRNA lipofection reagent may be used as RNA lipofection reagents. More specifically, the RNA lipofection reagent used may be Lipofectamine&#xae; RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Lipofectamine&#xae; MessengerMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Lipofectamin&#xae; 2000, Lipofectamin&#xae; 3000, NeonTransfection System (Thermo Fisher scientific), Stemfect RNA transfection reagent (Stemfect), NextFect&#xae; RNA Transfection Reagent (BiooSientific), Amaxa&#xae; Human T cellNucleofector&#xae; kit (Lonza, VAPA-1002), Amaxa&#xae; Human CD34 cell Nucleofector&#xae; kit (Lonza, VAPA-1003), ReproRNA&#xae; transfection reagent STEMCELL Technologies) or mRNA-in&#xae; (Thermo fisher scientific).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As an example, the factor introducing device <b>30</b> may introduce the somatic cell inducing factor into the cells and then suspend the cells in culture solution. The factor introducing device <b>30</b> may also carry out transfection of the somatic cell inducing factor several times. After a prescribed time period such as 24 hours, for example, after introducing the somatic cell inducing factor into the cells, the medium may be exchanged and the somatic cell inducing factor again transfected into the cells. The transfection of the somatic cell inducing factor into the cells, and the cell culturing for the prescribed time period, may be repeated several times, such as 2 to 4 times.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">During lipofection of the somatic cell inducing factor RNA, when using a 12-well plate, for example, the number of cells per well is from 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>to 1&#xd7;10<sup>8</sup>, from 5&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>to 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>or from 1&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>to 5&#xd7;10<sup>5</sup>. The base area per well is 4 cm<sup>2</sup>. The amount of somatic cell inducing factor RNA during lipofection of the somatic cell inducing factor RNA is from 200 ng to 5000 ng, from 400 ng to 2000 ng or from 500 ng to 1000 ng, each time. The amount of lipofection reagent during lipofection of the somatic cell inducing factor RNA is from 0.1 &#x3bc;L to 100 &#x3bc;L, from 1 &#x3bc;L to 50 &#x3bc;L or from 1.5 &#x3bc;L to 10 &#x3bc;L.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The culture medium used during lipofection of the somatic cell inducing factor RNA is low serum medium such as Opti-MEM&#xae; (Gibco). The medium used during, and before and after, lipofection of the somatic cell inducing factor RNA may also include B18R protein. B18R protein reduces congenital antiviral reaction of the cells. B18R protein is sometimes used to inhibit cell death due to immunoreaction during insertion of RNA into cells. However, if the cells are to be differentiated into somatic cells in a short period of time, the medium does not need to include B18R protein, or it may contain B18R protein in a low concentration of 0.01% to 1%.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Animal cells differentiate into somatic cells within 10 days, 9 days, 8 days or 7 days from lipofection of the somatic cell inducing factor RNA. When the somatic cells to be created are nervous system cells, differentiation into nervous system cells can be confirmed by whether or not they are positive for &#x3b2;-III Tubulin, MAP2 or PsA-NCAM. B-III Tubulin, MAP2, PsA-NCAM and vGlu are neuron-identifying markers, being constituent proteins of microtubules in neuronal processes.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Alternatively, the inducing factor-introducing reagent solution such as a gene transfer reagent solution may include a Sendai virus vector solution. RNA derived from Sendai virus is not integrated into host DNA, but it allows a gene of interest to be introduced into the host. A Sendai virus vector set includes ASCL1 mRNA, Myt1L mRNA and Ngn2 mRNA, for example, with a MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 0.01 to 1000, 0.1 to 1 or 1 to 10. The inducing factor/Sendai virus vector may also include mRNA corresponding to a drug resistance gene. The inducing factor RNA included in the Sendai virus vector may include Ngn2-T2A-Puro mRNA (Trilink), for example. Introduction of the Sendai virus into the cells may be carried out once.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The factor introducing device <b>30</b> feeds the solution containing the cells into which the inducing factor has been introduced (inducing factor-introduced cells) into the introduced cell solution-feeding channel <b>31</b> using a pump or the like.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The inner wall of the introduced cell solution-feeding channel <b>31</b> in the enclosure <b>200</b> may be coated with poly-HEMA to render it non-adhesive, so that the inducing factor-introduced cells do not adhere. Alternatively, a material resistant to adhesion of the inducing factor-introduced cells may be used as the material for the introduced cell solution-feeding channel <b>31</b>. Also, by using a material with good thermal diffusivity and CO<sub>2 </sub>permeability, for example, as the material of the introduced cell solution-feeding channel <b>31</b>, the conditions in the introduced cell solution-feeding channel <b>31</b> will be equivalent to the controlled temperature and CO<sub>2 </sub>concentration in the enclosure <b>200</b>. In addition, a back-flow valve may be provided in the introduced cell solution-feeding channel <b>31</b> from the viewpoint of preventing contamination. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, one or a plurality of folds may be formed in the interior of the introduced cell solution-feeding channel <b>31</b> to intermittently vary the inner diameter. As another alternative, the inner diameter of the introduced cell solution-feeding channel <b>31</b> may be intermittently varied, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the cell preparation device <b>40</b> connected to the introduced cell solution-feeding channel <b>31</b> comprises a somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b> in which the inducing factor-introduced cells prepared at the factor introducing device <b>30</b> are cultured, a first dissociating mechanism <b>60</b> that dissociates the cell mass (cell colonies) comprising somatic cells established at the somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b> into a plurality of cell masses, an amplifying culturing apparatus <b>70</b> that carries out amplifying culturing of the somatic cells, a second dissociating mechanism <b>80</b> that dissociates the cell mass comprising somatic cells that have been cultured by amplifying culturing at the amplifying culturing apparatus <b>70</b> into a plurality of cell masses, and a somatic cell transport mechanism <b>90</b> that delivers the somatic cells in order to a packaging device <b>100</b>. When no cell mass is formed, however, or when the cell mass does not need to be dissociated, the first dissociating mechanism <b>60</b> and second dissociating mechanism <b>80</b> may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b> may also comprise a culturing vessel including a well plate, bag and tube inside it. The somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b> may further comprise a pipetting machine. The somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b> receives the solution containing the somatic cell inducing factor-introduced cells from the introduced cell solution-feeding channel <b>31</b>, and allocates the solution into the culturing vessel by the pipetting machine.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">When the cells are to be differentiated into nervous system cells, the inducing factor-introduced cells are placed in the culture vessel of the somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b>, and then from the 1st to 7th day, for example, N3 medium (DMEM/F12, 25 &#x3bc;g/mL insulin, 50 &#x3bc;g/mL human transferrin, 30 nmol/L sodium selenite, 20 nmol/L progesterone, 100 nmol/L putrescine) as nerve differentiation medium is added to the culture vessel. ROCK inhibitor (Selleck) may also be added to the medium at a concentration of 10 &#x3bc;mol/L for several days.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The inducing factor-introduced cells are allocated to the culture vessel in the somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b>, and then on the 9th day, for example, the medium is exchanged, with medium exchange being carried out thereafter until the target cells such as nervous system cells are observed. The &#x201c;medium exchange&#x201d; includes partial exchange of the culture medium, as well as replenishment.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b>, drug selection may be carried out, whereby cells into which the drug resistance factor has not been introduced are killed. When the somatic cell inducing factor RNA contains mRNA corresponding to a drug resistance gene, a solution containing the drug is supplied to the culture vessel and the inducing factor-introduced cells exhibiting drug resistance selectively survive. For example, when the somatic cell inducing factor RNA includes mRNA corresponding to a puromycin resistance gene, the lipofected cells may be exposed to puromycin to kill the cells other than those in which the somatic cell inducing factor RNA has been introduced, and select out the cells in which the somatic cell inducing factor RNA has been introduced. The drug may also be present in the medium. The drug concentration may be 2 mg/L, for example.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b>, the inducing factor-introduced cells are cultured for a prescribed period of time using medium containing a drug that kills cells in which the drug resistance factor has not been introduced, after which the inducing factor-introduced cells are cultured in medium lacking the drug.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">When the target somatic cells are formed, the somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b> collects the somatic cells with a pipetting machine. In addition, the somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b> places a vessel containing the collected somatic cells in an incubator, and reacts the somatic cells with the trypsin-substituting recombinant enzyme for 10 minutes at 37&#xb0; C., 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. When the cell masses are to be physically disrupted, there is no need for a trypsin-substituting recombinant enzyme. For example, the somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b> disrupts the cell masses of the somatic cells by pipetting with a pipetting machine. Alternatively, the somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b> may disrupt the cell masses by passing the cell masses through a pipe provided with a filter, or a pipe that intermittently varies the inner diameter, similar to the introduced cell solution-feeding channel <b>31</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">For example, when nerves are to be induced, the somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b> subsequently adds nerve differentiation medium as described above to a solution containing the disrupted cell masses of the somatic cells.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Culturing in the somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b> may be carried out in a bag instead of a well plate. The bag may also be CO<sub>2</sub>-permeable. The culturing may be by adhesion culture or suspension culture. In the case of suspension culture, agitation culture may be carried out. Culturing in the somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b> may also be hanging drop culturing.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b> may also comprise a first culture medium supply device that supplies medium containing a culture solution, inside the culture vessel including the well plate, bag and tube. The first culture medium supply device collects the culture solution in the culture vessel, and it may use a filter or dialysis membrane to filter the culture solution, to allow reuse of the purified culture solution. During this time, growth factors or the like may be added to the culture solution that is to be reused. The somatic cell culturing apparatus <b>50</b> may also comprise, in the culture vessel, a drug supply device that feeds a solution containing a drug that kills cells in which a drug resistance factor has not been introduced.

Moreover, since induction of neurons is possible in a short period of time, this showed that the medium does not need to include B18R protein which is normally used to inhibit cell death caused by immunoreaction occurring during insertion of RNA into cells.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS</heading><p id="p-0175" num="0174"><b>2</b>: Tube, <b>10</b>: separating device, <b>20</b>: preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel, <b>21</b>: inducing factor solution-feeding mechanism, <b>30</b>: factor introducing device, <b>31</b>: introduced cell solution-feeding channel, <b>40</b>: cell preparation device, <b>50</b>: somatic cell culturing apparatus, <b>51</b>: somatic cell solution-feeding channel, <b>60</b>: dividing mechanism, <b>70</b>: amplifying culturing apparatus, <b>71</b>: amplifying culturing solution-feeding channel, <b>72</b>: somatic cell solution-feeding channel, <b>80</b>: dividing mechanism, <b>90</b>: somatic cell transport mechanism, <b>91</b>: pre-packaging cell channel, <b>100</b>: packaging device, <b>101</b>: solution exchanger, <b>102</b>: filter, <b>103</b>: feeding channel, <b>104</b>: feeding channel, <b>105</b>: discharge channel, <b>106</b>: discharge channel, <b>110</b>: cryopreservation liquid solution-feeding mechanism, <b>200</b>: enclosure, <b>201</b>: blood storing unit, <b>202</b>: blood solution-feeding channel, <b>203</b>: mononuclear cell separating unit, <b>204</b>: pump, <b>205</b>: separating agent storing device, <b>206</b>: solution-feeding channel, <b>207</b>: pump, <b>208</b>: mononuclear cell solution-feeding channel, <b>209</b>: pump, <b>210</b>: mononuclear cell purifying filter, <b>211</b>: preintroduction cell solution-feeding channel, <b>212</b>: pump, <b>213</b>: factor introducing device, <b>214</b>: factor storing device, <b>215</b>, <b>38</b>: factor solution-feeding channel, <b>216</b>: pump, <b>217</b>: introduced cell solution-feeding channel, <b>218</b>: pump, <b>219</b>: somatic cell culturing vessel, <b>220</b>: cell medium storing unit, <b>221</b>: culture medium solution-feeding channel, <b>222</b>: pump, <b>223</b>: somatic cell medium storing device, <b>224</b>: culture medium solution-feeding channel, <b>225</b>: pump, <b>226</b>: waste liquid solution-feeding channel, <b>227</b>: pump, <b>228</b>: waste liquid storage section, <b>229</b>: introduced cell solution-feeding channel, <b>230</b>: pump, <b>231</b>: cell mass dissociater, <b>232</b>: amplifying culturing vessel, <b>233</b>: culture medium solution-feeding channel, <b>234</b>: pump, <b>235</b>: waste liquid solution-feeding channel, <b>236</b>: pump, <b>237</b>: introduced cell solution-feeding channel, <b>238</b>: pump, <b>239</b>: cell mass dissociater, <b>240</b>: amplifying culturing vessel, <b>241</b>: culture medium solution-feeding channel, <b>242</b>: pump, <b>243</b>: waste liquid solution-feeding channel, <b>244</b>: pump, <b>245</b>: introduced cell solution-feeding channel, <b>246</b>: pump, <b>247</b>: solution exchanger, <b>248</b>: waste liquid solution-feeding channel, <b>249</b>: pump, <b>250</b>: cryopreservation liquid storing device, <b>251</b>: solution-feeding channel, <b>252</b>: pump, <b>253</b>: solution-feeding channel, <b>254</b>: pump, <b>255</b>: cryopreservation vessel, <b>256</b>: low-temperature repository, <b>257</b>: liquid nitrogen repository, <b>258</b>: solution-feeding channel, <b>259</b>: cold storage section, <b>260</b>: case, <b>301</b>: bag, <b>302</b>: bag</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
