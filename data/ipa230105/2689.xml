The present disclosure further generally relates to new facilities and conventional refineries that have been wholly or partially converted to operate using internally generated heat derived from external electricity, and heat and electricity obtained from liquid organic hydrogen carriers acting as a source of labile hydrogen. The present disclosure also relates to the use of internal thermal energy to reduce and eliminate the need to combust hydrocarbons as a heat source in order to improve the overall carbon neutral footprint of new and existing hydrocarbon processing facilities. The present disclosure also relates generally to the use of eco-refineries to function as large-scale thermal heat and liquid chemical batteries employing liquid organic hydrogen carriers to store energy in the form of heat and as available labile hydrogen when importing excess electrical energy from the grid and exporting needed electrical energy to the grid when deficit.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional hydrocarbon processing facilities use large amounts of electrical and fossil fuel combustion energy in their operations to process and convert fossils fuels, including petroleum, coal, natural gas and orimulsion (a bitumen-based water suspension) to useful products and fuels. Fossil fuels are not considered to be &#x201c;green&#x201d; or environmentally neutral materials owing to the amount of carbon dioxide released to the environment during their extraction, transportation, processing and conversion to products, and the requisite use of fuels and electricity used in these processing steps. In addition, conventional hydrocarbon processing facilities combust hydrocarbons to produce needed heat and thermal energy for internal operations and thus release carbon dioxide to the environment, and waste a valuable source of energy, e.g. heat and thermal energy typically escaping the facility or deliberately released by cooling towers, redirected to cooling ponds, released in the form of steam or water vapor for cooling to maintain operating temperatures within the various processing units within the facility. While not directly impacting the environment, the loss of this collective heat and thermal energy requires the substitution of energy, either from electricity or the burning of fossil fuels by means of furnaces, to generate heat, hot water and steam that is used in the facilities for processing the raw fossil fuels and refined hydrocarbon products.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The 2016 Paris Accord Agreement identified a net zero greenhouse gas emissions goal by 2050. This target requires the elimination of non-carbon-neutral emissions in three stages, including Scope 1 that requires facilities to be operated in a carbon-neutral (CN) mode, Scope 2 that requires suppliers of goods and services to facilities to be CN; and Scope 3 that requires end-use of goods and services to be CN.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a result, under Scope 1 and 2, there is a need for an improved hydrocarbon processing facility and its associated process units that can better control and reserve thermal energy to improve the overall efficiency of the facility, and more significantly aid in reducing the need for external energy sources, so as to provide for facilities with zero or lowered carbon dioxide production, i.e. a facility that is carbon-neutral (CN) with respect to the environment when the overall energy balance of the facility is taken into account.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is also a need under Scope 3 to replace conventional hydrocarbon fuels, such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels and the like that are simply burnt to power internal combustion engines, turbines and jet turbines for transportation means and electrical energy generation resulting in the production of carbon dioxide that is released to the environment as a greenhouse gas.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure discloses multiple embodiments of apparatus, methods, processes, and systems that may be employed to construct or convert existing hydrocarbon processing facilities to better utilize heat and thermal energy to achieve zero or near-zero carbon emissions resulting in an overall improved carbon-neutral footprint with regard to the environment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure further discloses multiple embodiments employing the use of green electricity from the grid to generate heat and store thermal energy for use within a hydrocarbon processing facility that replaces the need for the combustion of hydrocarbons to generate heat for use in internal processes, as well as apparatus and means to capture, store, transfer and utilize thermal energy for use in the internal processes to improve the overall carbon neutral (CN) footprint of hydrocarbon processing facilities and prevent the waste of resources.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure also discloses multiple embodiments employing the use of liquid organic hydrocarbon compounds (LOHC) to generate heat and thermal energy and hydrogen for use within a carbon-neutral hydrocarbon processing facility, and further to generate or store thermal energy, electrical energy, and hydrogen associated with the internal processes.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure more specifically describes the use of carbon neutral materials and LOHC compounds used with existing and new dehydrogenation equipment, and reversible fuel cells, such as but not limited to solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) that enable the converted hydrocarbon processing facilities to function as large-scale liquid batteries employing the generated LOHC compounds to capture and generate carbon-neutral electricity at utility grid scale as well as for internal operations. For example, during periods of low-cost renewable energy, the converted refinery and hydrocarbon processing facility would import electricity for green hydrogen electrolysis, generation of LOHC materials by hydrogenation and process heating produced or generated by induction heating using the available carbon-neutral electricity or internally stored electricity and captured thermal energy. As a further example, excess hydrogen would be stored in the form of regenerated or labile hydrogen rich LOHC (R-LOHC) for internal use and for export in the form of tailored carbon-neutral fuels to replace conventional hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline, diesel, and the like.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure more specifically discloses multiple embodiments employing the use of liquid organic hydrocarbon compounds (LOHC) to generate heat and thermal energy for use within a carbon-neutral hydrocarbon processing facility, using sources of green electricity, green hydrogen and internally generated hydrogen to store labile hydrogen within the LOHC materials for use internally within the facility, and further to produce tailored LOHC materials useful as fuels for use in ground transportation, commercial transportation and utilities to convert them to operating under carbon-neutral conditions utilizing tailored LOHC materials rather than conventional fuels such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and the like.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present disclosure more specifically discloses multiple embodiments employing the use of liquid organic hydrocarbon compounds (LOHC) in association with a LOHC recycle unit to collect, store and use available sources of clean energy, including green hydrogen, green electricity and carbon-neutral materials by means of converting them to stored labile hydrogen in the form of recycle LOHC, stored heat, thermal energy and electricity via various battery storage technologies for use by the LOHC recycle unit within the converted carbon-neutral hydrocarbon processing facility and its associated process units.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure more specifically discloses multiple embodiments employing the use of liquid organic hydrocarbon compounds (LOHC) in association with a LOHC recycle unit to collect, store and use heat and thermal energy generated therein by means of a heat transfer liquid (HTF) and associated HTF control units, fluid circulation loops, valves, pumps and HTF exchangers to repurpose the use of the thermal energy for internal operation of the LOHC recycle unit and the converted carbon-neutral hydrocarbon processing facility and its associated process units.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, one embodiment of the present disclosure includes the use of electrical energy to electrolyze water to generate green hydrogen for use as a hydrogen source and for thermal energy for processes requiring heat, preferably employing sources of green electricity when available, and alternatively generating internal green energy during periods of renewable energy shortage by means of hydrogen powered fuel cells that utilize the labile hydrogen content in LOHC materials, including those manufactured within the LOHC recycle unit and by dehydrogenation of fuels such as EzH<sub>2</sub>&#x2122;, a product of and registered trademark of the Claire Technologies Corporation, 4115 Blackhawk Plaza Circle, Suite 100, Danville, Calif., 94506, USA. In further related embodiments, LOHC and fuels such as EzH<sub>2</sub>&#x2122; (a trademark of the Claire Technologies Corporation) may be supplied by the LOHC recycle unit for export or used internally to generate heat, electricity, hydrogen, and other associated byproducts that can be exported or repurposed for use within the facilities and its association process units.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further embodiments of the present disclosure describe apparatus, means and processes to construct and convert existing hydrocarbon processing facilities to carbon-neutral facilities that may continue to process fossil fuels under carbon-neutral conditions and in addition to generate carbon-neutral electricity and carbon-neutral LOHC materials for use as alternative fuels and sources of labile hydrogen, but operating under improved carbon-neutral conditions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Embodiments of the present disclosure will enable refinery and hydrocarbon processing facility furnaces to be replaced by HTF heat exchangers using heat exchange fluids (HTF) that can capture, store, and redirect otherwise wasted heat and thermal energy for use within the facilities to achieve an improved or overall carbon-neutral footprint.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further embodiments of the present disclosure enable the replacement of conventional furnaces, which directly release carbon dioxide to the environment, by apparatus, methods and process that are carbon-neutral in operation and help reduce carbon dioxide emission, and wasted thermal energy, thus enabling the reduction and sequestration of carbon dioxide to attain Paris Accord Scope 1 and Scope 2 compliance status.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse (GHG) emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by an organization (e.g., emissions associated with fuel combustion in boilers, furnaces, vehicles). Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling. Although scope 2 emissions physically occur at the facility where they are generated, they are accounted for in an organization's GHG inventory because they are a result of the organization's energy use. (see EPA &#x201c;Scope 1 and Scope 2 Inventory Guidance&#x201d; at the website corresponding to &#x201c;www.epa.gov/climateleadership/ghg-inventory-development-process-and-guidance&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further related embodiments of the present disclosure enable a gradual transition to all CN products that will allow the converted hydrocarbon processing facilities to attain Paris Accord Scope 3 compliance status over time as CN LOHC materials, CN electricity and products are used to replace conventional electricity, hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and the like.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Scope 3 emissions are the result of activities from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organization, but that the organization indirectly impacts in its value chain.

Accordingly, in one exemplary embodiment, a dehydrogenation reaction dehydrogenates an R-LOHC type material used as a third process unit feedstock <b>152</b>, the corresponding third process unit product <b>154</b> from the dehydrogenation process being hydrogen and a S-LOHC type material.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In yet further related embodiments, a fourth heat exchanger <b>136</b> may be employed within the circulation loops <b>128</b>, <b>128</b>&#x2032; for exchanging thermal energy with a fourth process unit <b>126</b>, being for example, but not limited to, a hydrogenation unit for hydrogenating an S-LOHC feedstock as a fourth process feedstock <b>156</b>. The hydrogenation reaction is an example of an exothermic reaction that generates heat useful as thermal energy for storage or direct addition of heat to the circulating HTF.

FCC operation includes contacting a heavy gasoil feedstock with hot circulating catalyst for cracking the feedstock to lower boiling products. Cracking the FCC feedstock by contact with the hot catalyst causes a substantial amount of carbon to deposit on the catalyst. Regenerating the carbon-fouled catalyst involves burning the catalyst in a regenerating unit that is a component of the FCC system. Catalyst regeneration in the FCC generates large quantities of carbon dioxide that may be recovered from the regenerator flue gas for sequestration to contribute to the carbon neutral operation of the CN hydrocarbon processing facility <b>100</b>.
