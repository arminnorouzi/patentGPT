However, various changes, modifications, and equivalents of the methods, apparatuses, and/or systems described herein will be apparent after an understanding of this disclosure. For example, the sequences of operations described herein are merely examples, and are not limited to those set forth herein, but may be changed as will be apparent after an understanding of this disclosure, with the exception of operations necessarily occurring in a certain order. Also, descriptions of features that are known in the art may be omitted for increased clarity and conciseness.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The features described herein may be embodied in different forms, and are not to be construed as being limited to the examples described herein. Rather, the examples described herein have been provided merely to illustrate some of the many possible ways of implementing the methods, apparatuses, and/or systems described herein that will be apparent after an understanding of this disclosure. Hereinafter, while embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is noted that examples are not limited to the same.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Throughout the specification, when an element, such as a layer, region, or substrate, is described as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element, it may be directly &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; the other element, or there may be one or more other elements intervening therebetween. In contrast, when an element is described as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element, there can be no other elements intervening therebetween. As used herein &#x201c;portion&#x201d; of an element may include the whole element or less than the whole element.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any one and any combination of any two or more of the associated listed items; likewise, &#x201c;at least one of&#x201d; includes any one and any combination of any two or more of the associated listed items.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although terms such as &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; and &#x201c;third&#x201d; may be used herein to describe various members, components, regions, layers, or sections, these members, components, regions, layers, or sections are not to be limited by these terms. Rather, these terms are only used to distinguish one member, component, region, layer, or section from another member, component, region, layer, or section. Thus, a first member, component, region, layer, or section referred to in examples described herein may also be referred to as a second member, component, region, layer, or section without departing from the teachings of the examples.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element's relationship to another element as illustrated in the figures. Such spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, an element described as being &#x201c;above,&#x201d; or &#x201c;upper&#x201d; relative to another element would then be &#x201c;below,&#x201d; or &#x201c;lower&#x201d; relative to the other element. Thus, the term &#x201c;above&#x201d; encompasses both the above and below orientations depending on the spatial orientation of the device. The device may be also be oriented in other ways (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations), and the spatially relative terms used herein are to be interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The terminology used herein is for describing various examples only, and is not to be used to limit the disclosure.
