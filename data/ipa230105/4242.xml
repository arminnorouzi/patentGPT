When the release treatment is performed, conductive layer X<b>1</b> (conductive layer <b>22</b>) is easily removed from a mold, that is, peeled off from pattern plate <b>5</b> in the peeling process to be described later.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Step S<b>2</b> is the growth process that is a process of growing conductive layer X<b>1</b> (conductive layer <b>22</b>) by electroless plating. In the present exemplary embodiment, the growth process further includes not only a first growth process of growing conductive layer X<b>1</b> but also a second growth process of growing specific layer X<b>2</b> (conductive layer <b>21</b>) as another conductive layer on conductive layer X<b>1</b>. Step S<b>2</b> corresponds to the first growth process, and the next step S<b>3</b> corresponds to the second growth process of growing specific layer X<b>2</b> by electroless plating.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In step S<b>2</b> (the first growth process), conductive layer X<b>1</b> is grown on parent material <b>52</b> having ultrathin organic film <b>8</b> formed on the front surface thereof by electroless plating. That is, pattern plate <b>5</b> is immersed in a plating solution in which a metal salt and a reducing agent coexist. Here, the electroless plating is performed by immersing pattern plate <b>5</b>, subjected to step S<b>1</b> (the release process), in a plating solution containing nickel, for example, an electroless Ni&#x2014;B plating solution, so that the metal containing nickel is precipitated to form conductive layer X<b>1</b>. That is, here, the plating solution may contain a boron compound as a reducing agent.

That is, in step S<b>3</b> as well, pattern plate <b>5</b> is immersed in a plating solution in which a metal salt and a reducing agent coexist. Here, for example, pattern plate <b>5</b>, subjected to step S<b>2</b> (the first growth process), is immersed in an electroless Cu&#x2014;Ni (copper nickel) plating solution to perform electroless plating, so that metal (copper nickel) is precipitated to form specific layer X<b>2</b> of copper nickel. Specific layer X<b>2</b> is formed to have a substantially semicircular cross section so as to cover conductive layer X<b>1</b>. Here, conductive layer X<b>1</b> is thinner than specific layer X<b>2</b>. For example, a thickness of specific layer X<b>2</b> is about 1 &#x3bc;m to 1.5 &#x3bc;m, whereas a thickness of conductive layer X<b>1</b> is about 0.3 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Lateral width M<b>2</b> of specific layer X<b>2</b> subjected to step S<b>3</b> is larger than lateral width M<b>1</b> of conductive layer X<b>1</b>, and is, for example, about 3 &#x3bc;m to 4 &#x3bc;m. Note that distance M<b>3</b> from an edge of conductive layer X<b>1</b> to an edge of specific layer X<b>2</b> is, for example, about 0.5 &#x3bc;m to 1 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the case where step S<b>2</b> (the first growth process) is omitted, pattern plate <b>5</b>, subjected to the release treatment in step S<b>1</b>, is immersed. The plating solution in step S<b>3</b> does not necessarily contain nickel, and may be an electroless Cu (copper) plating solution. In this case, specific layer X<b>2</b> of copper is formed.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In the above example, conductive layer X<b>1</b> and specific layer X<b>2</b>, which contain copper as metal having a relatively high conductivity, are formed, but conductive layer X<b>1</b> and specific layer X<b>2</b> may contain, for example, silver or gold instead of copper. In short, the plating solution is not limited to those described above.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Through the above growth process, conductive layer X<b>1</b> can be stably formed. In particular, the two-layer structure can be stably achieved by the first growth process and the second growth process.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Step S<b>4</b> is the blackening process. In step S<b>4</b>, a part of a front surface (surface layer) of specific layer X<b>2</b>, formed in step S<b>3</b>, is oxidized to form a blackened layer (that is, adhesion layer <b>4</b>) which is an oxide of copper (here, a copper oxide). In other words, step S<b>4</b> corresponds to a formation process of forming adhesion layer <b>4</b> having adhesion on a side of conductive layer X<b>1</b> opposite to pattern plate <b>5</b> (here, on the front surface of specific layer X<b>2</b> stacked on conductive layer X<b>1</b>). Adhesion layer <b>4</b> made of the copper oxide can be formed by, for example, immersing the surface layer of specific layer X<b>2</b> in an appropriate oxidation treatment liquid to advance roughening of the front surface of specific layer X<b>2</b>. Adhesion layer <b>4</b> can be expected as a layer having a relatively high adhesion with respect to insulator <b>3</b> (the resin layer).</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Note that the blackened layer (adhesion layer <b>4</b>) is not limited to the copper oxide. The blackened layer may be formed by, for example, performing an etching treatment or the like on the surface layer of specific layer X<b>2</b> to perform the roughening of the front surface, or may be formed by a plating treatment (for example, palladium substitution plating). Note that adhesion layer <b>4</b> is not an essential constituent element in the present disclosure. For example, if specific layer X<b>2</b> itself is black, the blackened layer (adhesion layer <b>4</b>) may be omitted. Since adhesion layer <b>4</b> is formed in this manner, conductive layer X<b>1</b> is easily transferred to insulator <b>3</b> by adhesion layer <b>4</b> in the next transfer process. In addition, since the blackened layer (adhesion layer <b>4</b>) is formed, it is possible to reduce the reflection in wiring body <b>1</b>. Note that the blackened layer (adhesion layer <b>4</b>) may be partially removed in a subsequent process.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Step S<b>5</b> is the transfer process. In step S<b>5</b>, transfer member T<b>1</b> is pressure-bonded to pattern plate <b>5</b> subjected to step S<b>4</b>, thereby transferring conductive layer X<b>1</b>, specific layer X<b>2</b>, and adhesion layer <b>4</b> to transfer member Ti. Transfer member Ti is a member which is to serve as base material <b>10</b> and insulator <b>3</b> of (the completed) wiring body <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. Transfer member T<b>1</b> is pressed with a front surface (front surface <b>30</b>) of a member corresponding to insulator <b>3</b> opposing pattern plate <b>5</b>. As a result, conductive layer X<b>1</b>, specific layer X<b>2</b>, and adhesion layer <b>4</b> are embedded in the member corresponding to insulator <b>3</b> of transfer member Ti.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Step S<b>6</b> is the peeling process. In step S<b>6</b>, transfer member T<b>1</b> is peeled off from pattern plate <b>5</b>. As a result, conductive layer X<b>1</b>, specific layer X<b>2</b>, and adhesion layer <b>4</b> are fixed to transfer member T<b>1</b> in an integrated manner. At this time, transfer member T<b>1</b> can be easily peeled off from pattern plate <b>5</b> since pattern plate <b>5</b> is provided with resin layer <b>7</b> and organic film <b>8</b> having easy peelability as described above. In other words, excessive stress is hardly applied to transfer member T<b>1</b> and pattern plate <b>5</b>, transfer member T<b>1</b> can be substantially uniformly peeled off, and conductive layer X<b>1</b>, specific layer X<b>2</b>, and adhesion layer <b>4</b> can be prevented from partially remaining on pattern plate <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In particular, since resin layer <b>7</b> is made of the fluorine-based resin, options of materials for insulator <b>3</b> of transfer member Ti, adhesive layer <b>51</b> of pattern plate <b>5</b>, and the like can be increased when the peelability is considered.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Step S<b>7</b> is the removal process (etching process). In step S<b>7</b>, an etching treatment is performed on front surface <b>30</b> of insulator <b>3</b> to form grooves G<b>1</b> on both sides of conductor <b>2</b>. That is, the removal process is a process of removing a part of specific layer X<b>2</b>. Here, selective etching is performed to remove a part of specific layer X<b>2</b> (and a part of adhesion layer <b>4</b>), and conductive layer X<b>1</b> and insulator <b>3</b> are maintained substantially intact without being removed. However, conductive layer X<b>1</b> may also be partially removed, and the removal process may be a process of removing a part of conductive layer X<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In particular, etching removal is performed by aeration of an etching solution in the removal process of the present exemplary embodiment. Here, for example, an amine-based etchant is used. The aeration is causing the etching solution to contain air (oxygen). For example, the aeration can be performed by spraying the etching solution onto front surface <b>30</b> of insulator <b>3</b>. Specifically, in a place where the fluidity of the etching solution is high, the etching removal proceeds since the oxygen concentration is sufficiently secured in the etching solution. However, in a place where the fluidity of the etching solution is low, the etching removal hardly proceeds because it is difficult to sufficiently secure the oxygen concentration.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Such a difference in the fluidity is controlled so that a part of specific layer X<b>2</b> (and a part of adhesion layer <b>4</b>) protruding to both sides from conductive layer X<b>1</b> is eroded earlier than conductive layer X<b>1</b> when conductive layer X<b>1</b> (conductive layer <b>22</b>) is viewed from the positive side in the Y-axis direction (when viewed from above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). As a result, conductive layer X<b>1</b>, a portion substantially overlapping conductive layer X<b>1</b> in specific layer X<b>2</b> (when viewed from the positive side in the Y-axis direction), and a portion substantially overlapping conductive layer X<b>1</b> in adhesion layer <b>4</b> (when viewed from the positive side in the Y-axis direction) remain. Finally, conductor <b>2</b> as a whole has line width L<b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) having a dimension substantially equal to lateral width M<b>1</b> of conductive layer X<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In short, groove G<b>1</b> is a groove formed by removing a part of specific layer X<b>2</b> (and a part of adhesion layer <b>4</b>) by the etching treatment as an example here. This removal process can form groove G<b>1</b> around specific layer X<b>2</b>, and, when another insulator <b>3</b>X is formed on wiring body <b>1</b>, the adhesion with insulator <b>3</b>X can be improved. In particular, in the removal process, the progress by the etching removal can be easily controlled by the aeration of the etching solution.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Since conductor <b>2</b> has the two-layer structure (conductive layer <b>21</b> and conductive layer <b>22</b>) in the present exemplary embodiment, it is easy to achieve two or more characteristics (for example, easy peelability and suitability for a blackening treatment).</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In addition, the selective etching can be performed since conductor <b>2</b> has the two-layer structure in the present exemplary embodiment, and further, wiring body <b>1</b> including conductor <b>2</b> having a high aspect ratio can be provided by utilizing an effect of the aeration. The aspect ratio referred to herein is a dimension (lateral width) in the X-axis direction relative to a dimension (height) in the Y-axis direction in conductor <b>2</b>. When conductor <b>2</b> having an aspect as high as possible, it is possible to contribute to a reduction in wiring resistance.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Then, the manufacturing method of wiring body <b>1</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment includes the growth process, the transfer process, and the peeling process, and these processes are repeatedly executed using the same pattern plate <b>5</b>, and thus, the quality of wiring body <b>1</b> can be stabilized. In addition, wiring body <b>1</b> can be manufactured by repeatedly using the same pattern plate <b>5</b>, which can contribute to cost reduction as a whole.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In addition, conductive layer X<b>1</b> can be stably formed since conductive layer X<b>1</b> (conductive layer <b>22</b>) is grown by the electroless plating in the growth process. Furthermore, the growth process further includes not only the first growth process of growing conductive layer X<b>1</b> but also the second growth process of growing specific layer X<b>2</b> (conductive layer <b>21</b>) as another conductive layer on conductive layer X<b>1</b>, and thus, the two-layer structure can be stably achieved. In particular, conductive layer X<b>1</b> is thinner than specific layer X<b>2</b>, and thus, the two-layer structure can be more stably formed.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In addition, the quality of wiring body <b>1</b> can be stabilized since pattern plate <b>5</b> is applied to the manufacturing method of wiring body <b>1</b> in the present exemplary embodiment.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">(2.3) Application of Wiring Body</heading><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Hereinafter, the application of wiring body <b>1</b> will be described.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">[Organic EL Display]</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">First, a case where touch sensor A<b>1</b> (touch panel) including wiring body <b>1</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment is applied to organic electro-luminescence (EL) display <b>300</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a schematic enlarged view illustrating a layer structure of organic EL display <b>300</b>.

In this case, a front surface and a side surface of conductor <b>2</b>A can be blackened, and further reduction of reflection can be achieved. Note that step S<b>8</b> may also be applied to the manufacturing method of wiring body <b>1</b> of the first basic example. Blackened layer J<b>1</b> may be partially removed in a subsequent step. For example, in a case where wiring body <b>1</b> constitutes wiring A<b>3</b> of touch sensor A<b>1</b>, blackened layer J<b>1</b> may be removed for the contact portion to cause a part of conductor <b>2</b> to function as a connection terminal in order to enhance reliability related to electrical contact with the input terminal of flexible wiring board F<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">Meanwhile, in step S<b>6</b> of the present modification, umbrella part X<b>21</b> of specific layer X<b>2</b> is embedded in insulator <b>3</b>.
