application is based on and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0085769, filed on Jun. 30, 2021, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the

Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional binary logic-based digital systems have focused on increasing the bit density of information through scaling of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices in order to quickly process large amounts of data. However, with the recent integration to less than 30 nanometers (nm), there has been a limitation in increasing bit density due to an increase in leakage current and power consumption caused by a quantum tunneling effect. In order to overcome this bit density limitation, interest in ternary logic elements and circuits, which are multi-valued logics, is rapidly increasing. In particular, the development of a standard ternary inverter (STI) as a basic unit for implementing ternary logic has been actively carried out. However, unlike an existing binary inverter that uses two CMOS for one voltage source, conventional techniques related to the STI require more voltage sources, require a complex circuit configuration, or have a complicated manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the ternary data processing of the STI, the current characteristics of two components, that is, a current component dependent on a gate voltage and a constant current component independent of the gate voltage, are used. In the case of the conventional STI device, a gate-dependent current is implemented by the thermal diffusion mechanism of a CMOS device, and a gate-independent constant current is implemented by the quantum mechanical interband tunneling mechanism in a PN junction. A conventional CMOS device-based STI process implements the gate-dependent current on the same principle as CMOS, and thus, there is a limitation in the switching capability due to the characteristics of the thermal diffusion mechanism. In order to further improve the ultra-low power characteristics of ternary devices, operating voltage scaling is essential, and for this purpose, a technique capable of overcoming limitations of the conventional switching capability is required.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One or more embodiments include a tunnel field effect transistor capable of
