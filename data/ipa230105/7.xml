As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the trimmer <b>1</b> generally includes a shaft <b>2</b> with a handle <b>4</b> toward one end and a motor housing <b>6</b> enclosing an electric motor <b>8</b> with a motor-driven output, or drive shaft <b>5</b>, for connection to a trimmer head <b>10</b> on the other end. Various powered trimmers (e.g., battery-powered, gas-powered, etc.) may be used with the trimmer head <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the illustrated trimmer head <b>10</b> includes a housing <b>14</b> rotatable about an axis A and a spool <b>18</b> positioned in the housing <b>14</b> for retaining one or more cutting lines <b>20</b>. Cutting line <b>20</b> is wound around the spool <b>18</b> and extends through opposed eyelets <b>22</b> to cut vegetation (e.g., grass, weeds, etc.). In the illustrated embodiment, the trimmer head <b>10</b> is mounted to the drive shaft <b>5</b> of the trimmer <b>1</b> via the spool <b>18</b>. In other words, the spool <b>18</b> is drivingly connected to the drive shaft <b>5</b>, and the trimmer head <b>10</b> is categorized as a &#x201c;spool mounted trimmer head.&#x201d; In particular, a nut <b>26</b> configured to be drivingly connected to the drive shaft may be insert molded into the spool <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In other embodiments, the trimmer head <b>10</b> is mounted to the drive shaft <b>5</b> via the housing <b>14</b>, rather than via the spool <b>18</b>. In such embodiments, a main body <b>30</b> and a cap or top plate <b>34</b> of the main body <b>30</b> are rotatably and axially fixed to the drive shaft <b>5</b>, and the trimmer head <b>10</b> is categorized as a &#x201c;housing mounted trimmer head.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the housing <b>14</b> includes the main body <b>30</b> and the top plate <b>34</b>. The top plate <b>34</b> is spaced above the spool <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) and is keyed to the insert molded nut <b>26</b>. The spool <b>18</b> and the top plate <b>34</b> are thus fixed to one another rotatably and axially via the insert molded nut <b>26</b> to thereby move together. The main body <b>30</b> defines a cavity <b>38</b> for receiving the spool <b>18</b>. A retainer, such as a retainer ring <b>42</b>, is positioned at the upper end of the main body <b>30</b>. The retainer ring <b>42</b> is located on the insert molded nut <b>26</b> and is captured with axial and rotational play between the top plate <b>34</b> and an upper end of the spool <b>18</b>. A spring (not shown) is located at a lower end of the spool <b>18</b> to bias against a lower portion of the housing <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the illustrated embodiment, the top plate <b>34</b> is generally cylindrical and includes a boss <b>46</b> (e.g., a center boss) having an aperture <b>50</b> extending through the boss <b>46</b>. The aperture <b>50</b> is shaped and sized to fixedly receive the insert molded nut <b>26</b>. An outer rim <b>54</b> of the top plate <b>34</b> covers an end of a sidewall <b>58</b> of the main body <b>30</b> to enclose the cavity <b>38</b>. A series of teeth <b>60</b> are positioned on an inner surface of the top plate <b>34</b> and are engageable with a corresponding series of teeth positioned on the retainer ring <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The main body <b>30</b> is generally cylindrical and includes a first end <b>30</b><i>a</i>, a second end <b>30</b><i>b </i>opposite the first end <b>30</b><i>a</i>, and a longitudinal axis <b>62</b> extending from the first end <b>30</b><i>a </i>to the second end <b>30</b><i>b</i>. The longitudinal axis <b>62</b> is collinear to the rotational axis A. The main body <b>30</b> additionally includes the sidewall <b>58</b>, a base wall <b>70</b>, and a protuberance, such as a wear bump or bump <b>72</b>, positioned on the base wall <b>70</b>. The sidewall <b>58</b> defines a pair of eyelet openings <b>74</b> and a pair of retainer openings <b>78</b>. The eyelet openings <b>74</b> are shaped and sized to receive the eyelets <b>22</b>, and the retainer openings <b>78</b> are shaped and sized to receive at least a portion of the retainer <b>42</b>. An inner surface of the base wall <b>70</b> includes a center boss <b>82</b> and one or more ribs <b>86</b>. The center boss <b>82</b> is shaped and sized to receive a portion of the insert molded nut <b>26</b>. The ribs <b>86</b> axially extend from the base wall <b>70</b> and are configured to interface with the spool <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, the wear bump <b>72</b> may be a generally domed-shaped protuberance extending from the base wall <b>70</b> on the main body <b>30</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the wear bump <b>72</b> is a rigid body having a wear surface <b>76</b> delimited by a generally annular chamfered edge <b>80</b>. The chamfered edge <b>80</b> extends between the wear surface <b>76</b> and a body <b>84</b> of the wear bump <b>72</b>. In some embodiments, the chamfered edge <b>80</b> is angled or chamfered at an angle from about 10 degrees to about 75 degrees. In other embodiments, the chamfered edge <b>80</b> is omitted. As will be described in greater detail below, the wear bump <b>72</b> provides a body or boss upon which a user may &#x201c;bump&#x201d; the trimmer head <b>10</b> during operation to extend additional line <b>20</b> from the spool <b>18</b>. The wear bump <b>72</b> further allows a user to rely on a height of the wear bump <b>72</b> to determine a cutting height CH (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref>) of the trimmer head <b>10</b>. Furthermore, the wear bump <b>72</b> is positioned on the main body <b>30</b> to prevent damage to the housing <b>14</b> of the trimmer head <b>10</b> during the &#x201c;bumping&#x201d; or cutting action.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, an edge <b>90</b> is formed on an outer surface of the main body <b>30</b> at a junction between the sidewall <b>58</b> and the base wall <b>70</b>. More specifically, the edge <b>90</b> is generally chamfered. In the illustrated embodiments, the edge <b>90</b> includes a 35-degree chamfer. However, in some embodiments, the edge <b>90</b> may include a chamfer of different sizes.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, an outer surface <b>70</b><i>a </i>of the base wall <b>70</b> includes a first wear ring <b>94</b> and a second wear ring <b>98</b>. The first and second wear rings <b>94</b>, <b>98</b> are generally circular and protrude from the base wall <b>70</b>. The outer surface <b>70</b><i>a </i>of the base wall <b>70</b> additionally includes ribs <b>102</b> protruding from the main body <b>30</b>. The ribs <b>102</b> are positioned between the first wear ring <b>94</b> and the second wear ring <b>98</b> and are equidistantly circumferentially spaced on the base wall <b>70</b> about the longitudinal axis <b>62</b>. In the illustrated embodiments, the main body <b>30</b> includes four ribs <b>102</b>. However, in alternative embodiments, the main body <b>30</b> may include fewer or additional ribs. The ribs <b>102</b> include a thickness equal to the thickness of the wear rings <b>94</b>, <b>98</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">During operation (e.g., a cutting operation) of the trimmer <b>1</b>, the trimmer head <b>10</b> may be bumped against a work surface. The angle at which the trimmer head <b>10</b> is oriented relative to the work surface as it is &#x201c;bumped&#x201d; may depend on the height of the user. For example, typically the base wall <b>70</b> of the trimmer head <b>10</b> is oriented within a range of 0-45 degrees relative to the work surface as it is being &#x201c;bumped.&#x201d; In some instances in which the wear bump <b>72</b> does not extend beyond the wear rings <b>94</b>, <b>98</b>, the wear rings <b>94</b>, <b>98</b> and/or chamfered edge <b>90</b> prevent damage to the housing <b>14</b> of the trimmer head <b>10</b>, regardless of the angle at which the base wall <b>70</b> is oriented relative to the work surface. In other instances, in which the wear bump <b>72</b> extends beyond the wear rings <b>94</b>, <b>98</b> (e.g., along the longitudinal axis <b>62</b>), for example, the wear bump <b>72</b> and chamfered edge <b>90</b> of the main body <b>30</b> protect the housing <b>14</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref>, an amount the wear bump <b>72</b> extends beyond the base wall <b>70</b> impacts an amount the trimmer head <b>10</b> is rotated before the chamfered edge <b>90</b> contacts the work surface.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the retainer <b>42</b> includes a ring <b>106</b> defining a central opening <b>110</b>. The retainer <b>42</b> includes a first series of teeth <b>114</b> positioned on an upper surface of the ring <b>106</b>, and a second series of teeth <b>118</b> positioned on a lower surface of the ring <b>106</b>. The first series of teeth <b>114</b> are engageable with the teeth <b>60</b> positioned on the top plate <b>34</b> of the housing <b>14</b>. Flexible retainer arms <b>122</b> extend from the ring <b>106</b>, each having a retainer member <b>126</b> engageable in the associated retainer openings <b>78</b> to connect the main body <b>30</b> and the retainer <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the spool <b>18</b> includes a generally cylindrical, central body <b>130</b> including a through bore extending through the spool <b>18</b> along an axis <b>136</b> generally collinear to the longitudinal axis <b>62</b>. An aperture <b>138</b> extends through the central body <b>130</b> for receiving line <b>20</b>, such that the aperture <b>138</b> extends radially outwardly along an axis <b>140</b> (e.g., cutting plane) substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>62</b>. With brief reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref>, the cutting height CH of the trimmer head <b>10</b> is defined between the axis <b>140</b> (e.g., plane in which the cutting line <b>20</b> extends immediately after exiting the aperture <b>138</b>) and the wear surface <b>76</b> of the wear bump <b>72</b>. During the cutting operation of the trimmer head <b>10</b>, in which the cutting line <b>20</b> extends outwardly generally along the axis <b>140</b>, the wear bump <b>72</b> can be set on the working surface to provide a guide for the user. This operation assists the user in cutting vegetation at a consistent desired height. More simply, the wear bump <b>72</b> may be utilized by a user to float the trimmer head <b>10</b> along the working surface at a set height while protecting the housing <b>14</b> from damage.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the through bore defined in the central body <b>130</b> is shaped and sized to receive the insert molded nut <b>26</b>. The insert molded nut <b>26</b> is positioned within the through bore and includes a threaded opening <b>144</b> shaped and sized to receive the drive shaft <b>5</b> of the trimmer <b>1</b>. In order to couple the trimmer head <b>10</b> to the drive shaft <b>5</b>, the nut <b>26</b> is tightened around the drive shaft <b>5</b>. A distal end <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the insert molded nut <b>26</b> protrudes through the spool <b>18</b> and is received within the center boss <b>82</b> of the main body <b>30</b> of the housing <b>14</b>. The insert molded nut <b>26</b> additionally includes an aperture <b>148</b> that extends through the insert molded nut <b>26</b> along an axis <b>140</b> generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>62</b>. Specifically, the aperture <b>148</b> of the insert molded nut <b>26</b> aligns with the aperture <b>138</b> of the spool <b>18</b>, thereby forming a passageway for cutting line <b>20</b> to be fed through the housing <b>14</b>, the spool <b>18</b>, and the insert molded nut <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The central body <b>130</b> of the spool <b>18</b> includes a first, upper flange <b>152</b> and a second, lower flange <b>156</b>. The first flange <b>152</b> and the second flange <b>156</b> are arranged in parallel planes. In some embodiments, the spool <b>18</b> may include additional flanges. Teeth <b>160</b> are formed on the upper flange <b>152</b> and are selectively engageable with the second series of teeth <b>118</b> on the retainer <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A spring is located at the lower end of the spool <b>18</b> to bias against the housing <b>14</b>. In the biased position, the retainer <b>42</b> and housing <b>14</b> are biased downwardly by the spring and the spool <b>18</b> is drivingly connected to the housing <b>14</b> via the second series of teeth <b>118</b> located on the lower surface of the retainer <b>42</b> cooperating with the teeth <b>160</b> on the upper flange <b>152</b> of the spool <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">To install cutting line <b>20</b>, an end of a single cutting line <b>20</b> is fed through the passageway in one eyelet <b>22</b>, into and through the aperture <b>138</b> of the spool <b>18</b> and the aperture <b>148</b> of the nut <b>26</b>. The end of the cutting line <b>20</b> is then fed through the passageway in the other eyelet <b>22</b>, such that an equal amount of line extends from each eyelet <b>22</b>. The cutting line <b>20</b> is centered and then wound onto the spool <b>18</b> (e.g., by turning the housing <b>14</b> in a direction opposite to a feed direction while holding the top plate <b>34</b>) until sufficient cutting line <b>20</b> extends from each eyelet <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In operation, the trimmer <b>1</b> is operated to rotate the drive shaft <b>5</b> and, thereby, the spool <b>18</b>. As mentioned above, in the biased, initial position, the housing <b>14</b> and the retainer <b>42</b> are biased downwardly via the biasing spring, and the spool <b>18</b> is drivingly connected to the housing <b>14</b> via the plurality of cooperating teeth <b>118</b>, <b>160</b> located on the retainer <b>42</b> and the top end of the spool <b>18</b>. As a result, the trimmer <b>1</b> can be operated to rotate the drive shaft <b>5</b>, thereby rotating the spool <b>18</b> (along with the housing <b>14</b> and the retainer <b>42</b>) and the cutting line <b>20</b> so that the line <b>20</b> may cut vegetation.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As the trimmer head <b>10</b> is being operated, the trimmer head <b>10</b> may be &#x201c;bumped&#x201d; against the work surface, for example, to dispense additional cutting line <b>20</b>. The housing <b>14</b> (e.g., main body <b>30</b>) and the retainer <b>42</b> move axially on the insert molded nut <b>26</b> against the spring bias to disengage the cooperating teeth (e.g., teeth <b>160</b>, <b>118</b>) on the top of the spool <b>18</b> and the bottom of the retainer <b>42</b>. With these cooperating teeth <b>160</b>, <b>118</b> disengaged, the housing <b>14</b> is free to rotate relative to the spool <b>18</b> so as to dispense additional line. The housing <b>14</b> may be depressed until the retainer <b>42</b> engages the top plate <b>34</b>. At this time, a plurality of cooperating interfaces (e.g., ramps or teeth <b>114</b> formed on the bottom of the top plate <b>34</b>, and ramps or teeth <b>60</b> formed on the top of the retainer <b>42</b>) engage with one another so as to momentarily drivingly connect the housing <b>14</b> with the spool <b>18</b>. Once the housing <b>14</b> disengages the surface, the spring biases the housing <b>14</b> and the retainer <b>42</b> downwardly into the biased position. As the cooperating interfaces <b>60</b>, <b>114</b> on the bottom of the top plate <b>34</b> and the top of the retainer <b>42</b> are disengaged, the housing <b>14</b> is again free to rotate relative to the spool <b>18</b> so as to dispense additional line <b>20</b> until the cooperating teeth <b>160</b>, <b>118</b> on the top of the spool <b>18</b> and the bottom of the retainer <b>42</b> become engaged in the biased position.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Because the wear bump <b>72</b> is positioned on the bottom of the base wall <b>70</b> of the main body <b>30</b>, the wear bump <b>72</b> contacts the work surface rather than the base wall <b>70</b>. Therefore, the housing <b>14</b> is protected from wear against the ground. In some instances, in the event that the user bumps the trimmer head <b>10</b> against the ground at an angle (e.g., the base wall <b>70</b> is oriented at an angle relative to the work surface), the chamfered edge <b>90</b> of the main body <b>30</b> may contact the work surface rather than the sidewall <b>58</b> and/or the base wall <b>70</b>, thereby protecting the housing <b>14</b> from wear.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">With specific reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref>, trimmer heads <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032;, <b>10</b>&#x2033; incorporating different sized wear bumps <b>72</b>, <b>72</b>&#x2032;, <b>72</b>&#x2033; may be selectively used with the trimmer <b>1</b>.
