Demand for the ability to treat clothing with various desirable or protective liquids is rising. In particular, demand for the ability to introduce a scent to dry clothing is growing. Additionally, there is a demand to treat dry clothing with various protective coatings, such as with liquids providing ultraviolet light protection, anti-microbial liquids, or other medicinal liquids.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, clothing is treated, for example with stain removers and the like, prior to washing. However, this method is ineffective for treating cloths with scent, ultraviolet protection, anti-microbial protection, and other similar medicinal liquids because washing the clothes will remove the intended application. Such treatments must be applied to dry clothing after the washing cycle is complete. Currently, the application of such liquids would not involve the use of a dryer, but would instead be done manually on each item of clothing individually, resulting in a large investment of time and treatment materials.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, a dryer appliance capable of applying a scent or other fluid to coat dry clothing is desirable. It is further desirable that such an appliance would operate with minimal additional energy requirements. It is still further desirable that such an appliance could conserve the amount of treatment materials required to accomplish the desired type of clothing treatment.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be apparent from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one exemplary embodiment, a dryer appliance is provided, including a cabinet, a rotatable drum within the cabinet defining a chamber for the receipt of articles for drying, a rotatable roller, an impeller assembly, a reservoir assembly, and a fluid distribution element for dispensing fluid into the chamber.

While described in the context of a specific embodiment of a dryer appliance, using the teachings disclosed herein it will be understood that dryer appliance <b>10</b> is provided by way of example only. Other appliances, including front or top-loaded washer appliances, combination washer/dryer appliances, ovens, dishwashers, refrigerators, and microwave ovens may also be utilized with the present subject matter as well.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Dryer appliance <b>10</b> defines a vertical direction V, a lateral direction L, and a transverse direction T. The vertical direction V, lateral direction L, and transverse direction T are mutually perpendicular and form an orthogonal direction system. Cabinet <b>12</b> includes a front panel <b>14</b> and a rear panel <b>16</b> spaced apart along the transverse direction T, a first side panel <b>18</b> and a second side panel <b>20</b> spaced apart along the lateral direction L, and a bottom panel <b>22</b> and a top surface or cover <b>24</b> spaced apart along the vertical direction V. Within cabinet <b>12</b> is a container or drum <b>26</b> which defines a chamber <b>28</b>. Chamber <b>28</b> defines a front opening <b>29</b> for receipt of articles, e.g., clothing, linen, etc., for drying. Drum <b>26</b> extends between a front portion and a back portion, e.g., along the transverse direction T. In example embodiments, drum <b>26</b> is rotatable, e.g., about an axis that is parallel to the transverse direction T, within cabinet <b>12</b>. Rotation of drum <b>26</b> is driven by drum motor <b>27</b>. A door <b>30</b> is rotatably mounted to cabinet <b>12</b> for providing selective access to drum <b>26</b>. Door <b>30</b> rotates between an open position and a closed position. When in the closed position, door <b>30</b> covers front opening <b>29</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an air handler <b>32</b>, such as a blower or fan, may be provided to motivate an airflow (not shown) through an entrance air passage <b>34</b> and an air exhaust passage <b>36</b>. Specifically, air handler <b>32</b> may include a motor <b>38</b> which may be in mechanical communication with a blower fan <b>40</b>, such that motor <b>38</b> rotates blower fan <b>40</b>. Air handler <b>32</b> is configured for drawing air through chamber <b>28</b> of drum <b>26</b>, e.g., in order to dry articles located therein, as discussed in greater detail below. In alternative example embodiments, dryer appliance <b>10</b> may include an additional motor (not shown) for rotating fan <b>40</b> of air handler <b>32</b> independently of drum <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Drum <b>26</b> may be configured to receive heated air that has been heated by a heating assembly in order to dry damp articles disposed within chamber <b>28</b> of drum <b>26</b>. The heating assembly includes a heater that is in thermal communication with chamber <b>28</b>. For instance, the heater may include one or more electrical resistance heating elements or gas burners, for heating air being flowed to chamber <b>28</b>. As discussed above, during operation of dryer appliance <b>10</b>, motor <b>38</b> rotates fan <b>40</b> of air handler <b>32</b> such that air handler <b>32</b> draws air through chamber <b>28</b> of drum <b>26</b>. In particular, ambient air enters an air entrance passage defined by heating assembly due to air handler <b>32</b> urging such ambient air into entrance <b>54</b>. Such ambient air is heated within the heating assembly and exits as heated air. Air handler <b>32</b> draws such heated air to drum <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Within chamber <b>28</b>, the heated air can remove moisture, e.g., from damp articles disposed within chamber <b>28</b>. This internal air flows in turn from chamber <b>28</b> through an outlet assembly positioned within cabinet <b>12</b>. The outlet assembly generally defines an air exhaust passage <b>36</b> and includes a trap duct <b>60</b>, air handler <b>32</b>, and an exhaust conduit. Exhaust conduit <b>62</b> is in fluid communication with trap duct <b>60</b> via air handler <b>32</b>. More specifically, exhaust conduit <b>62</b> extends between an exhaust inlet <b>64</b> and an exhaust outlet <b>66</b>. According to the illustrated embodiment, exhaust inlet <b>64</b> is positioned downstream of and fluidly coupled to air handler <b>32</b>, and exhaust outlet <b>66</b> is defined in rear panel <b>16</b> of cabinet <b>12</b>. During a dry cycle, internal air flows from chamber <b>28</b> through trap duct <b>60</b> to air handler <b>32</b>, e.g., as an outlet flow portion of airflow. Air further flows through air handler <b>32</b> and to the exhaust conduit.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The internal air is exhausted from dryer appliance <b>10</b> via the exhaust conduit. In some embodiments, an external duct is provided in fluid communication with the exhaust conduit. For instance, the external duct may be attached (e.g., directly or indirectly attached) to cabinet <b>12</b> at rear panel <b>16</b>. Any suitable connector (e.g., collar, clamp, etc.) may join the external duct to the exhaust conduit. In residential environments, the external duct may be in fluid communication with an outdoor environment (e.g., outside of a home or building in which dryer appliance <b>10</b> is installed). During a dry cycle, internal air may thus flow from the exhaust conduit and through the external duct before being exhausted to the outdoor environment.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In exemplary embodiments, trap duct <b>60</b> may include a filter portion which includes a screen filter or other suitable device for removing lint and other particulates as internal air is drawn out of chamber <b>28</b>. The internal air is drawn through the filter portion by air handler <b>32</b> before being passed through the exhaust conduit. After the articles have been dried (or a drying cycle is otherwise completed), the articles are removed from drum <b>26</b>, e.g., by accessing chamber <b>28</b> by opening door <b>30</b>. The filter portion may further be removable such that a user may collect and dispose of collected lint between drying cycles.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">One or more selector inputs <b>80</b>, such as knobs, buttons, touchscreen interfaces, etc., may be provided on a front control panel <b>82</b> and may be in communication with a processing device or controller <b>84</b>. Signals generated in controller <b>84</b> operate motor <b>38</b> and other system components in response to the position of selector inputs <b>80</b>. Additionally, a display <b>86</b>, such as an indicator light or a screen, may be provided on front control panel <b>82</b>. Display <b>86</b> may be in communication with controller <b>84</b> and may display information in response to signals from controller <b>84</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, &#x201c;processing device&#x201d; or &#x201c;controller&#x201d; may refer to one or more microprocessors or semiconductor devices and is not restricted necessarily to a single element. The processing device can be programmed to operate dryer appliance <b>10</b>. The processing device may include, or be associated with, one or more memory elements (e.g., non-transitory storage media). In some such embodiments, the memory elements include electrically erasable, programmable read only memory (EEPROM). Generally, the memory elements can store information accessible processing device, including instructions that can be executed by processing device. Optionally, the instructions can be software or any set of instructions and/or data that when executed by the processing device, cause the processing device to perform operations. For certain embodiments, the instructions include a software package configured to operate appliance <b>10</b> and execute certain cycles or operating modes.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, dryer appliance <b>10</b> also includes one or more sensors that may be used to facilitate improved operation of dryer appliance. For example, dryer appliance <b>10</b> may include one or more temperature sensors which are generally operable to measure internal temperatures in dryer appliance <b>10</b> and/or one or more airflow sensors which are generally operable to detect the velocity of air (e.g., as an air flow rate in meters per second, or as a volumetric velocity in cubic meters per second) as it flows through the appliance <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, controller <b>84</b> is configured to vary operation profiles of dryer appliance <b>10</b> based on one or more temperatures detected by the temperature sensors or air flow measurements from the airflow sensors.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, dryer appliance <b>10</b> includes a rotatable roller <b>100</b>. Roller <b>100</b> rotates about a central axis that is substantially parallel to the central axis about which drum <b>26</b> rotates. Roller <b>100</b> may be positioned in physical contact with an outer surface of drum <b>26</b> such that the rotation of drum <b>26</b> causes roller <b>100</b> to rotate in the opposite direction. Roller <b>100</b> may be significantly smaller in diameter than drum <b>26</b>. As a result, roller <b>100</b> rotates at a significantly faster velocity than drum <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Dryer appliance <b>10</b> may further include an impeller assembly <b>105</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> provides an exploded view of an exemplary embodiment of impeller assembly <b>105</b>.

Rather, impeller <b>110</b> may take many forms, as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. Impeller <b>110</b> functions to pump fluid through they system, as detailed below, and thus any impeller appropriate to this purpose may be used in accordance with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">An embodiment of housing <b>115</b> is provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Housing <b>115</b> may include a housing body <b>116</b> and a housing cover <b>117</b>. Housing body <b>116</b> may be generally cylindrical in shape. The cylindrical shape may be formed by a back and one or more side walls extending from the perimeter of the back wall, thus forming a hollow cavity sized to receive impeller <b>110</b>. The side walls of housing body <b>116</b> may include a series of holes spaced apart from one another to allow housing body <b>116</b> to be connected to housing cover <b>117</b>, as described herein. An outlet <b>119</b> may be formed in the one or more side walls to permit fluid to exit housing <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Housing cover <b>117</b> may generally shaped as a circular disc, as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Holes for connecting housing cover <b>117</b> may be evenly spaced around the perimeter of the disc in a pattern corresponding to the hole of housing body <b>116</b>. Housing cover <b>117</b> may be positioned against the top of the side walls of housing body <b>116</b>, thus substantially enclosing impeller <b>110</b> within housing assembly <b>115</b>. While it is desirable that impeller <b>110</b> be fully enclosed within housing assembly <b>115</b>, it is not strictly necessary, as impeller assembly <b>105</b> will continue to operate even if gaps are present in housing assembly <b>115</b>. Such gaps, however, would decrease the efficiency with which fluids are passed through the housing assembly. At least a majority of the fluid entering the housing assembly should exit the housing assembly through its intended outlet, as further described below. Housing body <b>116</b> and housing cover <b>117</b> may be secured together by placing bolts through the aligned openings in each of those components and tightening nuts to the opposite end of each bolt. However, the housing body <b>116</b> and housing cover <b>117</b> need not be secured by nuts and bolts. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any connection means known in the art, including screws, adhesives, clamps, and the like, that serve to secure these components together would fall within the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As also shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, housing cover <b>117</b> may further include an inlet <b>118</b>. Inlet <b>118</b> may simply be an opening in a conduit that intersects the cylindrical disc of housing cover <b>117</b>, permitting fluid to pass through inlet <b>118</b> and housing cover <b>117</b> and into the cavity formed by housing body <b>116</b>. Impeller <b>110</b> may be oriented within the cavity such that the rear plate of impeller <b>110</b> is on the opposite side of inlet <b>118</b>, such that the vanes of impeller <b>110</b> extend in the direction of inlet <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Housing assembly <b>115</b> may be secured in place by means of a bracket attached on one end to a fixed element within cabinet <b>12</b> and on the other end to housing cover <b>117</b> or housing body <b>116</b>. The bracket may be secured to housing assembly <b>115</b> in any known manner, such as screws, nuts and bolts, rivets, or the like. Attachment of the bracket may take advantage of the connection means employed for connecting housing body <b>116</b> to housing cover <b>117</b> or may use entirely separate connection means.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The skilled artisan will recognize that the above descriptions of shape, connection means, and positioning of the inlet and outlet of housing body <b>116</b> and housing cover <b>117</b> are merely illustrative of one embodiment of housing assembly <b>115</b> and that other arrangements consistent with the disclosure herein may equally fall within the scope of the invention. For example, in alternative embodiments, the inlet may be formed on the housing body and the outlet may be formed on the housing cover. In still other embodiments, the housing body may lack side walls, which side walls may be included on the housing cover, thus permitting the impeller to reside in a cavity of the housing cover. In still other embodiments, both the housing body and the housing cover may form side walls that together form the cavity in which the impeller resides. In still further embodiments, housing cover and housing body may form a single, integrated component, with or without an access port. These and other embodiments will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art and all fall within the scope of the intended invention.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Housing assembly <b>115</b> further includes a spindle <b>120</b>. As shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, spindle <b>120</b> may comprise a first end having spindle head <b>121</b> and a second end having spindle body <b>122</b>. Spindle body <b>122</b> may be a cylindrical element, at least a portion of which passes through a central opening in housing body <b>116</b> and attaches to impeller <b>110</b>. Spindle body <b>122</b> may attach to the rear plate of impeller <b>110</b> in some embodiments. In other embodiments spindle body may extend through a central opening in impeller <b>110</b> and may be connected on both ends, or even along the entirety of the intersection between spindle body <b>122</b> and impeller <b>110</b>. In still other embodiments, spindle body <b>122</b> and impeller <b>110</b> may form a single, integrated component. Spindle body <b>122</b> may be attached to impeller <b>110</b> in any known, conventional manner, including the use of a pin, screws, nuts and bolts, welding, and the like, such that rotation of spindle <b>120</b> causes rotation of impeller <b>110</b>. Spindle head <b>121</b> may be attached or integral to spindle body <b>122</b>, as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In the preferred embodiment, spindle head <b>121</b> is cylindrical in shape and is disposed entirely outside of housing <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Impeller assembler <b>115</b> may be position such that spindle head <b>121</b> is in direct contact with roller <b>100</b>, such that rotation of roller <b>100</b> causes rotation of spindle <b>120</b>, which may have an axis of rotation parallel to the axis of rotation of roller <b>100</b>. As previously explained, the rotation of roller <b>100</b> is caused by the rotation of drum <b>26</b>. Thus, the rotation of drum <b>26</b> drives the rotation of roller <b>100</b>, which drives the rotation of spindle <b>120</b>. Because spindle <b>120</b> is attached to impeller <b>110</b>, rotation of drum <b>26</b> thus results in rotation of impeller <b>110</b>. Again, as previously noted, the diameter of drum <b>26</b> may be significantly larger than the diameter of roller <b>100</b>, thus resulting is significantly faster rotation of roller <b>100</b> as compared to drum <b>26</b>. Similarly, spindle <b>120</b> may have a significant smaller diameter than roller <b>100</b> and thus may rotate at a significantly greater speed than roller <b>100</b>. Because spindle <b>120</b> is attached to impeller <b>110</b>, they share the same rate of rotation. As a consequence of these relationships, the rotation speed of the impeller may be controlled by the sizing of the roller and spindle selected. The greater the size disparities between the diameters of these components and that of the drum, the greater the rate of rotation of the impeller will be. The rate of rotation of impeller <b>110</b> may also be controlled, in part, by the rate of rotation of drum <b>26</b>, however, this rate of rotation is generally governed by the functional demands of the dryer in drying articles of clothing and other laundry.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Accordingly, normal operation of dryer appliance <b>10</b> involves rotation of drum <b>26</b>, which drives rotation of impeller <b>110</b> in impeller assembly <b>115</b>. As previously mentioned, the vanes of impeller <b>110</b> extend from a central portion of impeller <b>110</b> at an angle. In particular, in the preferred embodiment, the vanes of impeller <b>110</b> may extend at angle in the direction of outlet <b>119</b> of housing body <b>116</b> and away from inlet <b>118</b> of housing cover <b>117</b>. As such, rotation of impeller <b>110</b> generates a negative pressure at inlet <b>118</b> and a positive pressure at outlet <b>119</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Dryer appliance <b>10</b> may further include a reservoir assembly <b>125</b> for retaining clothing treatment fluids. In the preferred embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, reservoir assembly <b>125</b> includes a bottom surface <b>126</b> and one or more side surfaces <b>127</b> extending vertically upward around the perimeter of bottom surface <b>126</b>. Together, bottom surface <b>126</b> and side walls <b>127</b> form a cup-like cavity for retaining liquids. In this embodiment, bottom surface <b>126</b> is circular and a single side wall <b>127</b> forms a hollow cylinder extending upward. In alternative embodiments, however, these elements may take any shape consistent with the present disclosure. For example, bottom surface <b>126</b> may be rectangular and four side walls <b>127</b> may extend upward from each side of bottom surface <b>126</b>. Other arrangements for retaining liquids will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As further illustrated in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, bottom surface <b>126</b> of reservoir assembly <b>125</b> includes an opening <b>128</b> between the top and bottom of bottom surface <b>126</b>. A hollow siphon <b>129</b> is attached to bottom surface <b>126</b> and at least a portion of siphon <b>129</b> extends vertically upward from bottom surface <b>126</b>. Siphon <b>129</b> is positioned covering the opening <b>128</b> in bottom surface <b>126</b>. As used here, the phrase covering the opening is meant broadly to encompass not only extending over the top of the opening, but also in the sense of occupying the occupying the opening, or otherwise preventing liquid in reservoir assembly <b>125</b> from passing through opening <b>128</b> without first passing through siphon <b>129</b>, as discussed below. For example, in the preferred embodiment, siphon <b>129</b> attaches to bottom surface <b>126</b> via a flange situated below bottom surface. A portion of siphon <b>129</b> then extends though opening <b>128</b>, occupying the entirety of opening <b>128</b>, and extends vertically upward above bottom surface <b>126</b>. Thus, siphon <b>129</b> cover opening <b>128</b>, as that term is used here. In alternative embodiments, siphon <b>129</b> may mount to bottom surface <b>126</b> via a flange above bottom surface <b>126</b>, which likewise covers opening <b>128</b>. In yet other embodiments, no flange is used and siphon <b>129</b> is attached to bottom surface <b>126</b> by virtue of a gasket and compression. Other means of attaching siphon <b>129</b> to bottom surface <b>126</b> will be apparent to one of ordinary skill.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As previously noted, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, siphon <b>129</b> is hollow, thus forming a passageway for fluids to flow from reservoir assembly <b>125</b> through siphon <b>129</b> and through opening <b>128</b> in bottom surface <b>126</b>, thereby exiting reservoir assembly <b>125</b>. In some embodiments of the present invention, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, this fluid may be a liquid. In other embodiments, discussed below, the fluid may be a gas. In embodiments where it is desirable to draw liquids from reservoir assembly <b>125</b>, reservoir assembly <b>125</b> may further include a siphon cap <b>130</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). Siphon cap <b>130</b> comprises a top surface <b>131</b> disposed above the siphon and one or more side surfaces <b>132</b> extending downward from a perimeter of top surface <b>131</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the one or more side surface <b>132</b> form a cylinder, however this shape is not required. In alternative embodiments, top surface <b>131</b> may be rectangular and the one or more side surfaces <b>132</b> may be four side surfaces, one of each extending from each side of top surface <b>131</b>. While other configurations fall within the scope of the present disclosure, each configuration includes one or more side surfaces <b>132</b> extending downward from top surface <b>131</b> such that the one or more side surfaces <b>132</b> extend around a portion of siphon <b>129</b>, leaving a narrow gap between the two. Generally, it is preferred that the shape of siphon cap <b>130</b> match the shape of the vertically extending portion of siphon <b>129</b>. In alternative embodiments, appropriate for applications in which the fluid to be distributed is a gas, reservoir assembly <b>125</b> may omit siphon cap <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, reservoir assembly <b>125</b> may optionally include a lid <b>140</b>. For embodiments of reservoir assembly <b>125</b> which lack siphon cap <b>130</b>, lid <b>140</b> is necessary. Lid <b>140</b> is situated above the one or more side walls <b>127</b>. Lid <b>140</b> may further be situated outside of cabinet <b>12</b> such that at least a portion of reservoir assembly <b>125</b> extends through an opening <b>142</b> in top surface <b>24</b> of cabinet <b>12</b>. In alternative embodiments, lid <b>140</b> may set in a recess in top surface <b>24</b> or even recessed below top surface <b>24</b>, so long as lid <b>140</b> remains accessible. Lid <b>140</b> may be movable for selectively accessing and adding liquid to the reservoir assembly. For example, lid <b>140</b> may pivot between an open and closed position. In other embodiments, lid <b>140</b> may be entirely detachable. In still other embodiments, lid <b>140</b> may screw or snap onto an extension that rises above top surface <b>24</b>. In yet other embodiments, only a portion of lid <b>140</b> may be movable. Still other alternatives for movable lid <b>140</b> will be apparent to the skilled artisan that would permit selective access to reservoir assembly <b>125</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Where present, lid <b>140</b> may include a check valve <b>145</b> disposed through a surface of lid <b>140</b>. Check valve <b>145</b> may take the form of a duckbill valve or other similar one-way pressure release valve. As further described herein, negative pressure generated by impeller assembly <b>105</b> creates a vacuum within at least a portion of reservoir assembly <b>125</b>. Where such vacuum extends to the entire cavity of reservoir assembly <b>125</b>, for example if no treating fluids are present, it is necessary to relieve the pressure differential between the inside and outside of reservoir assembly <b>125</b> to prevent damage to the components. Check valve <b>145</b> achieves this pressure relief by permitting air to pass through lid <b>140</b> once the pressure differential reaches a particular point.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In alternative embodiments, reservoir assembly <b>125</b> may constitute a sliding drawer, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, where in reservoir assembly slides between a closed position, in which most or all of reservoir assembly <b>125</b> is contained within cabinet <b>12</b>, and an open position, in which at least a portion of reservoir assembly <b>125</b> extends outside of cabinet <b>12</b>, permitting access for adding treatment liquids to reservoir assembly <b>125</b>. In this embodiment, reservoir assembly <b>125</b> does not extend through top surface <b>24</b>, but rather at least a portion of reservoir assembly <b>125</b> extends through front panel <b>14</b> in at least the open position. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, reservoir assembly may further include a cover <b>146</b> that is attached to bottom surface <b>126</b>, the one or more side walls <b>127</b>, or both, either directly or indirectly. Cover <b>146</b> may extend outside of cabinet <b>12</b> when reservoir assembly is in the closed position (as well as when it is in the open position), providing users the ability to slide reservoir assembly <b>125</b> into the open position by pulling cover <b>146</b>. Cover <b>146</b> may further abut against a portion of front panel <b>14</b> when reservoir assembly <b>125</b> is in the closed position, thus acting as a stop to prevent reservoir assembly <b>125</b> from being pushed further into cabinet <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Reservoir assembly <b>125</b> may also be in fluid communication with inlet <b>118</b> of impeller assembly <b>105</b>. Specifically, a first fluid communication path <b>150</b> may have a first end <b>151</b> and second end <b>152</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. First end <b>151</b> may be connected to reservoir assembly <b>125</b> at the outlet of siphon <b>129</b>. Second end <b>152</b> may be connected to inlet <b>118</b> of impeller assembly <b>105</b>, permitting fluid to travel from reservoir assembly <b>125</b> to impeller assembly <b>105</b>. First fluid communication path <b>150</b> may take the form of a conduit or other tubing common in field.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, it may be desirable to control the timing of fluid flow from reservoir assembly <b>125</b>. As shown in the alternative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a valve <b>160</b>, such as a solenoid valve, may be disposed within first fluid communication path <b>150</b> to control the flow of fluid through first fluid communication path <b>150</b>. Valve <b>160</b> may be biased to the closed position, preventing fluid flow absent activation. Controller <b>84</b> may be configured to power valve <b>160</b> during only a portion of a drying cycle. For example, where the fluid used to treat articles of clothing or other laundry is a scent application, it may be desirable to limit the duration of time during which the scent is applied to provide over-scenting the articles. In such circumstances, controller <b>84</b> may activate valve <b>160</b> for a brief duration (e.g., 30 seconds) at the end of the drying cycle. Control over fluid distribution carries the additional benefit of conserving treatment materials.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Embodiments employing valve <b>160</b> in first fluid communication path <b>150</b> further require a pressure relief line <b>165</b>, as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Pressure relief line <b>165</b>, commonly referred to as a breather, may include a first end and a second end. The first end may be in fluid communication with first fluid communication path <b>150</b> and connected between valve <b>160</b> and inlet <b>118</b> of housing assembly <b>115</b>. The second end of pressure relief line <b>165</b> may include an opening for the intake of ambient air. Thus, when valve <b>160</b> is closed and impeller assembly <b>105</b> operates, a vacuum is generated in fluid communication path <b>150</b>. Pressure relief line <b>150</b> provides a source of air, preventing rupture or other damage to the components of fluid communication path <b>150</b> and/or valve <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring again to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, dryer appliance <b>10</b> may further include a second fluid communication path <b>170</b>. Second fluid communication path <b>170</b> may include a first end and a second end. The first end of second fluid communication path <b>170</b> may be connected to outlet <b>119</b> of impeller assembly <b>115</b>. The second end of second fluid communication path <b>170</b> may connected to a fluid distribution element <b>175</b>, thus providing a path for fluids to travel from impeller assembly <b>115</b> to fluid distribution element <b>175</b>. Second fluid communication path <b>170</b> may take the form of a conduit or other tubing common in field. Fluid distribution element <b>175</b> directs fluids from reservoir assembly <b>125</b> into chamber <b>28</b> defined by drum <b>26</b> for treatment of clothing and other articles therein. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, fluid distribution element <b>175</b> is a nozzle. However, any known method for directing fluids may be employed. In certain embodiments, fluid distribution element <b>175</b> may not be a separate component from, for example, a conduit constituting second fluid communication path <b>170</b>, but rather may simply be the end of opening of such conduit.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Considering the operation of dryer appliance <b>10</b> employing the components described herein, one of ordinary skill will recognize that rotation of drum <b>26</b> drives rotation of roller <b>100</b>, spindle <b>120</b>, and impeller <b>110</b>. Rotation of impeller <b>110</b> creates a vacuum at and upstream of inlet <b>118</b>, including in at least a portion of reservoir assembly <b>125</b> (assuming that valve <b>160</b> is absent or open). In embodiments for which reservoir assembly <b>125</b> includes siphon cap <b>130</b>, treatment fluid added by the user during operation occupies a portion of the space between siphon cap <b>130</b> and siphon <b>129</b>. Accordingly, the vacuum generated by rotation of impeller <b>110</b> draws the liquid through the hollow center of siphon <b>129</b>, through first communication path <b>150</b>, impeller assembly <b>105</b>, second communication path <b>170</b>, and fluid distribution element <b>175</b>, where the fluid is directed into the dryer chamber <b>28</b> and applied to the articles tumbling therein. Alternatively, in embodiments for which reservoir assembly <b>125</b> lacks siphon cap <b>130</b>, treatment fluid added by the user during operation is not drawn through siphon <b>129</b> by the application of a vacuum. Rather, the vacuum generated by rotation of impeller <b>110</b> draws gases present between the surface of the liquid and lid <b>140</b> through the hollow center of siphon <b>129</b>, through first communication path <b>150</b>, impeller assembly <b>105</b>, second communication path <b>170</b>, and fluid distribution element <b>175</b>, where the fluid is directed into the dryer chamber <b>28</b> and applied to the articles tumbling therein.
