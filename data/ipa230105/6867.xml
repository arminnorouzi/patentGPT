Moreover, these transmission channels can be rather noisy which in turn increases the need for error correction. High frequency (HF) radio communication channels of most long-distance communication systems are limited by the available assigned radio bandwidth and channel capacity at any given time. When using the HF radio channel in a financial high-frequency trading application, this limited bandwidth can cause delays in the receipt of financial instructions which in turn can be financially detrimental.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thus, there is a need for improvement in this field.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A unique gear shifting technique has been developed in which the modulation mode and equalization are shifted to achieve optional performance. In one form, three or more equalizers, each associated with a demodulator and message decoder, determine if the modulation being used can be increased in complexity in order to increase the channel throughput or determine if the modulation method should be reduced in complexity in order to improve the receiver error performance. The quality metric can be based on which equalizer-demodulator-decoder is set to first detect a valid message. Modulation complexity can be increased when a shorter equalizer detects a sufficient number of error free packets ahead of the current designated equalizer. Modulation complexity is decreased when a longer equalizer detects a higher number of error-free packets as compared to the current designated equalizer. Other factors can be considered with this technique such as a packet-error ratio and a signal-to-noise ratio. In a financial trading system, message erasures can be favored over errored messages by limiting the number of bit or symbol corrections permitted per message to less than the maximum possible for the selected decoding schemes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The system and techniques as described and illustrated herein concern a number of unique and inventive aspects.

used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Any alterations and further modifications in the described embodiments and any further applications of the principles of the invention as described herein are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates. One embodiment of the invention is shown in great detail, although it will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art that some features that are not relevant to the present invention may not be shown for the sake of clarity.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The reference numerals in the following description have been organized to aid the reader in quickly identifying the drawings where various components are first shown. In particular, the drawing in which an element first appears is typically indicated by the left-most digit(s) in the corresponding reference number. For example, an element identified by a &#x201c;100&#x201d; series reference numeral will likely first appear in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an element identified by a &#x201c;200&#x201d; series reference numeral will likely first appear in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and so on.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a generic version of a communication system <b>100</b> according to one example. As shown, the communication system <b>100</b> includes an information source <b>105</b> and an information destination <b>110</b>. The information source <b>105</b> and information destination <b>110</b> operatively communicate with one another through one or more communication channels <b>115</b>. Communication over these communication channels <b>115</b> can be one-way type communications and/or two-way type communications. In the illustrated example, the communication channels <b>115</b> between the information source <b>105</b> and information destination <b>110</b> include a primary communication channel <b>120</b> and a backend communication channel <b>125</b>. In other examples, the communication system <b>100</b> can include just a single communication channel <b>115</b> or more than two communication channels <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As will be explained in further detail below, the communication system <b>100</b> can be used in a number of situations, especially in situations where the information source <b>105</b> and information destination <b>110</b> are located physically remote from one another. The communication system <b>100</b> for instance can be used for private, commercial, medical, military, and/or governmental purposes. For the purposes of explanation, the communication system <b>100</b> will be described for use with a financial trading system, but it should be recognized that the communication system <b>100</b> can be adapted for other uses such as for issuing military commands and performing remote telemedicine procedures. In this example, the information source <b>105</b> and information destination <b>110</b> generally represent the locations of the computer systems for remotely located stock/commodity exchanges and/or financial institutions that trade on those exchanges. Some examples of these exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the NASDAQ Stock Market, Tokyo Stock Exchange (TYO), the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Euronext, London Stock Exchange, Shenzhen Stock Exchange, Toronto Stock Exchange, Bombay Stock Exchange, Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), to name just a few.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the information source <b>105</b> and information destination <b>110</b> are physically separated by a distance (D) <b>130</b>. For instance, the exchanges represented by the information source <b>105</b> and information destination <b>110</b> can be separated by mountains, continents, and even oceans. This physical distance <b>130</b> creates a delay or latency in communications between the information source <b>105</b> and information destination <b>110</b> locations. Normally, but not always, the greater the distance <b>130</b>, the longer the latency for a given communication channel <b>115</b>. In most cases, the distance <b>130</b> between these exchanges prevents direct line of sight communications which further increases latency as well as increases the risk for communication errors. For instance, the information destination <b>110</b> can be located past the radio horizon for the information source <b>105</b>. With trading as well as other activities, time and communication accuracy are crucial. Any delays can cause traders to lose money, and likewise, any communication errors can cause a loss. Communication errors can be reduced but usually at the cost of higher latency and/or greater bandwidth requirements. Most communication channels <b>115</b> have limited bandwidth to some degree. The latency and bandwidth capabilities can vary depending on the construction and type of communication channel <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As can be seen, the primary communication channel <b>120</b> has a primary channel latency (&#x394;T<sub>P</sub>) <b>135</b> and a primary channel bandwidth (B<sub>P</sub>) <b>140</b>. The backend channel latency <b>145</b> primary communication channel <b>120</b> has a backend channel latency (&#x394;T<sub>B</sub>) <b>145</b> and a backend channel bandwidth (B<sub>B</sub>) <b>150</b>. The communication channels <b>115</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> can have the same latency and bandwidth properties or different latency and/or bandwidth as well as other properties. In one example, the primary channel latency <b>135</b> of the primary communication channel <b>120</b> is less than the backend channel latency <b>145</b> of the backend communication channel <b>125</b>, and the primary channel bandwidth <b>140</b> of the primary communication channel <b>120</b> is less than the backend channel bandwidth <b>150</b> of the backend communication channel <b>125</b>. In some variations of this example, the primary communication channel <b>120</b> is a wireless communication channel (e.g., radio), and the backend communication channel <b>125</b> is a wired type communication channel (e.g., fiber optic cable). In one particular form, the primary communication channel <b>120</b> uses a skywave communication technique, and the backend communication channel <b>125</b> includes a non-skywave path such as a fiber optic cable. In other examples, the primary communication channel <b>120</b> and backend communication channel <b>125</b> represent different communication channels <b>115</b> for the same type of communication mode. For instance, primary communication channel <b>120</b> and backend communication channel <b>125</b> represent wireless communication channels having different frequency bands, and in one example, both communication channels <b>115</b> utilize high frequency (HF) radio to communicate via skywave propagation. With the primary communication channel <b>120</b> and backend communication channel <b>125</b> having different frequencies, the primary communication channel <b>120</b> and backend communication channel <b>125</b> can have different latencies, bandwidths, and/or communication error rates. For instance, the primary communication channel <b>120</b> in one situation can be noisier than the backend communication channel <b>125</b>, but the primary communication channel <b>120</b> can have a shorter latency than the backend communication channel <b>125</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The HF radio communication channel <b>115</b> of the communication system <b>100</b> can be limited by the available assigned radio bandwidth and channel capacity at any given time. When using the HF radio communication channel <b>115</b> in a financial high frequency trading application, increasing the number and/or transmission speed of messages increases the profit potential of the communication system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a specific example of a communication system <b>200</b> of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> communication system <b>100</b> configured to transfer data according to the unique technique described herein. Like in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> communication system <b>100</b>, the communication system <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> includes the information source <b>105</b>, information destination <b>110</b>, and communication channels <b>115</b> that include the primary communication channel <b>120</b> and backend communication channel <b>125</b>. Specifically, the communication system <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is configured to transfer data via a low latency, low bandwidth communication link <b>204</b>. In one form, the low latency, low bandwidth communication link <b>204</b> includes a high frequency radio channel (HF radio) <b>206</b>. The communication system <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is further configured to transfer data via a separate data via a high latency, high bandwidth communication link <b>208</b>. The low latency, low bandwidth communication link <b>204</b> and high latency, high bandwidth communication link <b>208</b> provide separate connections between a first communication node <b>212</b> at a transmission station <b>214</b> and a second communication node <b>216</b> at a receiving station <b>218</b>. The low latency, low bandwidth communication link <b>204</b> may be configured to transmit data using electromagnetic waves <b>224</b> passing through free space via skywave propagation between a transmitting antenna <b>228</b> and a receiving antenna <b>232</b>. The electromagnetic waves <b>224</b> may be generated by a transmitter in the first communication node <b>212</b>, passed along a transmission line <b>236</b> to the transmitting antenna <b>228</b>. The electromagnetic waves <b>224</b> may be radiated by the transmitting antenna <b>228</b> encountering an ionized portion of the atmosphere <b>220</b>. This radiated electromagnetic energy may then be refracted by the ionized portion of the atmosphere <b>220</b> causing the electromagnetic waves <b>224</b> to redirect toward the earth <b>256</b>. The electromagnetic waves <b>224</b> may be received by the receiving antenna <b>232</b> coupled to the second communication node <b>216</b> by the transmission line <b>240</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a transmitting communication node may use skywave propagation to transmit electromagnetic energy long distances across the surface of the earth <b>256</b> without the need of one or more transmission lines <b>236</b> to carry the electromagnetic energy.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Data may also be transmitted between the transmission station <b>214</b> and receiving station <b>218</b> using the high latency, high bandwidth communication link <b>208</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the high latency, high bandwidth communication link <b>208</b> may be implemented using a transmission line <b>244</b> passing through the earth <b>256</b>, which may include passing under or through an ocean or other body of water. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the high latency, high bandwidth communication link <b>208</b> may include one or more repeaters <b>252</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates four repeaters <b>252</b> along the transmission line <b>244</b> although any suitable number of repeaters <b>252</b> may be used. The transmission line <b>244</b> may also have no repeaters <b>252</b> at all. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the low latency, low bandwidth communication link <b>204</b> transmitting information from the first communication node <b>212</b> to the second communication node <b>216</b>, the data transmitted may pass along the low latency, low bandwidth communication link <b>204</b> and high latency, high bandwidth communication link <b>208</b> in both directions.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown, the communication system <b>200</b> further includes a client <b>260</b> that has a connection <b>264</b> to the first communication node <b>212</b>. The client <b>260</b> is configured to send instructions over the connection <b>264</b> to the first communication node <b>212</b>. In the illustrated example, the connection <b>264</b> includes a wireless connection <b>266</b> such as a microwave network. At the first communication node <b>212</b>, the instructions are prepared to be sent to the second communication node <b>216</b>, either by the low latency, low bandwidth communication link <b>204</b> or the high latency, high bandwidth communication link <b>208</b>, or both. As shown, the second communication node <b>216</b> is connected to an instruction processor <b>268</b> via a connection <b>272</b>. It should be recognized that the connection <b>272</b> can include wireless connection <b>266</b> like a microwave or other type of wireless connection. The client <b>260</b> may be any business, group, individual, and/or entity that desires to send directions over a distance. The instruction processor <b>268</b> may be any business, group, individual, and/or entity that is meant to receive or act upon those instructions. In some embodiments, the connection <b>264</b> and connection <b>272</b> may be unnecessary as the client <b>260</b> may send the data to be transmitted directly from the first communication node <b>212</b> or the second communication node <b>216</b> may be connected directly to the instruction processor <b>268</b>. The communication system <b>200</b> may be used for any kind of low-latency data transmission that is desired. As one example, the client <b>260</b> may be a doctor or surgeon working remotely while the instruction processor <b>268</b> may be a robotic instrument for working on a patient.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the client <b>260</b> may be a financial instrument trader and the instruction processor <b>268</b> may be a stock exchange. The trader may wish to provide instructions to the stock exchange to buy or sell certain securities or bonds at specific times. Alternatively or additionally, the instructions are in the form of news and/or other information supplied by the trader and/or a third party organization, such as a news organization or a government. The trader may transmit the instructions to the first communication node <b>212</b> which sends the instructions and/or news to the second communication node <b>216</b> using the transmitting antenna <b>228</b>, receiving antenna <b>232</b>, and/or by the transmission line <b>244</b>. The stock exchange can then process the actions desired by the trader upon receipt of the instructions and/or news.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The communication system <b>200</b> may be useful for high-frequency trading, where trading strategies are carried out on computers to execute trades in fractions of a second. In high-frequency trading, a delay of mere milliseconds may cost a trader millions of dollars; therefore, the speed of transmission of trading instructions is as important as the accuracy of the data transmitted. In some embodiments, the trader may transmit preset trading instructions or conditions for executing a trade to the second communication node <b>216</b>, which is located within close proximity to a stock exchange, using the high latency, high bandwidth communication link <b>208</b> at a time before the trader wishes to execute a trade. These instructions or conditions may require the transmission of a large amount of data, and may be delivered more accurately using the high latency, high bandwidth communication link <b>208</b>. Also, if the instructions or conditions are sent at a time prior to when a trade is wished to be executed, the higher latency of the high latency, high bandwidth communication link <b>208</b> can be tolerated.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The eventual execution of the instructions may be accomplished by the trader transmitting triggering data to the communication system <b>200</b> on which the instructions are stored. Alternatively or additionally, the triggering data can includes news and/or other information supplied by the trader and/or a separate, third party organization. Upon receipt of the triggering data, the trading instructions are sent to the stock exchange and a trade is executed. The triggering data that is transmitted is generally a much smaller amount of data than the instructions; therefore, the triggering data may be sent over the low latency, low bandwidth communication link <b>204</b>. When the triggering data is received at the second communication node <b>216</b>, the instructions for a specific trade are sent to the stock exchange. Sending the triggering data over the low latency, low bandwidth communication link <b>204</b> rather than the high latency, high bandwidth communication link <b>208</b> allows the desired trade to be executed as quickly as possible, giving the trader a time advantage over other parties trading the same financial instruments.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> where the first communication node <b>212</b> and the second communication node <b>216</b> are geographically remote from one another separated by a substantial portion of the surface of the earth <b>256</b>. This portion of the earth's surface may include one or more continents, oceans, mountain ranges, and/or other geographic areas. For example, the distance spanned in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may cover a single continent, multiple continents, an ocean, and the like. In one example, the first communication node <b>212</b> is in Chicago, Ill. in the United States of America, and the second communication node <b>216</b> is in London, England, in the United Kingdom. In another example, the first communication node <b>212</b> is in New York City, N.Y., and second communication node <b>216</b> is in Los Angeles, Calif., both cities being in North America. As shown, the transmitting antenna <b>228</b> and receiving antenna <b>232</b> are separated by a distance greater than the radio horizon such that no line of sight communications can be made. Instead, a skywave communication technique is used in which the electromagnetic waves <b>224</b> of the low latency, low bandwidth communication link <b>204</b> are skipped multiple times between the transmitting antenna <b>228</b> and receiving antenna <b>232</b>. Any suitable combination of distance, communication nodes, and communications links is envisioned that can provide satisfactory latency and bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates that skywave propagation allows electromagnetic energy to traverse long distances. Using skywave propagation, the low latency, low bandwidth communication link <b>204</b> transmits the electromagnetic waves <b>224</b> into a portion of the atmosphere <b>220</b> that is sufficiently ionized to refract the electromagnetic waves <b>224</b> toward the earth <b>256</b>. The waves may then be reflected by the surface of the earth <b>256</b> and returned to the ionized portion of the upper atmosphere <b>220</b> where they may be refracted toward earth <b>256</b> again. Thus electromagnetic energy may &#x201c;skip&#x201d; repeatedly allowing the low latency, low bandwidth signals electromagnetic waves <b>224</b> to cover distances substantially greater than those which may be covered by non-skywave propagation.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a specific implementation of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b>. As can be seen, the first communication node <b>212</b> at the transmission station <b>214</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> includes a modulator <b>405</b>, a radio transmitter <b>410</b>, and a fiber optic transmitter <b>415</b>. The modulator <b>405</b> includes one or more processors and memory along with other electronics, software, and/or firmware configured to modulate the message and/or other information using the above-mentioned variable messaging length technique which will be further described below. The radio transmitter <b>410</b> is operatively connected to the modulator <b>405</b> so as to transmit the message and/or other data to the receiving station <b>218</b> via the transmitting antenna <b>228</b> over the HF radio channel <b>206</b>. In the depicted example, the radio transmitter <b>410</b> transmits the message and/or other data via the primary communication channel <b>120</b>. The fiber optic transmitter <b>415</b> is operatively connected to the modulator <b>405</b> and a fiber optic cable <b>420</b> that forms at least part of the backend communication channel <b>125</b>. The fiber optic transmitter <b>415</b> is configured to transmit to the second communication node <b>216</b> one or more message tables and/or other information, such as a duplicate copy of the message transmitted by the radio transmitter <b>410</b>, via the backend communication channel <b>125</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The second communication node <b>216</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> includes a demodulator <b>425</b>, a radio receiver <b>430</b>, and a fiber optic receiver <b>435</b>. The demodulator <b>425</b> includes one or more processors and memory along with other electronics, software, and/or firmware configured to demodulate the message and/or other information from the first communication node <b>212</b> using the above-mentioned technique which will be further described below. The radio receiver <b>430</b> is operatively connected to the demodulator <b>425</b> so as to receive the message and/or other data from the first communication node <b>212</b> via the receiving antenna <b>232</b>. In the illustrated example, the radio receiver <b>430</b> again receives the message and/or other data via the primary communication channel <b>120</b>. The fiber optic receiver <b>435</b> is operatively connected to the demodulator <b>425</b> and the fiber optic cable <b>420</b>. The fiber optic receiver <b>435</b> is configured to receive from the fiber optic transmitter <b>415</b> of the first communication node <b>212</b> the message tables and/or other information, such as a duplicate copy of the message from the modulator <b>405</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">It should be recognized that the communication system <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> can facilitate one-way communication or two-way communication. For example, the modulator <b>405</b> can be configured to act as a modulator-demodulator (modem), and the demodulator <b>425</b> can likewise be a modem. The HF radio transmitter <b>410</b> in certain variations can be configured to receive wireless communications so as to act as a wireless transceiver. Similarly, the HF radio receiver <b>430</b> can also be a wireless transceiver. Both the fiber optic transmitter <b>415</b> and fiber optic receiver <b>435</b> can be fiber optic transceivers to facilitate two-way communication.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows another variation of the communication system <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> that can perform the gear shifting technique described herein. As can be seen, a communication system <b>500</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is constructed in a similar fashion and shares a number of components in common with the communication system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b></figref>. For instance, the communication system <b>500</b> includes the modulator <b>405</b> and the radio transmitter <b>410</b> with the transmitting antenna <b>228</b> at the transmission station <b>214</b> of the type described before. Moreover, the communication system <b>500</b> includes the demodulator <b>425</b> and the radio receiver <b>430</b> with the receiving antenna <b>232</b> at the receiving station <b>218</b> of the kind mentioned above. As can be seen, however, the fiber optic transmitter <b>415</b>, fiber optic cable <b>420</b>, and fiber optic receiver <b>435</b> have been eliminated such that all communications are wireless, and more particularly, through skywave communication via the HF radio channel <b>206</b>. In one variation, the communication system <b>500</b> includes a single communication channel <b>115</b> in the form of the low latency, low bandwidth communication link <b>204</b> that forms the primary communication channel <b>120</b>. In another variation, the radio communication between the radio transmitter <b>410</b> and radio receiver <b>430</b> is through two or more HF communication channels <b>115</b> such that one forms the primary communication channel <b>120</b> and the other forms the backend communication channel <b>125</b>. In one version, the primary communication channel <b>120</b> and the backend communication channel <b>125</b> can have generally the same data bandwidth and/or latency, and in other versions, the primary communication channel <b>120</b> and backend communication channel <b>125</b> can have different data bandwidths and/or latencies. The modulator <b>405</b> in the illustrated example is connected to the client <b>260</b> through a high speed transmitter data network <b>505</b>. The demodulator <b>425</b> is connected to the instruction processor <b>268</b> through a high speed receiver data network <b>510</b>. In one form, the high speed transmitter data network <b>505</b> and high speed receiver data network <b>510</b> are high speed data networks.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a system delay model <b>600</b> for the communication system <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b></figref> along with one or more competitor networks <b>605</b>. The competitor networks <b>605</b> include one or more high-speed fiber optic networks, but the competitor networks <b>605</b> can include other types of high latency networks. It should be recognized that a similar system delay model <b>600</b> can apply to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> communication system <b>500</b>. For the sake of brevity as well as clarity, the system delay model <b>600</b> and subsequent methods will be described with reference to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b>, but it should be recognized that the system delay model <b>600</b> and methods can be used for the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> communication system <b>500</b>. Moreover, the system delay model <b>600</b> and subsequent method will be described with reference to a single <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b>, but it should be recognized that these methods and model systems can be adapted to handle multiple communication systems <b>200</b>. Likewise, the system delay model <b>600</b> and subsequent method will be described with reference to a single <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> competitor network <b>605</b>, but it should be recognized that these methods and model systems can be adapted to handle multiple competitor networks <b>605</b>. Once more this method of switching equalizers or gears in the communication system <b>200</b> will be described with performing transactions of financial instruments (e.g., buying or selling stocks), but it should be recognized that this technique can be adapted for use in other environments such as load balancing remotely located server farms.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, various time measurement points or periods are in the system delay model <b>600</b> are identified by the letter &#x201c;T&#x201d; followed by a number.

As another example, time measurement point TC (or arrival time for the competitor) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> represents the transmission or travel time the message takes from the client <b>260</b> at the information source <b>105</b> to the information destination <b>110</b> over the competitor network <b>605</b>. For financial transactions, TC in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> system delay model <b>600</b> is the arrival time at the trading network. This TC time may not be known exactly, but the TC time may be estimated based on known fiber services and/or in other manners such as observing trading behavior of an institution using the competitor network <b>605</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">From the perspective of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b>, time T<b>9</b> represents the time the message takes to travel over the HF radio channel <b>206</b> (i.e., the low latency, low bandwidth communication link <b>204</b>) from the information source <b>105</b> to the demodulator <b>425</b> where the message is demodulated and packaged for transmission from the receiving station <b>218</b>. Time period T<b>16</b> represents the time the message takes to travel over the fiber optic cable <b>420</b> (i.e., the high latency, high bandwidth communication link <b>208</b>) from the information source <b>105</b> to the demodulator <b>425</b> where the message is demodulated and packaged for transmission from the receiving station <b>218</b>. For the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b>, the delay advantage between the path for the Over-The-Air (OTA) or HF radio channel <b>206</b> and the fiber path of the fiber optic cable <b>420</b> is the difference between point T<b>16</b> and T<b>9</b> (i.e., T<b>16</b>-T<b>9</b>). Time measurement point T<b>10</b> signifies the time where the packaged message is outputted or communicated from the demodulator <b>425</b> to the connection <b>272</b>.

The transmission time T<b>16</b> over the fiber optic cable <b>420</b> of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b> can at times lag or lead the arrival time of the competitor TC. However, the transmission time over the competitor network <b>605</b> normally will lag (i.e., be slower) as compared to the HF radio channel <b>206</b> that uses skywave communication. Due to the OTA time-of-flight advantage of the HF radio channel <b>206</b> over fiber-optic cables, the need to purchase the very fastest fiber paths between the trading centers is reduced.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The usable trading effective advantage between the competitor network <b>605</b> and the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b> is TC-T<b>12</b>. In order that the demodulator <b>425</b> at the receiving station <b>218</b> adapts properly to changing channel conditions, the demodulator <b>425</b> needs to know and/or estimate a few of these times in order achieve a sufficient gear shifting strategy to be financially viable. One time parameter is that the receiving station <b>218</b> needs to know is at least the T<b>16</b>-TC time difference: Again, the arrival time TC for the competitor may not be known exactly, but TC can be estimated by monitoring or considering one or more factors such as the trading history of the competitor. The operator of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b> normally should be able to measure or determine the travel time T<b>16</b> across the fiber optic cable <b>420</b> with a high degree of accuracy. Another parameter is T<b>10</b>-T<b>12</b>, or the time between the output of the demodulator <b>425</b> and message entry into the financial trading system which corresponds to the information destination <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. This T<b>10</b>-T<b>12</b> time parameter can be measured during commissioning of the FIG. communication system <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Still yet another parameter concerns the processing time within the receiving station <b>218</b>, and more particularly, the time parameter concerns processing within the modem or demodulator <b>425</b>. Time parameter T<b>16</b>-T<b>10</b> (or T<b>9</b>-T<b>10</b>) generally represents the processing time within the modem or demodulator <b>425</b> for equalization, errors correction, and message decoding. The time parameter T<b>16</b>-T<b>10</b> minimum (i.e., T<b>16</b>-T<b>10</b>min) is a minimum target that is set so that a delay advantage between the competitor network <b>605</b> and the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b> (TC-T<b>12</b>) is greater than a minimum delay advantage required for profitable trading. The time parameter T<b>16</b>-T<b>10</b> maximum (T<b>16</b>-T<b>10</b>max), while not strictly a maximum value for profitability, indicates that the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b> has reached a point of diminishing returns with respect to delay advantage between the systems TC-T<b>12</b> where more delay in the demodulator <b>425</b> or modem can be tolerated in order to decode more complex modulation techniques.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition to the trading strategies being employed, a number of technical factors affect the trading profitability of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b>. It should be appreciated that the time delays between the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b> and the competitor networks <b>605</b> impact profitability such as during high-speed financial transactions. The larger time advantage of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b> over the competitor networks <b>605</b> results in higher potential profits, especially when aggregated over multiple financial transactions. The trading network where the financial transactions take place (e.g., a stock or commodity exchange) has a certain amount of processing jitter in the order of when transactions are processed. If the timing advantage (TC-T<b>12</b>) between the competitor network <b>605</b> and the communication system <b>200</b> is small relative to the trading system jitter, then the value of the advantage drops because a message from point TC may be executed before one from point T<b>12</b> some fraction of the time, even when the message at T<b>12</b> arrived first.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Messages errors, such as the number of messages received correctly, can also impact profitability. Sometimes a message cannot be decoded properly and/or the error correction technique is not capable of reliably correcting the message within the time advantage window (or ever). This leads to message erasure in which the transmitted message is deleted and/or never decoded properly at the receiving station <b>218</b>. It should be appreciated that message erasures can detrimentally impact profitability of the HF radio channel <b>206</b> using the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b> or other communication systems <b>100</b> (e.g., the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> communication system <b>500</b>). The number of errored messages delivered to the trading system further impacts client profitability which in turn impacts the potential profitability of the communication system <b>200</b>. These errored messages occur when the demodulator <b>425</b> incorrectly decodes something that is not a message, such as radio noise and/or message fill data, as a valid message.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the aggregate, timing advantages and system performance affect the economic value of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b>. For instance, the timing advantage (TC-T<b>12</b>), the number of messages transmitted, and message error rates are some of the factors that impact profitability. These factors can offset one another. For example, the value of a successful message may decrease as the system timing advantage (TC-T<b>12</b>) decreases. This effect is exacerbated by the trading system jitter.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Looking at a graph <b>700</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the concept of diminishing returns also applies resulting in a reduced increase in value per unit of time advantage as the absolute advantage grows. As shown by an expected return line <b>705</b> in the graph <b>700</b>, there is a minimum delay advantage point <b>710</b> where the timing advantage (TC-T<b>12</b>) of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b> will result in profitability from a statistical perspective (e.g., on average). Among other things, the minimum delay advantage point <b>710</b> provides a tolerance or safety margin to account for financial trading system jitter. However, there is also a point of diminishing returns <b>715</b> where having the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b> being even faster than the competitor network <b>605</b> only minimally impacts the expected return, or even not at all. Between the minimum delay advantage point <b>710</b> and point of diminishing returns <b>715</b>, there is a target range <b>720</b> where the communication system <b>100</b> should normally operate to ensure profitability.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In addition to timing advantage, the transmission performance of the communication system <b>100</b> affects the economic value of the communication system <b>100</b>. Simply put, more messages being delivered by the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b> results in more profit potential. Radio and other transmissions are not perfect. The messages decoded at the receiving station <b>218</b> can be correct, erased, or an error (i.e., a false positive message). Each message type has an expected value with errored messages having a negative expected value (a loss). Erased messages can have either a neutral value (no gain or loss) or represent a loss due a missed trade or opportunity that needed to be executed. This relationship can be represented by Equation 1 below.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>R</i><sub>EV</sub><i>=N</i><sub>Succ</sub><i>*E</i>(Succ)&#x2212;<i>N</i><sub>Erased</sub><i>*E</i>(Erased)&#x2212;<i>N</i><sub>Error</sub><i>*E</i>(Error)&#x2003;&#x2003;(Equation 1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0085">where: R<sub>EV</sub>=expected return value for the system</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0086">N<sub>Succ</sub>=number of messages successfully received</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0087">E(Succ)=expected value per successful message</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0088">N<sub>Erased</sub>=number of messages erased because the messages could not be decoded correctly</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0089">E(Erased)=expected value per erased message</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0090">N<sub>Error </sub>is the number of messages in error were decoded incorrectly</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0091">E(Error)=expected value per errored message</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0087" num="0092">During normal operation, the communication system <b>100</b> aims to keep the number of successfully received messages (N<sub>Succ</sub>) much greater than the number of erased (N<sub>Erased</sub>) and message errors (N<sub>Error</sub>). This allow the control heuristics for the communication system <b>100</b> to focus on the number of successful messages received and the timing advantage of the communication system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0093">One of the areas of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b> that is designed or configured to address the timing advantage, message erasure, and message error issues is the demodulator <b>425</b> at the receiving station <b>218</b>. For example, the message length, modulation technique, error coding overhead/technique, and equalizer delay (T<b>10</b>-T<b>9</b>) among other things affect the time delay over the skywave communication system <b>200</b> to the output of the demodulator <b>425</b> (T<b>10</b>-T<b>0</b>).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0094">To help simplify the explanation, the message length for this example is constant, but in practice, the message length can vary based on channel capacity or other factors. In the receiving station <b>218</b>, modulation and coding are considered in tandem as together they determine the capacity of a radio channel for a given symbol rate. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, Table 1 <b>800</b> shows an example of message, modulation, and coding combinations for the communication system <b>200</b>. Other modes of operation are supported, but Table 1 <b>800</b> provides an illustrative example.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0095">Looking at the column for packets/second <b>805</b> in Table 1 <b>800</b>, it can be appreciated that the potential message capacity of the communication system <b>200</b> can vary with the modes selected. The reason that the higher performance modes cannot always be used is caused by the varying nature of the radio channel. Some dominant radio impairments considered include path loss where the lossier channels reduce channel capacity. The HF radio channel <b>206</b> also introduces noise directly into the radio path. Both excess loss and more radio-channel noise results in lower signal-to-noise ratios. For a digital system, the energy per bit received divided by the noise density (Eb/No) is often considered.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0096">Besides varying loss behavior, HF radio channels <b>206</b> have large amounts of inter-symbol interference due to multiple radio paths through the atmosphere, frequency dependent distortion, and Doppler shift. To combat the noise related effects, the communication system <b>200</b> sometime reduces the modulation complexity in order to increase the energy per bit to noise density ratio (Eb/No). To combat the radio channel non-linearities causing inter-symbol interference, the receiving station <b>218</b> uses one or more equalizers. However, it was found that equalizers add delays to the received signal. If the processing time in the equalizer (i.e., equalizer length) is too long, the delay advantage of the skywave communication system <b>200</b> (TC-T<b>12</b>) may become less than the required minimum delay advantage point <b>710</b> (T<sub>MIN</sub>) such that using the skywave communication system <b>200</b> will likely not be profitable. In such a case, the receiving station <b>218</b> of the communication system <b>200</b> uses a shorter equalizer that has less delay and with a more robust (but lower throughput) operating mode. In other words, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b> shifts gears between operating modes as the HF radio channel <b>206</b> changes.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0097">In one example, the skywave communication system <b>200</b> includes a modem adaption system that controls a number of parameters. These parameters for example include modulation formats, error correction techniques/overhead, message size, OTA data collection period, and choice of reference point for an equalization. The OTA data collection period includes both message serialization time and time to collect some (or most) of the multipath energy. The choice of reference point for equalization parameter is used in cases where the signal with the highest power might not be the first one received (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0098">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, Table 1 <b>800</b> shows an example set of modulation, message lengths and forward error correction (FEC) options used in the skywave communication system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. As will be explained in further detail below, the data represented by Table 1 <b>800</b> is used by the skywave communication system <b>200</b> during the gear shifting method. As can be seen, Table 1 <b>800</b> includes one or more mode identifiers <b>810</b> that identify a specific mode <b>815</b> of operation that the communication system <b>200</b> should use when communicating over the HF radio channel <b>206</b>. In the illustrated example, the mode identifiers <b>810</b> are in the form of a number, but other types of symbols can be used to identify the mode <b>815</b> in other examples. Among other things, each mode <b>815</b> in the illustrated example has a specific modulation method <b>820</b>, FEC scheme <b>825</b>, cyclic redundancy check (CRC) <b>830</b> scheme, user payload size <b>835</b>, total payload size <b>840</b>, encoded bit size <b>845</b>, payload symbol <b>850</b>, packet length <b>855</b>, and data rate <b>860</b>. While modulation method <b>820</b> shown in Table 1 <b>800</b> includes only quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), it should be appreciated that other types and/or combinations of modulation/demodulation techniques can be used such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), and phase modulation (PM) techniques, to name just a few.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0099">As can be seen, the modes <b>815</b> are generally organized or sorted based on the packets/second <b>805</b> or data rate <b>860</b>. In other words, the modes <b>815</b> with higher numbers for the mode identifiers <b>810</b> have higher order QAM constellations. In the illustrated example, the modes <b>815</b> have a slower data rate <b>860</b> (or packets/second <b>805</b>) with a lower mode identifier <b>810</b> number as compared to the modes <b>815</b> have higher data rates <b>860</b>. It should be appreciated that the exact mode numbers for the mode identifiers <b>810</b> can be flipped or reversed in other examples. While moving to higher order modulation schemes with the modes <b>815</b> increases the data rate <b>860</b>, there is a reduced noise immunity and reduced inter-symbol interference (ISI) immunity such that there is a higher risk for error. As will be explained in greater detail below, the skywave communication system <b>200</b> tests and shifts between these modes <b>815</b> to achieve a more financially and/or performance optimal communication scheme.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0100">Other message lengths and coding schemes can be used in other examples. It should be recognized that increasing the number of bits per symbol decreases message transit time. Increasing the number of bits per symbol in turn increases the number of offered messages and also increases the system timing advantage or delay advantage of the skywave communication system <b>200</b> (TC-T<b>12</b>). With these two favorable characteristics of potentially more value per message (i.e., due to time advantage) and more messages in a given period of time, the communication system <b>200</b> is designed to run as fast as possible. However, the speed of the skywave communication system <b>200</b> is limited up to where message reliability degrades to a point that the expected value (R<sub>EV</sub>) of the communication system <b>200</b> begins to decrease.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> includes a graph <b>900</b> showing signal power along a short transmission path <b>905</b>, a medium transition path <b>910</b>, and a long transmission path <b>915</b> in which the short transmission path <b>905</b> has the highest energy. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> graph <b>900</b> shows a decreasing monotonic function where the delay profile tends to have less energy in the echoes than the main energy lobe. While this does occur, it is not always the case. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> includes a graph <b>1000</b> showing signal power along a short transmission path <b>1005</b>, a medium transition path <b>1010</b>, and a long transmission path <b>1015</b> in which the medium transition path <b>1010</b> has the highest energy. In this scenario of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> graph <b>1000</b>, the peak signal power comes after some initial signal power. An issue arises as to whether the receiving station <b>218</b> should (1) attempt to equalize on the first energy peak, or (2) wait and use the larger, but later, energy peak. During operation, the communication system <b>200</b> considers both of these options.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0102">One example of a demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b> that is configured to switch between one or more operational for equalizing and decoding a data stream <b>1105</b> from the low latency, low bandwidth communication link <b>204</b>, such as the HF radio channel <b>206</b>, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. In one example, the data stream <b>1105</b> includes one or more signals that were received through skywave propagation over the HF radio channel <b>206</b>.

While the demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b> will be described as operating on the demodulator <b>425</b> for processing the incoming data stream <b>1105</b>, it should be recognized that the demodulator <b>425</b> can be incorporated in a modulator-demodulator (modem) to facilitate two-way communication. The demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b> can be configured as hardware, firmware, and/or software on the demodulator <b>425</b> or a general purpose computer. In one version, the demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b> is in the form of software that runs via a processor and memory on the demodulator <b>425</b>. In another version, the demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b> is implemented using electronic hardware.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0103">As can be seen, the demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b> includes two or more demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b> that are configured to analyze and decode the data stream <b>1105</b>, a controller <b>1115</b> that controls the operation of the demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b>, and a message validator and selector unit <b>1120</b> configured to validate and select messages decoded by the demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b>. As shown, the demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b> are operationally positioned between the data stream <b>1105</b> and the message validator and selector unit <b>1120</b>. Among other things, the demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b> are configured to equalize and decode the data stream <b>1105</b>, and if a correct message is decoded (or not), the demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b> are configured to supply the decoded message to the message validator and selector unit <b>1120</b>. In the illustrated example, the demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b> has three (3) demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b>, but in other examples, the demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b> can have two (2) demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b> or more than three (3) three demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b>. The demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b> in the depicted example include a first demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1125</b>, a second demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1130</b>, and a third demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1135</b>. For instance, these three demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b> in one form can each be assigned or otherwise configured to decode the message of a corresponding message path signal shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>.

In one version, the demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b> is biased to inhibit false positives by favoring message erasure over the creation of errored messages. In one example, the demodulators <b>1145</b> in the demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b> use an error correction scheme to more likely create message erasures as compared to creating errored messages. This behavior of favoring message erasures is accomplished in one case by limiting the number of bits the forward error correction (FEC) scheme in the demodulators <b>1145</b> can correct to less than a maximum number of bits that the FEC scheme can potentially correct.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0105">Similar to a vehicle transmission, the demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b> is able to shift gears between different equalizer and/or decoding schemes depending on the conditions of the primary communication channel <b>120</b> as well as other issues. Depending on the time of day and/or solar activity along with other conditions, for example, different channel frequencies may be more suitable for the HF radio channel <b>206</b>. By having an equalizer time that is between the first, short equalizer <b>1150</b> and the third, long equalizer <b>1170</b>, the second demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1130</b> is normally configured to be the main demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b> used to decode messages with time delays within the target range <b>720</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). The first demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1125</b> and primary channel latency <b>135</b> are designed to test or probe to see if another equalizer and/or demodulator setting would be more appropriate under the current conditions. For example, the dominant message decoder (i.e., second demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1130</b>) advances in time to the shorter equalizer symbol length of the first, short equalizer <b>1150</b> when the first demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1125</b> consistently provides a valid message before the calculations are completed on the second demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1130</b>. Under this condition, the communication channel <b>115</b> is becoming more benign or better. In other words, the operational parameters for the second demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1130</b> are upshifted to the operational parameters of the first demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1125</b> that has the first, short equalizer <b>1150</b> with a shorter symbol length or depth such that the messages can be decoded faster. A particular HF radio channel <b>206</b> is deemed less favorable to radio communication when the main, second demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1130</b> is having more difficulty in correctly decoding the short transmission path <b>1005</b> for messages. When this occurs, the second demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1130</b> is downshifted to the operational parameters of the third demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1135</b> with the third, long equalizer <b>1170</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0106">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the controller <b>1115</b> is operatively connected to the demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b> to provide configuration data to the equalizers <b>1140</b> and demodulators <b>1145</b> of the demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b> to control the operation of the demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b>. The controller <b>1115</b> is for example configured to set the symbol depth of each first equalizer <b>1150</b>. The controller <b>1115</b> is further operatively connected to the message validator and selector unit <b>1120</b> to receive selection data from the message validator and selector unit <b>1120</b>. Among other things, the selection data includes the number of messages detected from each equalizer settings in the demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b>. The controller <b>1115</b> further has a controller input <b>1185</b> where the controller <b>1115</b> receives internal information as well as measurements and estimates from the rest of the system delay model <b>600</b>. For example, the controller <b>1115</b> through the controller input <b>1185</b> is able to examine estimates of the signal to noise ratio (SNR), packet error rate (PER), and/or the time delay between the high latency, high bandwidth communication link <b>208</b> and the HF radio channel <b>206</b> (T<b>16</b>-T<b>9</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). Using the required delay and time advantage (TC-T<b>12</b>) performance requirements for the communication system <b>200</b>, the controller <b>1115</b> sets the configuration data for the three demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b>. Through the primary communication channel <b>120</b> and/or backend communication channel <b>125</b>, the controller <b>1115</b> communicates to the transmit controller at the transmission station <b>214</b> to set the desired current mode of operation. For example, the controller <b>1115</b> can communicate to the transmission station <b>214</b> the error correction scheme and which HF radio channels <b>206</b> to use through the fiber optic cable <b>420</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0107">As noted before with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the time advantage has an optimum or target range <b>720</b>. For instance, it makes little sense to have a large number of messages with minimal expected return (i.e., the delay advantage is very small). This situation can occur when the modulation is complex, but the equalizer needs to be very long to correct the channel distortions. Similarly, the operating mode is sub-optimum if there are close to zero (0) message failures in the communication system <b>200</b>, but the delay advantage has reached the point of diminishing returns <b>715</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0108">To balance these as well as other concerns, the controller <b>1115</b> sets a delay range window or the target range <b>720</b>, and the controller <b>1115</b> of the demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b> then aims to maximize the number of messages successfully received subject to staying within the target range <b>720</b>, as is shown by a chart <b>1200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. As shown, the chart <b>1200</b> shows competitor data arrival time (TC) <b>1205</b> and system data arrival time <b>1210</b>. As can be seen, the time difference between the competitor data arrival time <b>1205</b> and primary communication channel <b>120</b> creates a system delay advantage <b>1215</b>. At a minimum, the controller <b>1115</b> of the demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b> attempts to keep the system data arrival time <b>1210</b> between the minimum delay advantage point <b>710</b> and point of diminishing returns <b>715</b>, and more preferably, within the target range <b>720</b>. As indicated by double arrow <b>1220</b>, adjusting the bits/symbol changes the system delay advantage <b>1215</b>. For example, reducing the bit/symbol generally increases the length of time required to equalize and decode the message such that the system delay advantage <b>1215</b> is reduced, and increasing the number of bits per symbol generally reduces the time, thereby increasing the system data arrival time <b>1210</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, double arrow <b>1225</b> indicates the equalizer length. Generally speaking, longer equalizer windows increase the equalization time to the message which in turn reduces the system delay advantage <b>1215</b>, and shorter equalization windows reduce the message processing time, thereby increasing the system delay advantage <b>1215</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> show a flowchart <b>1300</b> that illustrates the overall gear shifting technique used by the demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b> of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Again, in an ideal situation for financial trading, the communication system <b>200</b> should transmit messages as fast as possible, but if the messages are transmitted too fast, the PER increases to the point where no useful information is transmitted. Once the system data arrival time (T<b>12</b>) <b>1210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>) approaches the point of diminishing returns <b>715</b>, there is a financial incentive to make more trades in any given time period. To accomplish this, the communication system <b>200</b> generally uses a higher rate coding and sends more messages over the same communication channel <b>115</b> in which the same number of bits are used with a fewer number of symbols. Looking for example at Table 1 <b>800</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the 16-QAM scheme for mode 4 and the 512-QAM scheme of mode 9 have the same number of user payload bits (i.e., 64 bits). However, the 512-QAM mode <b>815</b> only needs ten (10) payload symbols <b>850</b> and has a packet length <b>855</b> of 1.3 milliseconds (ms). In contrast, the 16-QAM scheme of mode 4 needs twenty-five (25) payload symbols <b>850</b> which results in a longer packet length <b>855</b> of 3.1 ms. Comparing mode 9 to mode 4 on a theoretical level, more than twice the number of financial transactions are able to be executed within the same time period using mode 9.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0110">Nevertheless, there is a trade-off of message robustness when transmitting more bits per symbol. As depicted by double arrow <b>1220</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, reducing the number of bits per symbol makes the message or packet length <b>855</b> longer, but the message is more robust such that there is less risk of errors such as when being transmitted over noisy communication channels <b>115</b>. This longer message length and the resulting longer message time can be sometimes acceptable so long as the system delay advantage <b>1215</b> is more than the minimum delay advantage point <b>710</b>. For example, downshifting the slower 16-QAM scheme of mode 4 may be justified when the system data arrival time <b>1210</b> is close to or exceeds the point of diminishing returns <b>715</b>. These more robust, higher bits per symbol messages typically experience lower inter-symbol interference (ISI). Messages with lower ISI levels usually require shorter processing times by the equalizer <b>1140</b> to achieve the same PER. As such, at least some of the system delay advantage <b>1215</b> lost by using the more robust lower modes can be offset by the shorter equalizer processing time.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0111">Conversely, increasing the bits per symbol makes the message packet length <b>855</b> shorter and faster at the expense of message robustness. The resulting less robust but faster messages may be acceptable when the HF radio channel <b>206</b> is generally quiet and not noisy. For example, the demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b> may switch or shift from modulation-demodulation mode 6 (64-QAM) to mode 7 (128-QAM) under quiet channel conditions or when the system data arrival time <b>1210</b> is close to or less than the minimum delay advantage point <b>710</b>. This upshift in the demodulator mode can also occur when the system data arrival time <b>1210</b> is far away from the point of diminishing returns <b>715</b> so as to increase expected profitability. These less robust, higher bits per symbol messages are typically more susceptible to ISI levels, as well as requiring higher SNR. Reducing ISI levels can usually be addressed by longer equalizer processing times at the equalizer <b>1140</b>. From this discussion, it should be recognized that there are trade-offs between the modulation method <b>820</b> (or mode <b>815</b>) and the equalizer processing with respect to the system data arrival time (T<b>12</b>) <b>1210</b>, message successes, erased messages, and message errors as well as the expected profitability of the communication system <b>200</b>. The gear or modulation-equalizer shifting technique described herein considers these factors as well as others and accordingly adjusts the modulation-demodulation mode and the equalizer processing time to enhance system profitability under ever changing conditions.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0112">As mentioned before with respect to Table 1 <b>800</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b> maintains in memory at the transmission station <b>214</b> and receiving station <b>218</b> a list of different operational modes <b>815</b> generally sorted based on the modulation method <b>820</b>. There is a trade off between the higher data rates <b>860</b> provided by the higher order modulation methods <b>820</b> and the higher risk of noise and error associated with the higher order modulation methods <b>820</b>. While more robust FEC scheme <b>825</b> at the higher mode identifiers <b>810</b> in Table 1 <b>800</b> can be used to at least compensate for the increased errors, the more robust FEC scheme <b>825</b> typically requires a larger overhead which in turn at least partially reduces system delay advantage (TC-T<b>12</b>) <b>1215</b> at the decoding stage. In order to simplify the communication model in one example, the same FEC and CRC schemes are used in each packets/second <b>805</b> such that the data rate <b>860</b> will generally not be impacted. In this case, the modulation method <b>820</b> and/or radio frequency or HF radio channel <b>206</b> are the parameters that are adjusted when the modes <b>815</b> are switched. In another example, the FEC scheme <b>825</b> and CRC scheme <b>830</b> can change (or not) for each of the modes <b>815</b> identified by the mode identifiers <b>810</b>. These additional variables add complexity to the model which in turn may improve performance of the communication system <b>200</b>. To help with understanding, the techniques will be described with reference to modes generally having the same FEC and CRC schemes, but it should be recognized that the more complex variable FEC/CRC methods can be used in other examples.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0113">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, and <b>12</b></figref>, there is again a tradeoff based on the length of the equalizer processing time the equalizer <b>1140</b> use when receiving a message. When possible, the shorter equalizer window is designed to attempt to demodulate messages received along the short transmission path <b>905</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> or short transmission path <b>1005</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the shorter equalizer increases the system delay advantage (TC-T<b>12</b>) <b>1215</b>. However, as shown by the lower energy short transmission path <b>1005</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the shorter path signal may not have sufficient power to be detected by the first equalizer <b>1150</b> demodulator <b>1155</b> pair. In that case, the longer equalizer windows for the second equalizer <b>1160</b> or even the third equalizer <b>1170</b> may be needed to detect the message through the higher power medium transition path <b>1010</b> from an echo or in combination with all three paths. These longer equalizer processing windows tend to reduce the amount of ISI which in turn reduces the risk of message erasures and message errors. However, the longer equalizer processing windows adversely affect the system delay advantage (TC-T<b>12</b>) <b>1215</b>. As shown by the double arrow <b>1225</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, a shorter equalizer window increases the system delay advantage (TC-T<b>12</b>) <b>1215</b>, and the longer equalizer window reduces the system delay advantage <b>1215</b>. The gear shifting method illustrated by the flowchart <b>1300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> switches or shifts the demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b> between various mode identifiers <b>810</b> and equalizer windows to keep the system data arrival time (T<b>12</b>) <b>1210</b> within the target range <b>720</b> for optimal transmission and/or financial performance.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0114">To keep the system data arrival time (T<b>12</b>) <b>1210</b> within the target range <b>720</b>, the controller <b>1115</b> in stage <b>1305</b> monitors various performance factors or parameters, such as the PER, SNR, expected transaction values, system delay advantage (TC-T<b>12</b>) <b>1215</b>, etc., in the system delay model <b>600</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). Shifting in one example is considered under three general scenarios or categories. The first scenario occurs when there is one dominant communication path (<b>905</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) on the HF radio channel <b>206</b> and there is little ISI. In this first scenario, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the HF radio channel <b>206</b> is the deciding factor of which modulation method <b>820</b> to use. If the SNR is improving (i.e., the HF radio channel <b>206</b> is becoming more quiet), the controller <b>1115</b> may consider performing a test or probe to see if an upshift of the mode <b>815</b> (e.g., switch from 64-QAM in mode 6 to 128-QAM in mode 7 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) is a plausible option. On the other hand, when the SNR is degrading such that the HF radio channel <b>206</b> is becoming noisier, the controller <b>1115</b> may consider performing a probe to see if a downshift of the mode <b>815</b> (e.g., switch from 32-QAM in mode 5 to 16-QAM in mode 4) is a plausible option.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0115">In a second scenario, the SNR is ample or otherwise acceptable for all of the modulation methods <b>820</b> (e.g., modes <b>4</b> to <b>9</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>), but the ISI level is high. As should be appreciated, extending the equalizer processing windows for the equalizer <b>1140</b> will help compensate for the increased ISI. Looking at the double arrow <b>1225</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the length of the equalizer processing windows can be theoretically increased until the system delay advantage <b>1215</b> is just slightly more than (or even equal to) the minimum delay advantage point <b>710</b> so as to achieve statistical profitability. As noted before, the competitor data arrival time <b>1205</b> on average can be determined, but obtaining real-time competitor arrival data that is accurate may be difficult. It would be expected that the competitor network <b>605</b> and the fiber optic cable <b>420</b> on the backend communication channel <b>125</b> of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communication system <b>200</b> would have similar transmission times.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0116">Under such a scenario, the transmission speed or time on the fiber optic cable <b>420</b> on the backend communication channel <b>125</b> (T<b>16</b>-T<b>0</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) can be used as a general proxy or substitute for the competitor data arrival time (TC) <b>1205</b> on the competitor network <b>605</b>. It should be recognized that transmission time point T<b>9</b> for the communication system <b>200</b> can be accurately determined by the network operator on a real-time basis. Moreover, the transmission time over the connection <b>272</b> (T<b>12</b>-T<b>10</b>) can be accurately determined at the time of commission for the communication system <b>200</b> so as to modify the calculations in order to provide a more accurate estimate for T<b>12</b>. In one embodiment, the time advantage (T<sub>ADV</sub>) between the fiber optic cable <b>420</b> of the high latency, high bandwidth communication link <b>208</b> (T<b>16</b>) and the skywave HF radio channel <b>206</b> of the low latency, low bandwidth communication link <b>204</b> (T<b>9</b>) at the input of the demodulator <b>425</b> (T<b>16</b>-T<b>9</b>) is used as the limit for testing purposes to generally correspond to the competitor data arrival time (TC) <b>1205</b>. The time advantage (T<sub>ADV</sub>) in some cases can be further modified by some factor or percentage to correspond to act as a buffer for these probe or testing limits. In another example, the time advantage (T<sub>ADV</sub>) is not modified because if the HF radio channel <b>206</b> were to be slower than the fiber optic cable <b>420</b>, there would be generally no need for the calculations because the message would be sent along the faster backend communication channel <b>125</b>. Other time point limits can be used for probing in other examples.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0117">In the second scenario where there is ample SNR for all modes but ISI is high, when the equalizer processing window extension is possible, and the resultant time advantage (T<sub>ADV</sub>) is greater than the minimum delay advantage point <b>710</b> (T<sub>MIN</sub>), then upshift probing is an option. On the other hand, when the equalizer processing window is increased to where the resultant time advantage (T<sub>ADV</sub>) is less than or equal to the minimum delay advantage point <b>710</b> (T<sub>MIN</sub>), then downshifting should occur to maintain financial viability of the communication system <b>200</b>. When downshifting is required, it normally should occur. In contrast, upshifting is more of a matter of conjecture and not always the correct way to proceed. In other words, downshifting is safer than upshifting as the demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b> can tell that the current situation for downshifting is not operable and needs to change; whereas upshifting is based on a prediction that increasing the modulation level will bring increased message throughput. As such, upshifting is preceded with probing or testing to confirm that the upshifting will work. While not necessary, probing can also be performed during downshifting. The third scenario is some combination of the first and second scenarios. In this third scenario, ISI and SNR are both to some extent limiting the mode of operation for the communication system <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0118">When parameters indicate that a shift to a new equalizer processing window size and/or mode is desirable or needed in stage <b>1310</b>, the controller <b>1115</b> via the demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b> performs a test or probes the potential shift using newer equalizer time windows and/or mode <b>815</b> in stage <b>1315</b>. Under normal operating conditions, the first demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1125</b>, second demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1130</b>, and third demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1135</b> are operating simultaneously.

To put it another way, the first equalizer <b>1150</b> and third equalizer <b>1170</b> are used as edge cases that do not necessarily operate under the limits placed in the second demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1130</b> so as to determine operational potential for the demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0119">Typically, the second demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1130</b> operates under the conditions that time advantage (T<sub>ADV</sub>) is greater than or equal to the minimum delay advantage point <b>710</b> (T<sub>MIN</sub>) and the time advantage (T<sub>ADV</sub>) is less than or equal to the limit (T<sub>DIM</sub>) for the point of diminishing returns <b>715</b> (i.e., T<sub>MIN</sub>&#x2264;T<sub>ADV</sub>&#x2264;T<sub>DIM</sub>).

The second demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1130</b> can also be downshifted to the operational parameters of the third demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1135</b>. Once shifting occurs, the controller <b>1115</b> returns to stage <b>1305</b> to start the process again.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> includes a Table 2 <b>1400</b> that shows some examples of the variables the controller <b>1115</b> uses when performing the shifting techniques illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>, <b>15</b>, and <b>16</b></figref>. It should be appreciated that other variables can be considered and processed in the controller <b>1115</b> using these techniques. The variable ranges and types specified in Table 2 <b>1400</b> are just some examples, and these ranges and types can be different in other examples. Moreover, other combinations of variables can be considered when performing these shifting techniques.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0124">Again, there is a financial incentive to make more trades in any given time period. To accomplish this, upshifting is used by the communication system <b>200</b> to switch to a higher rate coding. Looking for example at Table 1 <b>800</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the communication system <b>200</b> performs an upshift when the communication system <b>200</b> switches from the 64-QAM scheme for mode 6 to the 128-QAM scheme of mode 7. When this upshift occurs, the packets/second <b>805</b> and data rate <b>860</b> increase which in turn can increase the profitability of the communication system <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0125">An example of the shifting technique of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is illustrated by a flowchart <b>1500</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. In particular, the flowchart <b>1500</b> shows the acts that the controller <b>1115</b> as well as the other components of the demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b> perform during an upshift event. The controller <b>1115</b> can initiate the upshift process based on a number of events or conditions. For example, the controller <b>1115</b> can initiate the upshift process when the measured packet error rate (PER) from the system output <b>1180</b> or from some of the demodulator-equalizer units <b>1110</b> is less than a lower limit such as a packet error rate minimum (PER&#x3c;PER<sub>MIN</sub>). As alluded to before, the PER may reach a point of diminishing returns in which further decreasing the PER is not financially beneficial or beneficial from an overall system performance perspective. Usually, reducing the PER comes at the expense of the system delay advantage <b>1215</b>. Alternatively or additionally, upshifting can be initiated when the signal to noise ratio (SNR) trends upwards and/or when the channel estimator or model that the controller <b>1115</b> uses indicates the system delay advantage (TC-T<b>12</b>) <b>1215</b> is decreasing. Another factor that can be considered alone or in combination with other factors is the first demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1125</b> using a delay time such that time advantage as measured at T<b>16</b>-T<b>9</b> (T<sub>ADV</sub>) is greater than the time or point of diminishing returns <b>715</b> (T<sub>DIM</sub>) (i.e., T<sub>ADV</sub>&#x3e;T<sub>DIM </sub>has a PER that is considerably less than the maximum permissible error rate (PER<sub>MAX</sub>) (i.e., PER&#x3c;&#x3c;PER<sub>MAX</sub>). To put it another way, upshifting is usually tested when the communication system <b>200</b> is too good in that there are no or very few errors under the current demodulation and equalizer settings.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0126">When one or more of the above conditions occur (and/or other conditions), the controller <b>1115</b> initiates the upshift process. In stage <b>1505</b>, the controller <b>1115</b> instructs the transmission station <b>214</b> to initiate an upshift at a specific upshift time (T<sub>SHIFT</sub>) or within a specific time range. Both transmission station <b>214</b> and receiving station <b>218</b> maintain data similar to Table 1 <b>800</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> so as to coordinate which modulation mode to use. This modulation information can be updated on a periodic and/or as-needed basis. The instructions can be sent via the primary communication channel <b>120</b>, like the HF radio channel <b>206</b>, and/or via the backend communication channel <b>125</b> such as the fiber optic cable <b>420</b>. The controller <b>1115</b> in stage <b>1510</b> sets the mode <b>815</b> to the next highest modulation method <b>820</b> (i.e., one modulation mode above the current one). For example, if the initial mode was mode 4 (16-QAM), the controller <b>1115</b> will set the first demodulator <b>1155</b> to demodulate using mode 5 (32-QAM) in Table 1 <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The equalizer processing window for the short, first equalizer <b>1150</b> is set so that the window or the time advantage (T<sub>ADV</sub>) is the same as the minimum delay advantage point <b>710</b> (T<sub>MIN</sub>) for the new mode (mode N+1). Using the modulation from the new mode, the modulator <b>405</b> at the transmission station <b>214</b> modulates and transmits over the HF radio channel <b>206</b> a number (N<sub>PROBE</sub>) of probe signals at a rate of 1 every probing time period (T<sub>PROBE </sub>ms) in stage <b>1515</b>. Returning to the previous example, the probe messages or signals are modulated by the modulator <b>405</b> using mode 5 (32-QAM), and the transmission station <b>214</b> transmits ten (10) probes spaced out by 30 ms over the HF radio channel <b>206</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0127">In stage <b>1520</b>, if first demodulator <b>1155</b> probes are unsuccessful in that the PER is at or exceeds a maximum limit (PER&#x2265;PER<sub>MAX</sub>), then the controller <b>1115</b> determines if the probing has exceeded the number of attempts or tries limit (N<sub>TRIES</sub>) in stage <b>1525</b>. If not, the controller <b>1115</b> instructs the modulator <b>405</b> and radio transmitter <b>410</b> at the transmission station <b>214</b> to continue probing and send new values in stage <b>1515</b>. When the demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b> is not successful after the specified number of attempts limit (N<sub>TRIES</sub>) then the upshift is abandoned in stage <b>1530</b>. On the other hand, if first demodulator <b>1155</b> in stage <b>1520</b> receives the probes successfully (i.e., PER&#x3c;PER<sub>MIN</sub>), the controller <b>1115</b> in stage <b>1535</b> instructs the modulator <b>405</b> at the transmission station <b>214</b> to change to the new mode.

Once first demodulator <b>1155</b> in stage <b>1540</b> is receiving the messages, the second demodulator <b>1165</b> and third demodulator <b>1175</b> are set to the new modulator mode of the first demodulator <b>1155</b> in stage <b>1545</b>. Returning to the previous example, the second demodulator <b>1165</b> and third demodulator <b>1175</b> are upshifted to demodulate messages now according to mode 5 (32-QAM). The equalizer processing time window for the second equalizer <b>1160</b> in stage <b>1545</b> is also set to the new equalizer processing time window (or T<sub>ADV</sub>) used by the first equalizer <b>1150</b> during the probing.

The controller <b>1115</b> can initiate the downshift process based on a number of events or conditions. For example, the decision to downshift can be based on one or more of the following conditions plus others. For example, downshifting should occur when the measured PER is greater that a maximum packet error rate limit (PER<sub>MAX</sub>). Downshifting can also occur when the measured SNR is trending down for the demodulator-equalizer system <b>1100</b>. This can further happen when the channel estimation indicates that the delay spread (and hence ISI) is increasing. Downshifting may be advisable when the PER of third demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1135</b> is the only one less than the packet error rate limit (PER<sub>MAX</sub>) and third equalizer <b>1170</b> is set so that the time advantage (T<sub>ADV</sub>) is less than or equal to the minimum delay advantage point <b>710</b> (T<sub>MIN</sub>) for the third demodulator-equalizer unit <b>1135</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0132">When one or more of the above conditions occur (and/or other conditions), the controller <b>1115</b> initiates the downshift process.

The words in these definitions are to only have their plain and ordinary meaning. Such plain and ordinary meaning is inclusive of all consistent dictionary definitions from the most recently published Webster's dictionaries and Random House dictionaries. As used in the specification and claims, the following definitions apply to these terms and common variations thereof identified below.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0137">&#x201c;Antenna&#x201d; or &#x201c;Antenna system&#x201d; generally refers to an electrical device, or series of devices, in any suitable configuration, that converts electric power into electromagnetic radiation. Such radiation may be either vertically, horizontally, or circularly polarized at any frequency along the electromagnetic spectrum. Antennas transmitting with circular polarity may have either right-handed or left-handed polarization. In the case of radio waves, an antenna may transmit at frequencies ranging along an electromagnetic spectrum from extremely low frequency (ELF) to extremely high frequency (EHF). An antenna or antenna system designed to transmit radio waves may comprise an arrangement of metallic conductors (elements), electrically connected (often through a transmission line) to a receiver or transmitter. An oscillating current of electrons forced through the antenna by a transmitter can create an oscillating magnetic field around the antenna elements, while the charge of the electrons also creates an oscillating electric field along the elements. These time-varying fields radiate away from the antenna into space as a moving transverse electromagnetic field wave. Conversely, during reception, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of an incoming electromagnetic wave exert force on the electrons in the antenna elements, causing them to move back and forth, creating oscillating currents in the antenna. These currents can then be detected by receivers and processed to retrieve digital or analog signals or data. Antennas can be designed to transmit and receive radio waves substantially equally in all horizontal directions (omnidirectional antennas), or preferentially in a particular direction (directional or high gain antennas). In the latter case, an antenna may also include additional elements or surfaces which may or may not have any physical electrical connection to the transmitter or receiver. For example, parasitic elements, parabolic reflectors or horns, and other such non-energized elements serve to direct the radio waves into a beam or other desired radiation pattern. Thus antennas may be configured to exhibit increased or decreased directionality or &#x201c;gain&#x201d; by the placement of these various surfaces or elements. High gain antennas can be configured to direct a substantially large portion of the radiated electromagnetic energy in a given direction that may be vertical, horizontal, or any combination thereof. Antennas may also be configured to radiate electromagnetic energy within a specific range of vertical angles (i.e. &#x201c;takeoff angles) relative to the earth in order to focus electromagnetic energy toward an upper layer of the atmosphere such as the ionosphere. By directing electromagnetic energy toward the upper atmosphere at a specific angle, specific skip distances may be achieved at particular times of day by transmitting electromagnetic energy at particular frequencies. Other examples of antennas include emitters and sensors that convert electrical energy into pulses of electromagnetic energy in the visible or invisible light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Examples include light emitting diodes, lasers, and the like that are configured to generate electromagnetic energy at frequencies ranging along the electromagnetic spectrum from far infrared to extreme ultraviolet.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0138">&#x201c;Backend Communication Channel&#x201d;, &#x201c;Secondary Communication Channel&#x201d;, or &#x201c;Secondary Channel&#x201d; generally refers to a communication pathway that is a main choice for transferring information. Typically, but not always, the secondary channel has one or more properties, such as latency or bandwidth, that make the channel less desirable over a primary channel. For example, a secondary channel can have a lower data rate and/or latency as compared to a primary channel. A primary channel may support the transfer of information in one direction only, either direction alternately, or both directions simultaneously. The secondary channel can for example include wired and wireless forms of communication.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0139">&#x201c;Band&#x201d; or &#x201c;Frequency Bandwidth&#x201d; generally refer to a contiguous range of frequencies defined by an upper and lower frequency. Frequency bandwidth is thus typically expressed as a number of hertz (cycles per second) representing the difference between the upper frequency and the lower frequency of the band and may or may not include the upper and lower frequencies themselves. A &#x201c;band&#x201d; can therefore be defined by a given frequency bandwidth for a given region and designated with generally agreed on terms. For example, the &#x201c;20 meter band&#x201d; in the United States is assigned the frequency range from 14 MHz to 14.35 MHz thus defining a frequency bandwidth of 0.35 MHz or 350 KHz. In another example, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has designated the frequency range from 300 MHz to 3 GHz as the &#x201c;UHF band&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0140">&#x201c;Checksum&#x201d; generally refers to data derived from a block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors that may have been introduced during its transmission and/or storage. Typically, the checksum data is relatively small-sized. By themselves, checksums are often used to verify data integrity, but checksums are not typically relied upon to verify data authenticity. The procedure or process that generates the checksum from a data input is called a checksum function or checksum algorithm. Depending on the use case, a good checksum algorithm will usually output a significantly different value, even for small changes made to the data input. When the computed checksum for a data input matches the stored value of a previously computed checksum, the probability that the data has not been accidentally altered and/or corrupted is high. Some checksum algorithm techniques include parity byte, sum complement, and position-dependent algorithms. Check digits and parity bits are special cases of checksums that are usually appropriate for small blocks of data. Some error-correcting codes are based on special checksums which not only detect common errors, but the error correcting code in some cases further helps in the recovery of the original data.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0141">&#x201c;Command&#x201d; or &#x201c;Command Data&#x201d; generally refers to one or more directives, instructions, algorithms, or rules controlling a machine to take one or more actions, alone or in combination. A command may be stored, transferred, transmitted, or otherwise processed in any suitable manner. For example, a command may be stored in a memory or transmitted over a communication network as electromagnetic radiation at any suitable frequency passing through any suitable medium.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0142">&#x201c;Communication Link&#x201d; generally refers to a connection between two or more communicating entities and may or may not include a communications channel between the communicating entities. The communication between the communicating entities may occur by any suitable means. For example the connection may be implemented as an actual physical link, an electrical link, an electromagnetic link, a logical link, or any other suitable linkage facilitating communication. In the case of an actual physical link, communication may occur by multiple components in the communication link configured to respond to one another by physical movement of one element in relation to another. In the case of an electrical link, the communication link may be composed of multiple electrical conductors electrically connected to form the communication link. In the case of an electromagnetic link, elements of the connection may be implemented by sending or receiving electromagnetic energy at any suitable frequency, thus allowing communications to pass as electromagnetic waves. These electromagnetic waves may or may not pass through a physical medium such as an optical fiber, or through free space, or any combination thereof. Electromagnetic waves may be passed at any suitable frequency including any frequency in the electromagnetic spectrum. In the case of a logical link, the communication links may be a conceptual linkage between the sender and recipient such as a transmission station in the receiving station. Logical link may include any combination of physical, electrical, electromagnetic, or other types of communication links.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0143">&#x201c;Communication Node&#x201d; generally refers to a physical or logical connection point, redistribution point or endpoint along a communication link. A physical network node is generally referred to as an active electronic device attached or coupled to a communication link, either physically, logically, or electromagnetically. A physical node is capable of sending, receiving, or forwarding information over a communication link. A communication node may or may not include a computer, processor, transmitter, receiver, repeater, and/or transmission lines, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0144">&#x201c;Computer&#x201d; generally refers to any computing device configured to compute a result from any number of input values or variables. A computer may include a processor for performing calculations to process input or output. A computer may include a memory for storing values to be processed by the processor, or for storing the results of previous processing. A computer may also be configured to accept input and output from a wide array of input and output devices for receiving or sending values. Such devices include other computers, keyboards, mice, visual displays, printers, industrial equipment, and systems or machinery of all types and sizes. For example, a computer can control a network interface to perform various network communications upon request. A computer may be a single, physical, computing device such as a desktop computer, a laptop computer, or may be composed of multiple devices of the same type such as a group of servers operating as one device in a networked cluster, or a heterogeneous combination of different computing devices operating as one computer and linked together by a communication network. A computer may include one or more physical processors or other computing devices or circuitry, and may also include any suitable type of memory. A computer may also be a virtual computing platform having an unknown or fluctuating number of physical processors and memories or memory devices. A computer may thus be physically located in one geographical location or physically spread across several widely scattered locations with multiple processors linked together by a communication network to operate as a single computer. The concept of &#x201c;computer&#x201d; and &#x201c;processor&#x201d; within a computer or computing device also encompasses any such processor or computing device serving to make calculations or comparisons as part of a disclosed system. Processing operations related to threshold comparisons, rules comparisons, calculations, and the like occurring in a computer may occur, for example, on separate servers, the same server with separate processors, or on a virtual computing environment having an unknown number of physical processors as described above.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0145">&#x201c;Controller&#x201d; generally refers to a mechanical or electronic device configured to control the behavior of another mechanical or electronic device. A controller may include a &#x201c;control circuit&#x201d; configured to provide signals or other electrical impulses that may be received and interpreted by the controlled device to indicate how it should behave.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0146">&#x201c;Critical angle&#x201d; generally refers to the highest angle with respect to a vertical line extending to the center of the Earth at which an electromagnetic wave at a specific frequency can be returned to the earth using skywave propagation.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0147">&#x201c;Critical Frequency&#x201d; generally refers to the highest frequency that will be returned to the Earth when transmitted vertically under given ionospheric conditions using sky-wave propagation.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0148">&#x201c;Cyclic Redundancy Check&#x201d; or &#x201c;CRC&#x201d; generally refers to an error-detecting code or technique to detect errors in digital data. For example, CRC is commonly used in digital networks and/or storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data. CRC is based on binary division, and CRC is also sometimes referred to as polynomial code checksum. With CRC, blocks of data get encoded with or attached a short check value that is based on the remainder of a polynomial division of the contents of the blocks of data. During retrieval or decoding, the calculation is repeated. When the check values do not match, corrective action can be taken against data corruption. CRCs can be further used to facilitate error correction. The check or data verification value is a redundancy because it expands the message without adding information. CRCs can be simple to implement in binary hardware, easy to analyze mathematically, and are good at detecting common errors caused by noisy transmission channels. Given the check value has a fixed length, the function that generates the check value is sometimes used as a hash function.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0149">&#x201c;Data Bandwidth&#x201d; generally refers to the maximum throughput of a logical or physical communication path in a communication system. Data bandwidth is a transfer rate that can be expressed in units of data transferred per second. In a digital communications network, the units of data transferred are bits and the maximum throughput of a digital communications network is therefore generally expressed in &#x201c;bits per second&#x201d; or &#x201c;bit/s.&#x201d; By extension, the terms &#x201c;kilobit/s&#x201d; or &#x201c;Kbit/s&#x201d;, &#x201c;Megabit/s&#x201d; or &#x201c;Mbit/s&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Gigabit/s&#x201d; or &#x201c;Gbit/s&#x201d; can also be used to express the data bandwidth of a given digital communications network. Data networks may be rated according to their data bandwidth performance characteristics according to specific metrics such as &#x201c;peak bit rate&#x201d;, &#x201c;mean bit rate&#x201d;, &#x201c;maximum sustained bit rate&#x201d;, &#x201c;information rate&#x201d;, or &#x201c;physical layer useful bit rate.&#x201d; For example, bandwidth tests measure the maximum throughput of a computer network. The reason for this usage is that according to Hartley's Law, the maximum data rate of a physical communication link is proportional to its frequency bandwidth in hertz. Data bandwidth may also be characterized according to the maximum transfer rate for a particular communications network. For example:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0150">&#x201c;Low Data Bandwidth&#x201d; generally refers to a communications network with a maximum data transfer rate that is less than or about equal to 1,000,000 units of data per second. For example, in a digital communications network, the unit of data is a bit. Therefore low data bandwidth digital communications networks are networks with a maximum transfer rate that is less than or about equal to 1,000,000 bits per second (1 Mbits/s).</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0151">&#x201c;High Data Bandwidth&#x201d; generally refers to a communications network with a maximum data transfer rate that is greater than about 1,000,000 units of data per second. For example, a digital communications network with a high data bandwidth is a digital communications network with a maximum transfer rate that is greater than about 1,000,000 bits per second (1 Mbits/s).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0145" num="0152">&#x201c;Demodulation&#x201d; generally refers to a process of extracting an original information-bearing signal from a carrier wave.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0153">&#x201c;Demodulator&#x201d; or &#x201c;Detector&#x201d; generally refers to a device, such as an electronic circuit and/or computer, that extracts original information from a received modulated waveform based on one or more properties of the waveform. For example, these properties of the waveform can include amplitude, frequency, phase, and harmonics as well as other properties. After reception of the modulated carrier, the demodulator recovers the original modulating signal by the process of demodulation or detection. One or more modulators can be integrated with one or more demodulators to form a modulator-demodulator (modem). As such, the term demodulator may further refer to one or more parts, components, and/or software that demodulate within a modem.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0154">&#x201c;Downshift&#x201d; generally refers to changing a communication system to a less complex modulation scheme.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0155">&#x201c;Electromagnet Radiation&#x201d; generally refers to energy radiated by electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic radiation is produced from other types of energy, and is converted to other types when it is destroyed. Electromagnetic radiation carries this energy as it travels moving away from its source at the speed of light (in a vacuum). Electromagnetic radiation also carries both momentum and angular momentum. These properties may all be imparted to matter with which the electromagnetic radiation interacts as it moves outwardly away from its source. Electromagnetic radiation changes speed as it passes from one medium to another. When transitioning from one media to the next, the physical properties of the new medium can cause some or all of the radiated energy to be reflected while the remaining energy passes into the new medium. This occurs at every junction between media that electromagnetic radiation encounters as it travels. The photon is the quantum of the electromagnetic interaction and is the basic constituent of all forms of electromagnetic radiation. The quantum nature of light becomes more apparent at high frequencies as electromagnetic radiation behaves more like particles and less like waves as its frequency increases.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0156">&#x201c;Electromagnetic Spectrum&#x201d; generally refers to the range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0157">&#x201c;Electromagnetic Waves&#x201d; generally refers to waves having a separate electrical and a magnetic component. The electrical and magnetic components of an electromagnetic wave oscillate in phase and are always separated by a 90 degree angle. Electromagnetic waves can radiate from a source to create electromagnetic radiation capable of passing through a medium or through a vacuum. Electromagnetic waves include waves oscillating at any frequency in the electromagnetic spectrum including, but not limited to, radio waves, visible and invisible light, X-rays, and gamma-rays.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0158">&#x201c;Equalizer&#x201d; generally refers to an electronic and/or software-based filter that modifies the frequency response (amplitude and phase versus frequency) of a system for a specific purpose. Equalizers typically realize a more complicated frequency response in which the amplitude response varies continuously with frequency, amplifying some frequencies and attenuating others. An equalizer may have a response fixed in time or may be automatically and continuously adjusted. However, the frequency response of an equalizer is usually, but not always, matched to some external physical medium, such as a communication channel, and thus adjustable.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0159">&#x201c;Error Correction Code&#x201d;, &#x201c;Error Correcting Code&#x201d;, or &#x201c;ECC&#x201d; generally refers to data and/or algorithms for expressing a sequence of numbers or other data such that any errors which are introduced can be detected and corrected within certain limitations based on the remaining numbers or data. ECC is typically used for controlling errors in data over unreliable and/or noisy communication channels. For instance, the sender encodes the message with a redundant in the form of an ECC. There are two main categories of ECCs, block codes and convolution codes. Some non-limiting examples of ECC codes include AN, BCH, Berger, constant-weight, convolutional, cyclic redundancy check (CRC), expander, group, Golay, Goppa, Hadamard, Hagelbarger, Hamming code, Latin square based, lexicographic, long, low-density parity-check (i.e., Gallager code), LT, polar, raptor, Reed-Solomon error correction, Reed-Muller, repeat-accumulate, repetition (e.g., triple modular redundancy), spinal, rateless, nonlinear, tornado, near-optimal erasure correcting, turbo code, and Walsh-Hadamard codes.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0160">&#x201c;Fiber-optic Communication&#x201d; generally refers to a method of transmitting data from one place to another by sending pulses of electromagnetic energy through an optical fiber. The transmitted energy may form an electromagnetic carrier wave that can be modulated to carry data. Fiber-optic communication lines that use optical fiber cables to transmit data can be configured to have a high data bandwidth. For example, fiber-optic communication lines may have a high data bandwidth of up to about 15 Tbit/s, about 25 Tbit/s, about 100 Tbit/s, about 1 Pbit/s or more. Opto-electronic repeaters may be used along a fiber-optic communication line to convert the electromagnetic energy from one segment of fiber-optic cable into an electrical signal. The repeater can retransmit the electrical signal as electromagnetic energy along another segment of fiber-optic cable at a higher signal strength than it was received.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0161">&#x201c;Financial Instrument&#x201d; generally refers to a tradable asset of any kind. General examples include, but are not limited to, cash, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity, or a contractual right to receive or deliver cash or another financial instrument. Specific examples include bonds, bills (e.g. commercial paper and treasury bills), stock, loans, deposits, certificates of deposit, bond futures or options on bond futures, short-term interest rate futures, stock options, equity futures, currency futures, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, interest rate options, forward rate agreements, stock options, foreign-exchange options, foreign-exchange swaps, currency swaps, or any sort of derivative.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0162">&#x201c;Forward Error Correction&#x201d; or FEC generally refers to a technique used for controlling errors in data transmission over unreliable or noisy communication channels. Typically, but not always, a sender encodes the message in a redundant way by using an error-correction code (ECC). This redundancy allows a receiver to detect a limited number of errors that may occur anywhere in the message, and the redundancy often allows these errors to be corrected without retransmission. FEC gives the receiver the ability to correct errors without needing a reverse channel to request retransmission of data. However, higher forward channel bandwidth is typically required. FEC can be used in situations where retransmissions are costly or impossible, such as one-way communication links and when transmitting to multiple receivers in multicast. FEC is commonly used in modems. FEC information can also be added to mass storage devices to enable recovery of corrupted data. There are generally two types of FEC code categories, block codes and convolution codes. FEC block codes work on fixed-size blocks (or packets) of bits or symbols of predetermined size. Some non-limiting examples of block codes include Reed-Solomon, Golay, BCH, multidimensional parity, and Hamming codes. Typical block codes are usually decoded using hard-decision algorithms in which for every input and output signal a hard decision is made whether it corresponds to a one or a zero bit. Convolutional FEC codes work on bit or symbol streams of arbitrary length. Convolutional codes are typically decoded using soft-decision algorithms like the Viterbi, MAP or BCJR algorithms that process (discretized) analog signals, and which allow for much higher error-correction performance than hard-decision decoding. Convolutional FEC codes are most often soft decoded with the Viterbi algorithm, though other algorithms can be used. Viterbi decoding allows asymptotically optimal decoding efficiency with increasing constraint length of the convolutional code, but at the expense of exponentially increasing complexity. A convolutional code that is terminated is also a block code in that it encodes a block of input data, but the block size of a convolutional code is generally arbitrary, while block codes have a fixed size dictated by their algebraic characteristics. Types of termination for convolutional codes include tail-biting and bit-flushing. Some other non-limiting examples of FEC techniques include turbo coding, low density parity check (LDPC), interleaving, and local decoding. Many FEC coders (but not all) can also generate a bit-error rate (BER) signal which can be used as feedback to fine-tune the analog receiving electronics.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0163">&#x201c;Ground&#x201d; is used more in an electrical/electromagnetic sense and generally refers to the Earth's surface including land and bodies of water, such as oceans, lakes, and rivers.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0164">&#x201c;Ground-wave Propagation&#x201d; generally refers to a transmission method in which one or more electromagnetic waves are conducted via the boundary of the ground and atmosphere to travel along the ground. The electromagnetic wave propagates by interacting with the semi-conductive surface of the earth. In essence, the wave clings to the surfaces so as to follow the curvature of the earth. Typically, but not always, the electromagnetic wave is in the form of a ground or surface wave formed by low-frequency radio waves.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0165">&#x201c;Identifier&#x201d; generally refers to a name that identifies (that is, labels the identity of) either a unique thing or a unique class of things, where the &#x201c;object&#x201d; or class may be an idea, physical object (or class thereof), or physical substance (or class thereof). The abbreviation &#x201c;ID&#x201d; often refers to identity, identification (the process of identifying), or an identifier (that is, an instance of identification). An identifier may or may not include words, numbers, letters, symbols, shapes, colors, sounds, or any combination of those. The words, numbers, letters, or symbols may follow an encoding system (wherein letters, digits, words, or symbols represent ideas or longer identifiers) or they may simply be arbitrary. When an identifier follows an encoding system, it is often referred to as a code or ID code. Identifiers that do not follow any encoding scheme are often said to be arbitrary IDs because they are arbitrarily assigned without meaning in any other context beyond identifying something.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0166">&#x201c;Inter-symbol Interference&#x201d; or &#x201c;ISI&#x201d; generally refer to a form of distortion of a signal in which one symbol interferes with subsequent symbols. Typically, but not always, ISI is an unwanted phenomenon as the previous symbols have a similar effect as noise which makes communication less reliable. For example, the spreading of a pulse beyond the allotted time interval causes the pulse to interfere with neighboring pulses. ISI is usually, but not always, caused by multipath propagation and/or the inherent linear or non-linear frequency response of a communication channel causing successive symbols to blur together.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0167">&#x201c;Ionosphere&#x201d; generally refers to the layer of the Earth's atmosphere that contains a high concentration of ions and free electrons and is able to reflect radio waves. The ionosphere includes the thermosphere as well as parts of the mesosphere and exosphere. The ionosphere extends from about 25 to about 600 miles (about 40 to 1,000 km) above the earth's surface. The ionosphere includes a number of layers that undergo considerable variations in altitude, density, and thickness, depending upon a number of factors including solar activity, such as sunspots.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0168">&#x201c;Jitter&#x201d; generally refers to a variable delay in the receipt of a transmitted message. For example, jitter arises as messages arrive at an input at varying intervals, and as a result, the receiver of the message has to wait a variable time before a data slot is available for message transport.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0169">&#x201c;Latency&#x201d; generally refers to the time interval between a cause and an effect in a system. Latency is physically a consequence of the limited velocity with which any physical interaction can propagate throughout a system. Latency is physically a consequence of the limited velocity with which any physical interaction can propagate. The speed at which an effect can propagate through a system is always lower than or equal to the speed of light. Therefore every physical system that includes some distance between the cause and the effect will experience some kind of latency. For example, in a communication link or communications network, latency generally refers to the minimum time it takes for data to pass from one point to another. Latency with respect to communications networks may also be characterized as the time it takes energy to move from one point along the network to another. With respect to delays caused by the propagation of electromagnetic energy following a particular propagation path, latency can be categorized as follows:</p><p id="p-0163" num="0170">&#x201c;Low Latency&#x201d; generally refers to a period of time that is less than or about equal to a propagation time that is 10% greater than the time required for light to travel a given propagation path in a vacuum. Expressed as a formula, low latency is defined as follows:</p><p id="p-0164" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>latency</mi>   <mi>low</mi>  </msub>  <mo>&#x2264;</mo>  <mrow>   <mfrac>    <mi>d</mi>    <mi>c</mi>   </mfrac>   <mo>&#xb7;</mo>   <mi>k</mi>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths><ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0171">where:        <ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0172">d=distance (miles)</li>            <li id="ul0007-0002" num="0173">c=the speed of light in a vacuum (186,000 miles/sec)</li>            <li id="ul0007-0003" num="0174">k=a scalar constant of 1.1</li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0165" num="0175">For example, light can travel 25,000 miles through a vacuum in about 0.1344 seconds.

It may be thought of as merging the properties of two time-varying signals to create a third output signal that is the combination of both input signals. Modulation is useful in the process of conveying data, such as in the case of transmitting a digital bit stream or an analog (continuously varying) signal using electromagnetic energy. Analog modulation may transfer an analog baseband (or low pass) signal, for example an audio signal or TV signal, over an analog bandpass channel at a different frequency, for example over a limited radio frequency band or a cable TV network channel. Digital modulation may transfer a digital bit stream over an analog communication channel, for example over the public switched telephone network (where a bandpass filter limits the frequency range to 300-3400 Hz) or over a limited radio frequency band. Analog and digital modulation facilitate Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), where several low pass information signals are transferred simultaneously over the same shared physical medium, using different carrier frequencies. Digital baseband modulation, also known as &#x201c;line coding&#x201d;, can transfer a digital bit stream over a baseband channel, typically a non-filtered copper wire such as a serial bus or a wired local area network. Pulse modulation may transfer a narrowband analog signal, for example, a phone call over a wideband baseband channel or, in some of the schemes, as a bit stream over another digital transmission system. As used herein, analog modulation techniques may include, but are not limited to, any of the following alone or in combination: 1. Amplitude modulation (AM) (here the amplitude of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal) 2. Double-sideband modulation with carrier (DSB-WC) (used on the AM radio broadcasting band) 3. Double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission (DSB-SC) 4. Double-sideband reduced carrier transmission (DSB-RC) 5. Single-sideband modulation with carrier (SSB-WC) 6. Single-sideband modulation suppressed carrier modulation (SSB-SC) 7. Vestigial sideband modulation (VSB, or VSB-AM) 8. Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) 9. Frequency modulation (FM) (here the frequency of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal) 10. Phase modulation (PM) (here the phase shift of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal) 11. Transpositional Modulation (TM), in which the waveform inflection is modified resulting in a signal where each quarter cycle is transposed in the modulation process. In digital modulation, an analog carrier signal may be modulated by a discrete signal. Digital modulation methods can be considered as digital-to-analog conversion and the corresponding demodulation or detection as analog-to-digital conversion. The changes in the carrier signal are chosen from a finite number of M alternative symbols (the modulation alphabet). As used herein, digital modulation techniques may include, but are not limited to, any of the following used either alone or in combination: 1. Binary PSK (BPSK), using M=2 symbols 2. Quadrature PSK (QPSK), using M=4 symbols 3. 8PSK, using M=8 symbols 4. 16PSK, using M=16 symbols 5. Differential PSK (DPSK) 6. Differential QPSK (DQPSK) 7. Offset QPSK (OQPSK) 8. &#x3c0;/4-QPSK 9.

On-off keying (OOK), the most common ASK form 14. M-ary vestigial sideband modulation, for example 8VSB 15. Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), a combination of PSK and ASK 16. Polar modulation like QAM a combination of PSK and ASK 17. Minimum-shift keying (MSK) 18. Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK) 19. Continuous-phase frequency-shift keying (CPFSK) 20. Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation 21. Discrete multitone (DMT), including adaptive modulation and bit-loading 22. Wavelet modulation 23. Trellis coded modulation (TCM), also known as Trellis modulation 24. Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) 25. Chirp spread spectrum (CSS) according to IEEE 802.15.4a CSS uses pseudo-stochastic coding 26. Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) applies a special scheme for channel release</p><p id="p-0175" num="0188">&#x201c;Modulator&#x201d; generally refers to a device, such as an electronic circuit and/or computer, that varies one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the carrier signal, with a modulating signal that typically contains information to be transmitted. For example, these properties of the waveform can include amplitude, frequency, phase, and harmonics as well as other properties. By way of a non-limiting example, the modulator can control the parameters of a high-frequency electromagnetic information carrier in accordance with electrical signals of the transmitted message. One or more modulators can be integrated with one or more demodulators to form a modulator-demodulator (modem). As such, the term modulator may further refer to one or more parts, components, and/or software that functions as a modulator within a modem.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0189">&#x201c;Network&#x201d; or &#x201c;Computer Network&#x201d; generally refers to a telecommunications network that allows computers to exchange data. Computers can pass data to each other along data connections by transforming data into a collection of datagrams or packets. The connections between computers and the network may be established using either cables, optical fibers, or via electromagnetic transmissions such as for wireless network devices. Computers coupled to a network may be referred to as &#x201c;nodes&#x201d; or as &#x201c;hosts&#x201d; and may originate, broadcast, route, or accept data from the network. Nodes can include any computing device such as personal computers, phones, and servers as well as specialized computers that operate to maintain the flow of data across the network, referred to as &#x201c;network devices&#x201d;. Two nodes can be considered &#x201c;networked together&#x201d; when one device is able to exchange information with another device, whether or not they have a direct connection to each other. A network may have any suitable network topology defining the number and use of the network connections. The network topology may be of any suitable form and may include point-to-point, bus, star, ring, mesh, or tree. A network may be an overlay network which is virtual and is configured as one or more layers that use or &#x201c;lay on top of&#x201d; other networks.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0190">&#x201c;Non-skywave propagation&#x201d; generally refers to all forms of transmission, wired and/or wireless, in which the information is not transmitted by reflecting an electromagnetic wave from the ionosphere.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0191">&#x201c;Optical Fiber&#x201d; generally refers to an electromagnetic waveguide having an elongate conduit that includes a substantially transparent medium through which electromagnetic energy travels as it traverses the long axis of the conduit. Electromagnetic radiation may be maintained within the conduit by total internal reflection of the electromagnetic radiation as it traverses the conduit. Total internal reflection is generally achieved using optical fibers that include a substantially transparent core surrounded by a second substantially transparent cladding material with a lower index of refraction than the core.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0192">&#x201c;Optimum Working Frequency&#x201d; generally refers to the frequency that provides the most consistent communication path via sky-wave propagation. It can vary over time depending on number of factors, such as ionospheric conditions and time of day. For transmissions using the F2 layer of the ionosphere the working frequency is generally around 85% of the MUF, and for the E layer, the optimum working frequency will generally be near the MUF.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0193">&#x201c;Packet Error Rate&#x201d; or &#x201c;Packet Error Ratio&#x201d; or &#x201c;PER&#x201d; generally refers to the number of incorrectly received data packets divided by the total number of received packets in a digital transmission. Generally, a packet is declared incorrect if at least one bit is erroneous.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0194">&#x201c;Polarization&#x201d; generally refers to the orientation of the electric field (&#x201c;E-plane&#x201d;) of a radiated electromagnetic energy wave with respect to the Earth's surface and is determined by the physical structure and orientation of the radiating antenna. Polarization can be considered separately from an antenna's directionality. Thus, a simple straight wire antenna may have one polarization when mounted substantially vertically, and a different polarization when mounted substantially horizontally. As a transverse wave, the magnetic field of a radio wave is at right angles to that of the electric field, but by convention, talk of an antenna's &#x201c;polarization&#x201d; is understood to refer to the direction of the electric field. Reflections generally affect polarization. For radio waves, one important reflector is the ionosphere which can change the wave's polarization. Thus for signals received via reflection by the ionosphere (a skywave), a consistent polarization cannot be expected. For line-of-sight communications or ground wave propagation, horizontally or vertically polarized transmissions generally remain in about the same polarization state at the receiving location.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0195">&#x201c;Primary Communication Channel&#x201d; or &#x201c;Primary Channel&#x201d; generally refers to a communication pathway that is a first choice for transferring information. Typically, but not always, the primary communication channel has one or more properties, such as latency or bandwidth, that is desirable over others. For example, a primary communication channel can have the highest data rate of all the channels sharing a common interface. A primary communication channel may support the transfer of information in one direction only, either direction alternately, or both directions simultaneously. The primary communication channel can for example include wired and wireless forms of communication.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0196">&#x201c;Processor&#x201d; generally refers to one or more electronic components configured to operate as a single unit configured or programmed to process input to generate an output. Alternatively, when of a multi-component form, a processor may have one or more components located remotely relative to the others. One or more components of each processor may be of the electronic variety defining digital circuitry, analog circuitry, or both. In one example, each processor is of a conventional, integrated circuit microprocessor arrangement. The concept of a &#x201c;processor&#x201d; is not limited to a single physical logic circuit or package of circuits but includes one or more such circuits or circuit packages possibly contained within or across multiple computers in numerous physical locations. In a virtual computing environment, an unknown number of physical processors may be actively processing data, and the unknown number may automatically change over time as well. The concept of a &#x201c;processor&#x201d; includes a device configured or programmed to make threshold comparisons, rules comparisons, calculations, or perform logical operations applying a rule to data yielding a logical result (e.g. &#x201c;true&#x201d; or &#x201c;false&#x201d;). Processing activities may occur in multiple single processors on separate servers, on multiple processors in a single server with separate processors, or on multiple processors physically remote from one another in separate computing devices.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0197">&#x201c;Pseudorandom Binary Sequence&#x201d; or &#x201c;PRBS&#x201d; generally refers to a binary sequence generated with a deterministic algorithm that is difficult to predict and exhibits statistical behavior similar to a truly random sequence.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0198">&#x201c;Radio&#x201d; generally refers to electromagnetic radiation in the frequencies that occupy the range from 3 kHz to 300 GHz.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0199">&#x201c;Radio horizon&#x201d; generally refers to the locus of points at which direct rays from an antenna are tangential to the ground. The radio horizon can be approximated by the following equation:</p><p id="p-0187" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>d</i>&#x2245;&#x221a;{square root over (2<i>h</i><sub>t</sub>)}+&#x221a;{square root over (2<i>h</i><sub>r</sub>)}<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?><ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0200">where:</li>        <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0201">d=radio horizon (miles)</li>        <li id="ul0012-0003" num="0202">h<sub>t</sub>=transmitting antenna height (feet)</li>        <li id="ul0012-0004" num="0203">h<sub>r</sub>=receiving antenna height (feet).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0188" num="0204">&#x201c;Receive&#x201d; generally refers to accepting something transferred, communicated, conveyed, relayed, dispatched, or forwarded. The concept may or may not include the act of listening or waiting for something to arrive from a transmitting entity. For example, a transmission may be received without knowledge as to who or what transmitted it. Likewise the transmission may be sent with or without knowledge of who or what is receiving it. To &#x201c;receive&#x201d; may include, but is not limited to, the act of capturing or obtaining electromagnetic energy at any suitable frequency in the electromagnetic spectrum. Receiving may occur by sensing electromagnetic radiation. Sensing electromagnetic radiation may involve detecting energy waves moving through or from a medium such as a wire or optical fiber. Receiving includes receiving digital signals which may define various types of analog or binary data such as signals, datagrams, packets and the like.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0205">&#x201c;Receiving Station&#x201d; generally refers to a receiving device, or to a location facility having multiple devices configured to receive electromagnetic energy. A receiving station may be configured to receive from a particular transmitting entity, or from any transmitting entity regardless of whether the transmitting entity is identifiable in advance of receiving the transmission.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0206">&#x201c;Remote&#x201d; generally refers to any physical, logical, or other separation between two things. The separation may be relatively large, such as thousands or millions of miles or kilometers, or small such as nanometers or millionths of an inch. Two things &#x201c;remote&#x201d; from one another may also be logically or physically coupled or connected together.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0207">&#x201c;Satellite Communication&#x201d; or &#x201c;Satellite Propagation&#x201d; generally refers to transmitting one or more electromagnetic signals to a satellite which in turn reflects and/or retransmits the signal to another satellite or station.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0208">&#x201c;Signal-to-noise ratio&#x201d; or &#x201c;SNR&#x201d; or &#x201c;S/N&#x201d; generally refers to a measure that compares a level of a desired signal to a level of background noise. SNR is calculated as the ratio of signal power to noise power, often expressed in decibels. A SNR higher than 1:1 (greater than 0 dB) indicates more signal than noise.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0209">&#x201c;Size&#x201d; generally refers to the extent of something; a thing's overall dimensions or magnitude; how big something is. For physical objects, size may be used to describe relative terms such as large or larger, high or higher, low or lower, small or smaller, and the like. Size of physical objects may also be given in fixed units such as a specific width, length, height, distance, volume, and the like expressed in any suitable units. For data transfer, size may be used to indicate a relative or fixed quantity of data being manipulated, addressed, transmitted, received, or processed as a logical or physical unit. Size may be used in conjunction with the amount of data in a data collection, data set, data file, or other such logical unit. For example, a data collection or data file may be characterized as having a &#x201c;size&#x201d; of 35 Mbytes, or a communication link may be characterized as having a data bandwidth with a &#x201c;size&#x201d; of 1000 bits per second.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0210">&#x201c;Skip distance&#x201d; generally refers to the minimum distance from a transmitter to where a wave from skywave propagation can be returned to the Earth. To put it another way, the skip distance is the minimum distance that occurs at the critical angle for sky-wave propagation.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0211">&#x201c;Skip Zone&#x201d; or &#x201c;Quiet Zone&#x201d; generally refers to an area between the location where a ground wave from ground wave propagation is completely dissipated and the location where the first skywave returns using skywave propagation. In the skip zone, no signal for a given transmission can be received.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0212">&#x201c;Skywave Propagation&#x201d; refers generally to a transmission method in which one or more electromagnetic-waves radiated from an antenna are refracted from the ionosphere back to the ground. Skywave propagation further includes tropospheric scatter transmissions. In one form, a skipping method can be used in which the waves refracted from the ionosphere are reflected by the ground back up to the ionosphere. This skipping can occur more than once.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0213">&#x201c;Software-Defined Radio&#x201d; or &#x201c;SDR&#x201d; generally refers to a radio communication system where components that have been traditionally implemented in hardware are instead implemented via software on a computer and/or embedded system. Some examples of hardware now implemented as SDR are mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, and equalizers, just to name a few.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0214">&#x201c;Space-wave Propagation&#x201d; or sometimes referred to as &#x201c;Direct Wave Propagation&#x201d; or &#x201c;Line-of-sight Propagation&#x201d; generally refers to a transmission method in which one or more electromagnetic waves are transmitted between antennas that are generally visible to one another. The transmission can occur via direct and/or ground reflected space waves. Generally speaking, the antenna height and curvature of the earth are limiting factors for the transmission distances for space-wave propagation. The actual radio horizon for a direct line of sight is larger than the visible or geometric line of sight due to diffraction effects; that is, the radio horizon is about &#x2158; greater than the geometric line of sight.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0215">&#x201c;Spread Spectrum&#x201d; generally refers to a transmission method that includes sending a portion of a transmitted signal over multiple frequencies. The transmission over multiple frequencies may occur simultaneously by sending a portion of the signal on various frequencies. In this example, a receiver must listen to all frequencies simultaneously in order to reassemble the transmitted signal. The transmission may also be spread over multiple frequencies by &#x201c;hopping&#x201d; signals. A signal hopping scenario includes transmitting the signal for some period of time over a first frequency, switching to transmit the signal over a second frequency for a second period of time, before switching to a third frequency for a third period of time, and so forth. The receiver and transmitter must be synchronized in order to switch frequencies together. This process of &#x201c;hopping&#x201d; frequencies may be implemented in a frequency-hopping pattern that may change over time (e.g. every hour, every 24 hours, and the like).</p><p id="p-0200" num="0216">&#x201c;Stratosphere&#x201d; generally refers to a layer of the earth's atmosphere extending from the troposphere to about 25 to 35 miles above the earth surface.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0217">&#x201c;Symbol&#x201d; generally refers to a waveform, a state or a significant condition of the communication channel that persists, for a fixed period of time. For digital baseband transmissions, a symbol may be in the form of a pulse, and a symbol may be in the form of a tone in passband transmissions using modems. A transmitter or other device places symbols on one or more channels, and the receiver detects the sequence of symbols in order to reconstruct the transmitted data. In some cases, there may be a direct correspondence between a symbol and a small unit of data. For instance, each symbol can encode one or several bits. The data may also be represented by the transitions between symbols, and/or by a sequence of several symbols.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0218">&#x201c;Transceiver&#x201d; generally refers to a device that includes both a transmitter and a receiver that share common circuitry and/or a single housing. Transceivers are typically, but not always, designed to transmit and receive electronic signals, such as analog and/or digital radio signals.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0219">&#x201c;Transfer Rate&#x201d; generally refers to the rate at which something is moved from one physical or logical location to another. In the case of a communication link or communication network, a transfer rate may be characterized as the rate of data transfer over the link or network. Such a transfer rate may be expressed in &#x201c;bits per second&#x201d; and may be limited by the maximum data bandwidth for a given network or communication link used to carry out a transfer of data.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0220">&#x201c;Transmission Line&#x201d; generally refers to a specialized physical structure or series of structures designed to carry electromagnetic energy from one location to another, usually without radiating the electromagnetic energy through free space. A transmission line operates to retain and transfer electromagnetic energy from one location to another while minimizing latency and power losses incurred as the electromagnetic energy passes through the structures in the transmission line. Examples of transmission lines that may be used in communicating radio waves include twin lead, coaxial cable, microstrip, strip line, twisted-pair, star quad, lecher lines, various types of waveguide, or a simple single wire line. Other types of transmission lines such as optical fibers may be used for carrying higher frequency electromagnetic radiation such as visible or invisible light.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0221">&#x201c;Transmission Path&#x201d; or &#x201c;Propagation Path&#x201d; generally refers to a path taken by electromagnetic energy passing through space or through a medium. This can include transmissions through a transmission line. In this case, the transmission path is defined by, follows, is contained within, passes through, or generally includes the transmission line. A transmission or propagation path need not be defined by a transmission line. A propagation or transmission path can be defined by electromagnetic energy moving through free space or through the atmosphere such as in skywave, ground wave, line-of-sight, or other forms of propagation. In that case, the transmission path can be characterized as any path along which the electromagnetic energy passes as it is moves from the transmitter to the receiver, including any skip, bounce, scatter, or other variations in the direction of the transmitted energy.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0222">&#x201c;Transmission Station&#x201d; generally refers to a transmitting device, or to a location or facility having multiple devices configured to transmit electromagnetic energy. A transmission station may be configured to transmit to a particular receiving entity, to any entity configured to receive transmission, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0223">&#x201c;Transmission Time&#x201d; generally refers to is the amount of time from the beginning until the end of a message transmission in a communication network. In the case of a digital message, the transmission time is the time from the first bit until the last bit of a message has left the transmitting node. For a digital packet, the packet transmission time can be obtained from the packet size and bit rate. The transmission time should not be confused with propagation delay which refers to the time it takes for the first bit to travel from a sender to a receiver.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0224">&#x201c;Transmit&#x201d; generally refers to causing something to be transferred, communicated, conveyed, relayed, dispatched, or forwarded. The concept may or may not include the act of conveying something from a transmitting entity to a receiving entity. For example, a transmission may be received without knowledge as to who or what transmitted it. Likewise the transmission may be sent with or without knowledge of who or what is receiving it. To &#x201c;transmit&#x201d; may include, but is not limited to, the act of sending or broadcasting electromagnetic energy at any suitable frequency in the electromagnetic spectrum. Transmissions may include digital signals which may define various types of binary data such as datagrams, packets and the like. A transmission may also include analog signals.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0225">&#x201c;Triggering Data&#x201d; generally refers to data that includes triggering information identifying one or more commands to execute. The triggering data and the command data may occur together in a single transmission or may be transmitted separately along a single or multiple communication links.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0226">&#x201c;Troposphere&#x201d; generally refers to the lowest portion of the earth's atmosphere. The troposphere extends about 11 miles above the surface of the earth in the mid-latitudes, up to 12 miles in the tropics, and about 4.3 miles in winter at the poles.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0227">&#x201c;Tropospheric Scatter Transmission&#x201d; generally refers to a form of skywave propagation in which one or more electromagnetic waves, such as radio waves, are aimed at the troposphere. While not certain as to its cause, a small amount of energy of the waves is scattered forwards to a receiving antenna. Due to severe fading problems, diversity reception techniques (e.g., space, frequency, and/or angle diversity) are typically used.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0228">&#x201c;Upshift&#x201d; generally refers to changing a communication system to a more complex modulation scheme.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0229">&#x201c;Wave Guide&#x201d; generally refers to a transmission line configured to guides waves such as electromagnetic waves occurring at any frequency along the electromagnetic spectrum. Examples include any arrangement of conductive or insulative material configured to transfer lower frequency electromagnetic radiation ranging along the electromagnetic spectrum from extremely low frequency to extremely high frequency waves. Others specific examples include optical fibers guiding high-frequency light or hollow conductive metal pipe used to carry high-frequency radio waves, particularly microwaves.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0230">It should be noted that the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; &#x201c;the,&#x201d; and the like as used in the description and/or the claims include the plural forms unless expressly discussed otherwise.
