To save power, wireless devices may switch off (disable) the transceiver to enter into a sleep mode when there is no pending data packet to be transmitted to received. While the wireless device is switched to the sleep mode, the access point may store data frames bound for the wireless device in a buffer.

The wireless device is configured to switch on (enable) the transceiver periodically so as to receive beacons. When a beacon is received, the wireless device may check the TIM in the beacon to determine whether there is a buffered data frame in the access point pending for the wireless device to receive.

Firstly, at a target beacon transmission time (TBTT), a transceiver of the wireless device is switched on. Thereafter, the wireless device receives a first portion of a beacon, wherein a length of the first portion is less than the length of the entire beacon, and the first portion comprises a time stamp and a TIM.

A transceiver transmits and receives wireless signals. A time synchronization circuit is configured to perform a local time synchronization. A control circuit is coupled to the transceiver, configured to disable or enable the transceiver. The control circuit enables the transceiver at a target beacon transmission time to receive a first portion of a beacon, wherein the beacon comprises the first portion and a second portion, wherein the first portion comprises a time stamp and a traffic indication map and the second portion comprises a frame check sequence. The control circuit determines whether to receive a buffered data packet in the remote device according to the traffic indication map.

Obviously, the described embodiments are part of the embodiments of the application, not all of the embodiments. Based on the embodiments in the application, all other embodiments obtained by those skilled in the art without creative work belong to the scope of protection of the application.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">In the conventional implementations of power saving mode, the wireless device STA must receive an entire beacon frame to decide whether to switch off the transceiver. However, Applicant has experimentally determined that the wireless device STA can decide whether to switch off the transceiver without finishing the reception of an entire beacon frame. After acquiring the TIM in the beacon frame, the wireless device STA can decide whether to switch off the transceiver, so as to significantly save the receiving time and achieve the purpose of saving power. Therefore, the proposed embodiments are described in detail hereafter.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the structure of a beacon frame and the details of the TIM IE. A frame check sequence (FCS) is configured at the end of the beacon frame for a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) which determines integrity of the beacon frame. If the CRC is correct, the software or hardware may locate the TIM IE according to element IDs in the beacon frame, and determines whether there are buffered data packets to receive according to particular field values in the TIM IE, including the TIM (i.e., a partial virtual bit map). If buffered data packets exist, the wireless device STA may trigger the access point to send data packets by sending a PS poll request frame or a null request frame. In the receiving process according to the embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, only a portion of the beacon frame is needed to determine whether to enter the power saving mode. The portion of the beacon frame comprises at least a time tamp and a TIM. Specifically, the TIM can be determined according to an element ID in the TIM IE during reception. In other words, the proposed method for wireless data reception in the embodiment omits unneeded data after the TIM, such that significant amount of unneeded data is not received, allowing the wireless device to enter the power saving mode early.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart of receiving data packets buffered in the access point using a PS poll request frame. The wireless device STA notifies the access point that after entering the sleep mode, the wireless device STA will periodically wake up and listen to the beacon. When the TIM indicates that there are data packets to be received, the wireless device STA may send a PS poll request frame to trigger the access point to send the buffered data packets. The wireless device STA may determine whether to continue to send the PS poll request frame to trigger transmission of further data frames (frame1, frame2, frame3) according to a more data field carried in the data packet. The wireless device STA will not switch off its radio frequency (RF) module until the more data field in the received packet is 0. On the other hand, in the power saving mode, the RF module will not wake up again until the next TBTT.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is the flow of receiving the data packets buffered by the access point using a null data request frame. After the wireless device STA notifies the access point that it enters the sleep mode, the wireless device will periodically wake up to listen to the beacon, and send a null data frame with PS_flag 0 when the TIM indicates that there are data packets to be received. In response to the null data frame with PS_flag 0 sent to the access point, the access point will send all data packets to the wireless device STA. After receiving all data packets, the wireless device STA will send a null data frame with PS_flag 1 to the access point, and switch off the RF module. Until the next TBTT, the RF module is switched on again to receive the next beacon.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows conventional TIM analysis and transceiver mode switching. The wireless device STA establishes a connection with the access point. During the connection, both parties may agree on a listen interval, based on which, the wireless device STA wakes up regularly and switches on the transceiver to receive beacons periodically broadcasted by the access point. When the wireless device STA has no data to transmit or receive, it will pass a null data frame with a power-saving flag PS_flag 1 to inform the access point that the wireless device STA is about to enter the power saving mode. The wireless device STA then switches off the transceiver, and periodically switches on the transceiver according to the listening interval to receive next beacons.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">The time synchronization between the access point and the wireless device STA is implemented by the time stamp in the beacon and a local time synchronization (TSF) timer for synchronization.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">The following embodiment shows a process when a beacon is received.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">In step <b>502</b>, the transceiver is switched on at the TBTT. In step <b>504</b>, the entire beacon frame is received, and the reception is concluded in step <b>506</b>. In step <b>508</b>, a cyclic redundancy check (such as FCS check, address check, etc.) is performed to determine the integrity of the beacon. If the integrity of the beacon is valid, proceed to step <b>510</b>. Conversely, if the integrity of the beacon is compromised, the transceiver (RF module) is switched off in step <b>516</b>, and the process returns to step <b>502</b> to wait for next TBTT. In step <b>510</b>, a local TSF is updated, and the TIM is checked. In step <b>512</b>, The TIM is interpreted to determine whether there are buffered data packets pending for reception. If yes, the process goes to step <b>514</b>, wherein the processor is awakened, and the buffered data packets are received through the transceiver. Until all packets are received, the processor is switched off in step <b>515</b>. If there are no buffered data packets, or step <b>515</b> is completed, the process goes to step <b>516</b>, wherein the transceiver is switched off, and finally, the process returns to step <b>502</b> to wait for the next TBTT.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">It can be seen from the conventional implementation of power saving, to determine the integrity of the beacon, the wireless device STA must receive the entire beacon. Consequently, the timing to determine whether to switch off the transceiver (RF module) is deferred.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the TIM analysis and transceiver mode switching according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">In step <b>602</b>, the wireless device may set a TBTT to periodically enable the transceiver of the wireless device. By design, if without accident, the access point is expected to transmit a beacon frame on the TBTT. In implementation, the transceiver may be enabled by powering on or switching on the transceiver.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">In the process of receiving the beacon, the embodiment of the invention only needs a portion of the beacon to respond, and does not need to receive the entire beacon. For example, in step <b>604</b>, the wireless device receives a first portion of the beacon, wherein the length of the first portion is less than the length of the entire beacon, and the first portion comprises at least a time stamp and a TIM.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">In step <b>606</b>, the wireless device then determines whether to receive data packets according to the TIM. The embodiment is characterized in that if the wireless device determines that there is no need to receive data packets, the transceiver of the wireless device can be switched off without completely receiving the entire beacon, such that the efficiency of power usage is increased.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">The embodiment, however, does not perform the CRC verification when checking the TIM in step <b>606</b>, therefore exception handlers are required in case the integrity of the beacon is compromised during reception. In the first case, the access point may have buffered data packets, but the wireless device STA falsely determines that there are no data packets. In this case, the wireless device STA will not trigger the access point to send the buffered data packets, resulting in that the buffered data packets cannot be received in the current cycle. Even so, as long as the wireless device STA can correctly receive the beacon in the subsequent cycle, the data packet can be eventually delivered without data loss. In the second case, the access point does not contain any buffered data packet, but the wireless device STA falsely acknowledges that there are buffered data packets. In this case, the process falls back to the conventional steps, wherein the entire beacon will be completely received, and the CRC will be performed. The wireless device will acknowledge correct information from the entire beacon indicating that the access point does not cache data packets. The embodiment is proven effective and does not compromise the conventional protocol.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">In a further embodiment, when the wireless device determines that there is no need to receive data packets according to the TIM, it can further proceed to step <b>608</b> to check whether the time stamp is synchronize with the local time in the wireless device. In other words, it is checked whether an offset between the time stamp and the local time of the wireless device exceeds a threshold. The reason for considering the time offset here is that the time stamp in the beacon in this step skipped the step of checking the FCS. If a huge time discrepancy exists, it is likely that the content of the beacon frame is incorrectly received. In this case, the process may fall back to the conventional steps, to receive the entire beacon frame, and proceed to subsequent steps based on the CRC verification of the FCS in the end of the beacon frame.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">If the offset does not exceed the threshold value, first proceed to step <b>618</b> to perform the local time synchronization according to the time stamp, and then proceed to step <b>620</b> to switch off the transceiver of the wireless device.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">On the other hand, if the wireless device determines that a packet needs to be received in step <b>606</b>, the process goes to step <b>610</b> to completely receive the entire beacon, wherein the entire beacon comprises a frame check sequence (FCS). In step <b>612</b>, after acquiring the entire beacon, the wireless device can determine the integrity of the beacon according to the FCS. If step <b>612</b> finds that the beacon is incorrect, it directly jumps to step <b>620</b> to switch off the transceiver of the wireless device.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">On the other hand, if the beacon is correct, the process goes to step <b>614</b> to perform the local time synchronization according to the time stamp. Finally, in step <b>616</b>, the processor is awakened to receive the data packet through the transceiver. In step <b>617</b>, after receiving the data packet, the processor can be switched off or switched to the sleep mode, the power saving mode, the standby mode, or any other inactive modes. Finally, step <b>620</b> is performed to switch off the transceiver of the wireless device.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">After step <b>620</b>, the process repeats step <b>602</b>, so that the cycle continues. With the embodiment described, the advantages are summarized herein: since the amount of data of the received beacon is reduced, the wake-up time of the transceiver and the processor can be further reduced. For wireless devices maintaining in standby mode for a long time, it can significantly reduce power consumption and prolong the battery time.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">In a further embodiment, the TIM IE is found from the first portion of the beacon by the wireless device interpreting one or more element identifiers in the first portion of the beacon. The TIM IE contains the TIM as a bit map.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">Compared with the prior art, the proposed embodiments can switch off the transceiver earlier, so as to save a lot of unnecessary beacon receiving time and a lot of power. The effect of power conservation is particularly outstanding when the wireless device remains idle for a long time.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">The aforementioned embodiments suggest a wireless device receiving data from the access point. In a further embodiment, the access point can be substituted by any other remote device compliant to the Wi-Fi transmission protocol. That is, the wireless device as described in not limited to be receiving data from the access point.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an architecture diagram of a wireless device <b>700</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. Specifically, the wireless device can be any mobile device that supports Wi-Fi communication, such as a mobile phone or a computer. The wireless device <b>700</b> comprises at least a transceiver <b>708</b>, also known as a radio frequency module, which can be connected with an antenna <b>714</b> to transmit and receive wireless signals. The time synchronization module <b>710</b> provides a time synchronization function. A power control module <b>712</b> is configured to control the power switch of the transceiver <b>708</b>. A memory device <b>702</b> is configured for storing software <b>704</b> or program codes. The processor <b>720</b> executes the program in the memory device <b>702</b> and controls the overall operation of the wireless device <b>700</b> to implement the wireless data reception. It is worth mentioning that although the modules in the wireless device <b>700</b> are described as logical functions, they can be physically different hardware circuit designs or integrated circuit designs. For example, the power control module <b>712</b> may use a hardware circuit to determine the power switch of the transceiver <b>708</b> through simple signal control without the need for the processor <b>720</b>. The wireless device <b>700</b> of the present embodiment may further include a decision module <b>706</b>, which may be composed of a programmable logic circuit design with lower complexity than the processor <b>720</b>, and has simple logic operation and judgment functions. When the wireless device <b>700</b> or the processor <b>720</b> enters the sleep mode or power saving mode, the decision module <b>706</b> maintains crucial functions with minimum power consumption, such as packet verification, time synchronization, power control, and packet transmission/reception.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">In implementation, the decision module <b>706</b> may be implemented by a control circuit, coupled to the transceiver <b>708</b>, and configured to disable or enable the transceiver <b>708</b>. The time synchronization module <b>710</b> may be implemented by a time synchronization circuit. In an embodiment, the beacon sent from a remote device may comprise a first portion and a second portion, wherein the remote device may be an access point.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">For example, the decision module <b>706</b> enables the transceiver <b>708</b> at a target time. In implementation, the transceiver <b>708</b> is enabled by the power control module <b>712</b> powering on the transceiver <b>708</b>. The target time may be a TBTT. The transceiver <b>708</b> receives a first portion of the beacon, wherein the length of the first portion is less than the length of the entire beacon, the first portion comprises a time stamp and a traffic indication signal, and the second portion comprises a frame check sequence. The traffic indication signal may be a TIM.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">At this time, the wireless device <b>700</b> or the processor <b>720</b> may be in a sleep mode or a power saving mode, and the decision module <b>706</b> can operate with low power to maintain the beacon reception and judgment function. For example, the decision module <b>706</b> may determine whether a packet needs to be received according to the TIM. If the decision module <b>706</b> determines that there is no need to receive the data packet, the decision module <b>706</b> disables the transceiver <b>708</b> without completing the reception of the beacon, so as to further save the power of the wireless device <b>700</b>. In an embodiment, the decision module <b>706</b> disables the transceiver <b>708</b> from receiving the second portion of the beacon by instructing the power control module <b>712</b> to switch off the transceiver <b>708</b> before the beacon has been fully received.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">When the decision module <b>706</b> determines that a data packet needs to be received, it may instruct the transceiver <b>708</b> to receive the entire beacon, wherein the entire beacon comprises an FCS. The decision module <b>706</b> may determine the integrity of the beacon according to the FCS, such as performing a cyclic redundancy check. If the beacon is incorrect, the decision module <b>706</b> instructs the power control module <b>712</b> to switch off the transceiver <b>708</b>. The decision module <b>706</b> in this embodiment is described as a function block, and may actually be implemented by a logic circuit with complexity lower than the processor, cooperated with software. Similarly, the power control module <b>712</b> for switching the transceiver <b>708</b> may be circuit hardware, but may also be software programming.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">On the other hand, when the decision module <b>706</b> determines that the data packet needs to be received and the beacon is correct, the time synchronization module <b>710</b> performs the local time synchronization according to the time stamp, and the transceiver <b>708</b> receives the data packet. After the transceiver <b>708</b> completes the reception of the data packet, the power control module <b>712</b> switches off the transceiver <b>708</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">On the other hand, when the decision module <b>706</b> determines that there is no need to receive data packets, the processor <b>720</b> maintains in the state of sleep or inactive. The decision module <b>706</b> can then check whether the offset between the time stamp and the local time of the wireless device exceeds a threshold. If the offset does not exceed the threshold, the decision module <b>706</b> may instruct the time synchronization module <b>710</b> to perform the local time synchronization according to the time stamp, and then disables the transceiver <b>708</b>. For example, the decision module <b>706</b> disables the transceiver <b>708</b> by instructing the power control module <b>712</b> to switch off the transceiver <b>708</b>. In this embodiment, the threshold may be a time unit, such as a few microseconds or a few milliseconds.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">On the other hand, when the offset exceeds the threshold, it is likely an error in beacon reception. In this case, the process falls back to the conventional way, wherein an entire beacon is received. The decision module <b>706</b> may instruct the transceiver <b>708</b> to fully receive the entire beacon, including a frame check sequence. The decision module <b>706</b> checks the frame check sequence to determine the integrity of the beacon. If the beacon is not received correctly, no process is required, and the decision module <b>706</b> may instruct the power control module <b>712</b> to switch off the transceiver <b>708</b> of the wireless device. On the other hand, if the beacon verification is correct, it means that a data packet needs to be received or that there is a time synchronization problem. In this case, the decision module <b>706</b> instructs the time synchronization module <b>710</b> to perform the local time synchronization according to the time stamp, and then wakes up the processor <b>720</b> to process the data packet reception through the transceiver <b>708</b>. After receiving the data packet, the wireless device <b>700</b> or the processor <b>720</b> can enter the sleep mode or power saving mode again, and the power control module <b>712</b> also stops supplying power to the transceiver <b>708</b> to save power.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">Based on the above embodiments, the technical effect of the invention is that it can save a sizable proportion of power consumption for wireless devices that are idle for a long time.
