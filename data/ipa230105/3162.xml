The present disclosure also relates to a corresponding exhaust aftertreatment system. Although the method and system will be described in relation to a vehicle in the form of a truck, the method and system can also be efficiently incorporated in other vehicles types such as e.g. buses and construction equipment.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">During cold starts of vehicles, it is difficult to control NOx emissions which tend to be higher at cold starts. NOx emission control performed by cold start On Board Diagnostics (OBD) and On Board monitoring (OBM) processes relies on measurements performed by NOx sensors in the exhaust aftertreatment systems of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To perform On Board Diagnostics of NOx emissions during a cold start is challenging since the NOx sensors require time to warm up and start before they can provide accurate readings. The current NOx sensors are sensitive to humidity and therefore starting the sensor is typically delayed until water on the sensor has vaporized. However, by the time the NOx sensor is warmed up, the cold start sequence of the vehicle is nearly ended and the opportunity to perform emission control and diagnostics during the cold start is lost or at least cannot be optimally performed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Emission control, diagnostics, and monitoring have attracted much attention due to the environmental impact of emissions. Therefore, at least for this reason, it is of interest to improve such emission control, especially during cold starts.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the invention is to provide a method and system for NOx emission control during start of a vehicle that at least partly alleviates the deficiencies with the prior art.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for NOx emission control during start of a vehicle comprising an exhaust aftertreatment system, an engine, and a NOx sensor, the method comprising the steps of: determining a temperature of the NOx sensor; if the determined temperature of the NOx sensor is below a predetermined threshold, initiating heating of the NOx sensor, and, performing a preventive action for delaying engine start until the determined temperature of the NOx sensor exceeds or is equal to the predetermined threshold.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is based on the realization that by allowing the NOx sensor to heat up prior to engine start, provides for more efficient use of the NOx sensor during cold starts. By means of the method, the NOx sensor is ready to provide accurate measurements when the engine is started so that efficient emission control can be performed also during cold starts.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, by the provision of the herein proposed method, improved emission control and therefore also reduced NOx emission levels during cold starts is achieved.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The temperature of the NOx sensor may be determined by a temperature sensor directly on the NOX sensor. Further, the NOx sensor may comprise its own temperature sensing means for determining its temperature for determining whether it is ready to be activated and used. Thus, the NOx sensor may provide its own signal indicating that it is activated, or at least ready to be activated, once its temperature is above or at the predefined temperature.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, in other possible implementations, the temperature of the NOx sensor may be determined by a temperature sensor arranged in the exhaust gas stream near the NOx sensor. The temperature of the NOx sensor may then be assumed to be close to the temperature of the exhaust gas stream measured near the NOx sensor, or a model or other type of estimation is used for calculating or estimating a temperature of the NOx sensor based on the temperature of the exhaust gas near the NOx sensor. Near the NOx sensor may be considered in direct proximity of the sensor, or as close as reasonably possible without touching the NOx sensor and compromising its performance.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The preventive action is performed to directly or indirectly cause a delay in starting the engine so that the NOx sensor is allowed sufficient time to heat up to a temperature that ensure proper operation of the NOx sensor. Once sufficiently warm, the NOx sensor can provide accurate emission level measurements during the engine cold start.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Once the temperature of the NOx sensor is determined, or estimated, to be equal to or exceed the predetermined threshold, the preventive action may be terminated.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">NOx sensors are commonly used in exhaust gas aftertreatment systems of vehicles and are configured to detect and measure the levels of nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas. NOx sensors are considered known per se and details about their operation and functionality will not be described in detail herein.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The engine is preferably an internal combustion engine. The internal combustion engine may be diesel engine or a gasoline engine or any other type of internal combustion engine. The internal combustion engine may be part of a hybrid driveline partly powered by a battery.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to an example embodiment, performing a preventive action may comprise preventing the engine to start. This preventive action is such that even if an occupant of the vehicle attempts to start the engine, the engine will not start and is thus forced to maintain off. Thus, engine start, e.g. ignition, is not allowed until the NOx-sensor is sufficiently warm. This ensures that the NOx-sensor has reached proper operating temperature and can provide accurate measurements.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to an example embodiment, performing a preventive action may comprise generating a signal with instructions informing the driver to delay starting the engine. Thus, the preventive action may be a message encouraging the driver to delay engine start. The instructions may be provided as a message in the form of a &#x201c;pop-up&#x201d; message in the driver interface. It could also be an information message using audio, or with a lamp lighting up in the driver interface. It could potentially also be a combination of the different types of messages. With a less forcing preventive action the driver may override the prevention in case of e.g. emergencies.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an example embodiment, the signal with instructions informing the driver to delay starting the engine may be generated upon initiating heating of the NOx sensor. Hereby, a confirmation that NOx sensor heating is initiated is provided which allows for better timing of other tasks by the user. The instructions may for example include information about how long the delay to engine start is expected to be.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an example embodiment, the method may comprise initiating cold start on board diagnostics and/or on-board monitoring once the engine is started. Generally, when the engine and aftertreatment system is cold and the engine starts, the exhaust emissions are higher than when the system and engine have heated up. This is due to that NOx conversion in the aftertreatment system requires relatively high exhaust gas temperatures to work efficiently. Early initiation of cold start diagnostics and/or on-board monitoring advantageously provides for efficient monitoring of cold start emissions. In this way, any potential faults can be detected quickly by analysing the NOx levels. Further, monitoring the cold start NOx emissions over time may be advantageous since it allows for tracking cold start performances of the vehicles during their complete lifetime. For example, this enables detecting and tracking aging of the exhaust aftertreatment systems.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to an example embodiment, the method may further comprise activating the NOx sensor when the measured temperature of the NOx sensor exceeds or is equal to the predetermined threshold. To activate the NOx sensor means that the sensor can start to send useful measurement values to an engine control unit. The NOx sensor element needs to be relatively warm, e.g. approximately 800&#xb0; C. to work efficiently. When the NOx sensor is activated and sending useful measurement values, these values can be used by the control systems to convert NOx with as high performance as possible, or at least with an acceptable level of performance.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Heating of the NOx sensor is performed in a controlled way at a heating rate that is sufficiently low to not damage the sensor or cause unnecessary wear and tear on the NOx sensor.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to an example embodiment, heating of the NOx sensor may be performed such that water accumulated on the NOx sensor is vaporized in a controlled way so that damage to the NOx sensor due to expanding water vapor is prevented. Thus, heating of the NOx sensor is performed at a slow rate so that the heating does not cause damage to the NOx sensor. The heating rate is such that the water on the sensor can vaporize out and away from the sensor at a rate such that the expansion thereof does not cause damage to the NOx sensor. For example, the NOx sensor is heated to about 800&#xb0; C. in about 10-60 seconds depending on the surrounding temperature.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the second aspect of the invention, there is provided an exhaust aftertreatment system of a vehicle comprising: an exhaust pipe section for transferring exhaust gas towards an exhaust gas outlet; a NOx sensor arranged in the exhaust pipe for measuring a level of nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas; a heater arranged to heat the NOx sensor, and a sensor for determining a temperature of the NOx sensor; and the system further comprising a control unit configured to cause a preventive action for delaying engine start until a determined temperature of the NOx sensor exceeds or is equal to the predetermined threshold.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to an example embodiment, the control unit may be configured to prevent the vehicle to start until the determined temperature of the NOx sensor exceeds the threshold, and/or to generate a signal with instructions informing the driver to delay starting the engine.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to an example embodiment, the heater may be controllable to heat the NOx sensor at a heating rate to vaporize water accumulated on the NOx sensor such that damage to the NOx sensor due to expanding water vapor is prevented.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to an example embodiment, the heater comprises an electrical heating element or a heating element powered by the same type of fuel as the engine.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Effects and features of the second aspect of the invention are largely analogous to those described above in connection with the first aspect.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a vehicle comprising the exhaust aftertreatment system according to the second aspect.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a computer program comprising program code means for performing the steps of the first aspect when the program is run on a computer.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to a fifth aspect of the invention, there is provided a computer readable medium carrying a computer program comprising program code means for performing the steps of the first aspect when the program product is run on a computer.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to a sixth aspect of the invention, there is provided a control unit for controlling NOx emission during start of a vehicle comprising an exhaust aftertreatment system and a NOx sensor, the control unit being configured to perform the steps of the method according to the first aspect.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Effects and features of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth aspects are largely analogous to those described above in relation to the first aspect.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further features of, and advantages will become apparent when studying the appended claims and the following description.

The internal combustion engine may be e.g. a diesel engine or a gasoline engine or any other type of internal combustion engine. The truck <b>1</b> may be a hybrid electric vehicle. The truck <b>1</b> further comprises an exhaust gas aftertreatment system <b>300</b> including e.g. catalytic devices, urea injectors, and nitrogen oxide sensors, and will be discussed in further with reference to subsequent drawings. The truck <b>1</b> further comprises a control unit <b>100</b> that will also be discussed with reference to subsequent drawings.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow-chart of method steps according to embodiments of the invention and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> conceptually illustrates an exhaust aftertreatment system <b>300</b> according to embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The exhaust aftertreatment system <b>300</b> comprises an exhaust pipe section <b>302</b> for transferring exhaust gas <b>304</b> towards an exhaust gas outlet <b>306</b>. The exhaust pipe section <b>302</b> is part of a larger transfer system for transferring exhaust gas from the engine <b>2</b> to an exhaust gas outlet <b>306</b>. Generally, the aftertreatment system <b>300</b> may comprise catalytic units (e.g. selective catalytic reduction devices), urea injectors, ammonia-slip catalysts, diesel oxidation catalyst, particulate filters, exhaust gas temperature sensors, and other components that are per se known to the skilled person and will not be described in detail herein.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A NOx sensor <b>308</b> is arranged in the exhaust pipe section <b>302</b> for measuring a level of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the exhaust gas <b>304</b>. Further, a heater <b>312</b> is arranged to heat the NOx sensor <b>308</b>. The NOx sensor <b>308</b> may comprise its own heater integrated with the NOx-sensor, or the heater is an external heater arranged in contact with the housing of the NOx sensor <b>308</b>, or at least in close proximity to the NOx sensor <b>308</b>, sufficiently close to be able to heat the NOx sensor <b>308</b> in accordance with embodiments herein.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Here, a single NOx sensor <b>308</b> is depicted. However, in practical applications, there is typically more than one NOx sensor in the aftertreatment system. For example, a first NOx sensor may be arranged upstream of a selective catalytic reduction unit and a second NOx sensor may be arranged downstream of the selective catalytic reduction unit and possibly downstream of an ammonia-slip catalyst.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The locations of the NOx sensors in the aftertreatment system depend on the specific implementation at hand and various possibilities exist and are within the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In step S<b>102</b>, a temperature of the NOx sensor <b>308</b> is determined. This temperature may be determined by a temperature sensor arranged on and being dedicated to the NOx sensor. However, preferably, the NOx sensor <b>308</b> has its own internal circuitry and sensor <b>310</b><i>a </i>for determining its temperature, or at least whether it is ready for activation. In some possible implementations a sensor <b>310</b><i>b </i>arranged to measure the temperature of the exhaust gas in the transfer pipe <b>302</b> is located near the NOx sensor <b>308</b>. In this way the temperature of the NOx sensor <b>308</b> can be estimated from the temperature measured by the sensor <b>310</b><i>b, </i>or the temperature measured by the sensor <b>310</b><i>b </i>can be used as an indication of the temperature of the NOx sensor <b>308</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">It is next evaluated whether the determined temperature of the NOx sensor <b>308</b> is below a predetermined threshold, and if so, initiating heating of the NOx sensor <b>308</b> in step S<b>104</b>. Thus, the temperature sensor of the NOX sensor may indicate that the measured temperature is below the predetermined threshold, whereby the heater <b>312</b> is responsive to initiate heating of the NOx sensor <b>308</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, in step S<b>106</b> a preventive action is performed for delaying engine start until a determined temperature of the NOx sensor <b>308</b> exceeds or is equal to a predetermined threshold. For this, the system <b>300</b> further comprises a control unit <b>100</b> configured to cause the preventive action. For example, the control unit <b>100</b> may prevent the engine <b>2</b> to start, i.e. the preventive action is a hard action forcing the engine <b>2</b> to continue to be off until the NOx sensor <b>308</b> is at its predefined temperature. In other embodiments, the preventive action, caused by the control unit <b>100</b> is of a more instructive nature and comprises generating a signal with instructions informing the driver to delay starting the engine <b>2</b>. The signal may be generated upon initiating heating of the NOx sensor <b>308</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thus, the preventive action could either be a &#x201c;hard&#x201d; prevention, where an engine control unit could inhibit start of the engine <b>2</b> before the NOx sensor <b>308</b> has reached the predetermined temperature and is active. The preventive action could also be a &#x201c;soft&#x201d; prevention action as a recommendation where the driver is requested to postpone or delay starting the engine <b>2</b> but also has the option to override the preventive function if needed, for example due to safety reasons if the vehicle is parked but quickly has to move, for example due to a hazard such as a fire nearby or another emergency situation.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Once the temperature of the NOx sensor <b>308</b> is determined, or estimated, to be equal to or exceed the predetermined threshold, the preventive action may terminate and the engine is allowed to start, in step S<b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The control unit <b>100</b> is, in one implementation, configured to receive signals from the internal temperature sensor <b>310</b><i>a </i>of the NOx sensor indicative of the temperature of the NOx sensor. In other possible implementations, the control unit <b>100</b> is configured to receive signals from the sensor <b>310</b><i>b </i>indicative of the temperature in the exhaust gas transfer pipe <b>302</b>, here upstream of the NOx sensor <b>308</b>, from which signals the control unit <b>100</b> can calculate or model the temperature of the NOx sensor <b>308</b>. If the internal temperature sensor <b>310</b><i>a </i>of the NOx sensor is used, the sensor <b>310</b><i>b </i>may be omitted for the purpose of determining the temperature of the NOx sensor <b>308</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Once the engine <b>2</b> is started cold start diagnostics and/or on-board monitoring of emissions can be initiated. With the method proposed herein, the cold start diagnostics and/or on-board monitoring can be initiated and utilized with high accuracy from the instant that the engine <b>2</b> is started due to that the NOx sensor <b>308</b> will already be heated up and active. Thus, emission control may be improved during cold starts. The NOx sensor <b>308</b> may be activated when the measured temperature of the NOx sensor <b>308</b> exceeds or is equal to the predetermined threshold. The NOx sensor <b>308</b> itself may provide a signal to the control unit <b>100</b> that it is active and ready to provide NOx emission measurements data.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The heater <b>312</b> is controllable by the control unit <b>100</b> to heat the NOx sensor <b>308</b> at a heating rate to vaporize water accumulated on the NOx sensor <b>308</b> such that damage to the NOx sensor <b>308</b> due to expanding water vapor is prevented.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The heater <b>312</b> may comprise an electrical heating element or a heating element powered by the same fuel as the engine <b>2</b>. Using an electrical heating element provides for a versatile heating element that can be used with almost any type of exhaust aftertreatment system since electric power sources are included in most vehicles. However, using a heating element powered by the same fuel as the engine eliminates the need for an electrical power source, thus saving energy in the electrical energy sources of the vehicle that may be used for other systems in need of electrical energy. For example, a diesel driven burner, or a hydrogen driven heater may be used, or a heater using some other type of available chemical fuel. Further, an air pump in the exhaust aftertreatment system may be used to increase the air flow going through the system for heating the NOx sensor, possibly in combination with one or more of the other mentioned types of heaters.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The control unit <b>100</b> is configured for controlling NOx emission during start of a vehicle <b>1</b> comprising an exhaust aftertreatment system <b>300</b> and a NOx sensor <b>308</b>. The control unit <b>100</b> being is configured to determine a temperature of the NOx sensor <b>308</b> by acquired sensing data from a temperature sensor <b>310</b><i>a </i>of the NOX sensor <b>308</b> or from a sensor <b>310</b><i>b </i>in the exhaust aftertreatment system, or by receiving a signal from the NOx sensor <b>308</b> itself indicative of the present state of the NOx sensor. If the determined temperature of the NOx sensor <b>308</b> is below a predetermined threshold and thus needs heating, the control unit <b>100</b> is configured to initiate heating of the NOx sensor <b>308</b>. If the heating is initiated, the control unit <b>100</b> is configured to control a preventive action for delaying engine start until the temperature of the NOx sensor is determined to exceed or being equal to the predetermined threshold.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A control unit may include a microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable digital signal processor or another programmable device. Thus, the control unit comprises electronic circuits and connections (not shown) as well as processing circuitry (not shown) such that the control unit can communicate with different parts of the truck such as the brakes, suspension, driveline, in particular an electrical engine, an electric machine, a clutch, and a gearbox in order to at least partly operate the truck.
