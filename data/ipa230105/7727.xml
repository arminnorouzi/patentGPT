An access network <b>100</b> (AN) includes multiple antenna groups, one including <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, another including <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>, and an additional including <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, only two antennas are shown for each antenna group, however, more or fewer antennas may be utilized for each antenna group. Access terminal <b>116</b> (AT) is in communication with antennas <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, where antennas <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> transmit information to access terminal <b>116</b> over forward link <b>120</b> and receive information from access terminal <b>116</b> over reverse link <b>118</b>. Access terminal (AT) <b>122</b> is in communication with antennas <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, where antennas <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> transmit information to access terminal (AT) <b>122</b> over forward link <b>126</b> and receive information from access terminal (AT) <b>122</b> over reverse link <b>124</b>. In a FDD system, communication links <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> may use different frequency for communication.

At the transmitter system <b>210</b>, traffic data for a number of data streams is provided from a data source <b>212</b> to a transmit (TX) data processor <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, each data stream is transmitted over a respective transmit antenna. TX data processor <b>214</b> formats, codes, and interleaves the traffic data for each data stream based on a particular coding scheme selected for that data stream to provide coded data.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The coded data for each data stream may be multiplexed with pilot data using OFDM techniques. The pilot data is typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and may be used at the receiver system to estimate the channel response. The multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream is then modulated (i.e., symbol mapped) based on a particular modulation scheme (e.g., BPSK, QPSK, M-PSK, or M-QAM) selected for that data stream to provide modulation symbols. The data rate, coding, and modulation for each data stream may be determined by instructions performed by processor <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The modulation symbols for all data streams are then provided to a TX MIMO processor <b>220</b>, which may further process the modulation symbols (e.g., for OFDM).

N<sub>T </sub>modulated signals from transmitters <b>222</b><i>a </i>through <b>222</b><i>t </i>are then transmitted from N<sub>T </sub>antennas <b>224</b><i>a </i>through <b>224</b><i>t</i>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">At receiver system <b>250</b>, the transmitted modulated signals are received by N<sub>R </sub>antennas <b>252</b><i>a </i>through <b>252</b><i>r </i>and the received signal from each antenna <b>252</b> is provided to a respective receiver (RCVR) <b>254</b><i>a </i>through <b>254</b><i>r</i>. Each receiver <b>254</b> conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, and downconverts) a respective received signal, digitizes the conditioned signal to provide samples, and further processes the samples to provide a corresponding &#x201c;received&#x201d; symbol stream.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">An RX data processor <b>260</b> then receives and processes the N<sub>R </sub>received symbol streams from N<sub>R </sub>receivers <b>254</b> based on a particular receiver processing technique to provide N<sub>T </sub>&#x201c;detected&#x201d; symbol streams. The RX data processor <b>260</b> then demodulates, deinterleaves, and decodes each detected symbol stream to recover the traffic data for the data stream. The processing by RX data processor <b>260</b> is complementary to that performed by TX MIMO processor <b>220</b> and TX data processor <b>214</b> at transmitter system <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A processor <b>270</b> periodically determines which pre-coding matrix to use (discussed below).

The reverse link message is then processed by a TX data processor <b>238</b>, which also receives traffic data for a number of data streams from a data source <b>236</b>, modulated by a modulator <b>280</b>, conditioned by transmitters <b>254</b><i>a </i>through <b>254</b><i>r</i>, and transmitted back to transmitter system <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">At transmitter system <b>210</b>, the modulated signals from receiver system <b>250</b> are received by antennas <b>224</b>, conditioned by receivers <b>222</b>, demodulated by a demodulator <b>240</b>, and processed by a RX data processor <b>242</b> to extract the reserve link message transmitted by the receiver system <b>250</b>.

Therefore, it is needed to define timing duration(s) for a UE to monitor Physical Sidelink Control Channel (PSCCH), e.g. Sidelink Control Information (SCI). In NR Uu, a UE could discontinuously monitor Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) based on DRX configuration. The UE could monitor PDCCH when the UE is in active time. The UE may not monitor PDCCH when the UE is not in active time. The active time could include the time while:<ul id="ul0132" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0132-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0133" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0133-0001" num="0314">drx-onDurationTimer or drx-InactivityTimer or drx-RetransmissionTimerDL or drx-RetransmissionTimerUL or ra-ContentionResolutionTimer is running; or</li>        <li id="ul0133-0002" num="0315">a Scheduling Request is sent on PUCCH and is pending; or</li>        <li id="ul0133-0003" num="0316">a PDCCH indicating a new transmission addressed to the C-RNTI of the MAC entity has not been received after successful reception of a Random Access Response for the Random Access Preamble not selected by the MAC entity among the contention-based Random Access Preamble.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0077" num="0317">In NR Uu, drx-onDurationTimer is configured by a network and is started based on Short DRX Cycle or Long DRX Cycle configuration, drx-InactivityTimer is started or restarted if the PDCCH indicates a new transmission (e.g. DL or UL), drx-RetransmissionTimerUL is started after the expiry of drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL, and drx-RetransmissionTimerDL is started after the expiry of drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0318">In NR SL, a transmitter UE (Tx UE) could perform sidelink transmission to a receiver UE via sidelink resources selected by the Tx UE (e.g. via autonomous resource selection mode, mode-2) or sidelink resources indicated by a base station (e.g. via network scheduling mode, mode-1). For mode-1, the base station could configure the Tx UE with a configured grant for sidelink transmission (e.g. type-1 or type-2 configured grant for SL). The configured grant could be associated with a set of periodic SL resources. The Tx UE could perform sidelink transmission to the Rx UE via using SL resources associated with an (activated) configured grant.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0319">In NR Uu, a UE does not need to monitor downlink control channel (e.g. PDCCH) to receive transmission via configured grant. However, in NR SL, a Rx UE may need to receive PSCCH for each PSSCH transmission including transmission from a Tx UE via configured grant for SL. Since the Tx UE needs to transmit PSCCH for each Physical Sidelink Shared Channel (PSSCH) transmission, which can assist surrounding UE(s) to perform sensing. Moreover, the Tx UE may indicate or update information about periodic resource reservation in sidelink control information. If the Rx UE applies SL DRX (e.g. a short or long DRX cycle) and if sidelink resources associated with a configured grant of the Tx UE does not align with active time associated with SL DRX of the Rx UE, the Rx UE may not be able to receive some (or all) of PSCCH or PSSCH transmissions from the Tx UE. The misalignment may be because of difference between periodicity of the configured grant and periodicity of the DRX cycle, and/or different time offsets between the configured grant and the DRX cycle.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0320">An example of the issue is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. A Tx UE is configured by a base station with configured grant for sidelink and is activated by the base station. A Rx UE applies SL DRX configuration and starts drx on duration timer at t<b>1</b>. The Tx UE performs sidelink transmission <b>1</b> via SL resource(s) at t<b>2</b> while the timer is still running. The Rx UE is in active time at t<b>2</b> and receives SL transmission <b>1</b> (PSCCH and PSSCH). The Tx UE performs SL transmission <b>2</b> via another SL resource associated with the configured grant. However, RX UE is not in active time and may not monitor PSCCH. The Rx UE could start on duration timer at t<b>4</b> (a timing after t<b>3</b>). The Rx UE may fail to receive SL transmission <b>2</b> due to not being in active time at t<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0321">Another issue could occur when a Rx UE receives a SCI indicating a new transmission associated with periodic communication (e.g. Sidelink (SL) Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS)) from a Tx UE in active time. According to NR Uu specification, a UE could start or restart a timer (e.g. drx-inactivitytimer) in response to receiving a PDCCH indicating a new transmission. The UE monitors the PDCCH when the timer is running. A purpose for the timer is for the UE to monitor other PDCCH indicating new transmission scheduled by a base station. If concept of the timer is reused for SL, and the Rx UE receives a SCI indicating new transmission from a Tx UE, the Rx UE could start or restart the timer in response to the reception of the SCI. However, if the SCI is associated with a periodic SL resource (e.g. SL SPS or mode-2 resources), the Tx UE may not indicate additional (or sequential) new transmissions after the new transmission since the periodic SL resource is reserved corresponding to a periodicity. The Rx UE may monitor unnecessary time duration and induce power wastage.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0322">To solve the issue(s) mentioned above, one general concept of the invention is that a Rx UE could determine whether to monitor a sidelink control channel at a timing based on a sidelink information transmitted from a Tx UE. The Rx UE could determine to monitor the sidelink control channel at the timing regardless whether the Rx UE is in active time at the timing if the sidelink information indicates a first sidelink transmission (for the Rx UE) at the timing or if the sidelink formation indicates a (reserved) resource for a first sidelink transmission at the timing.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0323">The timing could be associated with a first sidelink transmission from the Tx UE. The first sidelink transmission could be associated with a configured sidelink grant. The configured sidelink grant indicates, reserves, or corresponds to multiple (periodic) sidelink resources for transmissions of multiple Medium Access Control (MAC) Packet Data Units (PDUs). The first sidelink transmission could be associated with a Radio Resource Control (RRC) configuration indicating a set of PSSCH durations for transmissions of multiple MAC PDUs. The first sidelink transmission could be associated with a configured grant Type 2. The first sidelink transmission could be associated with a configured grant Type 1.

The specific SCI could be associated with a previous sidelink transmission (e.g. different from the first sidelink transmission). The UE could determine the timing associated with the first sidelink transmission based on the sidelink information included in the specific SCI. The previous sidelink transmission could be associated with a same RRC configuration as the first sidelink transmission. The sidelink resource of the previous sidelink transmission and the sidelink resource of the first sidelink transmission are indicated, reserved, or associated with the same configured sidelink grant. In one embodiment, the previous sidelink transmission delivers, includes, or comprises different MAC PDU from the first sidelink transmission. In one embodiment, the first sidelink transmission is new or initial sidelink transmission, which delivers, includes, or comprises a new Transport Block (TB) or a new MAC PDU. The RRC configuration could be a configured grant configuration for SL (e.g. SL-ConfiguredGrantConfig).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0325">The sidelink information could be a timing offset indicating the timing associated with the first sidelink information with respect to a previous timing. The previous timing could be associated with a reception of the specific SCI. Alternatively, the previous timing could be associated with reception of a MAC PDU associated with (or indicated by) the specific SCI. Alternatively, the previous timing could be associated with a first (system) frame number. In one embodiment, the sidelink information could be a resource reservation periodicity indicated in the specific SCI, while the resource reservation periodicity is not zero.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0326">An example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.
