The performance of radio frequency and long-wavelength infrared sensors may be less easily degraded, but their resolution may be inferior.

In operation, the optical telescope <b>105</b> may receive light from an optical scene <b>156</b>, this received light may be transmitted through the optical beam combiner <b>125</b> through the optical detector optics <b>130</b> (which may include a lens) and focused on the optical detector array <b>135</b>. Each detector in the optical detector array <b>135</b> converts the received light into electric charge. The read out integrated circuit <b>127</b> measures the electric charge over a specified interval and outputs digital signals proportional to the charge. The processing circuit <b>150</b> converts this digital signal into the proper format to create an optical image of the scene on the display <b>155</b>. The optical detector array <b>135</b> may periodically be reset and the time interval between any such reset, and a subsequent read-out of the cumulative photon detections since the reset may be referred to as a &#x201c;frame&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the optical telescope <b>105</b> and the optical detector optics <b>130</b> may be considered to form an &#x201c;optical receiver&#x201d;. As used herein, an &#x201c;optical receiver&#x201d; or a &#x201c;radio frequency receiver&#x201d; is a subsystem that receives and processes optical or radio frequency radiation propagating in free space. An &#x201c;imaging receiver&#x201d; (e.g., an imaging optical receiver or an imaging radio frequency receiver) is a subsystem that receives and processes the electromagnetic radiation in a manner making possible the reconstruction of an image of the scene. As such, the optical telescope <b>105</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an imaging optical receiver, and the combination of the optical telescope <b>105</b> and the optical detector optics <b>130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> can also form an imaging optical receiver. Similarly, the radio frequency antenna array <b>115</b>, the radio frequency to optical converter <b>120</b>, and the optical detector optics <b>130</b> together form an imaging radio frequency receiver. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the optical detector optics <b>130</b> form a shared element of (i) the imaging optical receiver that includes the optical telescope <b>105</b> and the optical detector optics <b>130</b> and of (ii) the imaging radio frequency receiver that includes the radio frequency receiver <b>115</b>, the radio frequency to optical converter <b>120</b> and the optical detector optics <b>130</b>.

As used herein, an &#x201c;optical beam combiner&#x201d; is any passive optical system that has at least two inputs and at least one output, the light at the output being a linear combination of the light at the inputs. It may be a partially silvered mirror, for example, or it may include powered elements such as lenses. In some embodiments, it may include, for example, a grating or prism to combine different wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The &#x201c;optical scene&#x201d;, as used herein, means the set of things (e.g., buildings, vegetation, soil, rocks, vehicles, aircraft, sky, or clouds) from which light, in a wavelength range of interest, reaches the detector through the optical receiver. Similarly, the &#x201c;radio frequency scene&#x201d;, as used herein, means the set of things from which electromagnetic radiation, in a frequency range of interest, reaches the detector through the radio frequency receiver, as discussed in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the radio frequency antenna array <b>115</b> may include a plurality of antenna elements <b>205</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

Each optical modulator <b>305</b> has an optical local oscillator input fed by an optical local oscillator signal (e.g., a signal from an optical local oscillator <b>415</b>, discussed in further detail below), a modulation input, and an output. In some embodiments, each optical modulator <b>305</b> is a phase modulator, which may include a nonlinear crystal (e.g., a lithium niobate crystal) the index of refraction of which depends on an electric field applied across it. In operation, a radio frequency tone received by one of the antenna elements <b>205</b>, amplified by one of the low noise amplifiers <b>210</b> and input to one of the optical modulators <b>305</b> may cause phase modulation of the optical local oscillator signal, resulting, at the output of the optical modulator <b>305</b>, in a signal including a carrier component, an upper sideband, and a lower sideband. For large modulation depth, other sidebands may also be present, and the carrier may be suppressed (or entirely absent, if the modulation depth corresponds to a zero of the zeroth Bessel function of the first kind).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The phase of the upper sideband may be equal to the sum of the phase of the optical local oscillator signal and the phase of the radio frequency tone. The output of each phase modulator may be connected to a filter <b>310</b> (e.g., a high-pass or bandpass filter) that allows the upper modulation sideband to pass and rejects or blocks the carrier and the lower modulation sideband. As such, each of the modulators in such an embodiment acts as a phase-preserving frequency converter. An amplitude modulator (e.g., an electro-absorption modulator or a Mach-Zehnder interferometer having a phase modulator in each arm, the phase modulators being driven in opposite directions by the radio frequency modulating signal), similarly followed by a filter <b>310</b> that passes one modulation sideband while blocking the carrier and the other modulation sideband, may similarly act as a phase-preserving frequency converter.

For example, in a passive sensing embodiment (in which the optical transmitter <b>140</b> and the radio frequency transmitter <b>145</b> are absent or shut off), the image separation circuit may separate the signal generated by the optical detector array <b>135</b> into signals from the radio frequency channel corresponding to natural electromagnetic radiation from the radio frequency scene <b>158</b> and signals from the optical channel corresponding to natural electromagnetic radiation from the optical scene <b>156</b>, and display them (or portions of them) separately on the display <b>155</b>. Such separation may be accomplished by any of several methods.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, the wavelength bands of the optical signals received at the optical detector array <b>135</b> (<i>i</i>) from the optical channel and (ii) from the radio frequency channel may differ. In this case wavelength-dependent detection may be used to perform image separation. For example, a controllable optical detector filter <b>170</b> (e.g., a filter wheel with two bandpass filters, each corresponding to one of the two wavelength bands) may be employed between the optical detector optics <b>130</b> and the optical detector array <b>135</b> to allow only one of the two signals to reach the detector at any time.

The detector may be operated in the first bias condition (with a first bias voltage or a first bias current applied to each of the pixels) during a first time interval and in the second bias condition (with a second bias voltage or a second bias current applied to each of the pixels) during a second time interval, and the processing circuit <b>150</b> may then separate the images and, for example, display the corresponding images separately on the display <b>155</b> (e.g., displaying one or the other of the two images (e.g., as selected by a user) or displaying the two images side by side or one above the other).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the wavelength band of the output of the radio frequency to optical converter <b>120</b> may be selectable.

Such a wavelength-selectable optical local oscillator <b>415</b> may include two lasers, configured to operate at different wavelengths, and a system for switching between them. For example, the outputs of the two lasers may be connected to respective inputs of an optical power combiner, and the lasers may be configured so that only one operates at a time (and the other is shut off). In such an embodiment, the optical filter <b>165</b> may be absent. The controllable optical detector filter <b>170</b> may be a filter wheel with two bandpass filters, each corresponding to one of the two wavelengths of operation of the optical local oscillator <b>415</b>. If the signal from the radio frequency channel is much stronger that the signal from the optical channel (e.g. as a result of close approach to a very high power radio frequency source), the sensing system may switch the controllable optical detector filter <b>170</b> to another wavelength band, switch the optical local oscillator <b>415</b> to fall within the newly selected wavelength band and switch the optical detector array <b>135</b> to the newly selected wavelength band.

In some embodiments, the phase delay through the channels of the radio frequency antenna array <b>115</b> and the radio frequency to optical converter <b>120</b> may not all be the same, and, for example, the effect of the variation in phase delay may be to convert received plane waves to converging spherical waves at the output of the radio frequency to optical converter <b>120</b>, so that the optical detector optics <b>130</b> may be unnecessary, or so that (i) the optical detector optics <b>130</b> may be selected for compatibility with the optical telescope <b>105</b>, and (ii) light corresponding to a distant radio frequency source may also be focused at the optical detector array <b>135</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an embodiment with active sensing (i.e., with an optical transmitter <b>140</b> or a radio frequency transmitter <b>145</b>, or both), time division multiplexing may be employed to separate the active images from each other and from the passive images. For example, the minimum round-trip time of flight for a radio frequency signal may be the round-trip time of flight for the nearest object in the radio frequency scene <b>158</b>, and the maximum round-trip time of flight for a radio frequency signal may be the round-trip time of flight for the most distant object in the radio frequency scene <b>158</b>. As such, if the &#x201c;radio frequency reflection time interval&#x201d; is the time interval that (i) begins later than the emission of a radio frequency pulse by the minimum round-trip time of flight and (ii) ends later than the emission of the pulse by the maximum round-trip time of flight, then the reflection from the radio frequency scene <b>158</b> of the radio frequency pulse may be received by the sensing system entirely within the radio frequency reflection time interval, and the reflection of the radio frequency pulse may be absent during a time interval preceding the radio frequency reflection time interval and during a time interval following the radio frequency reflection time interval.

The active images may include, in addition to signals from the reflection of the radio frequency pulse, signals corresponding to natural radio frequency and optical (passive) emissions. These contributions may be sufficiently small to be neglected, or their effects may be reduced by blocking or disabling any input path not needed for the active image being acquired (e.g., putting the optical control element <b>175</b> in the second state when an active radio frequency image is acquired), or corrections may be made for their effects, for example, by subtracting from each active image acquired by the optical detector array <b>135</b> during the radio frequency reflection time interval a passive image obtained in otherwise similar circumstances (e.g., with the optical control element <b>175</b> in the second state) during a time interval when reflections from transmitted pulses are absent (i.e., outside of the radio frequency reflection time interval).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Active images acquired by the optical detector array <b>135</b> during the optical frequency reflection time may similarly be displayed or used to perform optical ranging.

For example, the timing circuit <b>160</b> may send a first control signal to the optical transmitter <b>140</b>, to cause it to transmit an optical pulse. After the minimum round-trip time of flight for an optical signal has elapsed, the timing circuit <b>160</b> may send a second control signal to the processing circuit <b>150</b> and the read out integrated circuit <b>127</b>, to begin recording arrival times of photons, and after the maximum round-trip time of flight for an optical signal has elapsed, the timing circuit <b>160</b> may send a third control signal to the processing circuit <b>150</b> and the read out integrated circuit <b>127</b>, to stop recording arrival times of photons. The time interval between the first control signal and the photon arrival times may be divided by 2 times the speed of light by the ranging circuit, to calculate the range to the optical scene, for each detector in the optical detector array <b>135</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">If the total number of received photons is relatively small, then the range estimation error for any pixel may be unacceptably large.
