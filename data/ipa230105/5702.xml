In particular, it relates to a system for reducing image drift of a microscopy system. More particularly, it relates to a system for reducing thermal drift of a sample holder and corresponding methods thereof.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Microscopy systems are widely used for not only observing samples, but also for manufacturing, processing, and machining samples. In a typical microscopy system, a beam of particles is directed on to a sample supported on a sample holder, the particles in the beam interact with the sample and cause a variety of emissions from the sample which may then be captured by a variety of detectors. The beam may comprise charge-neutral particles such as photons, or charged particles such as electrons or ions, depending on the intended use and resolution of the microscope system. The microscopy system may also comprise optics (that may be electromagnetic or electrostatic or magnetostatic) to direct the beam at a certain location on the sample, and to focus it.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electrons and ions may offer higher resolution owing to their shorter wavelengths (because of higher mass of electrons and ions compared to photons). However, charged particles may have to be accelerated to high kinetic energies to achieve a resolution comparable to or better than optical microscopes. Higher energies may lead to greater cross-section for interacting with neutral molecules and thus such systems are typically operated in vacuum conditions in a vacuum column or a vacuum chamber.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some vacuum chambers, a cold trap may also be provided to prevent contamination of the vacuum pump and/or the sample by vapors. The temperature of the cold trap may typically be different from that of the vacuum chamber. Thus, a heat flow may occur between the cold trap and the sample holder (that may be at thermal equilibrium with the vacuum chamber).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Detectors for charged particle microscopy systems may also be typically cooled to temperatures as low as &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. to reduce dark current and improve signal-to-noise. In addition, detectors may be retractable, allowing them to deployed for detection and retracted otherwise.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The deployment and retraction of detectors may cause a significant temperature variation at the sample holder. For example, once the sample holder (with the sample) has been inserted into the vacuum chamber, the beam may be aligned with the sample and the microscopy system prepared for subsequent operation. After equilibration, the sample holder will be at the ambient temperature of the vacuum chamber, possibly with also the cold trap inside the chamber.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">At a later time, the cooled detector(s) may be deployed close to the sample holder to capture emissions from the interaction of the beam with the sample. The deployment of cooled detector(s) may result in a change in the heat flow between the sample holder and the detector(s) owing to the change in the distance of the detector(s). The detector(s) may also shield, at least in part, the cold trap resulting in a change in the heat flow between the sample holder and the cold trap. Thus, an overall variation in heat flow from/to the sample holder may occur due to a change in the distance from the detector(s). This may result in a thermal drift. As a result, the alignment of the image may be disturbed and the image may start to drift. The magnitude of the drift may depend on the temperature difference between the cold detector(s) and the temperature of the sample holder before deployment of the detector(s). In typical systems, the drift may be as large as, for example, 200 nm, whereas a typical expected resolution may be, for example, 1 nm. The system may then have to be allowed to settle down into a new equilibrium condition which may take, for example, 1 hour. This may then lead to inefficiency in operating the system.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the present technology aim to improve the efficiency of microscopy systems by reducing the drift of the image owing to thermal variations at the sample holder. They may be of particular relevance for microscopy systems used for fabrication and/or machining of micro or nano structures where such drifts may have a particularly adverse impact.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention seeks to overcome or at least alleviate the shortcomings and disadvantages of the prior art. More particularly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved system and method for reducing image drift of a microscopy system.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a sample holder for a microscopy system comprising a material with a low thermal conductivity for reducing a drift of the sample holder when inserted into a microscope. The drift may be a thermal drift arising from inserting the sample holder from a temperature different from that as the inside of the microscope. Or, it may arise from inserting other elements at a temperature different from the sample holder into the microscope. In either case, thermal drift causes the image of a sample to drift until the sample holder reaches thermal equilibrium with its environment. The attainment of equilibrium may take long, thus reducing the efficiency of the imaging process.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The sample holder may be configured to hold a sample so as to allow imaging at least a part of the sample in a microscope. This may comprise translation and/or rotation of the sample holder, with means provided to drive such movements.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The sample holder may comprise an elongated rod and a tip for holding the sample, wherein an intermediate part is provided between the rod and the tip, the intermediate part comprising the material with the low thermal conductivity. The intermediate part may comprise materials such as Zerodur with a thermal conductivity of 1.46 W/m/K. On the other hand, typically, the rod may comprise a material such as Phosphor Bronze (CuSn) that has a thermal conductivity of 75 W/m/K. Thus, the thermal conductivity of the rod may be reduced, lowering the thermal drift of the rod, and consequently, the sample holder.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A length of the intermediate part may be between 0.01 and 20 times of the length of the rod.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The thermal conductivity of the material may be between 0.1 W/m/K and 100 W/m/K.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The sample holder may further comprise an ultra-low expansion (ULE) material, wherein a coefficient of thermal expansion of the ULE material is between 10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>/&#xb0; C. and 100/&#xb0; C. The thermal drift of the sample holder may also be reduced by reducing a coefficient of thermal expansion of the sample holder. For example, Zerodur with a coefficient of thermal expansion 10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup>/&#xb0; C. may also be used as a ULE material.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The intermediate part as described above may comprise the ULE material.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The intermediate part as described above may be manufactured by a casting process.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The intermediate part as described above may be manufactured by an injection molding process.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The intermediate part as described above may be manufactured by an additive manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a second aspect, the present invention relates to a high emissivity component for a microscopy system comprising a sample holder, wherein the high emissivity component comprises, at least in part, a coating with a high thermal emissivity to increase a heat load between the sample holder and the high emissivity component. The high emissivity component may help to prevent contamination of the sample and/or the vacuum pumps. The high emissivity component may comprise one of the objects with which the sample holder may have heat exchange. Increasing the heat load by increasing the emissivity of the high emissivity component may help reduce variation in the heat load at the sample holder if the heat exchange with the high emissivity component becomes a significant contributor to the total heat load at the sample holder.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The coating may comprise a material with an operational electromagnetic wavelength between 300 nm and 1000 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The coating may comprise a material with a thermal emissivity between 0.5 and 1.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The coating may comprise a material with a working temperature between &#x2212;273&#xb0; C. and 0&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The coating may comprise a material with an areal density between 0.1 mg/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 10 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The high emissivity component may be coated for a surface area ranging from at least 5% to at most 100%. A larger coated area may help to increase the rate of heat exchange between the high emissivity component and the sample holder.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The coating may have a uniform thickness over the coated part of the high emissivity component. The uniform thickness may be between 1 nm and 1 cm.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Alternatively, the coating may have a variable thickness over the coated part of the high emissivity component such that a minimum thickness of the coating may be between 1 nm and 1 cm and a maximum thickness of the coating may be between 1 nm and 1 cm over the coated part of the high emissivity component. This may be of advantage if only a fraction of the surface area of the high emissivity component accounts for most of the heat exchange with the sample holder.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The coating may comprise a non-magnetic material, an organic material, or an inorganic material.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The uncoated part of the high emissivity component may comprise a material with a thermal emissivity between 0 and 90 for wavelengths between 300 nm and 1000 &#x3bc;m. In particular, the thermal emissivity of the coating may be larger than that of the uncoated part of the high emissivity component to increase the heat load at the sample holder.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The high emissivity component may comprise a cold trap.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a third aspect, the present invention relates to a microscopy system comprising a first element configured to have a first temperature (T1), a second element configured to have a second temperature (T2), and a third element configured to have a third temperature (T3), wherein the third element is configured to be located at a plurality of different distances from the first element, wherein the microscopy system is configured to at least image a sample and to reduce a drift of the image.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The first element may comprise a sample holder as described above. Or the first element may comprise a sample holder.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The second element may comprise a high emissivity component as described above.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The third element may comprise a detector. Thus, the microscopy system may comprise a detector (or a plurality of detectors) that may be retracted and deployed. This may allow for better positioning of the sample.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The second temperature may be different from the first temperature and the third temperature may be different from the first temperature. Because of a difference in temperature, the change in position of the detector may lead to a variable heat exchange with the sample holder. For example, if the detector is colder than the sample holder, a larger heat flow may occur when the detector is deployed than when it is retracted. This may cause the sample holder to drift. However, by employing a sample holder as described above, the change in length of the sample holder due to thermal variation may be reduced. Similarly, by employing a cold trap with a high emissivity coating, heat exchange with the cold trap may be made large enough that the variation occurring due to the changing distance of the detector may be small.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A heat flow between the first element and the second element may be, at least in part, radiative.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A heat flow between the first element and the third element may be, at least in part, radiative.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A result of the variation in the distance of the third element from the first element may be a variation in the radiative heat flow from the first element. As described above, for example, a cold detector (compared to the sample holder) would lead to higher radiative heat flow when positioned closer to the sample holder than when positioned farther away.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A result of the variation in the distance of the third element from the first element may be a variation in the radiative heat flow between the first element and the second element. For example, a cold detector may partly shield the cold trap from the sample holder when it is deployed close to the sample holder. Thus, the radiative heat flow between the sample holder and the cold trap may be changed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The microscopy system may be configured to reduce a drift of the image by reducing the variation in the radiative heat flow from the first element as the distance to the third element is varied.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The reduction in the variation in the radiative heat flow from the first element may be between 1% and 100%.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The microscopy system may comprise a vacuum chamber configured to house the first element, the second element, and the third element. The vacuum chamber may allow the heat flow to be dominated by radiation instead of, for example, convection.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A pressure in the vacuum chamber may be less than 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>Pa.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A temperature of the vacuum chamber may be significantly identical to the temperature (T1) of the first element.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A difference between the first temperature and the second temperature may be between 20&#xb0; C. and 1000&#xb0; C., preferably between 50&#xb0; C. and 300&#xb0; C., further preferably between 100&#xb0; C. and 200&#xb0; C. In particular, the second element may be hotter than the first element, so that the direction of heat flow is from the second element to the first element.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A difference between the first temperature and the third temperature may be between 20&#xb0; C. and 1000&#xb0; C., preferably between 50&#xb0; C. and 300&#xb0; C., further preferably between 100&#xb0; C. and 200&#xb0; C.

The vacuum chamber <b>10</b> may house a sample holder <b>100</b>, configured to hold a sample (not shown) on its tip <b>110</b>. The sample holder <b>100</b> may be configured to be inserted into and/or retracted from the vacuum chamber <b>10</b>. The vacuum chamber <b>10</b> may also house a high emissivity component <b>200</b>, which in this example is a cold trap, configured to liquefy any vapors that may contaminate the sample or the vacuum pump(s). In a typical microscopy system, the vacuum chamber <b>10</b> may be connected to a vacuum column comprising optics for directing and/or focusing a beam of particles that may illuminate the sample. The optics may comprise any of electromagnetic, electrostatic, magnetic, or optical lenses depending on the nature of particles comprising the beam of particles. For example, in an electron microscopy system the optics may comprise electromagnetic lenses. The particles may also comprise positively charged ions, or neutral photons.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The pressure in the vacuum chamber <b>10</b> may be less than 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>bar. The sample holder <b>100</b> may be at a temperature 0&#xb0; C. and 100&#xb0; C., preferably between 15&#xb0; C. and 50&#xb0; C., further preferably between 25&#xb0; C. and 35&#xb0; C. This may be significantly identical to the temperature inside the vacuum chamber <b>10</b>. The cold trap <b>200</b>, on the other hand, may be at a temperature between &#x2212;273&#xb0; C. and 0&#xb0; C., preferably between &#x2212;269&#xb0; C. and &#x2212;123&#xb0; C., further preferably between &#x2212;253&#xb0; C. and &#x2212;153&#xb0; C. Alternatively, the cold trap <b>200</b> may comprise a temperature higher than the sample holder <b>100</b>. Thus, there may be a temperature difference between the sample holder <b>100</b> and the cold trap <b>200</b>, leading to an exchange of heat between them. The heat exchange may be dominated by radiation owing to the low pressure in the vacuum chamber <b>10</b> and because the two may not be in contact with each other.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts the vacuum chamber <b>10</b> but with at least one detector <b>400</b> also inserted into the vacuum chamber <b>10</b>. The detector <b>400</b> may also comprise a plurality of detectors. The detector <b>400</b> may comprise any of a CCD camera, a CMOS camera, a direct electron detector, a segmented silicon drift detector, an Everhart-Thornley detector, a charged particle multiplier, or any other detectors used in microscopy systems.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">At least one of the detectors <b>400</b> may be configured to be located at a plurality of different distances from the sample holder <b>100</b>, for example at least 2 different distances. This may be of advantage in configuring the positioning of the sample with respect to the beam of particles. The detector <b>400</b> may be provided with a means for expansion and retraction in this case.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The detector <b>400</b> may have a temperature between &#x2212;273&#xb0; C. and 0&#xb0; C., preferably between &#x2212;100&#xb0; C. and 0&#xb0; C., further preferably between &#x2212;75&#xb0; C. and &#x2212;35&#xb0; C. Alternatively, the detector <b>400</b> may have a temperature higher than the sample holder <b>100</b>. Colder temperatures may help reduce dark current and improve the signal-to-noise ratio by reducing thermal noise. More particularly, the temperature of the detector <b>400</b> may be different from the temperature of the sample holder <b>100</b>, particularly the tip section <b>110</b> of the sample holder <b>100</b>. Thus, a heat flow may occur between the sample holder <b>100</b> and the detector <b>400</b>. Owing to the low pressure of the vacuum chamber <b>10</b> and a lack of contact between the detector <b>400</b> and the sample holder <b>100</b>, the heat flow may be dominated by radiation.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As described above, the detector <b>400</b> may be configured to be located at different distances from the sample holder <b>100</b>. As a result, the rate of heat flow exchange between the detector <b>400</b> and the sample holder <b>100</b> may vary. When the detector <b>400</b> is closer to the sample holder <b>100</b>, the rate of heat exchange may, for example, be larger than when the detector <b>400</b> is farther away. Similarly, owing to the variation in the distance of the detector <b>400</b> from the sample holder <b>100</b>, the rate of heat exchange between the cold trap <b>200</b> and the sample holder <b>100</b> may also vary as the detector <b>400</b> may thermally shield, at least in part, the cold trap <b>200</b> when the detector <b>400</b> is, for example, closer to the sample holder <b>100</b>. Thus, a variation in the rate of heat flow from the sample holder <b>100</b> may occur due to the variation in distance of the detector <b>400</b> from the sample holder <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">It is an aspect of the present invention to reduce the variation in the rate of heat flow from the sample holder <b>100</b> resulting from the variation in distance of the detector <b>400</b>. This may be of advantage in reducing the thermal drift of the sample holder <b>100</b> and consequently in reducing the drift of the image.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The variation in rate of heat flow from the sample holder <b>100</b> may be reduced by controlling its temperature, by using a heater for example, or by changing the geometries of any of the detector <b>400</b>, the sample holder <b>100</b>, or the cold trap <b>200</b>. Changing the geometry may comprise changing a shape, changing a surface area, or changing any of the dimensions of an object. The variation may also be reduced by changing the relative positions of the three elements described above. Embodiments of the present technology aim to reduce the variation by modifying the thermal emissivity of any of the three objects, preferably of the cold trap <b>200</b>, and by reducing the temperature variation at the sample holder <b>100</b>. These will now be described with reference to the remaining figures.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a typical sample holder <b>100</b> with its different sections.

The tip section <b>110</b> may also comprise a tilt mechanism configured to allow tilting of the sample. The rest of the sample holder <b>100</b> may comprise components configured to hold the tip section <b>110</b> and allow for controlling the tilt mechanism. More particularly, it may comprise the rod section comprising the components <b>120</b> and <b>130</b>. The component <b>130</b> may have a temperature different from that of the tip section <b>110</b>. This may lead to exchange of heat between the tip section <b>110</b> and the component <b>130</b>, that may lead to a thermal drift of the tip section <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In order to reduce the heat flow between the tip section <b>110</b> and component <b>130</b>, the component <b>120</b> of the rod section, that may be configured to lie within the vacuum chamber <b>10</b> during operation, may be fabricated with a material having a low thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity may be between 0.1 W/m/K and 100 W/m/K, for example. Additionally, the component <b>120</b> may comprise a material with a low coefficient of thermal expansion which may further reduce thermal drift of the tip section <b>110</b>.

The cold trap <b>200</b> may comprise an outer casing <b>210</b>, and in this particular embodiment, an inner coating <b>220</b>. The coating <b>220</b> may comprise a material with a high thermal emissivity so as to increase the heat flow rate between the cold trap <b>200</b> and the sample holder <b>100</b>. As a result of this increase heat flow rate, the effect of shielding of the cold trap <b>200</b> by the detector <b>400</b> when it is deployed close to the sample holder <b>100</b> is reduced. Thus, the variation in the heat flow rate from the sample holder <b>100</b> may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The coating <b>220</b> may cover between 5% and 100% of the inner surface area of the cold trap <b>200</b>.
