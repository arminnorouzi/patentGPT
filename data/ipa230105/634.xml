A typical knee prosthesis includes a tibial tray, a femoral component, and a polymer insert or bearing positioned between the tibial tray and the femoral component. Depending on the severity of the damage to the patient's joint, orthopaedic prostheses of varying mobility may be used. For example, the knee prosthesis may include a &#x201c;fixed&#x201d; tibial insert in cases wherein it is desirable to limit the movement of the knee prosthesis, such as when significant soft tissue damage or loss is present. Alternatively, the knee prosthesis may include a &#x201c;mobile&#x201d; tibial insert in cases wherein a greater degree of freedom of movement is desired. Additionally, the knee prosthesis may be a total knee prosthesis designed to replace the femoral-tibial interface of both condyles of the patient's femur or a uni-compartmental (or uni-condylar) knee prosthesis designed to replace the femoral-tibial interface of a single condyle of the patient's femur.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The type of orthopedic knee prosthesis used to replace a patient's natural knee may also depend on whether the patient's posterior cruciate ligament is retained or sacrificed (i.e., removed) during surgery. For example, if the patient's posterior cruciate ligament is damaged, diseased, and/or otherwise removed during surgery, a posterior-stabilized knee prosthesis may be used to provide additional support and/or control at later degrees of flexion. Alternatively, if the posterior cruciate ligament is intact, a cruciate-retaining knee prosthesis may be used.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One consideration of joint arthroplasty is bone growth around or near the implanted knee prosthesis. Bone tissue growth and resorption is directly related to the loading experienced by the bone tissue. This phenomenon, which is referred to as Wolfe's law, results in abnormal growth of bone tissue that experiences abnormal loading. Abnormal growth of the bone tissue may be, for example, a result of stress shielding where the bone density is considerably lower in a region adjacent to an implant. The bone density lowers due to the implant experiencing the brunt of the load in the region, i.e., the implant shields the bone from stress, resulting in reduced density. The reduced density can weaken the bone tissue in the region to a point where there is an increased risk of further dysfunction or damage, such as fracturing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One particular issue with orthopaedic implants in view of Wolfe's law is the geometric and material requirements. Orthopaedic implants, generally, comprise materials other than bone tissue, such as various metals and/or polymers. The materials may be chosen to match the material properties of native bone tissue as closely as possible, but a perfect match is difficult to achieve. Further, the shape of the implant must match the shape of the portion of bone that is resected to allow implantation. This is particularly important with regards to thicknesses of the implant in various regions, which may have a thickness that results in excessive stiffness in order to properly fill the joint space. These two issues can contribute to abnormal bone loading.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides an orthopaedic knee system including one or more components with a modified stiffness to simulate natural load distribution on bone tissue and reduce the risk of, for example, bone density loss due to stress shielding and other bone tissue abnormalities.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a tibial insert includes a medial articular surface, a lateral articular surface, and a central body formed between the medial articular surface and the lateral articular surface, wherein the central body includes a stiffness-modifying feature.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the stiffness-modifying feature may include a groove defined in the central body. Additionally, in some embodiments, a therapeutic agent disposed in the groove. The groove may be linear or curved when the tibial insert is viewed in a transverse plane. In some embodiments, the groove may extend from an anterior side of the tibial insert to a posterior side of the tibial insert. For example, the groove may extend linearly from an anterior side of the tibial insert to a posterior side of the tibial insert. Alternatively, the groove may curve from an anterior side of the tibial insert to a posterior side of the tibial insert.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the tibial insert may further includes a post extending superiorly from the central body. In such embodiments, the stiffness-modifying feature may be embodied as a first stiffness-modifying feature defined in the central body medially of the post and a second stiffness-modifying feature defined in the central body laterally of the post. In some embodiments, each of the first and second stiffness-modifying features include is a groove defined in the central body. Additionally, in some embodiments, at least one of the grooves is a linear when the tibial insert is viewed in a transverse plane. Additionally or alternatively, at least one of the grooves may be a curved when the tibial insert is viewed in a transverse plane.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the central body may include an inner wall that defines the stiffness-modifying feature. For example, the inner wall may define a groove in the central body, such as a curved or linear groove. Additionally, in some embodiments, stiffness-modifying feature may include a passageway defined in the central body. The passageway may be embodied as a blind passageway having an opening on an anterior side of the central body or a posterior side of the central body. Alternatively, the passageway extends through the central body and may include a first opening on an anterior side of the central body and a second opening on a posterior side of the central body. In some embodiments, the tibial insert may include a therapeutic agent disposed in the passageway. Additionally, in some embodiments, the tibial insert may include a groove defined on a top surface of the central body, and the groove is in fluid communication with the passageway. The groove may define a pair of tabs of the central body, which may be movable into the passageway in response to a force applied to the tabs. A therapeutic agent may be disposed in the passageway, and the tabs may cause a release of the therapeutic agent from the passageway in response to the force. Further, in some embodiments, the tibial insert may include a pair of openings defined on an anterior side of the central body. In such embodiments, each of the openings may be configured to receive a tensioner operable to move the tabs of the central body to cause the release of the therapeutic agent form the passageway.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another aspect, a tibial prosthesis for implantation into a surgically-prepared tibia of a patient may include a platform and a rail. The platform may include a top surface configured to receive a tibial insert. The rail may be coupled to a periphery of the platform. The rail may also include a stiffness-modifying feature.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the stiffness-modifying feature is a slot defined in the rail. For example, the stiffness-modifying feature may be embodied as a rail section having a height, relative to the top surface of the platform, that is less than a height of an adjacent rail section. Additionally or alternatively, the stiffness-modifying feature may include a recess defined in the top surface of the platform. In some embodiments, the tibial prosthesis may include a therapeutic agent disposed in the recess.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly to yet another aspect, a tibial prosthesis for implantation into a surgically-prepared tibia of a patient may include a platform having a bottom surface and a keel extending inferiorly from the bottom surface of the platform. The keel may include a stiffness-modifying feature. In some embodiments, the stiffness-modifying feature may be embodied as an undercut defined in the keel adjacent to the bottom surface of the platform.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a further aspect, a tibial prosthesis for implantation into a surgically-prepared tibia of a patient may include a polymer platform and a keel. The polymer platform may have a superior surface and an inferior surface opposite the superior surface, and the keel may extend from the inferior surface of the polymer platform. The polymer platform includes a plurality of stiffness-modifying features defined in the inferior surface. In some embodiments, the one or more of the plurality of stiffness-modifying features may be embodied as a slot defined in the inferior surface of the polymer platform. For example, the slot(s) may be defined in the inferior surface of the polymer platform in an anterior-posterior direction. Additionally or alternatively, the inferior surface of the polymer platform may include a porous ingrowth surface and at least two slots of the plurality of slots may intersect each other.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The detailed description particularly refers to the following figures, in which:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a superior plan view of a tibial insert including stress-modifying features defined in a top surface of a body of the tibial insert;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a superior plan view of another tibial insert including stress-modifying features defined in a top surface of a body of the tibial insert;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a superior plan view of a tibial insert, similar to the tibial insert of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, and having different stress-modifying features defined in a top surface of a body of the tibial insert;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a superior plan view of a tibial insert, similar to the tibial insert of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, and having different stress-modifying features defined in a top surface of a body of the tibial insert;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective superior view of another embodiment of a tibial insert having stress-modifying features defined therein;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is an anterior perspective view of a tibial base including a keel having stress-modifying features defined in the keel;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a bottom perspective view of the tibial base of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is an anterior perspective view of a known tibial base;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an inferior perspective view of a polymer tibial base having stress-modifying features defined on a bottom surface; and</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an inferior perspective view of another polymer tibial base having stress-modifying features defined on a bottom surface.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">While the concepts of the present disclosure are susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific exemplary embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit the concepts of the present disclosure to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Terms representing anatomical references, such as anterior, posterior, medial, lateral, superior, inferior, etcetera, may be used throughout the specification in reference to the orthopaedic implants and surgical instruments described herein as well as in reference to the patient's natural anatomy. Such terms have well-understood meanings in both the study of anatomy and the field of orthopaedics. Use of such anatomical reference terms in the written description and claims is intended to be consistent with their well-understood meanings unless noted otherwise.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, illustrative embodiments of tibial inserts <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B provided in accordance with the present disclosure are illustrated. The tibial inserts <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B may be similar in shape, with the primary difference being that the tibial insert <b>100</b>A includes a post <b>108</b>, while the tibial insert <b>100</b>B does not. As illustrated, the tibial inserts <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B are shaped for use in an orthopaedic system, which may also include a femoral component that bears on articular surfaces of the tibial inserts <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B. For example, the tibial insert <b>100</b>A includes a medial articular surface <b>102</b>, a lateral articular surface <b>104</b>, and a central body <b>106</b> defined between the medial and lateral articular surfaces <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. The post <b>108</b> extends upwardly (i.e., superiorly) from the central body <b>106</b>. Similarly, the tibial insert <b>100</b>B includes a medial articular surface <b>112</b>, a lateral articular surface <b>114</b>, and a central body <b>116</b> defined between the medial and lateral articular surfaces <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. As discussed above, the tibial insert <b>100</b>B does not include a post on the central body <b>106</b>. The shape of the tibial inserts <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B can be any suitable shape for orthopaedic applications. The tibial inserts <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B may be formed by, for example, molding from a single material, such as ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">To reduce the risk of abnormal bone loading and corresponding bone abnormalities, each of the tibial inserts <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B has been modified so the load distribution of implants including the tibial inserts <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B on surrounding bone tissue simulates natural bone loading when implanted. To do so, as shown, each of the inserts <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B has one or more stiffness-modifying features <b>120</b> defined in or on the central body <b>106</b>, <b>116</b>. In the illustrative embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the stiffness-modifying features <b>120</b> are embodied as grooves <b>122</b>, <b>132</b> formed in the central body <b>106</b>, <b>116</b> of the tibial inserts <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, respectively.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the tibial insert <b>100</b>A includes a pair of inner walls <b>124</b> that each define a corresponding groove <b>122</b>, which illustratively extends from an anterior side <b>126</b> to a posterior side <b>128</b> of the tibial insert <b>100</b>A. The grooves <b>122</b> are defined in the central body <b>106</b> of the tibial insert <b>100</b>A on either side of the post <b>108</b>. Similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the tibial insert <b>100</b>B includes a pair inner walls <b>134</b> that each define a corresponding groove <b>132</b>, which illustratively extends from an anterior side <b>136</b> to a posterior side <b>138</b> of the tibial insert <b>100</b>B. It should be appreciated that although each of the tibial inserts <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B is illustrated as including two grooves <b>122</b>, <b>132</b>, respectively, the tibial inserts <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B may include additional or fewer grooves in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The formed grooves <b>122</b>, <b>132</b> reduce the stiffness of the tibial inserts <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B adjacent to the grooves <b>122</b>, <b>132</b>, due to the lack of supporting material. As such, the inserts <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B are less stiff in regions around the grooves. While the stiffness-modifying features <b>120</b> are illustrated as grooves in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the stiffness-modifying features <b>120</b> may be embodied as other types of modifications, as will be described further herein. The depth, thickness, length, and number of the grooves <b>122</b>, <b>132</b> can be controlled or selected such that the tibial inserts <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B display a stiffness that simulates natural bone loading after implantation. That is, the stiffness of the tibial inserts <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B is reduced, relative to a typical tibial insert, such that loading from the patient's surrounding anatomy (e.g., the femur) is transferred to the underlying tibial bone, which generally promotes bone growth. A location and shape of the groove(s) <b>122</b>, <b>132</b> can be chosen such that the grooves <b>122</b>, <b>132</b> are formed in locations at which, for example, the tibial insert <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B would be overly stiff due to material thickness; the formed groove(s) <b>122</b>, <b>132</b> can reduce the stiffness of the insert <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B in the overly stiff region by removing material to reduce the risk of stress shielding and other abnormal bone loading.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the illustrative embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the groves <b>122</b>, <b>132</b> are embodied as straight or linear grooves (e.g., when the tibial inserts <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B are viewed in a transverse plane) that extend from the anterior side <b>126</b>, <b>136</b> to the posterior side <b>128</b>, <b>138</b> of the corresponding tibial insert <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B. However, in other embodiments, the stiffness-modifying features <b>120</b> may be embodied as curved or non-linear grooves, when the corresponding tibial insert is viewed in a transverse plane. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, tibial inserts <b>200</b>A, <b>200</b>B as shown and include stiffness-modifying features <b>120</b> embodied as curved or non-linear grooves <b>222</b>, <b>232</b> defined in the central body <b>106</b>, <b>116</b> of the respective tibial insert <b>200</b>A, <b>200</b>B. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the tibial insert <b>200</b>A includes a pair of inner walls <b>224</b> that define corresponding curved grooves <b>222</b> in the central body <b>106</b> such that the curved grooves <b>222</b> curve around the post <b>108</b>, which extends upwardly from the central body <b>106</b> as discussed above with regard to tibial insert <b>100</b>A. Similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the tibial insert <b>200</b>B includes a pair of inner walls <b>234</b> that define corresponding curved grooves <b>232</b> in the central body <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Similar to the grooves <b>122</b>, <b>132</b>, the curved grooves <b>222</b>, <b>232</b> are formed and located to adjust the stiffness of the tibial inserts <b>200</b>A, <b>200</b>B and bone loading characteristics following implantation. Although shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> as having a general arcuate shape, it should be appreciated that the curved grooves <b>222</b>, <b>232</b> may have complex curved shapes in other embodiments to adjust the stiffness of the corresponding tibial insert <b>200</b>A, <b>220</b>B in particular areas.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be appreciated that the stiffness-modifying features <b>120</b> may be embodied as other types of features and included in other tibial implants and/or orthopaedic prostheses. For example, in other embodiments, an illustrative tibial implant may include a tibial insert and a base. In some embodiments, the tibial insert comprises a polymer, such as UHMWPE, that is minimally porous and the base comprises a porous metal, such as titanium, or a porous polymer, such as polyether ether ketone (PEEK), that is at least 30-70% porous. Such a tibial insert may be molded onto the base so the material of the tibial insert infiltrates pores of the base portion to bond the two portions together.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Similar to the tibial inserts described above, the illustrative tibial insert may include a medial articular surface, a lateral articular surface, a central body defined between the medial and lateral articular surfaces, and a post that extends upwardly (i.e., superiorly) from the central body. The illustrative tibial implant may additionally include multiple types of stiffness-modifying features <b>120</b> formed in the tibial insert. For example, the illustrative tibial insert may include stiffness-modifying features <b>120</b> embodied as a pair of grooves defined in the central body, which may be similar to the grooves described above. Each of the grooves is defined in the central body <b>316</b> on opposing sides of the post and extend from an anterior side of the tibial insert to a posterior side of the tibial insert. In the illustrative embodiment, the grooves <b>322</b> are linear when the tibial insert is viewed in a transverse plan, but may be curved in the transverse plane in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The illustrative tibial insert also includes a stiffness-modifying feature <b>120</b> embodied as a passageway defined in the central body. Illustratively, the passageway is embodied as a blind passageway having an opening defined the anterior side of the tibial insert. However, in other embodiments, the passageway may be embodied as a full passageway having an opening on the anterior side and an opposite opening on the posterior side. Regardless, it should be appreciated that the passageway also modifies the stiffness of the tibial implant by removing material from a region where the tibial insert may be overly stiff. The shape, volume, and location of the passageway can be adjusted to provide the illustrative tibial implant with the desired stiffness.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, a therapeutic agent may be placed in one or more of the stiffness-modifying features <b>120</b> (e.g., in a groove and/or the passageway). As used herein, a &#x201c;therapeutic agent&#x201d; is a biologically active substance that may have a therapeutic effect when implanted. Exemplary therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, anti-inflammatories, antimicrobials, cells, growth factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), and analgesics. The therapeutic agent may be provided in a therapeutic agent carrier, which can act as a reservoir of the therapeutic agent. The therapeutic agent carrier may be, for example, a sponge, gel, liquid, polymer, or other type of material that holds the therapeutic agent therein for release, which may be immediate or gradual, into surrounding tissue after implantation. The therapeutic agent carrier may have any shape that can be placed in the slot and release therapeutic agent.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another illustrative embodiment, a tibial implant may include a tibial insert and a base. The illustrative tibial insert and the base may be substantially similar to the previously-described tibial insert and base. For example, the illustrative tibial insert may include a medial articular surface, a lateral articular surface, and a central body defined between the medial and lateral articular surfaces, but does not include the previously-described post. The illustrative tibial implant also includes multiple types of stiffness-modifying features <b>120</b> formed in the tibial insert. For example, the illustrative tibial implant includes stiffness-modifying features <b>120</b> embodied as a groove and a passageway defined in the central body. The groove is defined in a top surface of the central body and is in fluid communication with, or otherwise connected to, the passageway. In such embodiments, the groove and the passageway may cooperate to form tabs of the central body, which may be moved or pressed inwardly into the passageway via a force applied to the central body.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, a therapeutic agent within a therapeutic agent carrier may be placed in one or more of the stiffness-modifying features <b>120</b> (e.g., in the groove and/or the passageway). In some embodiments, the illustrative tibial insert is configured such that high loads exerted on the tibial implant cause compression of the therapeutic agent carrier located in the stiffness-modifying feature <b>120</b> (e.g., the passageway) to release the therapeutic agent into surrounding tissues. For example, compressive loads on material adjacent to the groove may force the tabs inwardly into the passageway to compress the therapeutic agent carrier and release therapeutic agent. Such a configuration may, for example, reduce pain and inflammation associated with large impacts.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, another illustrative embodiment of tibial insert <b>300</b> for a tibial implant provided in accordance with the present disclosure is illustrated. The tibial insert <b>300</b> is illustratively similar to the previously-described tibial insert. For example, the tibial insert <b>300</b> illustratively includes a medial articular surface <b>302</b>, a lateral articular surface <b>304</b>, and a central body <b>306</b> defined between the medial and lateral articular surfaces <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>. Additionally, the tibial insert <b>300</b> includes multiple types of stiffness-modifying features <b>120</b> formed in the central body <b>506</b>, including a groove <b>322</b> and a passageway <b>330</b> defined in the central body <b>306</b>. The groove <b>322</b> is defined in a top surface <b>324</b> of the central body <b>306</b> and is in fluid communication with, or otherwise connected to, the passageway <b>330</b>. The groove <b>322</b> and passageway <b>330</b> cooperate to form tabs <b>340</b> of the central body <b>306</b>, which are movable or compressible into the passageway <b>330</b> via a suitable force applied to the central body <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The tibial insert <b>300</b> may also include a therapeutic agent carrier positioned in the passageway <b>330</b> and a therapeutic agent stored in the therapeutic agent carrier. The tibial insert <b>300</b> also includes a pair of openings <b>350</b> located on an anterior side <b>352</b> of the central body <b>306</b>. Illustratively, the openings <b>350</b> are located on a respective side (e.g., a medial and lateral side) of an opening <b>332</b> of the passageway <b>330</b> defined on the anterior side <b>352</b> of the central body <b>306</b>. Each of the openings <b>350</b> may be sized to receive a tensioner, such as a suture. A suture may be passed through the openings <b>350</b> and tied to force the tabs <b>340</b> together. In other respects, the illustrative tibial insert <b>300</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be substantially similar to the previously-described tibial inserts.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The previously described tibial inserts and components can be used to form so-called &#x201c;monolithic&#x201d; implants that are formed as integral implants. In some instances, a surgeon may wish to use a so-called &#x201c;modular implant,&#x201d; which has a tibial insert and a tibial base that are mechanically or otherwise interlocked together but separable without destroying either component.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">An illustrative embodiment of a tibial base for a modular orthopaedic implant may be formed from, for example, a metal such as cobalt chrome or titanium. The overall stiffness of the illustrative tibial base is partially controlled by the material comprising the tibial base. The illustrative tibial base may also comprise additional features that affect the stiffness, including peripheral rails having a rail thickness, locking features having a locking feature thickness, a cement rail having a cement rail thickness, and a shape of a keel, a stem, and one or more fins. Each of these features may be adjusted to provide the desired stiffness of the tibial base, bearing in mind design constraints such as the overall geometry of the tibial base.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Another illustrative embodiment of a tibial base for a modular orthopaedic implant includes a platform configured for implantation into a surgically-prepared tibia of a patient. The platform includes a rail located about a periphery of the platform. The rail extends superiorly from the platform and, in some embodiments, may be configured to secure or couple with a tibial insert of the modular orthopaedic implant.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The illustrative tibial base includes stiffness-modifying features <b>120</b> embodied as slots or recesses formed in various locations to modify the overall stiffness of the tibial base so the formed implant transfers loads to the bone tissue in a manner that simulates natural bone loading. For example, the illustrative tibial base includes slots or recesses formed in the rail. Additionally, the illustrative tibial base includes slots or recesses formed in a top surface of the platform. It should be appreciated that one or more of the described slots may be shaped and sized to receive one or more therapeutic agents, which may or may not be in a therapeutic agent carrier, to elute therapeutic agent(s) following implantation.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Another illustrative embodiment of a tibial base for a modular orthopaedic implant includes a platform configured for implantation into a surgically-prepared tibia of a patient. The platform includes a rail located about a periphery of the platform. The rail extends superiorly from the platform and, in some embodiments, may be configured to secure or couple with a tibial insert of the modular orthopaedic implant.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The illustrative tibial base includes stiffness-modifying features <b>120</b> embodied as slots or recesses formed in the rail to adjust the overall stiffness characteristics of the tibial base and formed implant. In some embodiments, one or more of the slots or recesses may be embodied as a section of the rail having a reduced height relative to other sections of the rail.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In yet another illustrative embodiment of a tibial base for a modular orthopaedic implant, the illustrative tibial base may be similar to the previously-described tibial base but include fewer slots formed in a rail located on a periphery of a platform of the illustrative tibial base such that the overall stiffness of the illustrative tibial base is greater than the overall stiffness of the previously-described tibial base.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">It should be appreciated that similar tibial bases may differ in where various slots are formed in the corresponding tibial base such that the similarly shaped tibial bases have different overall stiffness characteristics. For example, an illustrative tibial base may include a platform configured for implantation into a surgically-prepared tibia of a patient. The platform includes a rail located about a periphery of the platform. The rail extends superiorly from the platform and, in some embodiments, may be configured to secure or couple with a tibial insert of the modular orthopaedic implant. The illustrative tibial base includes slots or recesses formed in the rail and located so as to adjust the overall stiffness characteristics of the illustrative tibial base and formed implant. Similarly, another tibial base may include a different number of slots formed in a rail located on a periphery of a platform of the other tibial base or formed in different locations of its rail such that the overall stiffness of the other tibial base is different from the prior tibial base.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>, another illustrative embodiment of a tibial base <b>400</b> for a modular orthopaedic implant provided according to the present disclosure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, with a known tibial base <b>410</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> for comparison. Each of the tibial bases <b>400</b>, <b>410</b> include a fin or keel <b>450</b> that extends inferiorly from a bottom surface <b>402</b>, <b>412</b> of the tibial base <b>400</b>, <b>402</b>. The tibial base <b>400</b>, unlike the tibial base <b>410</b>, has a stiffness-modifying feature <b>120</b> in the form of slots or undercuts <b>452</b> formed in the fin <b>450</b>. The slots <b>452</b> in the fin <b>450</b> can reduce the stiffness behavior of the tibial base <b>400</b>, and thus the stiffness behavior of an implant incorporating the tibial base <b>400</b>. The size, location, and number of slots formed in the fins <b>450</b> can be adjusted to adjust the overall stiffness characteristics of the tibial base <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It should be appreciated that the previously described tibial bases with stiffness-modifying features can be coupled with tibial inserts that also include stiffness-modifying features in order to control the overall stiffness characteristics of a formed implant. Therefore, the overall stiffness characteristics of implants provided according to the present disclosure can be adjusted in many different ways. Illustrative ways of adjusting the overall stiffness characteristics of a tibial base and/or tibial insert, or a monolithic implant, include but are not limited to: selection of metal material and/or treatment for one or more of the components; selection of polymer material and/or treatment for one or more of the components; additive manufacturing to add varying degrees of flexibility in the metal and/or polymer material(s); and introducing slots or other openings with varying locations, orientations, depths, and widths. By adjusting the overall stiffness characteristics of implants to more closely simulate normal bone tissue loading, the risk of abnormal bone growth can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Another embodiment of a tibial base may comprise a polymer, such as UHMWPE or PEEK, and have porous metal pads affixed to a bottom surface of the illustrative tibial base. For example, the illustrative tibial base may include multiple (e.g., four) separate porous metal pads attached to the bottom surface that each have a corresponding post. In some embodiments, the illustrative tibial base may include a keel extending inferiorly from the bottom surface. The keel may include a slot that extends superiorly, which splits the keel into two sections (e.g., medial and lateral sections). The slot may further adjust the stiffness of the tibial. Conversely, in another illustrative tibial base, the keel may be solid and not include a slot formed therein. Additionally, the other illustrative tibial base may include a single porous pad attached to the bottom surface. As such, described tibial bases may have different stiffness due to the inclusion of different stiffness-modifying features.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, another illustrative embodiment of a tibial base <b>500</b> provided according to the present disclosure is illustrated.

Additionally, the tibial base <b>500</b> may include a keel <b>550</b> extending inferiorly from the inferior surface <b>506</b> of the polymer platform <b>502</b>. To modify the stiffness of the tibial base <b>500</b>, the inferior surface <b>506</b> may have several stiffness-modifying features <b>120</b> formed therein.

The illustrative slots <b>510</b> are defined in the inferior surface <b>506</b> in an anterior-posterior direction, but may be defined in the inferior surface <b>506</b> in other directions in other embodiments. Thus, it should be appreciated that the inferior surface <b>506</b> of the tibial base <b>500</b> provided according to the present disclosure can also be modified to modify the overall stiffness characteristics of the base portion and the formed implant.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, another illustrative embodiment of a tibial base <b>600</b> provided according to the present disclosure is illustrated.
