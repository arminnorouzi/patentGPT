More particularly, systems and methods for operating snow wings of motor graders are disclosed herein such that an operator can effectively operate the motor graders.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">When operating a motor grader, an operator needs to properly position its components such as a snow wing, a moldboard, a blade, etc. It is difficult for inexperienced operators (and sometimes even experienced ones) to properly position and operate the components of the motor grader so as to effectively remove material/objects (e.g., snow) from a road surface. Multiple operating factors or parameters need to be considered and collected at the same time. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20180106014 (Horstman) discloses a control system for a work vehicle. More particularly, in paragraph [0038], Horstman's system provides its operator &#x201c;with an interface display to access and configure embedded software by which one or more control inputs may be programmed to stow only a selected subset of the work implements on the machine.&#x201d; However, Horstman fails to disclose or suggest how to properly coordinate its &#x201c;work implements&#x201d; so as to effectively operate its machine. Thus, it would be advantageous to have an improved method and system to address the foregoing needs.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present technology is directed to systems and methods for operating a machine. In some embodiments, the machine can be a motor grader or a grading machine having multiple components (e.g., a blade, a moldboard, a snow wing, etc.) coordinating with one another to perform a task (e.g., removing snow from a road surface). The present method includes (i) receiving information regarding material or an object on a surface; and (ii) determining a set of parameters for operating a grading machine. The grading machine is configured to travel on the surface and to move or remove the material or the object on the surface. The set of parameters include, for example, an articulation angle of the grading machine, a moldboard angle (or a circle angle) of the moldboard of the grading machine, and wheel lean for the front wheels of the grading machine. Examples of the articulation angle and the moldboard angle are discussed in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, and the wheel lean is discussed in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present method further includes positioning a snow wing of the grading machine based on the set of parameters such that the snow wing and the moldboard can coordinate with each other to effectively complete the task. In some embodiments, the snow wing can be in alignment with the moldboard. In some embodiments, the snow wing can be in parallel to the moldboard. In some embodiment, the snow wing can be positioned to form a specific acute angle (e.g., 10, 15, 30, etc. degrees) with the moldboard. By this arrangement, the present technology enables operators, either experienced or inexperienced, to effectively operate the grading machine.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another aspect of the present technology is to provide a machine or system that can be autonomously (or partially autonomously) and effectively operated. The machine can include, for example, a processor and a memory communicably coupled to the one processor. The memory can store computer executable instructions, when executed by the processor, to: (i) receive information regarding material on a surface where machine travels on and is configured to move/remove the material on/from the surface; (ii) determine a set of parameters for operating the grading machine, and the set of parameters include an articulation angle of the machine and a moldboard angle of a moldboard of the machine; (iii) position a snow wing of the machine based on the set of parameters such that the snow wing is in alignment with the moldboard; and (iv) operate the machine based on the set of parameters. In some embodiments, the moldboard can also be positioned, along with the snow wing, based on the set of parameters.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Non-limiting and non-exhaustive examples are described with reference to the following figures.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram (top view) illustrating a machine in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram (top view) illustrating operations of a machine in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a schematic diagram (side view) illustrating operations of a moldboard in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> are schematic diagrams (front view) illustrating operations of wheels of a machine in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a front view illustrating components of a motor grader in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a top view illustrating components/operations of a motor grader in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a front view illustrating components of a motor grader in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a top view illustrating components/operations of a motor grader in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is a front view illustrating components of a motor grader in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> is a top view illustrating components/operations of a motor grader in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is a front view illustrating operations of a snow wing of a motor grader in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> is a rear view illustrating operations of a snow wing of a motor grader in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating components in a computing device configured to interact with a machine in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating components of a machine in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flow diagram showing a method in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Various aspects of the disclosure are described more fully below with reference to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and which show specific exemplary aspects.
