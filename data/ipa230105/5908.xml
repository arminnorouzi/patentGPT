Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">One or more embodiments relate to a ternary inverter and a method of manufacturing the ternary inverter, and more particularly, to a ternary inverter having a small area and high energy efficiency and a method of manufacturing the ternary inverter.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Binary logic-based digital systems in the related art have focused on increasing bit density through miniaturization of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices to quickly process large amounts of data. However, as the CMOS devices are recently integrated to 30 nm or less, the increasing of bit density is limited by an increase in leakage current and power consumption due to a quantum tunneling effect. To overcome such a limitation of bit density, the interest in ternary logic devices and circuits, which are one of multi-valued logics, is rapidly increasing. In particular, the development of a standard ternary inverter (STI) as a basic unit for realizing ternary logic has been actively progressing. However, unlike binary inverters using two CMOSs for one voltage source, techniques in the related art that are related to an STI have problems in that more voltage sources are required, or a complex circuit configuration is required or a large area is required.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One or more embodiments include a ternary inverter having a small area and high energy efficiency and a method of manufacturing the ternary inverter.

The substrate <b>100</b> may be a semiconductor substrate. For example, the substrate <b>100</b> may include silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), silicon-germanium (SiGe), indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs), or indium arsenide (InAs). However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto, and the substrate <b>100</b> may include various other semiconductor materials. The substrate <b>100</b> may have a first conductivity type. The first conductivity type may be an n-type or a p-type. When the conductivity type of the substrate <b>100</b> is n-type, the substrate <b>100</b> may include a Group V element (e.g., phosphorus (P) or arsenic (As)) as an impurity.

The constant current forming layer <b>200</b> may be an epitaxial layer formed in an epitaxial growth operation. The constant current forming layer <b>200</b> may include S<b>1</b>. The constant current forming layer <b>200</b> may have the first conductivity type. Men the conductivity type of the constant current forming layer <b>200</b> is n-type, the constant current forming layer <b>200</b> may include a Group V element (e.g., P or As) as an impurity. When the conductivity type of the constant current forming layer <b>200</b> is p-type, the constant current forming layer <b>200</b> may include a Group III element (e.g., B or In) as an impurity. A doping concentration of the constant current forming layer <b>200</b> may be greater than a doping concentration of the substrate <b>100</b>.

The first source S<b>1</b> and the first drain D<b>1</b> may each include a doped semiconductor material.

The second drain D<b>2</b> may be doped with a conductivity type different from that of the first drain D<b>1</b> to have a different conductivity type from that of the first drain D<b>1</b>. For example, the second source S<b>2</b> may have the second conductivity type, and the second drain D<b>2</b> may have the first conductivity type.
