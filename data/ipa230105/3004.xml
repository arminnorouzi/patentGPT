However, a person having ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that the teachings herein can be applied in a multitude of different ways. The described implementations can be implemented in any device, system or network that is capable of transmitting and receiving radio frequency (RF) signals according to one or more of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 standards, the IEEE 802.15 standards, the Bluetooth&#xae; standards as defined by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), or the Long Term Evolution (LTE), 3G, 4G or 5G (New Radio (NR)) standards promulgated by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), among others. The described implementations can be implemented in any device, system or network that is capable of transmitting and receiving RF signals according to one or more of the following technologies or techniques: code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA), single-user (SU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and multi-user (MU) MIMO. The described implementations also can be implemented using other wireless communication protocols or RF signals suitable for use in one or more of a wireless personal area network (WPAN), a wireless local area network (WLAN), a wireless wide area network (WWAN), or an internet of things (IOT) network.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Various implementations relate generally to coordinated transmit power control for sharing time and frequency resources of a wireless medium. Particular implementations relate more specifically to coordinated AP (CAP) spatial-reuse-multiple-access (SRMA) techniques for sharing the time and frequency resources of a transmission opportunity (TXOP). According to such techniques, an AP that wins contention and gains access to the wireless medium for the duration of a TXOP (referred to as the TXOP owner) may limit the transmit powers of the APs selected to share the time and frequency resources such that interference from the selected APs does not prevent STAs associated with the TXOP owner from successfully decoding packets transmitted by the TXOP owner.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Particular implementations of the subject matter described in this disclosure can be implemented to realize one or more of the following potential advantages. In some implementations, the described techniques can be used to reduce latency because the TXOP owner may share a TXOP with other APs, and as such, the other APs may not need to wait to win contention for a TXOP to be able to transmit and receive data according to conventional CSMA/CA or EDCA techniques. Additionally or alternatively, some implementations can achieve improvements in throughput fairness. Various implementations may achieve these and other advantages without requiring that the TXOP owner or the other APs selected to participate in the TXOP be aware of the STAs associated with other BSSs (OBSSs), without requiring a preassigned or dedicated master AP or preassigned groups of APs, and without requiring backhaul coordination between the APs participating in the TXOP.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a block diagram of an example wireless communication network <b>100</b>. According to some aspects, the wireless communication network <b>100</b> can be an example of a wireless local area network (WLAN) such as a Wi-Fi network (and will hereinafter be referred to as WLAN <b>100</b>). For example, the WLAN <b>100</b> can be a network implementing at least one of the IEEE 802.11 family of wireless communication protocol standards (such as that defined by the IEEE 802.11-2016 specification or amendments thereof including, but not limited to, 802.11ay, 802.11ax, 802.11az, 802.11ba and 802.11be). The WLAN <b>100</b> may include numerous wireless communication devices such as an access point (AP) <b>102</b> and multiple stations (STAs) <b>104</b>.

For example, the beacons can include an identification of a primary channel used by the respective AP <b>102</b> as well as a timing synchronization function for establishing or maintaining timing synchronization with the AP <b>102</b>.

To perform passive scanning, a STA <b>104</b> listens for beacons, which are transmitted by respective APs <b>102</b> at a periodic time interval referred to as the target beacon transmission time (TBTT) (measured in time units (TUs) where one TU may be equal to 1024 microseconds (&#x3bc;s)). To perform active scanning, a STA <b>104</b> generates and sequentially transmits probe requests on each channel to be scanned and listens for probe responses from APs <b>102</b>. Each STA <b>104</b> may be configured to identify or select an AP <b>102</b> with which to associate based on the scanning information obtained through the passive or active scans, and to perform authentication and association operations to establish a communication link <b>108</b> with the selected AP <b>102</b>. The AP <b>102</b> assigns an association identifier (AID) to the STA <b>104</b> at the culmination of the association operations, which the AP <b>102</b> uses to track the STA <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As a result of the increasing ubiquity of wireless networks, a STA <b>104</b> may have the opportunity to select one of many BSSs within range of the STA or to select among multiple APs <b>102</b> that together form an extended service set (ESS) including multiple connected BSSs. An extended network station associated with the WLAN <b>100</b> may be connected to a wired or wireless distribution system that may allow multiple APs <b>102</b> to be connected in such an ESS. As such, a STA <b>104</b> can be covered by more than one AP <b>102</b> and can associate with different APs <b>102</b> at different times for different transmissions. Additionally, after association with an AP <b>102</b>, a STA <b>104</b> also may be configured to periodically scan its surroundings to find a more suitable AP <b>102</b> with which to associate. For example, a STA <b>104</b> that is moving relative to its associated AP <b>102</b> may perform a &#x201c;roaming&#x201d; scan to find another AP <b>102</b> having more desirable network characteristics such as a greater received signal strength indicator (RSSI) or a reduced traffic load.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some cases, STAs <b>104</b> may form networks without APs <b>102</b> or other equipment other than the STAs <b>104</b> themselves. One example of such a network is an ad hoc network (or wireless ad hoc network). Ad hoc networks may alternatively be referred to as mesh networks or peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. In some cases, ad hoc networks may be implemented within a larger wireless network such as the WLAN <b>100</b>. In such implementations, while the STAs <b>104</b> may be capable of communicating with each other through the AP <b>102</b> using communication links <b>108</b>, STAs <b>104</b> also can communicate directly with each other via direct wireless links <b>110</b>. Additionally, two STAs <b>104</b> may communicate via a direct communication link <b>110</b> regardless of whether both STAs <b>104</b> are associated with and served by the same AP <b>102</b>. In such an ad hoc system, one or more of the STAs <b>104</b> may assume the role filled by the AP <b>102</b> in a BSS. Such a STA <b>104</b> may be referred to as a group owner (GO) and may coordinate transmissions within the ad hoc network. Examples of direct wireless links <b>110</b> include Wi-Fi Direct connections, connections established by using a Wi-Fi Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS) link, and other P2P group connections.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The APs <b>102</b> and STAs <b>104</b> may function and communicate (via the respective communication links <b>108</b>) according to the IEEE 802.11 family of wireless communication protocol standards (such as that defined by the IEEE 802.11-2016 specification or amendments thereof including, but not limited to, 802.11ay, 802.11ax, 802.11az, 802.11ba and 802.11be). These standards define the WLAN radio and baseband protocols for the PHY and medium access control (MAC) layers. The APs <b>102</b> and STAs <b>104</b> transmit and receive wireless communications (hereinafter also referred to as &#x201c;Wi-Fi communications&#x201d;) to and from one another in the form of PHY protocol data units (PPDUs) (or physical layer convergence protocol (PLCP) PDUs). The APs <b>102</b> and STAs <b>104</b> in the WLAN <b>100</b> may transmit PPDUs over an unlicensed spectrum, which may be a portion of spectrum that includes frequency bands traditionally used by Wi-Fi technology, such as the 2.4 GHz band, the 5 GHz band, the 60 GHz band, the 3.6 GHz band, and the 900 MHz band. Some implementations of the APs <b>102</b> and STAs <b>104</b> described herein also may communicate in other frequency bands, such as the 6 GHz band, which may support both licensed and unlicensed communications. The APs <b>102</b> and STAs <b>104</b> also can be configured to communicate over other frequency bands such as shared licensed frequency bands, where multiple operators may have a license to operate in the same or overlapping frequency band or bands.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Each of the frequency bands may include multiple sub-bands or frequency channels. For example, PPDUs conforming to the IEEE 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax and 802.11be standard amendments may be transmitted over the 2.4, 5 GHz or 6 GHz bands, each of which is divided into multiple 20 MHz channels. As such, these PPDUs are transmitted over a physical channel having a minimum bandwidth of 20 MHz, but larger channels can be formed through channel bonding. For example, PPDUs may be transmitted over physical channels having bandwidths of 40 MHz, 80 MHz, 160 or 320 MHz by bonding together multiple 20 MHz channels.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each PPDU is a composite structure that includes a PHY preamble and a payload in the form of a PHY service data unit (PSDU). The information provided in the preamble may be used by a receiving device to decode the subsequent data in the PSDU. In instances in which PPDUs are transmitted over a bonded channel, the preamble fields may be duplicated and transmitted in each of the multiple component channels. The PHY preamble may include both a legacy portion (or &#x201c;legacy preamble&#x201d;) and a non-legacy portion (or &#x201c;non-legacy preamble&#x201d;). The legacy preamble may be used for packet detection, automatic gain control and channel estimation, among other uses. The legacy preamble also may generally be used to maintain compatibility with legacy devices. The format of, coding of, and information provided in the non-legacy portion of the preamble is based on the particular IEEE 802.11 protocol to be used to transmit the payload.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows an example protocol data unit (PDU) <b>200</b> usable for wireless communication between an AP and a number of STAs.

With a DCF, there is generally no centralized master device allocating time and frequency resources of the shared wireless medium. On the contrary, before a wireless communication device, such as an AP <b>102</b> or a STA <b>104</b>, is permitted to transmit data, it must wait for a particular time and then contend for access to the wireless medium. In some implementations, the wireless communication device may be configured to implement the DCF through the use of carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) with collision avoidance (CA) (CSMA/CA) techniques and timing intervals. Before transmitting data, the wireless communication device may perform a clear channel assessment (CCA) and determine that the appropriate wireless channel is idle. The CCA includes both physical (PHY-level) carrier sensing and virtual (MAC-level) carrier sensing. Physical carrier sensing is accomplished via a measurement of the received signal strength of a valid frame, which is then compared to a threshold to determine whether the channel is busy. For example, if the received signal strength of a detected preamble is above a threshold, the medium is considered busy. Physical carrier sensing also includes energy detection. Energy detection involves measuring the total energy the wireless communication device receives regardless of whether the received signal represents a valid frame. If the total energy detected is above a threshold, the medium is considered busy. Virtual carrier sensing is accomplished via the use of a network allocation vector (NAV), an indicator of a time when the medium may next become idle. The NAV is reset each time a valid frame is received that is not addressed to the wireless communication device. The NAV effectively serves as a time duration that must elapse before the wireless communication device may contend for access even in the absence of a detected symbol or even if the detected energy is below the relevant threshold.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As described above, the DCF is implemented through the use of time intervals. These time intervals include the slot time (or &#x201c;slot interval&#x201d;) and the inter-frame space (IFS). The slot time is the basic unit of timing and may be determined based on one or more of a transmit-receive turnaround time, a channel sensing time, a propagation delay and a MAC processing time. Measurements for channel sensing are performed for each slot. All transmissions may begin at slot boundaries. Different varieties of IFS exist including the short IFS (SIFS), the distributed IFS (DIFS), the extended IFS (EIFS), and the arbitration IFS (AIFS). For example, the DIFS may be defined as the sum of the SIFS and two times the slot time. The values for the slot time and IFS may be provided by a suitable standard specification, such as one of the IEEE 802.11 family of wireless communication protocol standards (such as that defined by the IEEE 802.11-2016 specification or amendments thereof including, but not limited to, 802.1lay, 802.11ax, 802.11az, 802.11ba and 802.11be).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the NAV reaches 0, the wireless communication device performs the physical carrier sensing. If the channel remains idle for the appropriate IFS (for example, the DIFS), the wireless communication device initiates a backoff timer, which represents a duration of time that the device must sense the medium to be idle before it is permitted to transmit. The backoff timer is decremented by one slot each time the medium is sensed to be idle during a corresponding slot interval. If the channel remains idle until the backoff timer expires, the wireless communication device becomes the holder (or &#x201c;owner&#x201d;) of a transmit opportunity (TXOP) and may begin transmitting. The TXOP is the duration of time the wireless communication device can transmit frames over the channel after it has won contention for the wireless medium. If, on the other hand, one or more of the carrier sense mechanisms indicate that the channel is busy, a MAC controller within the wireless communication device will not permit transmission.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Each time the wireless communication devices generates a new PPDU for transmission in a new TXOP, it randomly selects a new backoff timer duration. The available distribution of the numbers that may be randomly selected for the backoff timer is referred to as the contention window (CW). If, when the backoff timer expires, the wireless communication device transmits the PPDU, but the medium is still busy, there may be a collision. Additionally, if there is otherwise too much energy on the wireless channel resulting in a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the communication may be corrupted or otherwise not successfully received. In such instances, the wireless communication device may not receive a communication acknowledging the transmitted PDU within a timeout interval. The MAC may then increase the CW exponentially, for example, doubling it, and randomly select a new backoff timer duration from the CW before each attempted retransmission of the PPDU. Before each attempted retransmission, the wireless communication device may wait a duration of DIFS and, if the medium remains idle, then proceed to initiate the new backoff timer. There are different CW and TXOP durations for each of the four access categories (ACs): voice (AC_VO), video (AC_VI), background (AC_BK), and best effort (AC_BE). This enables particular types of traffic to be prioritized in the network.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As described above, APs <b>102</b> and STAs <b>104</b> can support multi-user (MU) communications; that is, concurrent transmissions from one device to each of multiple devices (for example, multiple simultaneous downlink (DL) communications from an AP <b>102</b> to corresponding STAs <b>104</b>), or concurrent transmissions from multiple devices to a single device (for example, multiple simultaneous uplink (UL) transmissions from corresponding STAs <b>104</b> to an AP <b>102</b>). To support the MU transmissions, the APs <b>102</b> and STAs <b>104</b> may utilize multi-user multiple-input, multiple-output (MU-MIMO) and multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiple access (MU-OFDMA) techniques.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In MU-OFDMA schemes, the available frequency spectrum of the wireless channel may be divided into multiple resource units (RUs) each including multiple frequency subcarriers (also referred to as &#x201c;tones&#x201d;). Different RUs may be allocated or assigned by an AP <b>102</b> to different STAs <b>104</b> at particular times. The sizes and distributions of the RUs may be referred to as an RU allocation. In some implementations, RUs may be allocated in 2 MHz intervals, and as such, the smallest RU may include 26 tones consisting of 24 data tones and 2 pilot tones. Consequently, in a 20 MHz channel, up to 9 RUs (such as 2 MHz, 26-tone RUs) may be allocated (because some tones are reserved for other purposes). Similarly, in a 160 MHz channel, up to 74 RUs may be allocated. Larger 52 tone, 106 tone, 242 tone, 484 tone and 996 tone RUs may also be allocated. Adjacent RUs may be separated by a null subcarrier (such as a DC subcarrier), for example, to reduce interference between adjacent RUs, to reduce receiver DC offset, and to avoid transmit center frequency leakage.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">For UL MU transmissions, an AP <b>102</b> can transmit a trigger frame to initiate and synchronize an UL MU-OFDMA or UL MU-MIMO transmission from multiple STAs <b>104</b> to the AP <b>102</b>.

To support the MU transmissions, the APs <b>102</b> and STAs <b>104</b> may utilize multi-user multiple-input, multiple-output (MU-MIMO) and multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiple access (MU-OFDMA) techniques.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In MU-OFDMA schemes, the available frequency spectrum of the wireless channel may be divided into multiple resource units (RUs) each including a number of different frequency subcarriers (&#x201c;tones&#x201d;). Different RUs may be allocated or assigned by an AP <b>102</b> to different STAs <b>104</b> at particular times. The sizes and distributions of the RUs may be referred to as an RU allocation. In some implementations, RUs may be allocated in 2 MHz intervals, and as such, the smallest RU may include 26 tones consisting of 24 data tones and 2 pilot tones. Consequently, in a 20 MHz channel, up to 9 RUs (such as 2 MHz, 26-tone RUs) may be allocated (because some tones are reserved for other purposes). Similarly, in a 160 MHz channel, up to 74 RUs may be allocated. Larger 52 tone, 106 tone, 242 tone, 484 tone and 996 tone RUs may also be allocated. Adjacent RUs may be separated by a null subcarrier (such as a DC subcarrier), for example, to reduce interference between adjacent RUs, to reduce receiver DC offset, and to avoid transmit center frequency leakage.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For UL MU transmissions, an AP <b>102</b> can transmit a trigger frame to initiate and synchronize an UL MU-OFDMA or UL MU-MIMO transmission from multiple STAs <b>104</b> to the AP <b>102</b>. Such trigger frames may thus enable multiple STAs <b>104</b> to send UL traffic to the AP <b>102</b> concurrently in time. A trigger frame may address one or more STAs <b>104</b> through respective association identifiers (AIDs), and may assign each AID (and thus each STA <b>104</b>) one or more RUs that can be used to send UL traffic to the AP <b>102</b>. The AP also may designate one or more random access (RA) RUs that unscheduled STAs <b>104</b> may contend for.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Access to the shared wireless medium is generally governed by a distributed coordination function (DCF). With a DCF, there is generally no centralized master device allocating time and frequency resources of the shared wireless medium. On the contrary, before a wireless communication device, such as an AP <b>102</b> or a STA <b>104</b>, is permitted to transmit data, it must wait for a particular time and then contend for access to the wireless medium. In some implementations, the wireless communication device may be configured to implement the DCF through the use of carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) with collision avoidance (CA) (CSMA/CA) techniques and timing intervals. Before transmitting data, the wireless communication device may perform a clear channel assessment (CCA) and determine that the appropriate wireless channel is idle. The CCA may include both physical (PHY-level) carrier sensing and virtual (MAC-level) carrier sensing. Physical carrier sensing is accomplished via a measurement of the received signal strength of a valid frame, which is then compared to a threshold to determine whether the channel is busy. For example, if the received signal strength of a detected preamble is above a threshold, the medium is considered busy. Physical carrier sensing also includes energy detection. Energy detection involves measuring the total energy the wireless communication device receives regardless of whether the received signal represents a valid frame. If the total energy detected is above a threshold, the medium is considered busy. Virtual carrier sensing is accomplished via the use of a network allocation vector (NAV), an indicator of a time when the medium may next become idle. The NAV is reset each time a valid frame is received that is not addressed to the wireless communication device. The NAV effectively serves as a time duration that must elapse before the wireless communication device may contend for access even in the absence of a detected symbol or even if the detected energy is below the relevant threshold.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As described above, the DCF is implemented through the use of time intervals. These time intervals include the slot time (or &#x201c;slot interval&#x201d;) and the inter-frame space (IFS). The slot time is the basic unit of timing and may be determined based on one or more of a transmit-receive turnaround time, a channel sensing time, a propagation delay and a MAC processing time. Measurements for channel sensing are performed for each slot. All transmissions may begin at slot boundaries. Different varieties of IFS exist including the short IFS (SIFS), the distributed IFS (DIFS), the extended IFS (EIFS), and the arbitration IFS (AIFS). For example, the DIFS may be defined as the sum of the SIFS and two times the slot time. The values for the slot time and IFS may be provided by a suitable standard specification, such as one of the IEEE 802.11 family of wireless communication protocol standards (such as that defined by the IEEE 802.11-2016 specification or amendments thereof including, but not limited to, 802.11ah, 802.11ad, 802.11ay, 802.11ax, 802.11az, 802.11ba and 802.11be).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">When the NAV reaches 0, the wireless communication device performs the physical carrier sensing. If the channel remains idle for the appropriate IFS (for example, the DIFS), the wireless communication device initiates a backoff timer, which represents a duration of time that the device must sense the medium to be idle before it is permitted to transmit. The backoff timer is decremented by one slot each time the medium is sensed to be idle during a corresponding slot interval. If the channel remains idle until the backoff timer expires, the wireless communication device becomes the holder (or &#x201c;owner&#x201d;) of a transmit opportunity (TXOP) and may begin transmitting. The TXOP is the duration of time the wireless communication device can transmit frames over the channel after it has won contention for the wireless medium. If, on the other hand, one or more of the carrier sense mechanisms indicate that the channel is busy, a MAC controller within the wireless communication device will not permit transmission.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Some APs and STAs may be configured to implement spatial reuse techniques. For example, APs and STAs configured for communications using IEEE 802.11ax or 802.11be may be configured with a BSS color. APs associated with different BSSs may be associated with different BSS colors. If an AP or a STA detects a wireless packet from another wireless communication device while contending for access, the AP or STA may apply different contention parameters based on whether the wireless packet is transmitted by, or transmitted to, another wireless communication device within its BSS or from a wireless communication device from an overlapping BSS (OBSS), as determined by a BSS color indication in a preamble of the wireless packet. For example, if the BSS color associated with the wireless packet is the same as the BSS color of the AP or STA, the AP or STA may use a first received signal strength indication (RSSI) detection threshold when performing a CCA on the wireless channel. However, if the BSS color associated with the wireless packet is different than the BSS color of the AP or STA, the AP or STA may use a second RSSI detection threshold in lieu of using the first RSSI detection threshold when performing the CCA on the wireless channel, the second RSSI detection threshold being greater than the first RSSI detection threshold. In this way, the requirements for winning contention are relaxed when interfering transmissions are associated with an OBSS.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a block diagram of an example wireless communication device <b>400</b>.

In addition to a modulator and a demodulator, the modem <b>402</b> may further include digital signal processing (DSP) circuitry, automatic gain control (AGC) circuitry, a coder, a decoder, a multiplexer and a demultiplexer. For example, while in a transmission mode, data obtained from the processor <b>404</b> may be provided to an encoder, which encodes the data to provide coded bits. The coded bits may then be mapped to a number N<sub>SS </sub>of spatial streams for spatial multiplexing or a number N<sub>STS </sub>of space-time streams for space-time block coding (STBC). The coded bits in the streams may then be mapped to points in a modulation constellation (using a selected MCS) to provide modulated symbols. The modulated symbols in the respective spatial or space-time streams may be multiplexed, transformed via an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) block, and subsequently provided to the DSP circuitry (for example, for Tx windowing and filtering). The digital signals may then be provided to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The resultant analog signals may then be provided to a frequency upconverter, and ultimately, the radio <b>406</b>.

The output of the DSP circuitry may then be fed to the AGC, which is configured to use information extracted from the digital signals, for example, in one or more received training fields, to determine an appropriate gain. The output of the DSP circuitry also is coupled with a demultiplexer that demultiplexes the modulated symbols when multiple spatial streams or space-time streams are received. The demultiplexed symbols may be provided to a demodulator, which is configured to extract the symbols from the signal and, for example, compute the logarithm likelihood ratios (LLRs) for each bit position of each subcarrier in each spatial stream. The demodulator is coupled with the decoder, which may be configured to process the LLRs to provide decoded bits.
