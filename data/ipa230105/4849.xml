These zero-energy edge modes are their own anti-particles and possess non-Abelian exchange statistics, and thus provide an attractive platform for implementing quantum computing devices that support qubit operations. Majorana zero-modes were first predicated and observed at the ends of one-dimensional (1D) semiconducting nanowires with induced Zeeman spin splitting.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Alternatively, 1D topological superconductivity may also be achieved with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) instead of nanowires. Carbon nanotubes are small diameter cylinder-like allotropes of graphene (having diameter d of the order of 1 nm), with exceptional electronic band structures and transport properties. As opposed to nanowires, carbon nanotubes have a true 1D topology because d is extremely small. Moreover, since the nanotubes are constructed solely of carbon atoms, they have highly reproducible and uniform quantum properties.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">These characteristics have made carbon nanotubes a preferred platform for 1D Majorana fermions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> conceptually illustrates a configuration for a typical prior art nanotube device <b>100</b>, which is based on the same arrangement originally used to realize Majorana fermion quasi-particles in semiconducting nanowires&#x2014;namely, an inert supporting structure <b>101</b>, on which is mounted a thin s-wave superconductor <b>102</b>, proximate to which is located a carbon nanotube <b>103</b>. A magnet <b>120</b> provides a transverse Zeeman magnetic field <b>121</b> (Bx). Reference axes <b>10</b> indicate that the longitudinal symmetry axis of nanotube <b>103</b> is in the z-direction, whereas the magnetic flux of transverse Zeeman magnetic field <b>121</b> (Bx) is in the x-direction. In order to attain proper Zeeman splitting, magnetic field <b>121</b> needs to be very strong, of the order 10 T, because of the low electron g-factor of carbon nanotube <b>103</b>. The high strength of Zeeman magnetic field <b>121</b> poses practical challenges: first of all, high magnetic fields are not easily produced; secondly, a strong magnetic field tends to critically suppress superconductivity in substrate <b>102</b>.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The presently disclosed subject matter provides a quantum computing device having topological Majorana zero-modes without the need for Zeeman splitting, thereby obviating the strong transverse magnetic field necessary to attain Zeeman splitting.
