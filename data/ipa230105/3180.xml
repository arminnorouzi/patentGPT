Snowmobiles and other recreational vehicles often have an integrated mesh covering the air intake to allow entry of air while impeding passage of debris into the internal air passages.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Often, the mesh is molded into the plastic of the component at a certain distance from an upper most surface surrounding the mesh to ensure that the mesh is securely embedded in the molded components, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The mesh <b>12</b> is embedded in the component <b>10</b>, with a lip <b>15</b> formed around the edge of the mesh <b>12</b>. While the mesh <b>12</b> is held securely in place and should not easily rip away from the plastic, the lip <b>15</b> surrounding the mesh <b>12</b> prevents a user from easily wiping away debris or snow accumulated on the surface of the mesh <b>12</b>. Small particles of debris or ice could become lodged along the edge of the mesh <b>12</b> and against the lip <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there is a desire for a vehicle or plastic components with an improved mesh arrangement.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the present technology to ameliorate at least some of the inconveniences present in the prior art.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one aspect of the present technology, there is provided a vehicle component having at least one aperture and a mesh molded over the aperture on a top surface of the component. In the prior art, such as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, edges of the mesh are molded below the top surface creating an edge or lip around the mesh. In contrast, according to non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, the component includes a textured surface surrounding the aperture, onto which the mesh is molded. Using a rough, irregular surface texture, a portion of the component material crosses the mesh, affixing the mesh to the surface. This also creates a generally flat surface profile from the mesh to the surrounding components surfaces, eliminating the lip surrounding the mesh. The irregularity of the surface profile surrounding the aperture also aids in camouflaging the edge of the mesh on the component surface.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another aspect of the present technology, there is provided a method for molding plastic articles with a mesh disposed over an aperture. In the prior art, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a mesh <b>12</b> would be disposed in a mold <b>30</b> having a cavity <b>36</b> for receiving material on either side of the edges of the mesh <b>12</b>, producing the lip or edge <b>15</b> surrounding the aperture of the final molded product. In such an arrangement, additional structures or procedures (not illustrated) are generally required to maintain the edges of the mesh <b>12</b> in the correct position. In contrast, according to non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, a mesh is disposed onto a mold cavity surface in the mold configured to produce a textured exterior surface on the component.

The following description relates to one example of a molded component, notably an air intake <b>100</b> for a snowmobile engine <b>99</b> as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that there are other known types of vehicle components with mesh covered apertures incorporating different designs and that at least some aspects of the present technology could apply.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The component <b>100</b> formed from a molded component body <b>105</b>. The body <b>105</b> is made from polypropylene with 10% fiber composition, but could be formed from different materials, including but not limited to any applicable injection molding material, including for example Nylon.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The component body <b>105</b> defines apertures <b>110</b> for allowing air passage through the air intake component <b>100</b> to the engine <b>99</b>. For the two components <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a left component <b>100</b> defines three apertures <b>110</b> and a right component <b>100</b> defines two apertures <b>110</b>. Depending on the particular embodiment, the component body <b>105</b> could define fewer or more apertures <b>110</b>, including only one aperture <b>110</b> in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The component <b>100</b> also includes a mesh <b>120</b> extending over each aperture <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, it is also contemplated that one mesh <b>120</b> could extend over multiple apertures <b>110</b>. For the current embodiment of the component <b>100</b> as an air intake <b>100</b>, the mesh <b>120</b> covering the apertures <b>110</b> is a hydrophobic mesh <b>120</b>. In the present example embodiment, the mesh <b>120</b> is specifically a SEFAR NITEX&#xae; mono-filament PA 6.6 (polyamide/nylon) open mesh, with 125 &#x3bc;m mesh openings. Depending on the particular embodiment of the vehicle component <b>100</b> and the desired usage (for example, environmental conditions), different types of mesh material could be used for the mesh <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The component body <b>105</b> includes an outer textured surface <b>130</b> surrounding each aperture <b>110</b> on an exterior side of the component body <b>105</b>. As will be described in more detail below, the textured surface <b>130</b> is created by mold cavities when injection molding the component <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As is illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a surface finish of the outer textured surface <b>130</b> is an irregular, bumpy surface finish. The surface finish of the textured surface <b>130</b> thus has a rough, dull appearance. In the present embodiment, the surface finish is specifically a BM-42105 surface finish, as defined by Brasmold (texturing company, St-Jean-Sur-Richelieu, Canada). Remaining exterior portions of the component body <b>105</b> include surface portions having a glossy surface finish, although it is contemplated that some or all of the remaining portions may have different surface finishes.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, a portion of the mesh <b>120</b> is molded into at least a portion of the component body <b>105</b> surrounding the aperture <b>110</b>, specifically to the textured surface <b>130</b>. Surrounding the aperture <b>110</b>, an outer surface <b>123</b> of the portion of the mesh <b>120</b> abuts the outer textured surface <b>130</b> surrounding the aperture. The inner surface of the portion of the mesh <b>120</b> disposed on the textures surface <b>130</b> thus abuts an inner limit of the outer textured surface <b>130</b> surrounding the aperture <b>110</b>. It is contemplated that the mesh <b>120</b> could be aligned with the inner limit of the textured surface <b>130</b>, an outer limit of the textured surface <b>130</b>, or at some point in between. For example, depending on factors including, but not limited to, the choice of mesh material and an exact form of the textured surface <b>130</b>, some portions of the mesh <b>120</b> could be forced into upper portions of the textured surface <b>130</b> during fabrication of the component <b>100</b>. The surface finish of the outer textured surface <b>130</b> is configured to camouflage an edge <b>122</b> of the mesh <b>120</b> embedded in the outer textured surface <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Some of an outer surface <b>123</b> of the mesh <b>120</b> is exposed in the outer textured surface <b>130</b> surrounding the aperture <b>110</b>, such as the schematically illustrated lower portions <b>132</b> of the textured surface <b>130</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. The extent to which the outer surface <b>123</b> of the mesh <b>120</b> is exposed in the textured surface <b>130</b> could depend on various factors, including for example effects on the mesh <b>120</b> during fabrication as mentioned above. At only some points in the textured surface <b>130</b> does material forming the surface <b>130</b> protrude through the mesh <b>120</b>, thereby securing the mesh <b>120</b> in place on the exterior surface of the body <b>105</b>. With the current embodiment of composition of the component body <b>105</b> and the surface texture <b>130</b>, the overlapping textures of the surface <b>130</b> and the mesh <b>120</b> are sufficient to maintain the mesh <b>120</b> in place on the component body <b>105</b> and provide sufficient cover to camouflage the outer edge <b>122</b> of the mesh <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As can further be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the outer surface <b>123</b> of the mesh <b>120</b> is generally laterally aligned with the outer textured surface <b>130</b> surrounding the aperture <b>110</b>. In contrast to the prior art component <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> where the mesh <b>12</b> is sandwiched between relatively thick portions of the component body, according to the present technology the mesh <b>120</b> is molded to the exterior surface of the component body <b>105</b> such that only a negligible lip of the texture surface <b>130</b> is formed around the aperture <b>110</b> and the mesh <b>120</b>. For a user wiping away debris and/or snow, for example, from the mesh <b>120</b>, there is no edge preventing the debris and/or snow from being cleared away from the mesh <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, a method <b>300</b> for molding a plastic item, specifically the components <b>100</b>, according to non-limiting embodiments of the present technology is illustrated.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The method <b>300</b> begins, at step <b>310</b>, with disposing the mesh <b>120</b> in a mold <b>205</b> shaped for forming the component <b>100</b>. The mold <b>205</b> in the present non-limiting example includes a mold cavity <b>210</b> and a mold core <b>220</b>. The mold cavity <b>210</b> includes a surface-defining portion <b>215</b> having a textured surface, which creates the textured surface portion <b>130</b> on the finished molded component <b>100</b>. The mold <b>205</b> also includes an aperture defining portion <b>212</b> for forming the aperture <b>110</b>. The surface-defining portion <b>215</b> surrounds the aperture defining portion <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">When placing the mesh <b>120</b> in the mold <b>205</b>, the mesh <b>120</b> is disposed over the aperture defining portion <b>212</b> and the edge portions <b>122</b> of the mesh <b>120</b> are disposed on surface-defining portion <b>215</b>. In contrast to prior art mold <b>30</b>, no additional spacers or supports are generally required to maintain placement of the edges <b>122</b> of the mesh <b>120</b>, as the edges <b>122</b> abut directly the surface-defining portion <b>215</b>. In at least some embodiments, the mold core <b>220</b> could define the surface-defining portion <b>215</b> and the mesh <b>120</b> could be placed on the mold core <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The method <b>300</b> continues, at step <b>320</b>, with filling the mold <b>205</b> with plastic, the mesh <b>120</b> being molded to the textured surface <b>130</b> of the component <b>100</b> formed by the surface-defining portion <b>215</b> of the mold <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In at least some embodiments, filling the mold <b>205</b> with plastic includes injecting the plastic to perform injection molding. In at the present embodiment, injecting the plastic includes injection a polypropylene and 10% fiber mix. It is contemplated that different materials could be injected depending on the specific embodiment of the component <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, some portions of the mesh <b>120</b> could be forced into crevices in the surface-defining portion <b>215</b> by the injection of plastic into the mold <b>205</b>. In some such cases, some of the mesh <b>120</b> could have an exposed upper surface in the textured surface <b>130</b> and/or some portions of the mesh <b>120</b> could take on the shape of the surface-defining portion <b>215</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Modifications and improvements to the above-described embodiments of the present technology may become apparent to those skilled in the art.
