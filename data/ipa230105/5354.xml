Medical devices, e.g. patient monitors, ventilators, infusion pumps, etc., issue alarms for conditions that range from a routine need for service to life-threatening conditions. With conventional alarm priorities limited to &#x201c;high,&#x201d; &#x201c;medium,&#x201d; and &#x201c;low,&#x201d; the criticality of any given alarm may not actually require the skill level of the person to whom the alarm is directed. Clinicians often find they are responding to conditions that do not require their skill level and could have been handled by a junior clinician. This results in a higher-than-necessary number of alarms being sent to the primary designated clinician. The sheer number of alarms received by such clinicians, particularly when the condition is not as serious as it appeared upon receipt of the alarm, exacerbates alarm fatigue.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Alarm fatigue can occur not just from the sheer number of alarms but also the loudness of audible alarms, the number of high-priority alarms that do not require an urgent response, and the duplicative efforts of sending the same alarm to multiple people. Alarm fatigue is also exacerbated by the great number of audible signals coming from alarms from different medical devices located in a patient's room. Most of the time, clinicians are not in the room and the medical device alarms continue to generate audible signals until a clinician arrives to respond. The audible signals create unnecessary noise that raises the anxiety and frustration of both patients and family members and causes an environment that does not promote patient healing.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a need for an Alarm Management System that directs alerts to the lowest-level staff member who can handle the underlying conditions and reduces the number of audible alarms. It is further desirable to provide variable escalation time delays that are suitable for the criticality of the underlying condition. It is also beneficial to provide more information to the recipient of an alert.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In certain embodiments, a method for managing an alarm issued by a medical device being used to treat a patient is disclosed. The method includes the steps of receiving a first alarm from the medical device, retrieving a dynamic attribute associated with the patient, assigning a first sub priority to the first alarm based in part on evaluation of the dynamic attribute, and providing a first alert to a first staff member that is associated with the first sub priority.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In certain embodiments, a system for managing an alarm issued by a medical device being used to treat a patient is disclosed. The system includes a processor coupled to at least one of the medical device, a monitoring system being used to monitor the patient, and a hospital system. The system also includes a memory coupled to the processor. The memory contains data and instructions that, when loaded into the processor and executed, cause the processor to receive a first alarm from the medical device and retrieve one or more of first information from the medical device, second information from the monitoring system, and third information from the hospital system. One or more of the first, second, and third information includes a dynamic attribute associated with the patient. The data and instructions further cause the processor to assign a first sub priority to the first alarm based in part on evaluation of the dynamic attribute and provide a first alert to a first staff member that is associated with the first sub priority.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In certain embodiments, a method of communicating with a staff member is disclosed. The method includes the steps of receiving an alarm issued by a medical device being used to treat a patient, retrieving a dynamic attribute associated with the patient, selecting a first sub priority based in part on the dynamic attribute, and providing a first alert to a first staff member. The first alert includes a first identifier associated with the patient, a second identifier associated with the medical device, the alarm, a dynamic attribute associated with the patient, a value of the dynamic attribute, and a first sub-priority assigned to the alarm based on the dynamic attribute.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In certain embodiments, a method of silencing an alarm in a room of a patient is disclosed. The method includes the steps of receiving an alarm from a medical device, causing the medical device to stop emitting an audible alert, retrieving a dynamic attribute associated with the patient, assigning a sub priority to the alarm based in part on evaluation of the dynamic attribute, providing an alert to a staff member that is associated with the first sub priority, and causing, if the first sub-priority exceeds a threshold, an audible alert to be sounded in the patient room.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide further understanding and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate disclosed embodiments and together with the description serve to explain the principles of the disclosed embodiments.

Corrective actions for clinical alarms are usually performed by clinicians, but technical alarms may be addressed by either clinicians or other staff, e.g. technicians, orderlies, etc.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">In certain embodiments, the disclosed system defines multiple staff roles associated with levels of training and/or specific skills. Table 2 is an exemplary embodiment of defined staff roles. In this example, there are four clinical roles S1, S2, S3, S4 and a technician role S5. Primary care nurses, e.g. S2, perform most of the care of the patient, program medical devices, and address most alarms. In some settings, e.g. a surgical suite, specialists such as anesthesiologists, e.g. S1, program infusion pumps to administer anesthetics and controlled substances and will also address alarms. For ventilators, S1 may include respiratory therapists to troubleshoot complex situations and change ventilator and alarm settings. If the primary clinician, e.g. S2, is busy, then the Alarm Management System will forward the alarm information and sub-priority to a back-up clinician, e.g. S3, to ensure patient care needs are addressed in a timely fashion. S4 is defined as clinicians with less skill, e.g. LPNs, or less experience, e.g. medical students, new nurses in training, etc., who are capable of handling certain alarm conditions and can therefore relieve alarm fatigue of the S1-S3 roles. S5 is defined as technicians, staff, and orderlies who do not have a clinical background but are capable of resolving routine technical alarms.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="161pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Role</entry><entry>Training or skill</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>S1</entry><entry>primary care physician, surgeon, anesthesiologist,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>respiratory therapist</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>S2</entry><entry>primary care nurse</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>S3</entry><entry>backup nurse</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>S4</entry><entry>licensed practical nurse (LPN), medical student,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>new nurse in training</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>S5</entry><entry>technician, staff, orderly</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0036" num="0033">In certain circumstances, for example a small hospital or clinic, there may be a limited number of staff and a single staff role, e.g. S2, may receive alerts for all sub-priorities.

In certain embodiments, the primary clinician, e.g. the S2 role, is assigned a limited number of patients, e.g. 5 patients, and a secondary clinician, e.g. a S3 or S4 role, is assigned to provide back-up for a larger number of patients, e.g. 20 patients.

The alarm specificity provided in this disclosed system ensures that the highest sub-priorities are reserved for situations where the onset of life-threatening harm is immediate.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0036">In certain embodiments of the present disclosure, one dynamic attribute is enough to define the sub-priority of an alarm. In other embodiments, one or more dynamic attributes are needed to define a sub-priority for a given alarm.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0037">In certain embodiments of the present disclosure, an H1 sub-priority is assigned for an alarm associated with an infusion pump where all four of the following dynamic attributes are met: 1) the alarm stops the infusion, 2) the medication that is infusing is associated with a critical indication for use, 3) the medication affects a patient health measurement that is outside its normal range, and 4) the estimated time to perform a corrective action is greater than several minutes. A system error, e.g. a pump failure, alarm on an infusion pump that is infusing norepinephrine meets these four criteria since the system error stops the infusion, norepinephrine has a critical indication for use and it raises blood pressure for a patient with low pressure, and resolution requires a lengthy corrective active that involves retrieving a new pump, connecting to a patient, and reprogramming the infusion into the pump.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0038">In certain embodiments, an H2 sub-priority is assigned for an air-in-line alarm on a pump infusing norepinephrine to a patient with low blood pressure. An air-in-line alarm stops the pump and norepinephrine has a critical indication for use and it affects a patient health measurement(it raises blood pressure for a patient with low pressure). An air-in-line alarm does not require a lengthy corrective action, however, and a nurse can resolve an air-in-line alarm by purging the line much quicker than getting a new pump, connecting the administration line, waiting for the replacement pump to start up, and reprogramming the pump. Addressing the air-in-line alarm in this way is routine and results in the patient being without a critical medication for less time, compared to the above example and warrants a lower sub-priority, e.g. H2.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0039">In certain embodiments, an H3 alarm may occur when an air-in-line alarm is associated with morphine for treating pain. In this scenario only the first two criteria from the H1 example are met. The air-in-line alarm stops the infusion and morphine has a critical indication for use. However, morphine does not affect a patient health measurement or have a significant PK characteristic (i.e. short half-life). A patient not receiving morphine for a period of time is less critical than a patient not receiving norepinephrine and therefore a lower sub-priority, e.g. H3, is warranted for morphine.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0040">In certain embodiments of the disclosed system, medium priority alarms can range between 3 to 15 minutes before the onset of potential harm is critical. In certain embodiments, M1 alarms have the potential to be high priority alarms that require action within a short time, e.g. 2 minutes, and it may be necessary for primary care nurses to always address these. In certain embodiments, M2 and M3 alarms have the potential to become M1 alarms within 5 and 10 minutes, respectively. This allows ample time for these alarms to be responded in an alarm forwarding scheme to reduce alarm fatigue while maintaining patient safety.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0041">In certain embodiments of the disclosed system, low priority alarms take 15 minutes or greater before non-serious patient harm can occur. In certain embodiments, L1 alarms will escalate if clinicians do not respond to them. For example, a battery alarm with 30 minutes of life remaining that is initially assigned an L1 sub-priority will need to escalate if the device is not plugged into wall power within 15 minutes to allow time for escalation to a medium sub-priority and resolution by the escalation staff member. In another example, an L2 sub-priority escalates to a L1 sub-priority alarm after 30 minutes or does not escalate at all.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0042">In certain embodiments, each sub-priority is categorized as a clinical alarm or a technical alarm and ranked based on one or more of time criticality and risk to the patient. The phrase &#x201c;technical alarm&#x201d; includes system error alarms or device fault alarms that often require a device to be replaced, e.g. a failure of the device's internal mechanism such as a stalled motor, and alarms that require a service to be performed on an operational device, e.g. replace a sensor, plug in battery, etc.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0043">An example of a clinical alarm is an air-in-line alarm from an infusion pump because a clinically trained staff member needs to manipulate the intravenous (IV) set to purge the air bubble before restarting the infusion. Some alarm conditions require both technical and clinical corrective actions. For example, replacing a medical device will require the technical corrective action of bringing a new device into the patient's room and the clinical corrective action of connecting the device to the patient and programming the device.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Assignments of Staff Roles to Sub-Priorities</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0044">The present disclosure assigns a staff role to each sub-priority. In certain embodiments, certain staff roles, e.g. S5, have the skills to respond to technical alarms while other roles, e.g. S1-S4, have the skills and training to handle both clinical and technical alarms. A staff role assigned to a sub-priority is determined to be capable of resolving alarm conditions having this assigned sub-priority as well as alarm conditions assigned lower-level sub-priorities. In certain embodiments, the same staff role may be assigned to one of more sub-priorities. In certain embodiments, different staff roles may be assigned to the same sub-priority of alarm from different types of medical devices.

In certain embodiments, an alarm unit <b>110</b> is a physical device located in a patient room with its own display <b>112</b> and means to interact with a patient, e.g. speaker, microphone, video surveillance camera, etc. In certain embodiments, the Alarm Management System <b>100</b> is implemented as a virtual device, e.g. on a hospital server, and the alert content information is sent to a clinician's personal device, e.g. mobile phone. In certain embodiments, the alarm unit <b>110</b> is integrated by the control unit of a medical device, for example the controller of an infusion pump. The Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> contains data and instructions stored in a memory (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the alarm unit <b>110</b> that, when loaded into a processor (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the alarm unit <b>110</b> and executed, cause the processor to implement the functions described herein.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0054">In certain embodiments, the Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> is communicatively coupled to a number of third-party, hospital-based systems. For example, the Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> will integrate with one or more of a Staff Management system <b>150</b>, a Patient Registration system <b>148</b>, an EMR system <b>142</b>, a Lab system <b>144</b>, and a Pharmacy system <b>146</b> that may include a Medical Administration Record (MAR). The Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> communicates information bidirectionally with these systems through a HL7 integration engine <b>140</b> ensuring that data from the hospital-based systems is translated appropriately for the Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0055">The Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> communicates bidirectionally with a plurality of medical devices that alarm as exemplified by Medical Device <b>132</b>, e.g. infusion pump, patient monitor, ventilator, etc. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, this communication occurs through an integration engine <b>130</b> that translates the alarm information from these devices into a standard format for the Alarm Management Application <b>120</b>. In certain embodiments, the Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> is connected to these other devices via a wired connection and a standard communication protocol, e.g. RS-232, RS-485, etc. In certain embodiments, a portion of the connection is wireless using one of the common medical device communication technologies, e.g. Wi-Fi. In certain embodiments, the Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> will also communicate with a Vital Sign Monitor <b>134</b>. These physiological monitors provide information that is useful for determining the status of the patient and how the patient is responding to their treatment.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0056">In certain embodiments, the Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> is also communicatively coupled to a communication network <b>160</b>, which may include wired or wireless connections to various personal devices and other databases, and to a Real Time Locating System <b>162</b> (RTLS) that is capable of determining the physical location of a staff member; e.g. whether a staff member is in a patient room. In certain embodiments, the Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> is integrated into a third-party hospital enterprise system and the logic described in the present disclosure replaces the enterprise software's alarm management functionality.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0057">In certain embodiments, the database <b>123</b> aggregates information related to the patient specific, device specific, and time dependent dynamic attributes. In certain embodiments, the database <b>123</b> includes information and rules regarding the alarms that are implemented in each connected Medical Device <b>132</b> and Vital Sign Monitor <b>134</b>. This information includes the causes of the alarms, how the causes may be resolved, and the verbal commands the Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> can provide to a patient to resolve an alarm.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0058">In certain embodiments, the database contains the medications and fluids being administered by a treatment device, e.g. an infusion pump, and medication administration information, e.g. the administered doses and times of administration, and the medical devices being used. This information may include PK properties, e.g. biological half-life, as well as whether an infusion is a loading dose, or a maintenance dose as determined by one or more of the doctor's orders and medical device settings. This information may also include PD characteristics, e.g. whether the medication or fluid is known or intended to affect a patient health measurement, e.g. vital sign or lab test of the patient.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0059">In certain embodiments, the database <b>123</b> mirrors patient-related data available from one or more of the external systems, e.g. the EMR <b>142</b>, the Lab <b>144</b>, the Pharmacy <b>146</b>, and the Registration <b>148</b>. In certain embodiments, the Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> retrieves information on the patient such as their age and weight from the Registration system <b>148</b> so as to customize the sub-priority alarm criteria for that patient. For example, an alarm associated with an infusion pump stopping fluid replacement in a dehydrated adult may require less urgency than an alarm associated with an infusion pump stopping fluid replacement in dehydrated neonates or pediatrics under a certain weight. Where an H2 alarm may be appropriate for the adult with dehydration, an H1 alarm may be the preferred sub-priority alarm for the dehydrated neonate or pediatric under a certain weight.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0060">In certain embodiments, information about the patient from the Device Integration Engine <b>130</b> is drawn into a Patient Health Algorithm module <b>121</b> that is configured to execute an assessment protocol that combines various measurements and/or assessments to generate a &#x201c;health rating&#x201d; that can then be transferred to the Alarm Priority function <b>122</b> for use in assigning a sub-priority. In certain embodiments, the protocol may be one or more of the MEWS, which is a tool designed to identify patients with declining conditions, and APACHE 2, a widely used intensive care unit (ICU) mortality prediction tool.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0061">In certain embodiments, the Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> utilizes a nationally known patient health algorithm <b>121</b>, or algorithms customized by the individual hospital, to dynamically adjust the sub-priority assigned to an alarm. Two such algorithms are the MEWS and the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) algorithms, which assign a scope to certain vital signs based on a comparison to respective thresholds, wherein higher scores area associated with poorer prognosis. These algorithms are used to triage patients in a lower acuity setting and determine the need for a rapid response team to intervene. In certain embodiments, the Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> calculates the algorithm score based on vital signs received from a Vital Sign Monitor <b>134</b> and dynamically adjusts the sub-priority of an alarm related to a medication or fluid that may improve the patient's deteriorating condition. For example, if a patient is experiencing decline in several parameters that may indicate the onset of sepsis and the patient is receiving fluid replacement therapy or an antibiotic, then the Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> may increase the sub-priority of an &#x201c;infusion stopped&#x201d; alarm by one or two levels.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0062">When an alarm is received from a Medical Device <b>132</b>, the Alarm Priority module <b>122</b> determines the sub-priority for the alarm condition based in part on one or more dynamic attributes, for example information received from the Vital Sign Monitor <b>134</b> and information retrieved from one or more of the EMR <b>142</b>, the Lab system <b>144</b>, the Pharmacy system <b>146</b>, and the Registration system <b>148</b> as well as information, e.g. medication, from the database <b>123</b>. The Alarm Priority module <b>122</b> determination may also be based in part on alarm information and rules retrieved from the database <b>123</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0063">Once the sub-priority is assigned to the alarm, the Alarm Priority functionality <b>122</b> sends the information to the Alarm Distribution functionality <b>125</b>.

In certain embodiments, the Alarm Handler functionality <b>126</b> will provide one or more of a visual alert on the display <b>112</b> or an audio alert on the annunciator <b>116</b> according to information received from the Alarm Distribution module <b>125</b>. In certain embodiments, a microphone or video surveillance camera is used to detect patient actions that assist the Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> to verify the presence or the lack of presence of a particular cause of an alarm to help determine the appropriate sub-priority or to determine the alarm can be suppressed, e.g. a false positive alarm that does not need to be conveyed to the intended recipient.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0067">The Registration system <b>148</b> may disclose that the patient has a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order. In certain embodiments, sub-priority assignment rules in the Alarm Priority functionality <b>122</b> determine alarms for patients with a DNR order are assigned lower sub-priorities that the same alarms for patients without a DNR order. For example, an H1 sub-priority will be changed to H2, a H2 sub-priority to H3, etc. In certain embodiments, only the highest sub-priority, e.g. H1, will be reduced and all other assigned sub-priorities remain at the standard level.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0068">In certain embodiments, the escalation rules are different when a clinician is in the patient room. In certain embodiments, the Alarm Distribution module <b>126</b> communicates to the Medical Device <b>132</b> and causes the Medical Device <b>132</b> to emit or silence the alarm. In certain embodiments, every alert for all alarms will cause an alert in the patient's room, either from the Alarm Unit <b>110</b> or the Medical Device <b>132</b>, after a defined amount of time.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Alert Content</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0069">The method disclosed herein enhances the ability of a staff member to determine the urgency of responding to an alarm and the amount of delay time they may have before responding to an alarm.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0070">In certain embodiments, the content provided to a personal device or for the display screen for an in-room Alarm Management System for an original alert includes one or more of the following: the original sub-priority, the time remaining until the sub-priority is escalated, the identification, e.g. initials, of the staff member to whom the alarm will be escalated, the highest sub priority that is associated with the escalation staff member, whether a back-up is available for the escalation staff member, and a corrective action or recommendation based on a dynamic attribute that may be useful to the recipient.

A lower sub-priority, e.g. H3 or M1, is assigned if the patient health measurement is within its respective pre-determined ranges.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0085">For example, vasopressors are used to treat low blood pressure. If a vasopressor is infusing and the patient's blood pressure is being actively monitored, an alarm related to the vasopressor that occurs while the patient's blood pressure is below the acceptable range should be assigned a sub-priority, e.g. H2. If the blood pressure changes from below-range to within the acceptable range, then the sub-priority of that alarm may be reduced, e.g. H3. If the patient's blood pressure is above the acceptable range, then a lower sub-priority, e.g. M1 may be appropriate since the alarms associated with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> are alarms that stop the therapy.

Lastly, if the patient being infused a vasopressor but the patient's blood pressure is not being actively monitored, then the sub-priority for any alarm related to the infusion of the vasopressor could be H1, H2 or H3 depending on the other dynamic attributes.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0086">Medication and fluids may also be used to improve lab results. Lab values may start off normal and monitoring is ordered to ensure infusion of a medication or fluid does not change the lab result to an abnormal value. In other circumstances, the initial lab value may be outside the acceptable range and a medication or fluid is administered to improve it. For example, potassium IV may be administered to treat hypokalemia. An alarm related to the infusion of the potassium IV may be assigned an H2 sub-priority if the lab value is outside the acceptable range and assigned a lower sub-priority, e.g. H3 or M1, if the lab result is within the acceptable range.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0087">Steps <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> are exemplary evaluations of PK/PD characteristics of a medication being administered to the patient.

If associated with a battery alarm, then the sub-priority will be based on the amount of time remaining on the battery, otherwise step <b>352</b> checks whether the alarm is a notification that does not require correct action. Certain alarms do not require corrective action. For example, some infusion pumps have an internal mechanism that tries to self-correct an occlusion for 60-120 seconds. If the pump issues an alarm at the start of the self-correction process, the disclosed system waits in step <b>350</b> for the defined corrective period. If the pump correction is successful, the pump may issue an &#x201c;alarm&#x201d; that is simply a signal that the issue has been automatically resolved and then step <b>352</b> logs the event and terminates the process.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0091">If the pump alarm is not associated with a time dependent alarm and a corrective action is required then the process continues to step <b>354</b> where it branches depending on whether the alarm is related to a critical indication of an administered medication.

The required corrective action is to obtain and connect a new IV bag, or a pre-filled syringe, of the medication to enable the next infusion to start. In certain embodiments, the initial sub-priority is set to a low level, e.g. M3, which will cause the system to notify a S3 clinician to retrieve the new IV bag and bring it to the patient's room. The alert to the S3 clinician may include the sub-priority, the necessary information to describe the item to be retrieved, e.g. the size of the IV bag and the medication concentration and volume. Even when the S3 staff member acknowledges the alert, the alarm is escalated to a higher priority, e.g. a M1, to notify the assigned S1 staff member to come to the patient room to connect the new IV bag and start the new infusion.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Multiple Infusions</heading><p id="p-0101" num="0096">A lot of patients that are hospitalized have multiple diagnoses that require infusions and often each diagnosis requires multiple infusions.

For each separate infusion, the Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> will determine if the indication for use is critical or non-critical. In certain embodiments, the Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> will retrieve the indication for use from the database for each infusion.

For example, a patient who is hyperglycemic and receiving insulin, which has a critical indication for use, may be co-infused with low-concentration dextrose, which has a non-critical indication for use.

For example, if an infusion pump has an H1 alarm while a ventilator has an M1 alarm, the alarm management device will generate an audio emergency alert and visually display device identification information associated with the pump that is alarming. The display of the ventilator alarm sub-priority would occur underneath the infusion pump sub-priority signaling lesser importance.

If the ventilator is running on wall power, and the battery is functional, then no alert is assigned since this may be just an alarm to say a battery with low power is recharging. If the ventilator is running on battery power, then a sub-priority will be defined based on the amount of time left on the battery. For example, an alarm indicating there is ten minutes of battery power will be assigned a M2 sub-priority.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0117">If the battery is not functional, e.g. a charging issue, then step <b>634</b> determines whether the ventilator is running on wall power. If the battery is non-operational and the ventilator has lost its connection to wall source, then the ventilator has turned off and Step <b>634</b> assigns the highest sub-priority, e.g. H1. If the battery is not functional or has lost its ability to charge and the ventilator is connected to a mains power source is not, then step <b>634</b> assigns a lower sub-priority, e.g. M2 sub-priority. Depending on the staff role associated with a ventilator M2 priority, a lower-level staff member can install a new battery.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0118">For gas alarms, step <b>640</b> determines whether the alarm is associated with an oxygen supply issue, e.g. a supply of O<sub>2 </sub>has stopped. Room air consists of 21% oxygen. Patients may receive supplemental oxygen at levels up to 100% oxygen. Step <b>644</b> branches based on whether a patient is receiving room air or receiving supplemental oxygen. In certain embodiments, if the patient is receiving supplemental oxygen, a higher sub-priority is generated, e.g. H3, since the alarm indicates that the patient may be receiving less than the intended amount of oxygen. In other embodiments, the sub-priority is defined based on the amount of O<sub>2 </sub>that is required. If the patient is receiving only room air or very minimal supplement oxygen, then a lower sub-priority is assigned, e.g. M3.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0119">Ventilators can provide a breathing mixture from gases other than pure oxygen, e.g. manufactured air or heliox. If an air or heliox Gas Supply alarm is received, then the patient may be receiving pure oxygen from the ventilator. Too much oxygen in the breathing mixture for an extended period of time may damage lung tissue. In certain embodiments, if step <b>642</b> determines that the alarm is related to the patient receiving the breathing mixture and the patient is breathing a 70% or greater oxygen levels, then step <b>646</b> assigns a lower sub-priority, e.g. M2. If the oxygen content of the breathing mixture is set to &#x3c;70% oxygen, then step <b>646</b> assigns a higher sub-priority, e.g. M1, since the patient may not tolerate the excess oxygen. If the alarm is related to other aspects of the gas supply, for example a low gas supply tank pressure alarm, then step <b>642</b> assigns a lower sub-priority alarm, e.g. M3.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> provides the logic for assigning sub-priorities to sensor alarms, which can be related to non-functional sensors, sensors hooked up incorrectly, sensors requiring calibration, etc. Ventilators typically have flow, pressure, oxygen (<b>02</b>), and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) sensors. The flow sensor is the most important sensor to maintain during the ventilation to determine if the patient is getting the correct flow rate. Alarm sub-priorities will be decreased if a primary sensor, e.g. flow sensor or CO<sub>2 </sub>sensor, stops working but a redundant external monitoring activity is concurrently operating. For example, a lower sub-priority is warranted for both non-functional flow sensors and CO<sub>2 </sub>sensors when the patient is also being monitored by an ETCO<sub>2 </sub>monitor.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0121">Steps <b>650</b>, <b>660</b>, <b>662</b>, <b>666</b> branch depending on the type of sensor associated with the alarm. For flow sensor alarms, step <b>650</b> branches to step <b>652</b> where the application determines if there is a redundant monitoring source, e.g. ETCO<sub>2 </sub>monitoring, and assigns a M2 sub-priority. If there is no redundant monitoring source then the software branches to step <b>654</b>. If the patient is sensitive to excessive tidal volume, e.g. patient with an underlying condition of ARDS, COPD, etc., the process branches to step <b>656</b> that determines whether a new ventilator is required. If a new ventilator is not required, a H3 sub-priority is assigned. If a new ventilator is required, some manufacturer's flow sensors require a lengthy replacement and testing process, which requires manual ventilation in the interim, and an H3 sub-priority is assigned with an additional alert to a second staff member to retrieve a new ventilator.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0122">If the patient is not sensitive to excessive tidal volume, then the software branches to step <b>658</b> to determine if a new ventilator is needed.

These figures do not represent an exhaustive list of clinical alarms but cover numerous examples of how dynamic attributes define a sub-priority for a ventilator clinical alarm. Some of the steps in these figures illustrate how an alarm sub-priority may change from its baseline value based on the patient's medical or current condition e.g. COPD, a patient action e.g. coughing, or a redundant mechanism to mitigate harm e.g. ETCO<sub>2 </sub>monitoring. Patients with certain types of underlying conditions require protective strategies while being treated with a ventilator. Conventional systems rely on the clinician to manually adjust the settings of the ventilator based on the underlying conditions. It is important that patients who have underlying conditions in need of a protective strategy have a higher sub-priority, so clinicians respond quicker to mitigate the potential increased harm. Alternatively, patients who may not need protective strategies may have lower sub-priorities which allows clinicians more time to respond and reduces alarm fatigue.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0127">The disclosed method enables a hospital to define a set of rules that modify the sub-priorities assigned to certain alarm conditions that may interact with the underlying conditions. For example, patients who have COPD or asthma may experience chronic inflammation of small airways, which increases airway resistance and decreases elastic recoil. This leads to limited airflow and an impaired ability of the airways to remain open at the end of breath expiration. The collapse of airways at the end of expiration results in incomplete expiration, higher residual end-expiratory volume, hyperinflation, and auto-high positive end-expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP). Protective measures for ventilating COPD and asthma patients include preventing air trapping in the smaller airways by reducing the tidal volume, ensuring respirations are slow and deep, and ensuring the expiration time is significantly long enough to remove air.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0128">In certain embodiments, higher sub-priorities are defined for diabetics. Diabetics who are prone to developing high blood sugar and potentially diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA) rely on respiratory mechanisms to compensate for metabolic acidosis and, therefore, are at a higher risk for certain alarm conditions which may indicate disease progression.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0129">Step <b>670</b> covers an apnea alarm or when the ventilator is set to allow the patient to breathe by themselves, i.e. spontaneous breathing, however there is no respiration detected.

Coaching may include the instructions of Table 9.

If there is no concurrent alarm and the patient has COPD or asthma, then step <b>676</b> in this example assigns the same priority, e.g. H3, since a fast rate may affect the patient's breath expiration and lead to air stacking in patient's having smaller airways. If the patient's underlying medical condition is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), then step <b>677</b> assigned a lower sub-priority, e.g. M1. If there is no concurrent alarm and the patient does not have COPD, asthma, or ARDS but is diagnosed as diabetic, step <b>679</b> checks the latest lab test and assigns a higher sub-priority, e.g. H2, if the patient has high blood sugar since the high respiration rate may indicate patient deterioration in this situation.

A diagnosis of diabetes and a laboratory test showing high blood sugar causes step <b>685</b> to assign a high priority, e.g. H1, since the metabolic alkalosis is at a more advanced stage.

For example, a high respiratory rate or a high tidal volume, e.g. fast and/or shallow breathing, may generate an alarm reflects agitation of a patient being on a ventilator in a hospital room by themselves when they are awake, lightly sedated or on a daily spontaneous breathing trial. In addition, a patient may be fighting the respiration pattern provided by the ventilator, a behavior known as &#x201c;patient-ventilator asynchrony,&#x201d; which may result in several alarms, e.g. high airway pressure alarm. For these alarms, it is possible to coach a patient who is capable of following instructions to change their breathing pattern, e.g. slow down respiration, to resolve the alarm. In certain embodiments, the disclosed system can resolve these alarms without involvement of a staff member.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0138">For example, the Alarm Management System <b>120</b> receives a ventilator alarm and determines from a database in its memory that the alarm might be related to a patient's breathing pattern and that may be corrected with instruction, e.g. verbal command. The Alarm Management Application <b>120</b> can retrieve the ventilation mode and the set-point and actual respiratory rates from the ventilator and determine if the mode supports spontaneous breathing and if the patient is breathing spontaneous breaths. If both conditions are met, then in certain embodiments the alarm unit will retrieve the audio/video file from the database in its memory and provide the pre-recorded instructions on a video or audio device. In certain embodiments, a remote staff member may provide instructions via an audio or visual device. In certain embodiments, a pre-determined time period, e.g. twenty seconds, is allowed for the patient to be coached to resolve the alarm. If successful, then the alarm clears, and an information alert is sent to a remote clinician. If the time expires or the Alarm Unit determines that a potential cause of the alarm is not associated with patient behavior or the patient is not capable of responding to instructions, then the Alarm Management System <b>120</b> software will continue to process the alarm and assign an appropriate sub-priority alarm. In certain embodiments, the Alarm Management System <b>120</b> considers the time spent on this instruction when defining the sub-priority.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0139">In another embodiment, the Alarm Unit <b>110</b> uses its microphone to determine if the patient is coughing, which may be the reason for a high airway pressure alarm. The Alarm Unit's memory database will know that a potential cause of high airway pressure alarms is a patient coughing. In certain embodiments, the alarm unit hardware includes a built-in microphone (<b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that can detect that a patient is coughing during a high airway alarm. If confirmatory, then a high airway pressure alarm will not be forwarded to a remote clinician if it does not continue after the coughing ceases. If the patient is not coughing, then then the software alarm logic for high airway pressure alarms will continue to proceed through its logic as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E</figref>.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="2">Patient Monitor Alarms</heading><p id="p-0147" num="0140">A patient monitor is used to monitor a patient's vital signs and detect arrhythmias of different criticality, e.g. life-threatening, critical, and non-critical. Monitors are ubiquitous in both high acuity hospital environments, e.g. ICU, and lower acuity environments, e.g. medical/surgical floors. They play a significant role in generating the number of alarms in these environments and a large percentage of these alarms are not actionable, e.g. false positive alarms. The high frequency of non-actionable monitor alarms may have many causes, e.g. a weak signal to noise ratio, a motion artefact, electromagnetic interference, etc. To combat alarm fatigue, it is vital that dynamic attributes are used to provide context to alarms so clinicians know which alarms may be actionable and the sense of urgency in responding to them.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0141">When clinicians respond repeatedly to monitor alarms that do not require an actionable response, they are inclined to take longer to respond to subsequent alarms, or resort to unsafe practices, e.g. turning off the volume of a monitor or utilizing the monitor's ability to suppress future alarms. Numerous safety signals from public databases indicate that turning off the alarm volume or using the suppression feature of a monitor is unsafe and may lead to serious injury or death. To facilitate preventing alarm fatigue and to ensure critical alarms are responded to in a timely fashion, the embodiments in this application clarify how dynamic attributes are used to provide the necessary alarm specificity to achieve these goals. Dynamic attributes provide context to clinicians to facilitate determining when a monitor alarm is associated with a true critical event, when a more urgent response is required to address an alarm associated with lack of monitoring or reliability of monitoring, and when a reduced sub-priority requiring a less urgent response is required, reducing the alarm fatigue factor for clinicians.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>D</figref> depict a flowchart of an exemplary embodiment of a method of handling an alarm received from a monitoring device alarm, according to certain aspects of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> depicts an exemplary embodiment in how the Alarm Management System <b>120</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may classify each category of patient monitor alarms, each with their own separate logic and rules using dynamic attributes to define initial sub-priorities for the alarms within the category.

Step <b>810</b> branches depending on whether the alarm is associated with a clinical alarm or a technical alarm. If the alarm is technical, then step <b>814</b> determines if the patient monitoring is available or unavailable. For example, monitoring is unavailable when the monitoring loses power, a lead becomes disconnected, the monitor experiences a system error and requires to be taken out of service, etc. This category of alarms covers both the case where all monitoring is lost, e.g. a patient monitor <b>134</b> loses power, or when only one of the parameter is not available, e.g. a lead has become disconnected.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0144">If monitoring is unavailable, then the logic branches to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref>.

If no corrective action is required, then no alert is generated. If the alarm is clinical in nature, then Steps <b>812</b>, <b>816</b>, <b>818</b> determine if the alarm is a life-threatening arrhythmia e.g. asystole, ventricular fibrillation, a critical arrhythmia e.g. ventricular tachycardia, a non-critical arrhythmia e.g. premature ventricular contraction, or a patient parameter alarm e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub>, etc. Each of these categories would have their own logic utilizing dynamic attributes to define initial sub-priorities or when to suppress an alarm signal and not send it in an alarm forwarding scheme. Exemplary logic for a life-threatening arrhythmia alarm is described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> and for a patient parameter alarm in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> depicts an exemplary process for handling a life-threatening arrhythmia alarm from a patient monitor.

For example, if the initial alarm is associated with a high heart rate but the patient health measurement showed that there was a period of bradycardia before this alarm, then a potentially serious condition Tachy-Brady Syndrome may manifest, which may require the need for an internal pacemaker if symptoms are significant enough. Another example is if the patient alarm is for high blood pressure and one of the patient health measurements, e.g. lab value, associated with the patient is high blood sugar indicating diabetic ketoacidosis then a higher sub-priority is warranted since disease progression is indicated. If there is an indication that the situation is life-threatening, step <b>858</b> assigns an H2 sub-priority otherwise routes the process to step <b>860</b>.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0155">Step <b>860</b> determines if the current patient health measurements change the score of a patient health algorithm. Patient health algorithms like the MEWS are used in lower acuity settings, e.g. a medical ward. In certain embodiments, if the score is high enough, then then the process branches to step <b>862</b> and if the new algorithm value indicates a life-threatening risk, step <b>862</b> assigns an H2 sub-priority that will cause a rapid response team to assess whether the patient should be moved to a higher acuity setting, e.g. ICU. If the patient health algorithm has changed but does not rise to a life-threatening situation, then the process branches to step <b>864</b>. If the algorithm score has not changed, the process also proceeds from step <b>860</b> to step <b>864</b>.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0156">Step <b>864</b> determines whether a corrective action is required on the device to address the alarm. For example, an alarm indicates that the recommend time to change the leads has expired, thus necessitating a clinician or technician changing the leads. In an example, a device parameter has exceeded a limit and based off the dynamic attributes in steps <b>854</b>, <b>856</b> and <b>860</b> not being affirmative, the hospital staff has pre-approved an increase or decrease in the limits so the alarm condition does not re-occur. If a corrective action is required, then a M1 sub-priority alarm is generated. If not, the process branches to step <b>866</b> to determine whether the alarm has cleared within the initial delay, e.g. self-cleared. If the alarm clears, then no alert is sent to a remote clinician. If the alarm is not resolved, then in certain embodiments a lower priority alarm is assigned, e.g. M1 or M2. In another embodiment, if steps <b>854</b>, <b>858</b>, or <b>862</b> is not affirmative, e.g. a patient treatment affects the parameter but the treatment is not critical, an M1 sub-priority is assigned. In certain embodiments, the default setting is an M2 sub-priority</p><p id="p-0164" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref> depicts the handling of a technical alarm when some aspect of monitoring is not available, e.g. leads are disconnected, a sensor has failed, etc. In conventional systems, a loss of patient monitoring is uniformly assigned a medium priority alarm. As with patient parameters, the system disclosed herein assesses related dynamic attributes and adjusts the sub-priority up or down based on this additional information, thereby alleviating alarm fatigue.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0158">Step <b>870</b> determines if there is redundant monitoring in place. In certain embodiments, if the Sp<b>0</b><sub>2 </sub>probe is disconnected, which is one of the more frequent monitoring alarms in a hospital, but end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>is being measured via capnography, then a low sub-priority, e.g. an M3, is assigned.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0159">If there is not a viable redundant monitoring process in place, the process branches to step <b>872</b> that determines whether the patient is undergoing a treatment that requires monitoring associated with the alarm. For example, treating high blood pressure with a medication requires blood pressure monitoring and loss of the blood pressure monitoring assigns an H3 sub-priority. For the same example of a patient being treated for high blood pressure, loss of the SpO<sub>2 </sub>monitoring would be considered a &#x201c;no&#x201d; and the process would branch to step <b>876</b>.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0160">Step <b>876</b> determines if the patient has an underlying condition pertinent to the monitoring being performed. If yes, then the process branches to step <b>880</b> that determines if the patient health measurement or other indicator is critical. For example, if the patient is experiencing serious symptoms, has a high patient health algorithm score, or has a critical patient health measurement such as a positive lab test for a cardiac marker, then step <b>880</b> assigns a H3 sub-priority. If the patient does not have a critical indicator, a lower sub-priority, e.g. an M1, is assigned.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0161">If the patient does not have an underlying medical condition, the process branches from step <b>876</b> to step <b>878</b> that will assign an H3 sub-priority if the patient health measurement is critical but assign an even lower sub-priority, e.g. an M2, if their status is not critical.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="2">Aspects</heading><p id="p-0169" num="0162">Aspect 1.
