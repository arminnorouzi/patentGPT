No. 2021-111495, which was filed on Jul. 5, 2021, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading

of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An electric power steering system disclosed in Patent Document 1 (Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2018-130007) is configured such that an operation force applied by a driver to a steering wheel is assisted by a dual-system assist device, so as to steer a wheel. In case of a failure of one of the two systems of the assist device, the steering wheel is assisted by only the other of the two systems.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Steering systems installed on vehicles include not only the power steering system described above but also a steering system that includes a steering device including an electric motor and configured to steer a wheel without depending on the operation force applied by the driver to an operating member such as the steering wheel, i.e., a steer-by-wire steering system. It has been proposed to provide the steer-by-wire steering system with a dual-system steering device from the viewpoint of failsafe, for instance. In the steer-by-wire steering system, the operation force of the driver does not contribute to steering of the wheel. Thus, in a case where the wheel is steered by only one of the two systems of the steering device, there may be a possibility that the steering force for steering the wheel is insufficient. Elimination or mitigation of the shortage of the steering force enhances the utility of the steer-by-wire steering system. Accordingly, an aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a steer-by-wire steering system having high utility.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect of the present disclosure, a steer-by-wire steering system for a vehicle, includes:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">an operating member operable by a driver;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">a dual-system steering device including two systems each of which includes an electric motor as a drive source, the steering device being configured to steer a wheel; and</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">a controller configured to control a current to be supplied to each of the electric motors of the respective two systems so as to cause the steering device to steer the wheel in accordance with an operation of the operating member,</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">wherein the controller is configured to prohibit the current greater than an upper limit value from being supplied to the electric motors of the respective two systems, and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">wherein, when the wheel is steered by only one of the two systems, the controller raises the upper limit value of the current to be supplied to the electric motor of the one of the two systems.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">For protecting the electric motor or the drive circuit (driver) for the electric motor from overheating, an upper limit value is typically set for the supply current to the electric motor. The steering system according to the present disclosure is configured such that, when one of the two systems of the steering device fails to operate and the wheel is steered by only the other system, the upper limit value of the supply current to be supplied to the electric motor in the other system is raised, so that the steering force is sufficiently obtained. The electric motors or the drive circuits for the electric motors in the dual-system steering device are typically provided with a heat sink common to the two systems for overheating protection. When the upper limit value of the supply current is raised and the wheel is steered by only the other system, the heat sink can be utilized dedicatedly for the other system. Thus, overheating of the electric motor and the drive circuit for the electric motor in the other system is not so problematic. In this respect, it is hard to imagine that steering of the wheel by only the other system continues for a relatively long length of time in such a failure condition in which one of the two systems fails to operate. Thus, even if the upper limit value of the supply current to be supplied to the electric motor in the other system is raised when the wheel is steered by only the other system, overheating of the electric motor and the drive circuit for the electric motor in the other system is not so problematic.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Various Forms</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The steering device of the steering system according to the present disclosure includes the two systems. Such a dual-system steering device may be configured to include two motors that are separate from each other so as to correspond to the respective two systems or may be configured to include one dual-system electric motor including two systems that correspond to the respective two systems of the steering device. Specifically, the steering device may employ one electric motor having one output shaft and two sets of coils corresponding to the respective two systems of the steering device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">When the temperature of the steering system is lowered to a certain level, a resistance to an operation of a mechanical structural portion increases due to a decrease in clearances in the mechanical structural portion, an increase in the viscosity of the lubricant, etc., thus requiring a larger steering force for steering the wheel. In other words, it is needed to supply a greater amount of current to the electric motor of the steering device. In view of this, the amount of raising of the upper limit value of the supply current, i.e., the increase amount of the upper limit value of the supply current, may be made larger when the temperature of the steering system is not higher than a set temperature than when the temperature of the steering system is higher than the set temperature. Conversely, in a situation in which the temperature of the steering system is not lower than a certain level, the required steering force need not be so large. Accordingly, the upper limit value of the supply current may be raised on condition that the temperature of the steering system is not higher than the set temperature. In other words, the steering system may be configured such that the upper limit value of the supply current is not raised as long as the temperature of the steering system is higher than the set temperature.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The temperature of the steering system may be identified based on detection by a temperature sensor provided for the steering device itself, specifically, a temperature sensor provided on a housing of an actuator, in the vicinity of the electric motor, or in the vicinity of the drive circuit, for instance. The temperature of the steering system may be a temperature of the environment in which the vehicle is placed or a temperature estimated based on a supply history of the current to the electric motor (such as the amount of current that has been supplied and the length of time during which the current has been supplied).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The set temperature may be determined to be a temperature not higher than 0&#xb0; C. such as &#x2212;20&#xb0; C., &#x2212;10&#xb0; C., or 0&#xb0; C., in view of the resistance to the operation described above. The steering force to be required needs to be increased with a decrease in the temperature of the steering system. Thus, the amount of raising of the upper limit value of the supply current may be increased with a decrease in the temperature of the steering system, namely, the upper limit value of the supply current may be made higher with a decrease in the temperature of the steering system.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the meantime, when a speed of the vehicle (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;vehicle speed&#x201d; where appropriate) is lowered to a certain extent, the steering force for steering the wheel is considerably large due to the influence of a frictional force between the tire and the road surface. When the vehicle is at a standstill, namely, when the vehicle speed is 0, the wheel has to be steered in what is called stationary steering state. This causes a need to generate a considerably large steering force, resulting in an excessively large supply current to the electric motor. Thus, when the vehicle speed is not higher than the set speed, the upper limit value of the supply current may be prohibited from being raised. For prohibiting the upper limit value from being raised in the stationary steering state or a state close to the stationary steering state, the set speed may be desirably determined such that the vehicle is regarded as being at a standstill at the set speed. Specifically, the set speed is 2-5 km/h, for instance.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">For matching the operations of the two systems of the steering device to each other when the wheel is steered by both the two systems, the supply currents to be supplied to the electric motors of the respective two systems are desirably made equal to each other. That is, it is desirable to execute a control for causing the two systems to operate in a coordinated fashion (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;coordinated control&#x201d; where appropriate). In the coordinated control, the current to be supplied to the electric motor of one of the two systems (i.e., a main system) may be determined, and the determined current may be supplied also to the electric motor of the other of the two systems (i.e., a sub system). In other words, the supply current to be supplied to the electric motors of the two systems may be determined in the main system, and the determined supply current may be supplied also to the sub system. In the steering system configured to execute the coordinated control described above, when the wheel is steered by only the other system, namely, when the wheel is steered by only the sub system, the current to be supplied to the electric motor of the other system may be determined independently and the determined current may be supplied to the electric motor of the other system.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The objects, features, advantages, and technical and industrial significance of the present disclosure will be better understood by reading the following detailed description of an embodiment, when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view schematically illustrating an overall configuration of a steering system according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a view schematically illustrating heat sinks respectively provided for an electric motor and a controller of a steering device for protecting the electric motor and the controller from overheating;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a flowchart of a basic steering program and a flowchart of a dependent steering program executed in the steering system according to the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a graph representing a current limitation map for a high-temperature state utilized in determining an upper limit value of a supply current to a steering motor;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a graph representing a characteristic of a torque with respect to a rotational speed of the steering motor;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a graph representing a relationship between an environmental temperature and a steering force generated by the steering device;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a graph representing a current limitation map for a low-temperature state utilized in determining the upper limit value of the supply current to the steering motor;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart of a current limitation subroutine partly constituting the basic steering program; and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart of a reaction force application program executed in the steering system according to the embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to the drawings, there will be described below in detail a steering system according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.

(The upper limit of the steering torque Tq<sub>S </sub>will be hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;upper limit torque Tq<sub>S-LIM</sub>&#x201d; where appropriate).

When the environmental temperature TA is lowered to a temperature not higher than a certain level (e.g., not higher than &#x2212;10&#xb0; C.), the resistance to the operations of the suspension device, the steering actuator <b>42</b>, etc., increases due to an increase in the viscosity of the lubricant such as grease and a decrease in clearances among the constituent components, for instance. The increase in the resistance leads to an increase in the steering force to be required. In view of this, it is desirable to raise the upper limit value I<sub>S-LIM</sub>of the steering current I<sub>S </sub>when the temperature of the steering system, specifically, the environmental temperature TA, becomes lower than or equal to a set temperature T<sub>L </sub>(e.g., &#x2212;10&#xb0; C.) set at a relatively low temperature. In view of the fact that the resistance to the operations increases with an decrease in the environmental temperature T<sub>A</sub>, the amount of raising of the upper limit value I<sub>S-LIM</sub>is preferably increased with a decrease in the environmental temperature T<sub>A</sub>, namely, the upper limit value I<sub>S-LIM</sub>is preferably set to a higher value with a decrease in the environmental temperature T<sub>A</sub>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0062">In view of the above, the steering ECU <b>62</b> of the present steering system carries out, in the current limiting process described above, raising of the upper limit value I<sub>S-LIM </sub>of the steering current I<sub>S </sub>(hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;upper-limit raising&#x201d; where appropriate) in the failure condition. In the present steering system, there are prepared two configurations, namely, two modes, for the upper-limit raising. One of the two modes is a standard raising mode in which the upper-limit raising is carried out on condition that the wheels <b>10</b> are steered by only one of the two systems. The other of the two modes is a temperature-dependent raising mode in which the upper-limit raising is carried out on condition that the wheels <b>10</b> are steered by only one of the two systems and the environmental temperature T<sub>A </sub>is not higher than the set temperature T<sub>L</sub>. The mode according to which the upper-limit raising is carried out is selected in advance from the two modes described above depending on the type, the specifications, etc., of the vehicle at the time of manufacture.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0063">Specifically, the steering ECU <b>62</b> refers to a current limitation map for a low-temperature state illustrated by the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> and determines the upper limit value I<sub>S-LIM</sub>of the steering current I<sub>S</sub>. In the normal condition, the upper limit value I<sub>S-LIM </sub>is constant at the standard value I<sub>S-N </sub>as indicated by the solid line in the map. In a case where the upper-limit raising is carried out in the standard raising mode in the failure condition, the upper limit value I<sub>S-LIM</sub>is raised by an amount of raising &#x394;I<sub>S-LIM </sub>when the environmental temperature T<sub>A </sub>is higher than the set temperature T<sub>L</sub>, and the upper limit value I<sub>S-LIM </sub>is determined such that the amount of raising &#x394;I<sub>S-LIM </sub>increases with a decrease in the environmental temperature T<sub>A </sub>when the environmental temperature T<sub>A </sub>is lower than or equal to the set temperature T<sub>L</sub>, as indicated by the dashed line in the map. In a case where the upper-limit raising is carried out in the temperature-dependent raising mode, the upper limit value I<sub>S-LIM</sub>is not raised when the environmental temperature T<sub>A </sub>is higher than the set temperature T<sub>L</sub>, and the upper limit value I<sub>S-LIM </sub>is determined such that the amount of raising &#x394;I<sub>S-LIM </sub>increases with a decrease in the environmental temperature T<sub>A </sub>when the environmental temperature T<sub>A </sub>is lower than or equal to the set temperature T<sub>L</sub>, as indicated by the long dashed short dashed line in the map.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0064">In a case where the motor temperature T<sub>M </sub>and the board temperature T<sub>D </sub>are higher than or equal to the monitoring required threshold T<sub>H </sub>set at a relatively high temperature, the current limitation for overheating protection described above is executed with a higher priority than the upper-limit raising. The current limitation for overheating protection is related to the upper-limit raising. Specifically, in the normal condition and the temperature-dependent raising mode, the steering ECU <b>62</b> refers to the solid line in the current limitation map for the high-temperature state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>) and determines the upper limit value I<sub>S-LIM </sub>such that the upper limit value I<sub>S-LIM</sub>decreases from the standard value I<sub>S-N </sub>with an increase in the motor temperature T<sub>M </sub>and the board temperature T<sub>D</sub>. In the standard raising mode, the steering ECU <b>62</b> refers to the dashed line in the current limitation map for the high-temperature state and determines the upper limit value I<sub>S-LIM</sub>such that the upper limit value I<sub>S-LIM</sub>decreases from a value, which is raised from the standard value I<sub>S-N </sub>by the amount of raising &#x394;I<sub>S-LIM </sub>, with an increase in the motor temperature T<sub>M </sub>and the board temperature T<sub>D</sub>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0065">In the failure condition, the upper limit value I<sub>S-LIM</sub>of the steering current I<sub>S </sub>is raised in only one of the two systems. It is thus expected that the amount of heat generated in the steering motor <b>50</b> of the one system and the amount of heat generated in the steering ECU <b>62</b> including the drive circuit for the steering motor <b>50</b> of the one system are increased. However, each of the heat sinks <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> utilized in common to the two systems in the normal condition is utilized dedicatedly for that one system in the failure condition, thus preventing or reducing an increase in the temperatures of the steering motor <b>50</b> and the steering ECU <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0066">In a case where the vehicle speed &#x3bd; is low, specifically, in a case where the vehicle is at a standstill or in a case where the vehicle speed &#x3bd; is low to such an extent that the vehicle is regarded as being at a standstill, the wheels <b>10</b> are steered in the stationary steering state or in a state close to the stationary steering state. The steering current I<sub>S </sub>is considerably large in those states, resulting in a high possibility of overheating of the steering motor <b>50</b> and the steering ECU <b>62</b>. When the vehicle speed v is increased after the vehicle starts to run, the vehicle gets out of those states, resulting in a reduced possibility of overheating of the steering motor <b>50</b> and the steering ECU <b>62</b>. Accordingly, the steering ECU <b>62</b> does not carry out the upper-limit raising when the vehicle speed &#x3bd; is lower than or equal to a set speed &#x3bd;<sub>TH</sub>, which is determined, in advance, to be a considerably low speed.
