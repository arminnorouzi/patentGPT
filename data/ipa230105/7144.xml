The present exemplary embodiments will be described citing a multi-function peripheral having a print function, a scan function, and a facsimile function as an example of an image processing apparatus, but this is not seen to be limiting. Not all of combinations of features that will be described in the present exemplary embodiments are necessarily essential to the solution of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of the configuration of a system according to a first exemplary embodiment. An image processing apparatus <b>101</b>, an application server <b>102</b>, which is an information processing apparatus, and a user terminal <b>103</b>, which is an external apparatus, are connected via a network <b>100</b> to communicate with each other. A plurality of image processing apparatuses and/or servers (not illustrated) can be connected to the system.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The image processing apparatus <b>101</b> is, for example, a multi function peripheral (MFP). The image processing apparatus <b>101</b> reads an image on a document and generates image data. The image processing apparatus <b>101</b> has a function of transmitting a file containing the generated image data to the application server <b>102</b> via the network <b>100</b>. Various types of services, such as a chat application and a bot service, run on the application server <b>102</b>. The application server <b>102</b> provides, for example, an online storage function that stores a file transmitted from the but service or the image processing apparatus <b>101</b>. The application server <b>102</b> can be a single server machine or can be a group of machines including a plurality of servers. The image processing apparatus <b>101</b>, the application server <b>102</b>, and the user terminal <b>103</b> can be located on the same network.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of the hardware configuration of the image processing apparatus <b>101</b>. The image processing apparatus <b>101</b> has a reading function of reading an image on a document and a print function of printing an image on a sheet. The image processing apparatus <b>101</b> also has, for example, a file transmission function of transmitting image data to an external apparatus.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As indicated above, the present exemplary embodiment will be described using an MFP as the image processing apparatus <b>101</b>. However, the image processing apparatus <b>101</b> is not limited to being an MFP. For example, the image processing apparatus <b>101</b> can be an image reading apparatus, such as a scanner, that does not have the print function.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A control unit <b>200</b> including a central processing unit (CPU) <b>201</b> controls the overall operation of the image processing apparatus <b>101</b>. The CPU <b>201</b> reads out and executes a control program stored in a read only memory (ROM) <b>202</b> or a storage <b>204</b>, and performs various control functions, such as reading control and printing control. A random access memory (RAM) <b>203</b> is a main storage memory of the CPU <b>201</b>, and is used as a work area and a temporary storage area for developing various types of control programs stored in the ROM <b>202</b> and the storage <b>204</b>. The storage <b>204</b> stores print data, image data, various types of programs, and various types of setting information therein. The storage <b>204</b> is a storage device, such as a hard disk drive (HDD) and/or a solid state drive (SSD).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the following description, the image processing apparatus <b>101</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment is configured such that the CPU <b>201</b> performs each of processing procedures illustrated in sequences that will be described below using the single memory (RAM <b>203</b>).
