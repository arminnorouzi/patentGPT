Moreover, <i>Hevea brasiliensis </i>trees take about seven years from planting to grow mature enough to yield rubber, and they yield natural rubber only for a period of 20 to 30 years. Demand for natural rubber is expected to increase in years to come, especially in developing countries, but for the reasons discussed above it is difficult to greatly increase natural rubber production from <i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>. Therefore, there has been a concern that natural rubber resources might dry up, and it has been desirable to provide stable natural rubber sources other than mature <i>Hevea brasiliensis </i>trees and to improve productivity of natural rubber from <i>Hevea brasiliensis. </i></p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Natural rubber has a cis-1,4-polyisoprene structure formed of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) as an elementary unit. This structure suggests that cis-prenyltransferase (CPT) may be involved in natural rubber biosynthesis. For example, several CPTs have been found in <i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>, including <i>Hevea </i>rubber transferase 1 (HRT1) and <i>Hevea </i>rubber transferase 2 (HRT2) (see, for example, Non-Patent Literatures 1 and 2). It is also known that rubber synthesis may be reduced in a dandelion species, <i>Taraxacum brevicorniculatum</i>, by suppressing the CPT expression (see, for example, Non-Patent Literature 3).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Non-Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Non-Patent Literature 1: Rahaman et al., BMC Genomics, 2013, vol. 14</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Non-Patent Literature 2: Asawatreratanakul et al., European Journal of Biochemistry, 2003, vol. 270, 4671-4680</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Non-Patent Literature 3: Post et al., Plant Physiology, 2012, vol. 158, 1406-1417</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Non-Patent Literature 4: Karine et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1838 (2014), 287-299</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As discussed above, there have been needs to develop stable natural rubber sources other than mature <i>Hevea brasiliensis </i>trees and to improve productivity of natural rubber from <i>Hevea brasiliensis. </i></p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a solution to these problems, the present inventors discovered that a polyisoprenoid (natural rubber) may be accumulated in rubber particles by binding a cis-prenyltransferase (CPT) family protein, which is a rubber synthase, to rubber particles, and causing an enzymatic reaction (see, for example, WO 2017/002818).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As a result of extensive research and experimentation, the present inventors have found that the above approach is disadvantageous in that the use of rubber particles limits the range of applications because when considering rubber synthesis in cells, limited cells (plants) can produce rubber particles.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Then, the present inventors have conducted extensive research and experimentation to arrive at the use of lipid droplets present in all plants, instead of rubber particles possessed only by special plants.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a lipid droplet has a membrane structure including phospholipids and membrane proteins (for example, oleosins or lipid droplet-associated protein (LDAP)/small rubber particle protein (SRPP) family proteins) and stores triacylglycerols therein.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Rubber particles and lipid droplets are similar in that: the membranes have a single lipid membrane structure; hydrophobic substances are stored inside; and multiple proteins exist on the membranes. Thus, the inventors expected that any enzyme capable of binding to rubber particles could also bind to lipid droplets. Actually, however, it was found that enzymes capable of binding to rubber particles do not bind to lipid droplets.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present disclosure aims to solve the new problem found by the present inventors and provide a fusion protein capable of binding to lipid droplets while having an enzymatic activity to synthesize a hydrophobic compound, a method for producing a substance including accumulating a hydrophobic compound in lipid droplets using the fusion protein, a vector which can enhance production of a hydrophobic compound when it is introduced into cells using genetic recombination techniques, and a transgenic cell into which the vector or a gene coding for the fusion protein has been introduced.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present inventors have investigated why enzymes capable of binding to rubber particles, such as rubber synthases, do not bind to lipid droplets. As a result, they have arrived at a hypothesis that the reason is the difference in the type of lipid forming the membrane between rubber particles and lipid droplets, or in other words that enzymes such as rubber synthases hardly bind to lipid droplets due to the difference in the type of lipid forming the membrane between rubber particles and lipid droplets.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is reported that the binding ability of rubber elongation factors (REFs) capable of binding to rubber particles depends on the type of lipid (Non-Patent Literature 4).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Thus, an attempt was made to fuse an amino acid sequence having an enzymatic activity to synthesize a hydrophobic compound with an amino acid sequence capable of binding to lipid droplets as an anchor (for example, an amino acid sequence derived from a protein originally present in lipid droplets) in order to enhance the lipid droplet-binding ability of an enzyme that has an enzymatic activity to synthesize a hydrophobic compound and that itself is not inherently capable of binding to lipid droplets, such as a rubber synthase.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The inventors revealed that binding to lipid droplets in some cases failed depending on the lipid droplet-binding protein used. They have investigated the cause of the failure and then found that lipid droplet-binding proteins are classified into class I proteins which are originally bound to the membrane upon the formation of lipid droplets and class II proteins which bind to the formed lipid droplets, and that in order to bind a protein to the formed lipid droplets, it is necessary to use a class II protein because class I proteins cannot allow the protein to bind to the formed lipid droplets.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Then, they have found that fusion proteins having a structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> can exhibit sufficient enzymatic activity on lipid droplets.

To the reaction mixture was added 1 mL of saturated saline-saturated n-butanol, followed by agitation for one minute in a vortex mixer. The resulting mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for one minute at room temperature, and then the upper butanol layer was collected to extract a polyisoprenoid. An amount of 50 &#x3bc;L of the extract was added to 3 mL of clear-sol, and the radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (LD6500, BECKMAN COULTER). The background value was subtracted from the measured value and, since 50 &#x3bc;L out of 1 mL was measured, the difference was multiplied by 20 times to calculate the count of the extract as a whole. A higher radioactivity (dpm) means a larger production of the polyisoprenoid (natural rubber), indicating a higher rubber synthesis activity.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0341">Table 6 shows the results.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00010" num="00010"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" rowsep="1">TABLE 6</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Linking conditions</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>First amino acid</entry><entry/><entry>{circle around (1)}: First amino</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>sequence</entry><entry>Second amino</entry><entry>acid sequence</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Lipid droplet-</entry><entry>acid sequence</entry><entry>{circle around (2)}: Second amino</entry><entry>Enzymatic</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>binding protein</entry><entry>Enzyme</entry><entry>acid sequence</entry><entry>activity</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Comparative Example 1</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>AtCPT5</entry><entry>{circle around (2)}</entry><entry>460</entry></row><row><entry>Example 1</entry><entry>LDAP2</entry><entry>AtCPT5</entry><entry>{circle around (1)}-{circle around (2)}</entry><entry>670</entry></row><row><entry>Example 2</entry><entry>LDAP2</entry><entry>AtCPTS</entry><entry>{circle around (2)}-{circle around (1)}</entry><entry>545</entry></row><row><entry>Example 3</entry><entry>LDAP1</entry><entry>AtCPT5</entry><entry>{circle around (2)}-{circle around (1)}</entry><entry>775</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0369" num="0342">As shown in Table 6, the fusion proteins exhibited higher activity on lipid droplets than AtCPT5 alone.</p><heading id="h-0039" level="2">[Electrophoresis Test]</heading><p id="p-0370" num="0343">The reaction solution after protein expression and a lipid droplet fraction obtained by fractionating the reaction solution were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis to confirm expression of the protein and whether the protein was expressed on the purified LD.
