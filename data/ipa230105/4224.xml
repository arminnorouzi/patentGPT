id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">In relation to a tactile presentation panel, a tactile presentation panel has a tactile presentation knob placed on an operation surface and presents a tactile sense to a user via the tactile presentation knob, and includes a control circuit that divides the operation surface into a plurality of regions, assigns a control target to each of divided regions, and sets a tactile sense to be presented for each of the divided regions, a tactile control circuit that generates a tactile sense set by the control circuit for each of the divided regions by changing a frictional force between the operation surface and the tactile presentation knob, and a touch detection circuit that detects a position on the tactile presentation panel of the tactile presentation knob. The tactile presentation knob is placed in the divided region so that the control target is selected.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000"

id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a tactile presentation panel, a tactile presentation touch panel, and a tactile presentation touch display that present a tactile sense to the user via a tactile presentation knob.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A touch panel is widely known as an apparatus that detects and outputs a position (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;touch position&#x201d;) instructed by an indicator such as a finger of the user or a pen on a touch screen, and there is a projected capacitive touch panel (PCAP) as a touch panel using a capacitive sensing system. The PCAP can detect a touch position even in a case where a surface on the user side (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;front surface&#x201d;) of a touch screen is covered with a protective plate such as a glass plate having a thickness of about several mm. Further, the PCAP has advantages such as excellent robustness because a protective plate can be arranged on the front surface, and long life because no movable portion is included.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A touch screen of the PCAP includes a detection row direction wiring layer that detects coordinates of a touch position in a row direction and a detection column direction wiring layer that detects coordinates of a touch position in a column direction. In description below, the detection row direction wiring layer and the detection column direction wiring layer may be collectively referred to as a &#x201c;detection wiring layer&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, a member on which the detection wiring layer is arranged is referred to as a &#x201c;touch screen&#x201d;, and an apparatus in which a detection circuit is connected to the touch screen is referred to as a &#x201c;touch panel&#x201d;. Furthermore, an area where a touch position can be detected on the touch screen is referred to as a &#x201c;detectable area&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the detection wiring layer for detecting electrostatic capacitance (hereinafter, may be simply referred to as &#x201c;capacitance&#x201d;), a first series conductor element formed on a thin dielectric film and a second series conductor element formed on the first series conductor element with an insulating film interposed between them are included. There is no electrical contact between the conductor elements, and one of the first series conductor element and the second series conductor element overlaps the other in plan view when viewed from the normal direction of the front surface. However, there is no electrical contact between the conductor elements, and the conductor elements intersect three-dimensionally.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Coordinates of a touch position of an indicator are identified as capacitance (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as &#x201c;touch capacitance&#x201d;) formed between the indicator and a conductor element which is a detection wiring by a detection circuit. Further, the touch position between conductor elements can be interpolated by a relative value of detected capacitance of one or more conductor elements.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In recent years, a touch panel as an operation panel including a switch or the like has become used for many personal devices instead of a mechanical switch. However, since the touch panel has no unevenness like a mechanical switch and has a uniform touch, a surface shape is not changed by operation. For this reason, it is necessary to perform all the operation processes from position check of a switch to operation execution and operation completion by relying on vision, and there is a problem in reliability of blind operation and operability by a visually handicapped person at the time of operation performed in parallel with other work such as operation of a sound or the like during driving of an automobile.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, since a touch panel has become widely used in an in-vehicle device from the viewpoint of designability, it is difficult to operate the in-vehicle device by blind touch during driving, and from the viewpoint of ensuring safety, attention to a touch panel with a function that enables operation by blind touch is increasing. Further, in consumer devices, a touch panel as an operation panel has become used in many home appliances and electronic devices. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of designability, devices equipped with the PCAP whose surface is protected with cover glass are also increasing. However, since the touch panel has a smooth surface, it is difficult to check the position of a switch by touch, and it is difficult to support universal design. In the case of the PCAP, a smooth glass surface is required as design property, and it is difficult to support universal design such as processing unevenness on a glass surface corresponding to a switch position.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a countermeasure against the above, there is a method of notifying that operation has been accepted and that operation has been completed by voice. However, a function and versatility equivalent to those of a mechanical switch are yet to be achieved, since, for example, an environment in which a voice function can be used is limited due to privacy and noise problems. If there are a function of presenting the position of a switch on the touch panel, a function of receiving operation, and a function of feeding back the completion of operation to the user by tactile sense, it is possible to realize operation by blind touch and support for universal design.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A mobile phone and a smartphone may have a tactile feedback feature using vibration to compensate for operational reliability and non-visual operability. It is expected that a feedback function by vibration in conjunction with operation by the user will rapidly become familiar, and demand for more advanced tactile feedback will increase.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Systems for generating a tactile sense are roughly divided into three types: a vibration system, an ultrasonic system, and an electric system. A feature of the vibration system is that it is possible to coexist with the PCAP and the cost is low. However, the vibration system is unsuitable for incorporation of a vibrator into a housing in a manner that the entire device vibrates sufficiently, and the area cannot be increased due to the limit of output of a vibrator. The ultrasonic system is capable of generating a tactile sense that cannot be generated by other systems, such as a smooth feeling. However, for the same reason as the vibration system, the ultrasonic method is unsuitable for incorporation into a housing, and is disadvantageous in that a large area cannot be obtained. The electric system includes an electrostatic friction system that generates a tactile sense by an electrostatic frictional force and an electric stimulation system that directly applies an electric stimulus to a finger. These systems can generate a tactile sense at an optional position, and a large area can be obtained and multi-touch can be supported.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Hereinafter, this system will be described. Note that, hereinafter, a member in which a tactile electrode is arranged on a transparent insulating substrate is referred to as a &#x201c;tactile presentation screen&#x201d;, and an apparatus in which a detection circuit is connected to the tactile presentation screen is referred to as a &#x201c;tactile presentation panel&#x201d;. Further, an area where a tactile sense can be presented on the tactile presentation screen is referred to as a &#x201c;tactile presentable area&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Regarding a tactile output device for a rotary knob, for example, in Patent Document 1, a knob corresponding to the rotary knob is attached on a screen of a display apparatus to which a touch panel is attached. The knob can be manually rotated by the user, and a projection is provided on a lower surface. When the user performs rotation operation of the knob, the projection moves while being in contact with a touch surface in accordance with the rotation operation. When the projection moves on the touch surface, the rotation operation of the knob is converted into touch operation. In a case where the user performs rotation operation, an actuator is controlled to vibrate the knob with a waveform corresponding to operation content.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent No. 6570799</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In Patent Document 1, since the knob is attached and fixed onto the screen of the display apparatus to which the touch panel is attached, the user cannot perform rotation operation of the rotary knob at an optional position where the user can easily operate the rotary knob. Further, since a tactile sense is presented to the knob by vibration by the control of the actuator, a tactile sense that can be presented to the knob is limited to a vibration feeling and a click feeling, and an operable range defined by stopping the rotation operation cannot be presented. Furthermore, since a frictional force between the screen of the display apparatus and the rotary knob when there is no tactile sense is always constant, a resistance feeling when the knob is rotated cannot be changed. As described above, there is a problem in Patent Document 1 that it is not possible to provide an operation feeling of a dial knob that allows intuitive operation by a tactile sense of the user, and is user-friendly.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present disclosure has been made to solve the above problem, and an object of the present disclosure is to provide a tactile presentation panel, a tactile presentation touch panel, and a tactile presentation touch display that can provide an operation feeling of a dial knob that allows intuitive operation by a tactile sense of the user, and is user-friendly.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means to Solve the Problem</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A tactile presentation panel according to the present disclosure is a tactile presentation panel that has a tactile presentation knob placed on an operation surface and presents a tactile sense to a user via the tactile presentation knob, the tactile presentation panel including a control circuit that divides the operation surface into a plurality of regions, assigns a control target to each of divided regions, and sets a tactile sense to be presented for each of the divided regions, a tactile control circuit that generates a tactile sense set by the control circuit for each of the divided regions by changing a frictional force between the operation surface and the tactile presentation knob, and a touch detection circuit that detects a position on the tactile presentation panel of the tactile presentation knob. The tactile presentation knob is placed in the divided region so that the control target is selected.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, another tactile presentation panel according to the present disclosure is a tactile presentation panel that has a tactile presentation knob placed on an operation surface and presents a tactile sense to a user via the tactile presentation knob, the tactile presentation panel including a control circuit that sets a tactile sense to be presented, a tactile control circuit that generates a tactile sense set by the control circuit by changing a frictional force between the operation surface and the tactile presentation knob, and a touch detection circuit that detects a position on the tactile presentation panel of the tactile presentation knob. The tactile control circuit sets at least the frictional force on the operation surface to guide the tactile presentation knob to a specific region on the operation surface.</p><heading id="h-0008"

The voltage signal V<sub>a </sub>(first voltage signal) of the first voltage generation circuit <b>113</b><i>a </i>has a first frequency. The voltage signal V<sub>b </sub>(second voltage signal) of the second voltage generation circuit <b>113</b><i>b </i>has a second frequency different from the first frequency. An amplitude of the voltage signal V<sub>a </sub>and an amplitude of the voltage signal V<sub>b </sub>may be the same amplitude V<sub>L</sub>. In the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, sine waves having different frequencies are used as the voltage signal V<sub>a </sub>and the voltage signal V<sub>b</sub>. Instead of the sine wave, a pulse wave or one having another shape may be used. In order to generate a sufficiently large tactile sense, the amplitude V<sub>L </sub>is preferably about several tens of volts.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a graph illustrating an amplitude modulation signal V<sub>N </sub>generated by combining the voltage signal V<sub>a </sub>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) and the voltage signal V<sub>b </sub>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The voltage signal V<sub>a </sub>is applied to the first electrode <b>102</b><i>a, </i>and the voltage signal V<sub>b </sub>is applied to the second electrode <b>102</b><i>b. </i>As a result, in a region where the electrostatic capacitance C<sub>NE </sub>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) is formed between each of the first electrode <b>102</b><i>a </i>and the second electrode <b>102</b><i>b </i>and the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b>, charging and discharging are repeated according to the amplitude modulation signal V<sub>N </sub>having a maximum amplitude V<sub>H </sub>that is approximately twice the amplitude V<sub>L</sub>.

The amplitude modulation signal V<sub>N </sub>has a beat frequency corresponding to a difference between the first frequency and the second frequency. Therefore, when the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b> rotates on the tactile presentation screen <b>150</b>, a frictional force acting on the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b> changes at the above-described beat frequency. As a result, the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b> vibrates at a beat frequency.

As described above, the tactile presentation screen <b>150</b> included in the tactile presentation panel <b>100</b> is configured to generate a tactile sense by changing a frictional force applied to the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b> by controlling an electrostatic force applied to the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">As described above, the amplitude modulation signal V<sub>N </sub>having a voltage approximately twice that of each of the input voltage signal V<sub>a </sub>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) and the voltage signal V<sub>b </sub>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) is generated. In this manner, the amplitude modulation signal V<sub>N </sub>necessary for exerting a desired frictional force on the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b> can thus be generated by the voltage signal V<sub>a </sub>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) and the voltage signal V<sub>b </sub>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) having a voltage of approximately &#xbd; of the amplitude modulation signal V<sub>N</sub>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Therefore, as compared with a case where an amplitude modulation signal is directly input to the first electrodes <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b, </i>the same electrostatic force can be generated at a voltage of &#xbd;, and low-voltage driving can be performed.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In order to present a sufficiently large tactile sense to the user, the maximum amplitude V<sub>H </sub>only needs to be sufficiently large in a manner corresponding to the tactile sense, and the amplitude V<sub>L </sub>may be a small value as compared with that. Therefore, the amplitude V<sub>L </sub>itself does not need to be as large as generating a sufficiently large tactile sense. As a result of the amplitude V<sub>L </sub>being set in this way, in a state where only one of the first electrode <b>102</b><i>a </i>and the second electrode <b>102</b><i>b </i>is in contact with the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b>, the user hardly perceives a tactile sense regardless of how the frequencies of the voltage signal V<sub>a </sub>and the voltage signal V<sub>b </sub>are selected.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In order to facilitate positioning of the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b> across the first electrode <b>102</b><i>a </i>and the second electrode <b>102</b><i>b, </i>a pitch P<sub>E </sub>of the tactile electrodes <b>102</b> is preferably smaller than a diameter R<sub>NE </sub>of the contact surface CT.

Since a transparent conductive film such as ITO has a relatively high electric resistance, the transparent conductive film is suitable for application to a small touch screen in which wiring resistance is not a problem. Further, since a transparent conductive film such as ITO is likely to have a wiring disconnected due to corrosion with another metal wiring, consideration for moisture resistance and waterproofness is required in order to prevent corrosion.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Note that, although the case where the structure of the touch screen and the structure of the display panel are independent is described above, they may be inseparably integrated.

The pressure sensitive sensor <b>216</b> detects the pressing force by detecting a change in electrostatic capacitance generated as an interval between the capacitance detection electrodes arranged in the pressure sensitive sensor <b>216</b> becomes small.

The pressure sensitive sensor <b>216</b> is preferably arranged at a position where reproducibility of a relationship between a shape change and a pressing force in the structure of the tactile presentation touch display <b>1</b> is excellent, a shape change caused by a pressing force is large, and the sensitivity of the pressure sensitive sensor <b>216</b> is most excellent.

The tactile electrode <b>102</b> is connected to the tactile presentation panel terminal portion <b>107</b> via the lead-out wiring layer <b>105</b>. The voltage supply circuit <b>110</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) is connected to the tactile presentation panel terminal portion <b>107</b> via the FPC <b>108</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).

A plurality of the tactile electrodes <b>102</b> are arranged at intervals along the arrangement direction (lateral direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>). In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the transparent insulating substrate <b>101</b> has a rectangular shape having long sides and short sides. Therefore, the tactile presentation screen <b>150</b> also has long sides and short sides corresponding to the transparent insulating substrate <b>101</b>.

In a case where the horizontal direction of the tactile presentation screen <b>150</b> as viewed by the viewer is along the long side, the arrangement direction is along the horizontal direction.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Although the example in which the tactile electrodes <b>102</b> extend in the extending direction and are arranged along the arrangement direction on the tactile presentation screen <b>150</b> is described above, the structure of the tactile electrodes <b>102</b> is not limited to this. For example, the configuration may be such that a plurality of segments are arranged in a matrix like the tactile presentation panel <b>100</b><i>a </i>illustrated in FIG. <b>17</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>19</b></figref> illustrate an example of a pattern shape of the tactile electrodes <b>102</b> arranged in a segment of an area A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. The shape of the tactile electrode <b>102</b> is not limited to the shape illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>19</b></figref>, and may be any structure in which mutual capacitance in the same area is larger than mutual capacitance between electrodes in different areas in a structure in which the first electrode <b>102</b><i>a </i>and the second electrode <b>102</b><i>b </i>are adjacent to each other. Specifically, the first electrode <b>102</b><i>a </i>and the second electrode <b>102</b><i>b </i>in the same area are preferably arranged such that a distance between the first electrode <b>102</b><i>a </i>and the second electrode <b>102</b><i>b </i>is smaller than a distance between the first electrode <b>102</b><i>a </i>and the second electrode <b>102</b><i>b </i>different areas. In this manner, the influence of capacitance formed between the detection electrode <b>203</b> of the touch panel <b>200</b> and the tactile electrode <b>102</b> on touch detection accuracy can be suppressed, so that wiring resistance of the tactile electrode <b>102</b> can be further reduced, and tactile strength (tactile sense) can be further improved.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The larger the electrostatic capacitance C<sub>NE </sub>formed between the tactile electrode <b>102</b> and the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b> is, the stronger a tactile sense can be presented. From this viewpoint, it is preferable that the area of the tactile electrode <b>102</b> is large. In a case where priority is given to the size of the area of the tactile electrode <b>102</b>, it is difficult to make the tactile electrode <b>102</b> less likely to be visually recognized by providing a microstructure to the tactile electrode <b>102</b>. In order to make the tactile electrode <b>102</b> less likely to be visually recognized while making the area of the tactile electrode <b>102</b> large, the tactile electrode <b>102</b> may be formed of a transparent conductive film. A typical material of the transparent conductive film is ITO. Since a transparent conductive film such as ITO has a relatively high electric resistance as compared with metal, the transparent conductive film is suitable for application to a small touch screen in which wiring resistance is not a problem. When application to a large touch screen where wiring resistance is a problem is necessary, the ITO film thickness is made large or the content of a dopant is increased to reduce the resistivity. In this case, since a light absorption rate of ITO may change and the touch screen may appear colored, it may be necessary to adjust the color tone of the display. Further, since a transparent conductive film such as ITO is likely to have a wiring disconnected due to corrosion with another metal wiring, consideration for moisture resistance and waterproofness is required in order to prevent corrosion in a case where wiring resistance of the electrode is lowered by a lamination structure of with other metal.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Instead of using the transparent conductive film as described above, the tactile electrode <b>102</b> may be a single layer film or a multilayer film of metal, or an electrode (hereinafter, also referred to as &#x201c;metal film-containing electrode&#x201d;) having a multilayer structure including any of these and also using another conductive material. As the metal, for example, low resistance metal such as aluminum or silver is preferable. By using the metal film-containing electrode, wiring resistance can be reduced. In contrast, a metal film, which is opaque, is easily visually recognized. Therefore, in order to make the metal film less likely to be visually recognized, a thin wire structure is preferably provided to the metal film-containing electrode. The thin wire structure is typically mesh-like.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The dielectric layer <b>106</b> includes a single-layer film of an organic insulating film, a single-layer film of an inorganic insulating film, or a multilayer film. In a case of a multilayer film, different types of organic insulating films may be laminated, or different types of inorganic insulating films may be laminated, or an organic insulating film and an inorganic insulating film may be laminated. The inorganic insulating film has high moisture impermeability, high hardness, and high abrasion resistance. Since the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b> rotates on the dielectric layer <b>106</b>, the dielectric layer <b>106</b> requires high abrasion resistance. The organic insulating film is preferable for obtaining high flatness, but has low hardness and low abrasion resistance. For this reason, in order to obtain both high flatness and high abrasion resistance, it is preferable to form the inorganic insulating film on the organic insulating film. As the inorganic insulating film, for example, a transparent silicon-based inorganic insulating film such as a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, or a silicon oxynitride film, or a transparent inorganic insulating film composed of a metal oxide such as alumina is used. As a material of the organic insulating film, a polymer material having a main chain composed of a silicon oxide, a silicon nitride film, or a silicon oxynitride film and having an organic substance bonded to a side chain or a functional group of the main chain, or thermosetting resin having a main chain composed of carbon can be used. Examples of the thermosetting resin include acrylic resin, polyimide resin, epoxy resin, novolak resin, and olefin resin.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The electrostatic capacitance C<sub>NE </sub>is represented by Equation (1) below.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>C</i><sub>NE</sub><i>=Q/V=&#x3b5;S/d </i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0137" num="0135">Here, Q is a charge amount stored in each of a conductive elastic portion <b>6</b> and the tactile electrode <b>102</b>, V is a voltage between the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b> and the tactile electrode <b>102</b>, &#x3b5; is a dielectric constant of the dielectric layer <b>106</b>, S is a contact area between the conductive elastic portion <b>6</b> and the tactile electrode <b>102</b> via the dielectric layer <b>106</b>, and d is a thickness of the dielectric layer <b>106</b>. The electrostatic capacitance C<sub>NE </sub>is proportional to the dielectric constant &#x3b5; and is inversely proportional to the film thickness d.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0136">From Equation (1) above, the dielectric constant c is preferably high in order to make the electrostatic capacitance C<sub>NE </sub>large. Specifically, the dielectric layer <b>106</b> preferably includes a film (hereinafter, also referred to as a &#x201c;high dielectric constant insulating film&#x201d;) having a relative dielectric constant of 10 or more. In the high dielectric constant insulating film, a state in which positive and negative charges are displaced into a material by an electric field applied from the outside occurs (this is generally referred to as dielectric polarization). In the dielectric polarization, charges (generally referred to as polarization charges) generated by polarization are maintained while voltage is held, and when the voltage decreases, the polarization charges decrease and the dielectric polarization decreases, and when the applied voltage is set to zero volt, the dielectric polarization also disappears. The direction of the dielectric polarization can be changed by an electric field. The high dielectric constant insulating film may be used as a single layer, or may be used as a multilayer film by being laminated with another inorganic insulating film or organic insulating film of a low dielectric constant, or another high dielectric constant insulating film. In general, since a refractive index is higher as a dielectric constant is higher, a lamination structure of a high refractive index film and a low refractive index film is obtained as a high dielectric constant insulating film and a low dielectric constant insulating film are laminated. With this lamination structure, the dielectric layer <b>106</b> can also function as an antireflection film.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0137">Further, from Equation (1) above, the thickness d is preferably small in order to make the electrostatic capacitance C<sub>NE </sub>large. By laminating a high dielectric constant insulating film and an organic insulating film, the film thickness of the organic insulating film can be reduced while sufficient insulation is secured. In this manner, the thickness d of the dielectric layer <b>106</b> can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0138">Assuming that the tactile electrode has a matrix structure (that is, a structure having an X electrode and a Y electrode crossing each other) (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2015-097076), a step, that is, unevenness is generated at an intersection between the X electrode and the Y electrode. This unevenness is flattened if the thickness of the insulating layer covering the unevenness is large. However, the thickness of the insulating layer is limited in order to avoid an excessive decrease in the electrostatic capacitance C<sub>NE</sub>. For this reason, unevenness may occur on a front surface of the tactile presentation screen. When the texture feeling of the unevenness is mixed with the texture feeling caused by an electrostatic force from the tactile electrode, it is difficult to give an intended texture feeling to the user. In a case where an organic insulating film having an effect of flattening a surface shape is used as the dielectric layer <b>106</b>, although occurrence of the unevenness is avoided, a large thickness is required to some extent for flattening, and a decrease in the electrostatic capacitance C<sub>NE </sub>cannot be avoided.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0139">In contrast, according to the first embodiment, since the tactile electrode <b>102</b> has no intersection, the size of the unevenness can be suppressed to about the thickness of the tactile electrode <b>102</b>. This makes it possible to thin the organic film having a flattening effect or to apply a high dielectric constant insulating film having a low flattening effect. In this manner, the electrostatic capacitance C<sub>NE </sub>can be made larger than that in the case of the matrix structure. Further, since a contact surface with the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b> of the tactile presentation screen <b>150</b> has less unevenness, a tactile sense caused by surface unevenness is not given to the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b> when signal voltage is not applied. For this reason, a tactile sense of the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b> when signal voltage is applied becomes clearer.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">Further, even if the electrostatic capacitance C<sub>NE </sub>is the same, if the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b> is slippery on the dielectric layer <b>106</b>, a change in an electrostatic force between the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b> and the tactile electrode <b>102</b> is easily perceived by the user as a change in a frictional force. In this manner, a larger tactile sense can be given to the user. In order to make the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b> slippery on the dielectric layer <b>106</b>, it is necessary to suppress adhesion between the dielectric layer <b>106</b> and the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b>.

In contrast, in a case where the tactile presentation knob <b>3</b> is located above the boundary between the first electrode <b>102</b><i>a </i>and the second electrode <b>102</b><i>b, </i>a tactile sense is generated.

When the adhesion between the conductive elastic portion <b>6</b> and a surface of the tactile presentation panel decreases due to a decrease in flatness and increase unevenness and minute unevenness on a surface of the tactile presentation panel <b>100</b>, or the like caused by processing accuracy of the rotation portion <b>4</b> or the fixing portion <b>5</b> (rotation shaft portion <b>5</b><i>a</i>) or assembly accuracy of the tactile presentation screen <b>150</b>, the tactile electrode <b>102</b> and the conductive elastic portion <b>6</b> form electrostatic capacitance not only via the dielectric layer but also via air having a small dielectric constant, and the electrostatic capacitance formed between the tactile electrode <b>102</b> and the conductive elastic portion <b>6</b> decreases, resulting in a decrease in tactile strength. Since the conductive elastic portion <b>6</b> has elasticity, a gap between the dielectric layer and the conductive elastic portion <b>6</b> due to unevenness is filled, and it is possible to prevent a decrease in tactile strength due to a decrease in adhesion.
