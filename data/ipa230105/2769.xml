Inflammatory diseases, both acute and chronic, are an important disease category that is still not completely understood.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract suffered by approximately 1.4 million patients in the United States. It is one of the five most prevalent gastrointestinal disease burdens in the United States, with an overall health care cost of more than $1.7 billion. Each year in the United States, inflammatory bowel disease accounts for more than 700,000 physician visits, 100,000 hospitalizations, and disability in 119,000 patients. No medical cure currently exists, so disease management requires a lifetime of care.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The two most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Although Crohn's disease can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract, it primarily affects the ileum (the distal or lower portion of the small intestine) and the large intestine. Ulcerative colitis primarily affects the colon and the rectum. The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is not completely understood, although both environmental and genetic factors are believed to play a role in the disease. Environmental components may include alterations in flora of the gut which are affected by exposure to ingested foods and medications.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Inflammatory bowel disease is associated with abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, severe cramps, muscle spasms, weight loss, malnutrition, fever, and anemia. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease may also suffer from skin lesions, joint pain, eye inflammation, and liver disorders, and children suffering from ulcerative colitis may suffer from growth defects. Although rarely fatal, these symptoms decrease quality of life for patients.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there is a pressing need to develop reliable methods of treating inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. There is a further need to identify methods of treatment that provide effective and permanent relief from symptoms across a broad spectrum of patients and which are not associated with negative side effects or cycles of inflammation and remission.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Described herein are agents, for example, IL-34 antisense oligonucleotides, that inhibit IL-34 gene expression. In some embodiments, the invention provides an IL-34 antisense oligonucleotide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, that includes the antisense oligonucleotide sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs:1-8 described herein. For example, an IL-34 antisense oligonucleotide of the invention can be an antisense oligonucleotide that includes the sequence: 5&#x2032;-CTCACCAAGACCCACAG-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO:1), wherein at least one nucleoside is a chemically modified nucleoside and/or at least one linkage is a modified internucleoside linkage; 5&#x2032;-GGCTTTGGGCCGCACCAGCT-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO:2), wherein at least one nucleoside is a chemically modified nucleoside and/or at least one linkage is a modified internucleoside linkage; 5&#x2032;-CTTTGGGCCGCACCAGCTTC-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO:3), wherein at least one nucleoside is a chemically modified nucleoside and/or at least one linkage is a modified internucleoside linkage; 5&#x2032;-TGGGCCGCACCAGCTTCAGG-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO:4), wherein at least one nucleoside is a chemically modified nucleoside and/or at least one linkage is a modified internucleoside linkage; 5&#x2032;-TCCATGACCCGGAAGCAGTT-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO:5), wherein at least one nucleoside is a chemically modified nucleoside and/or at least one linkage is a modified internucleoside linkage; or 5&#x2032;-TGTTTCATGTACTGAAG-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO:6), wherein at least one nucleoside is a chemically modified nucleoside and/or at least one linkage is a modified internucleoside linkage, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In some embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO:3, wherein at least one nucleoside is a chemically modified nucleotide and/or at least one linkage is a modified internucleoside linkage.

Antisense therapeutics may be single- or double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based, ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based, mixed DNA and RNA-based, or DNA/RNA chemical analogue compounds. In general, antisense therapeutics are designed to include a nucleotide sequence that is complementary or nearly complementary to an mRNA or pre-mRNA sequence transcribed from a given gene in order to promote binding between the antisense therapeutic and the pre-mRNA or mRNA. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that in most instances antisense therapeutics act by binding to an mRNA or pre-mRNA, thereby inhibiting protein translation, altering pre-mRNA splicing into mature mRNA, and/or causing destruction of mRNA. In most instances, the antisense therapeutic nucleotide sequence is complementary to a portion of a targeted gene's or mRNA's sense sequence. IL-34 antisense therapeutics described herein are oligonucleotide-based compounds that include an oligonucleotide sequence complementary to a IL-34 gene sense, IL-34 pre-mRNA sense, and/or IL-34 mRNA sense sequence, or a portion thereof. IL-34 antisense therapeutics described herein can also be nucleotide chemical analog-based compounds capable of binding to a IL-34 gene sense, IL-34 pre-mRNA sense, and/or IL-34 mRNA sense sequence, or a portion thereof.

A &#x201c;modified internucleoside linkage&#x201d; refers to a connection between the 3&#x2032; position of a nucleoside and the 5&#x2032; position of an adjacent nucleoside that is not natural. For example, in some embodiments, a modified internucleoside linkage may include, but is not limited to: a phosphorothioate linkage; a phosphorodithioate linkage, a phosphotriester linkage, an alkylphosphonate linkage, an aminoalkylphosphotriester linkage, an alkylene phosphonate linkage, a phosphinate linkage, a phosphoramidate linkage, an aminoalkylphosphoramidate linkage, a thiophosphoramidate linkage, a thionoalkylphosphonate linkage, a thionoalkylphosphotriester linkage, a thiophosphate linkage, a selenophosphate linkage, or a boranophosphate linkage</p><p id="p-0121" num="0135">In some embodiments, AONs described herein may include at least one chemically modified nucleoside and at least one modified internucleoside linkage.

IL-34 PNAs described herein can be used as antisense therapeutics that bind to IL-34 RNA sequences with high specificity and inhibit IL-34 gene expression.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0138">Locked nucleic acids (LNAs) are oligonucleotide sequences that include one or more modified RNA nucleotides in which the ribose moiety is modified with an extra bridge connecting the 2&#x2032; oxygen and 4&#x2032; carbon. LNAs are believed to have higher Tm's than analogous oligonucleotide sequences. IL-34 LNAs described herein can be used as antisense therapeutics that bind to IL-34 RNA sequences with high specificity and inhibit IL-34 gene expression.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0139">Morpholino oligomers are oligonucleotide compounds that include DNA bases attached to a backbone of methylenemorpholine rings linked through phosphorodiamidate groups. Morpholino oligomers of the present invention can be designed to bind to specific IL-34 RNA sequences of interest (for example, IL-34 mRNA or IL-34 pre-mRNA sequences of interest), thereby preventing gene expression. IL-34 morpholino oligomers described herein can be used as antisense therapeutics that bind to IL-34 mRNA sequences with high specificity and inhibit IL-34 gene expression. IL-34 morpholino oligomers described herein can also be used to bind IL-34 pre-mRNA sequences, altering IL-34 pre-mRNA splicing and IL-34 gene expression.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0140">Small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are generally RNA molecules with a hairpin-like structure that can be used to silence gene expression. shRNAs are generally expressed from plasmids encoding the shRNA sequence, and can be expressed from viral vectors to allow lentiviral, adenoviral, or adeno-associated viral expression. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that shRNA inhibits gene expression by taking advantage of RNA interference (RNAi) processes. In brief, the shRNA transcript is processed by Drosha and Dicer, and then loaded onto the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), allowing targeting of specific mRNA, and either mRNA degradation or repression of protein translation. IL-34 shRNAs described herein can inhibit gene expression of IL-34.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0141">Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are double-stranded RNA molecules of approximately 20-25 base pairs in length (but which can also be, for example, 18-30 base pairs in length) that take advantage of RNAi machinery (e.g., Drosha and RISC) to bind and target mRNA for degradation. siRNAs are not dependent upon plasmids or vectors for expression, and can generally be delivered directly to a target cell, for instance, by transfection. IL-34 siRNAs are double-stranded RNA sequences that include an RNA sequence complementary to a IL-34 mRNA sequence, and which prevent IL-34 protein translation. IL-34 siRNAs described herein include siRNAs that include the nucleotide sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOs:1-23, for example, the nucleotide sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOs:1-8, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0142">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecule containing about 22 nucleotides that function in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. miRNAs include sequences that are complementary to portions of an mRNA sequence. miRNAs are produced from long, single-stranded RNA molecules exhibiting highly specific stem-loop structures.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease. Inflammatory bowel diseases are autoimmune diseases of the digestive system. Crohn's disease may be localized to any portion of the gastrointestinal tract, including the terminal ileum, and may impact all cell types of the gastrointestinal tract. Ulcerative colitis is localized to the colon and rectum, and affects cells of the mucosa only.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0206">Inflammatory Crohn's disease is characterized by abnormal immune response that causes excess gastrointestinal inflammation. Inflammatory Crohn's disease most often affects the intestinal walls, including portions of the small and/or large intestine, for example, the ileum and the colon. Inflammatory Crohn's disease is also associated with development of thick and swollen tissue, as well as ulcers. Mutations in genes that play a role in immune system function (e.g., NOD2, ATG16L1, IL23R, and IRGM) are associated with Crohn's disease, as are genes associated with proper autophagy.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0207">Fibrostricturing Crohn's disease is a form of Crohn's disease that includes the occurrence of fibrostenotic lesions/fibrotic strictures of the gastrointestinal tract. Fibrotic strictures are more often associated with Crohn's disease of the ileum, as opposed to the colon. Inflammation generally precedes the development strictures. Strictures can be associated with any of the following symptoms: abdominal cramping, abdominal pain, abdominal bloating and distension, loss of appetite, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. More than 50% of patients that suffer from Crohn's disease experience fibrostenosis.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0208">Fibrotic strictures are associated with cell surface IL-17A receptor expression and increased collagen production, including collagen subtypes I, III, and V. Fibrotic strictures are also associated with co-occurrence of fistulas. Strictures are histologically characterized by the presence of a mixture of inflammatory and mesenchymal cells with deposition of an excess of extracellular matrix (ECM). Activated mesenchymal cells of the intestine accumulate ECM components, including fibronectin and collagen (for example, collagen types III and IV). Disorganized smooth muscle proliferation and excess ECM deposition are believed to modify the mechanical properties of stenotic bowel tissue, resulting in increased stiffness and narrowing of the intestinal tract associated with fibrotic strictures. The presence of fibrotic strictures results in intestinal tissue abnormalities in both the mucosal, submucosal, and muscular layers of the intestinal wall.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0209">Both environmental and genetic factors are believed to play a role in inflammatory bowel diseases, although the identity of such factors is not well-defined. For example, habitual smoking doubles the risk of developing Crohn's disease. Environmental components may include alterations in flora of the gut which are affected by exposure to ingested foods and medications.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0210">Inflammatory bowel diseases are associated with symptoms including abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, severe cramps, muscle spasms, weight loss, malnutrition, fever, anemia, skin lesions, joint pain, eye inflammation, liver disorders, arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and non-thyroidal illness syndrome, and treating these symptoms using a disclosed antisense compound is also contemplated in an embodiment, for example, treating children suffering from ulcerative colitis who may also suffer from growth defects.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Intestinal Fibrosis</heading><p id="p-0183" num="0211">Intestinal fibrosis commonly results from the reaction of intestinal tissue to inflammation, such as chronic inflammation caused by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In IBD, increased levels of SMAD7 block anti-inflammatory gene expression mediated via TGF-&#x3b2; pathway activation and Smad2/3 phosphorylation. Myofibroblasts exposed to increased TGF-&#x3b2; signaling produce increased amounts of collagen. In the context of Crohn's disease, persistent and chronic inflammation promotes fibrotic processes, resulting in the formation of strictures, including small bowel and colonic strictures.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0212">Intestinal fibrosis can be identified by any of a number of imaging techniques, such as contrast-enhanced ultrasonography. See, e.g., Quaia et al. The value of small bowel wall contrast enhancement after sulfur hexafluoride-filled microbubble injection to differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic strictures in patients with Crohn's disease. <i>Ultrasound Med.

The IL-34 inhibitors of the invention may also be used in combination with other drugs for treating drug and/or alcohol abuse, renal fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, endomyocardial fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, myelofibrosis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, drug and/or alcohol abuse.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Treatment and Evaluation</heading><p id="p-0194" num="0222">A &#x201c;patient&#x201d; or &#x201c;subject&#x201d; as described herein, refers to any animal at risk for, suffering from or diagnosed for an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease, including, but not limited to, mammals, primates, and humans. In certain embodiments, the patient may be a non-human mammal such as, for example, a cat, a dog, or a horse. A patient may be an individual diagnosed with a high risk of developing an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease, someone who has been diagnosed with an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease, someone who previously suffered from an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease, or an individual evaluated for symptoms or indications of an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease, for example, IL-34 expression signal.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0223">A &#x201c;patient in need,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a patient suffering from any of the symptoms or manifestations of an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease, a patient who may suffer from any of the symptoms or manifestations of an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease, or any patient who might benefit from a method of the disclosure for treating an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease. A patient in need may include a patient who is diagnosed with a risk of developing an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease, a patient who has suffered from an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease in the past, or a patient who has previously been treated for an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease. Of particular relevance are individuals that suffer from an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease associated with increased levels of IL-34 expression or activity.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0224">The terms &#x201c;treat&#x201d;, &#x201c;treatment&#x201d;, &#x201c;treating&#x201d; and the like are used herein to generally mean obtaining a desired pharmacological and/or physiological effect. The effect may be prophylactic in terms of completely or partially preventing a disease or symptom thereof and/or may be therapeutic in terms of partially or completely curing a disease and/or adverse effect attributed to the disease. The term &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; as used herein covers any treatment of a disease in a mammal, particularly a human, and includes: (a) preventing the disease from occurring in a subject which may be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (b) inhibiting the disease, i.e. preventing the disease from increasing in severity or scope; (c) relieving the disease, i.e. causing partial or complete amelioration of the disease; or (d) preventing relapse of the disease, i.e. preventing the disease from returning to an active state following previous successful treatment of symptoms of the disease or treatment of the disease.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0225">An &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; or a &#x201c;pharmaceutically effective amount,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the amount of an agent that is sufficient to at least partially treat a condition when administered to a patient. The therapeutically effective amount will vary depending on the severity of the condition, the route of administration of the component, and the age, weight, etc. of the patient being treated. Accordingly, an effective amount of a disclosed IL-34 antisense oligonucleotide is the amount of the IL-34 antisense oligonucleotide necessary to treat an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease in a patient such that administration of the agent prevents an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease from occurring in a subject, prevents an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease progression (e.g., prevents the onset or increased severity of symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease such as rectal bleeding, anemia, or gastrointestinal inflammation), or relieves or completely ameliorates some or all associated symptoms of an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease, e.g., causes regression of the disease.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0226">Efficacy of treatment may be evaluated by means of evaluation of gross symptoms associated with an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease, analysis of tissue histology, biochemical assay, imaging methods such as, for example, magnetic resonance imaging, or other known methods. For instance, efficacy of treatment may be evaluated by analyzing gross symptoms of the disease such as changes in abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, cramps, muscle spasms, weight loss, malnutrition, fever, anemia or other aspects of gross pathology associated with an inflammatory disease following administration of a disclosed IL-34 antisense oligonucleotide to a patient suffering from an inflammatory disease.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0227">Efficacy of treatment may also be evaluated at the tissue or cellular level, for example, by means of obtaining a tissue biopsy (e.g., a gastrointestinal tissue biopsy) and evaluating gross tissue or cell morphology or staining properties. Biochemical assays that examine protein or RNA expression may also be used to evaluate efficacy of treatment. For instance, one may evaluate IL-34, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, or levels of another protein or gene product indicative of an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease, inflammatory cytokine production, or an IL-34 mediated inflammatory response in dissociated cells or non-dissociated tissue via immunocytochemical, immunohistochemical, Western blotting, or Northern blotting methods, or methods useful for evaluating RNA levels such as quantitative or semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. One may also evaluate the presence or level of expression of useful biomarkers found in fecal matter, plasma, or serum to evaluate disease state and efficacy of treatment.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0228">In evaluating efficacy of treatment, suitable controls may be chosen to ensure a valid assessment. For instance, one can compare symptoms evaluated in a patient with an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease following administration of a disclosed IL-34 inhibitor, for example an IL-34 antisense oligonucleotide, to those symptoms in the same patient prior to treatment or at an earlier point in the course of treatment or in another patient not diagnosed with the inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease. Alternatively, one may compare the results of biochemical or histological analysis of gastrointestinal tissue following administration of a disclosed IL-34 inhibitor, for example an IL-34 antisense oligonucleotide, with those of gastrointestinal tissue from the same patient or from an individual not diagnosed with the inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease or from the same patient prior to administration of the IL-34 inhibitor. Additionally, one may compare blood, serum, cell, or fecal samples following administration of the IL-34 inhibitor, for example an IL-34 antisense oligonucleotide, with comparable samples from an individual not diagnosed with the inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease or from the same patient prior to administration of the IL-34 antisense inhibitor.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0229">Validation of IL-34 inhibition may be determined by direct or indirect assessment of IL-34 expression levels or activity. For instance, biochemical assays that measure IL-34 protein or RNA expression may be used to evaluate overall IL-34 inhibition. For instance, one may measure IL-34 protein levels in gastrointestinal tissue by Western blot to evaluate overall IL-34 levels. One may also measure IL-34 mRNA levels by means of Northern blot or quantitative polymerase chain reaction to determine overall IL-34 inhibition. One may also evaluate IL-34 protein levels or levels of another protein indicative of IL-34 signaling activity in dissociated cells, non-dissociated tissue, blood, serum, or fecal matter via immunocytochemical or immunohistochemical methods.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0230">IL-34 inhibition may also be evaluated indirectly by measuring parameters such as macrophage or monocyte generation or proliferation, or measuring alterations in other parameters correlated with changes in IL-34 activity, including MAP kinase phosphorylation and other indicators of signaling activation of the IL-34 receptor&#x2014;the macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR-1, also known as MCSFR-1, M-CSFR1, and CSF1R). For instance, one may measure levels of active MAPK1 or MAPK3 phosphorylation in cells of a patient treated with a disclosed IL-34 inhibitor, for example an IL-34 antisense oligonucleotide, as an indication of IL-34 activity in said cells. One may also evaluate the presence or level of expression of useful biomarkers found in plasma, blood, fecal matter or tissue to evaluate efficacy of IL-34 inhibition.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0231">Methods of treatment disclosed herein include methods of inhibiting inflammatory cytokine production. &#x201c;Inflammatory cytokine production&#x201d; refers to the expression of cytokines that initiate and/or promote an inflammatory cytokine response. An &#x201c;inflammatory cytokine response&#x201d; refers to an immune response that may be characterized by granulocyte recruitment, lymphocyte recruitment, systemic inflammation (especially of the gastrointestinal tract or a portion or portions thereof), fever, tissue destruction, shock, and/or death. An inflammatory cytokine response may be characterized by binding of individual cytokines to their cognate cell surface receptor (e.g., IL-34 binding to CSF1R) and subsequent cascades of intracellular signaling that alter cell functions and gene expression. Inflammatory cytokines include, but are not limited to IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-34, and TNF-alpha. Expression of inflammatory cytokines may occur in, for example, macrophages, monocytes, propia lamina mononuclear cells, or other cells of the gastrointestinal tract or cells of the immune system. Methods of inhibiting inflammatory cytokine production include methods that reduce expression levels of some or all inflammatory cytokines in a patient suffering from an inflammatory disease. Methods of inhibiting inflammatory cytokine production also include methods that reduce expression levels of some or all inflammatory cytokines in cells of a patient suffering from an inflammatory disease.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0232">Methods of the disclosure for inhibiting inflammatory cytokine production include methods of reducing or inhibiting an IL-34 mediated inflammatory response. An &#x201c;IL-34 mediated inflammatory response,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to an inflammatory response initiated, facilitated, or promoted by IL-34 expression or IL-34 signaling activity. An IL-34 mediated inflammatory response may result in expression of inflammatory cytokines including, but not limited to, IL-34, IL-6, IL-8, or TNF-alpha, and activation of inflammatory cytokine signaling. Additionally, an IL-34 mediated inflammatory response may be characterized by granulocyte recruitment, lymphocyte recruitment, systemic inflammation (especially of the gastrointestinal tract or a portion or portions thereof), fever, tissue destruction, shock, and/or death. An IL-34 mediated inflammatory response may also be characterized by activation of IL-34 signaling, for instance, binding of IL-34 to CSF1R and phosphorylation of downstream MAP kinases. Reducing or inhibiting an IL-34 mediated inflammatory response refers to alleviating any or all of the cellular and systemic changes associated with an IL-34 mediated inflammatory response. For example, a reduction in inflammatory cytokine production, immune cell recruitment, or tissue inflammation would indicate reducing or inhibiting of an IL-34 mediated inflammatory response.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0233">The disclosure also provides methods of inhibiting IL-34 in cells of a patient suffering from an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease. IL-34 may be inhibited in any cell in which IL-34 expression or activity occurs, including cells of the gastrointestinal tract, immune system, and blood. Cells of the gastrointestinal tract (including cells of the intestinal wall, the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, large intestine, small intestine, ileum, colon, rectum and anal canal), include columnar epithelial cells, intestinal stromal cells, mucosal epithelial cells, zymogenic cells, neck mucus cells, parietal cells, gastrin cells, Goblet cells, Paneth cells, oligomucus cells, and villus absorptive cells. Cells of the immune system include leukocytes, phagocytes (e.g., macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells), monocytes, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, natural killer cells, innate cells, lymphocytes, B cells, and T cells. Blood cells include red blood cells (erythrocytes) and white blood cells (leukocytes, monocytes, and platelets).</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Pharmaceutical Compositions and Routes of Administration</heading><p id="p-0206" num="0234">The present disclosure also provides methods for treating an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease via administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a disclosed IL-34 inhibitor, for example an IL-34 antisense oligonucleotide.

A pharmaceutical composition should be formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Useful formulations can be prepared by methods well known in the pharmaceutical art. For example, see <i>Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, </i>18th ed. (Mack Publishing Company, 1990).</p><p id="p-0210" num="0238">Pharmaceutical formulations, for example, are sterile. Sterilization can be accomplished, for example, by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. Where the composition is lyophilized, filter sterilization can be conducted prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0239">Parenteral Administration</p><p id="p-0212" num="0240">The pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure can be formulated for parenteral administration, e.g., formulated for injection via the intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intralesional, or intraperitoneal routes. The preparation of an aqueous composition, such as an aqueous pharmaceutical composition containing a disclosed IL-34 inhibitor, for example an IL-34 antisense oligonucleotide, will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. Typically, such compositions can be prepared as injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions; solid forms suitable for using to prepare solutions or suspensions upon the addition of a liquid prior to injection can also be prepared; and the preparations can also be emulsified.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0241">The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions; formulations including sesame oil, peanut oil or aqueous propylene glycol; and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0242">Solutions of active compounds as free base or pharmacologically acceptable salts can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant, such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. In addition, sterile, fixed oils may be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid can be used in the preparation of injectables. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension, or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P., and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In one embodiment, a disclosed IL-34 inhibitor may be suspended in a carrier or excipient fluid comprising 1% (w/v) sodium carboxymethylcellulose and 0.1% (v/v) TWEEN&#x2122; 80. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0243">Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. Sterile injectable solutions of the disclosure may be prepared by incorporating a disclosed IL-34 inhibitor, for example an IL-34 antisense oligonucleotide, in the required amount of the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0244">The preparation of more, or highly concentrated solutions for intramuscular injection is also contemplated. In this regard, the use of DMSO as solvent is preferred as this will result in extremely rapid penetration, delivering high concentrations of the disclosed IL-34 antisense oligonucleotide to a small area.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0245">Suitable preservatives for use in such a solution include benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, chlorobutanol, thimerosal and the like.
