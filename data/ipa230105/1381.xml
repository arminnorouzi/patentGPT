In order to suppress such climate fluctuations and environmental pollution and realize a low-carbon society, studies have been made on a method for carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) of separating and collecting an acidic gas such as carbon dioxide or hydrogen sulfide from an exhaust gas containing a large amount of water vapor discharged from these large-scale facilities and capturing and storing it in the ground or under the seabed. However, in the current technology, the energy cost required for CCS is very high, and a significant reduction in the energy cost is required. In particular, the process of separating and recovering carbon dioxide occupies about 60% of the energy cost in CCS, and therefore in order to reduce the energy cost in CCS, it is essential to increase the efficiency of the process of separating and recovering carbon dioxide and to save energy considerably. Also in the field of energy supply, processes for separating and recovering acidic gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide and water vapor from natural gas having a high carbon dioxide concentration, coal gas generated by an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), and fuel gas such as hydrogen used in a fuel cell have been carried out, and high-efficiency and energy-saving separation and recovering processes for carbon dioxide are also important in reducing energy costs in such fields.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Here, for gas separation and recovery, specifically, employed is a process of once absorbing the gas targeted for separation and recovery and then desorbing it. Consequently, for reducing the energy cost, development of gas-absorbing materials that can efficiently absorb and desorb acidic gases such as carbon dioxide at low cost has been actively progressing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, PTLs 1 and 2 propose use of gel particles of a polymer compound having an amino group as a gas-absorbing material. The gel particles exhibit gas absorption/desorption performance such that they have a high basicity at a temperature of about 30&#xb0; C. and absorb carbon dioxide, but when heated up to about 75&#xb0; C., the basicity thereof lowers and they desorb carbon dioxide. By utilizing such performance, it is said that a gas absorbing material inexpensive and excellent in reversible gas absorption performance can be provided.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="2">PTL 1: WO2016/024633</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="2">PTL 2: WO2017/146231</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As described above, it has been known that gel particles of a polymer compound having an amino group have excellent gas absorption/desorption performance. The present inventors evaluated the practicability of the gel particles and have confirmed that, by actually forming the gel particles into films or filling them in a column, excellent gas absorption/desorption performance is attained. On the other hand, for further increasing the gas absorption/desorption performance, it has been found that merely forming into films or filling in a column is limited and it is necessary to devise from a new viewpoint.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, in order to solve such a problem of the conventional art, the present inventors have made further studies for the purpose of providing a gas-absorbing material having a much higher gas absorption/desorption speed by using amino group-having polymer compound particles.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As a result of assiduous studies made for the purpose of solving the above-mentioned problems, the present inventors have reached a finding that, when fine particles having a primary particle diameter of 1000 nm or less are added to a gas-absorbing material that uses amino group-having polymer compound particles, then the gas absorbing speed and desorbing speed of the gas-absorbing material can be extremely improved.

In this description, the numerical range expressed by a wording &#x201c;a number to another number&#x201d; means a range that falls between the former number indicating the lower limit of the range and the latter number indicating the upper limit thereof. Also in this description, &#x201c;(meth)acrylamide&#x201d; means &#x201c;acrylamide&#x201d; and &#x201c;methacrylamide&#x201d;. Room temperature means 20&#xb0; C.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">&#x3c;Gas-Absorbing Material&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The gas-absorbing material of the present invention contains amino group-having polymer compound particles and fine particles having a primary particle diameter of 1000 nm or less (excepting the &#x201c;amino group-having polymer compound particles&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the present invention, &#x201c;containing fine particles having a primary particle diameter of 1000 nm or less (excepting the &#x201c;amino group-having polymer compound particles&#x201d;)&#x201d; means that the material further contains fine particles having a primary particle diameter of 1000 nm or less in addition to the amino group-having polymer compound particles. In the following description, &#x201c;fine particles having a primary particle diameter of 1000 nm or less (excepting the &#x201c;amino group-having polymer compound particles&#x201d;)&#x201d; may be simply referred to as &#x201c;fine particles&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The gas-absorbing material has a high gas absorption/desorption speed and a large gas absorption/desorption amount and exhibits excellent reversible gas absorption performance. This is assumed to be due to the following mechanism.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Namely, as shown in Examples give hereinunder, when a gas-absorbing material containing an amino group-having polymer compound particles and fine particles having a primary particle diameter of 1000 nm or less is molded, open pores not seen in a gas-absorbing material not containing fine particles are formed inside it. The open pores are considered to effectively function as a gas diffusion phase. Consequently, in the gas-absorbing material, the introduced gas can readily penetrate into the inside thereof and reacts with the amino group of the polymer compound particles therefore bringing about a state where the gas has been sufficiently absorbed within a short period of time. In addition, when the gas is desorbed from the polymer compound particles, depending on the condition changes such as temperature change and gas partial pressure change, the desorbed gas can readily diffuse outside through the gas diffusion phase. According to such a mechanism, it is presumed that the gas-absorbing material of the present invention can have a high gas absorption/desorption speed and can exhibit excellent reversible gas absorption performance.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In particular, in the case where the fine particles are water-repellent fine particles, the inside of the open pores can be repellent to water and therefore water can hardly exist inside the pores. As a result, the pores can more effectively function as a gas diffusion phase therefore exhibiting more excellent reversible gas absorption performance. Here, regarding the meaning of &#x201c;water-repellent fine particles&#x201d;, reference may be made to the description in the section of &#x201c;Fine Particles having primary particle diameter of 1000 nm or less&#x201d; to be given hereinunder.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the following, the amino group-having polymer compound particles, the fine particles having a primary particle diameter of 1000 nm or less and other optional components that the gas-absorbing material of the present invention contains are described.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">[Amino Group-Having Polymer Compound Particles]</heading><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The &#x201c;amino group-having polymer compound particles&#x201d; for use in the present invention are particles of an amino group-having polymer compound, and are preferably composed of an amino group-having polymer compound alone, but may contain materials used in preparing the particles, for example, a component for controlling the particle diameter such as a surfactant, and a polymer of a (meth)acrylamide derivative, a crosslinking agent and an unreacted monomer.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">(Amino Group-Having Polymer Compound)</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The amino group of the amino group-having polymer compound may be any of a primary amino group, a secondary amino group or a tertiary amino group, and is preferably such that the acid dissociation constant of the conjugated acid is planned.

The other component includes a crosslinking agent, a polymerization initiator, and a pKa regulator. By controlling the kind and the concentration of the surfactant to be added to the particles preparing liquid, the particle size of the polymer compound particles to be produced can be controlled. By using a crosslinking agent, a crosslinking structure can be formed in the polymer compound inside the particles to control the swellability of the particles so that the particles are not too much swollen. In the case where a relatively large amount of a crosslinking agent is used or in the case where the monomer concentration during polymerization is set relatively high, a crosslinking structure can also be formed between the particles. With that, a relatively large open pore structure can be formed between the composite particles linking via a crosslinking structure.

For example, the gas-absorbing material swollen with water is highly basic and is in a state of readily absorbing carbon dioxide at 30 to 50&#xb0; C. After the gas-absorbing material has absorbed carbon dioxide at that temperature and is then heated at 60 to 90&#xb0; C., its basicity lowers and the material desorbs the absorbed carbon dioxide.
