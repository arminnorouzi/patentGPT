However, these activities are also extremely dangerous for children and anxiety-producing for parents and/or other caregivers. The beach and/or an outdoor pool exposes a child to harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation and excessive heat, which can result in a sunburn, heat stroke, dehydration, and/or death.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional child seats provide comfort for infants by allowing them to be occupied within the child seat. However, the conventional child seats lack a covering and/or other means of cooling that would protect the infant from UV radiation and excessive heat.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is a need for a covered infant swing to protect the infant while sitting in an outdoor environment.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present general inventive concept provides a covered infant swing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additional features and utilities of the present general inventive concept will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the general inventive concept.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The foregoing and/or other features and utilities of the present general inventive concept may be achieved by providing a covered infant swing, including a support frame, a seat detachably connected to at least a portion of the support frame to receive an infant thereon, a plurality of cables connected at a first end to the support frame and connected at a second end to the seat to suspend the seat from the support frame and facilitate movement of the seat with respect to the support frame, and a covering member movably disposed on at least a portion of the support frame to move from retracted in a first position to at least partially extended over the support frame and the seat in a second position, and move from extended over the support frame and the seat in the second position to retracted in the first position.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The support frame may include a lateral bar disposed over the seat, a first leg disposed on at least a portion of a first end of the lateral bar to support the lateral bar, and a second leg disposed on at least a portion of a second end of the lateral bar to support the lateral bar.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The first leg and the second leg may each include a movable joint to move from extended away from the lateral bar in a first position to at least partially retracted toward the lateral bar in a second position, and move from retracted toward the lateral bar in the second position to extended away from the lateral bar in the first position.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The covered infant swing may further include at least one fan disposed on at least a portion of the support frame to blow air toward the seat in response to being turned on.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The covered infant swing may further include a plurality of shades disposed on at least a portion of a first side and a second side of the covering member to move from retracted in a first position to at least partially extended in a second position, and move from extended in the second position to retracted in the first position.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The covered infant swing may further include at least one sensor connected to at least a portion of the plurality of shades to move the plurality of shades from retracted in the first position to at least partially extended in the second position in response to the at least one sensor detecting a temperature level around the seat and extending up to the covering member exceeding a predetermined temperature level.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">These and/or other features and utilities of the present generally inventive concept will become apparent and more readily appreciated from the following description of the embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings of which:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a top isometric view of a covered infant swing, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present general inventive concept; and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a front perspective view of the covered infant swing, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present general inventive concept.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Various example embodiments (a.k.a., exemplary embodiments) will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some example embodiments are illustrated.
