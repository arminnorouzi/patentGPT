end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In order to facilitate understanding, concepts involved in the present disclosure are first explained.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">A terminal device can be a device which has a wireless transceiver function and can cooperate with a network device to provide communication services for a user. Specifically, the terminal device can refer to a user equipment (UE), an access terminal, a subscriber unit, a subscriber station, a mobile radio station, a mobile station, a remote station, a remote terminal, a mobile device, a user terminal, a terminal, a wireless communication device, a user agent, or a user device. For example, the terminal device can be a cellular phone, a cordless phone, a session initiation protocol (SIP) phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld device with wireless communication ability, a computing device, or a processing devices connected to a wireless modem, an in-vehicle device, a wearable device, or a terminal device of a public land mobile network (PLMN) in a future 5G network or future evolutions after 5G. The embodiment of the present disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As an example and not a limitation, in embodiments of the present disclosure, the terminal device can also be a wearable device. The wearable device can also be called a wearable smart device, which is a general term for intelligent design of daily wear and development of wearable devices using wearable technology, such as glasses, gloves, a watch, clothing, or shoes. A wearable device is a portable device which is worn directly on a body or integrated into a user's clothing or accessories. The wearable device is not only a hardware device, but also realizes a powerful function through software support, data interaction, and cloud interaction. In a broad sense, the wearable smart device is full-featured and large-size, can realize, without relying on a smart phone, complete or partial functions, such as a smart watch or smart glasses, or only focuses on a certain type of application function, which needs to cooperate with other devices (such as a smart phone), such as, various kinds of smart bracelets or smart jewelry for physical sign monitoring.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Furthermore, in the embodiments of the present disclosure, the terminal device can also be a terminal device in an internet of things (IoT) system. IoT is an important part in the future development of information technology and its main technical feature is that things are connected to a network through communication technology, so as to realize an intelligent network of human-machine interconnection and interconnection of things. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, IOT technology can achieve massive connections, deep coverage, and terminal power saving through, for example, a narrow band NB technology.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A network device can be a device used for communicating with a terminal device. For example, it can be a base transceiver station (BTS) in a global system for mobile communication (GSM) or a code division multiple access (CDMA) communication system, or can be a Node B (NB) in a wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) system, or can be an evolutionary Node B (eNB or eNodeB) in an LTE system. Alternatively, the network device can also be a relay station, an access point, an in-vehicle device, a wearable device, a network-side device in a future 5G network or after 5G, or a network device in a public land mobile network (PLMN) in future evolutions.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The network device involved in the embodiments of the present disclosure can also be referred to as a radio access network (RAN) device. The RAN device is connected to a terminal device and is configured to receive data of the terminal device and transmit the same to a core network device.

An (R)AN device in the 5G system can be constituted by multiple 5G-(R)AN nodes. The (R)AN nodes can include: a non-3GPP access network such as an access point (AP) of a WiFi network or a next-generation base station (which may be collectively referred to as a new-generation radio access network node (NG-RAN node), wherein the next-generation base station includes a new air interface base station (NR nodeB, gNB), a new generation evolved base station (NG-eNB), a central unit (CU), a distributed unit (DU), a gNB with a separate form, etc.), a transmission receive point (TRP), a transmission point (TP), or other nodes.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a 5G core network (5G core/new generation core, 5GC/NGC) includes multiple functional units including an access and mobility management function (AMF) network element, a session management function (SMF) network element, a user plane function (UPF) network element, an authentication server function (AUSF) network element, a policy control function (PCF) network element, an application function (AF) network element, a unified data management function (UDM) network element, a network slice selection function (NSSF) network element and so on.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The AMF network element is mainly responsible for mobility management, access management, and so on. The SMF network element is mainly responsible for session management, UE address management and allocation, dynamic host configuration protocol function, user plane function selection and control and so on. The UPF is mainly responsible for external connection to a data network (DN), data packet routing and forwarding of a user plane, packet filtering, performing related control functions of quality of service (QoS), and so on. The AUSF is mainly responsible for an authentication function of a terminal device. The PCF network element is mainly responsible for providing a unified policy framework for network behavior management, providing policy rules for control plane functions, acquiring registration information related to policy decisions, and so on. It should be noted that these functional units can work independently, or can be combined to implement certain control functions, such as access control and mobility management functions (for example, access authentication, security encryption, and location registration of the terminal device), and session management functions (for example establishment, release, and modification of a user plane transmission path.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, in the network architecture diagram exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a model control function is further provided. The model control function is a network element in the core network device, which is configured to control coordination of model segments when the model segments are jointly executed between various devices. The model control function can be a new network element in the core network device, or the coordination control of model segments by the model control function can be integrated into a certain network element in the current core network device, such as the AMF network element, the SMF network element, or the like. In this case, the network element which integrates the coordination control of the model segments is the model control function in the embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The functional units in the 5GC can communicate through a next generation network (NG) interface.

An RAN device can establish a user plane data transmission channel with the UPF through an NG interface 3 (N3 for short). An AN/RAN device can establish a control plane signaling connection with the AMF network element through an NG interface 2 (N2 for short). The UPF can communicate with the AMF network element through an NG interface 4 (N4 for short). The UPF can exchange user plane data with a data network DN through NG interface 6 (N6 for short). The AMF network element can exchange information with the SMF network element through an NG interface 11 (N11 for short).

It should be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is only an exemplary architecture diagram. Besides the functional units shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the network architecture can further include other functional units.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The network architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a reference point-based network architecture, and the network architecture is a network architecture in a non-roaming scenario. Certainly, a method of the present disclosure can also be applied in a roaming scenario, and the network architecture is not limited to a reference point-based network architecture. The network architecture can also adopt a network architecture based on service interfaces.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the above-mentioned system architecture, since the terminal device has limitations of in terms of computing power, storage capacity, and battery capacity and the AI/ML model has higher device requirements, ability of the terminal device is a bigger challenge when the terminal device is used for running the AI/ML model independently. Even if the terminal device can complete execution of the AI/ML model independently, it may take a long time. Based on this, the AI/ML model can be divided into two or more model segments, and the corresponding segments are executed by two or more devices respectively. For example, some model segments can be divided into the network device, and the AI/ML model can be jointly executed by the network device and the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of dividing a model provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, it is directed to divide an AI/ML model. The AI/ML model is an image recognition model capable of recognizing things in images. In the embodiment of the present disclosure, it is assumed that the model has been pre-trained. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the image recognition model is divided into three model segments, which are respectively configured on three devices for execution. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the three devices are a terminal device <b>20</b>, a first device <b>21</b>, and a second network device <b>22</b> respectively, and each device only executes its own model segment.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">When the model segments executed by the three devices are coordinated, any one or two of the devices can realize some functions of the image recognition model. After the three devices execute their respective model segments, all functions of the image recognition model can be achieved. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an obtained output of the model is &#x201c;tree&#x201d;, which means that after an image is outputted and processed by the model, the model recognizes that a thing in the image is a tree.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">It can be understood that an image recognition model may include multiple different parts, for example, may include multiple convolutional layers, multiple pooling layers, multiple upsampling layers, multiple downsampling layers, and so on. Various parts in the model are arranged organically, and each part may output an intermediate result after data is inputted data. A result outputted by a previous part may be an input of a next part. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, after the terminal device <b>20</b> executes a corresponding model segment, an obtained output is an intermediate result. The intermediate result is an input of a model segment executed by the first network device <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">First, based on this, the model segments executed by the devices are in sequence. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the network device <b>21</b> can execute its corresponding model segment and obtain the corresponding intermediate data only when the terminal device <b>20</b> finishes executing its model segment and obtain the intermediate result to be the input of the first network device <b>21</b>. Then, the intermediate data outputted by the first network device <b>21</b> is an input of a model segment executed by the second network device <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Second, based on differences in computing capabilities of the terminal devices in different scenarios, the models can be divided in different methods. The coordination between models cannot be achieved when the model segments are executed between the devices.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">For example, it is assumed that the image recognition model in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is constituted by a preprocessing layer&#x2014;a convolutional layer&#x2014;an upsampling layer&#x2014;a convolutional layer&#x2014;a pooling layer&#x2014;a convolutional layer&#x2014;an activation layer&#x2014;a full-connection layer. For example, the dividing method can be one as follows.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In a first method, a model segment A<b>1</b> includes the preprocessing layer&#x2014;the convolutional layer, a model segment B<b>1</b> includes the upsampling layer&#x2014;the convolutional layer&#x2014;the pooling layer, and a model segment C<b>1</b> includes the convolutional layer&#x2014;the activation layer&#x2014;the full connection layer.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In a second method, a model segment A<b>2</b> includes the preprocessing layer, a model segment B<b>2</b> includes the convolutional layer&#x2014;the upsampling layer&#x2014;the convolutional layer&#x2014;the pooling layer, and a model segment C<b>2</b> includes the convolutional layer&#x2014;the activation layer&#x2014;the full connection layer).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In a third method, a model segment A<b>3</b> includes the preprocessing layer&#x2014;the convolutional layer&#x2014;the upsampling layer, a model segment B<b>3</b> includes the convolutional layer&#x2014;the pooling layer&#x2014;the convolutional layer&#x2014;the activation layer, and a model segment C<b>3</b> includes the full connection layer.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Based on the above-mentioned three dividing methods, the model segment A<b>1</b>, the model segment A<b>2</b>, and the model segment A<b>3</b> can be configured on the terminal device <b>20</b>, the model segment B<b>1</b>, the model segment B<b>2</b>, and the model segment B<b>3</b> can be configured on the first network device <b>21</b>, and the model segment C<b>1</b>, the model segment C<b>2</b>, and the model segment C<b>3</b> are configured on the second network device <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">However, due to the multiple methods of dividing the models, dividing and coordination between models is a problem. For example, when a model segment which is selected for execution by the terminal device <b>20</b> is A<b>1</b>, a model segment which is possibly selected for execution by the first network <b>21</b> is B<b>2</b> and a model segment which is possibly selected for execution by the second network <b>22</b> is C<b>3</b>. In this case, the whole model executed by the three devices is the preprocessing layer&#x2014;the convolutional layer&#x2014;the convolutional layer&#x2014;the upsampling layer&#x2014;the convolutional layer&#x2014;the pooling layer&#x2014;the fully connected layer, which is different from the original image recognition model.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Certainly, when the model is divided by only one method, for example, only the first division method is included, each device only includes one model segment of the image recognition model. The execution of the model can ensure coordination. However, only one method cannot meet requirements of various application scenarios. For example, the model is divided into a model segment A (80% of the model), a model segment B (10% of the model), and a model segment C (10% of the model), and they are configured on the terminal device <b>20</b>, the first network device <b>21</b>, and the second network device <b>22</b>, respectively. At this time, it is assumed that power of the terminal device <b>20</b> is low. When the terminal device <b>20</b> executes the model segment A, the power at this time is not sufficient to support the terminal device <b>20</b> to complete the execution of the model segment A. If another dividing method is included at this time, the model is divided into a model segment D (10% of the model), a model segment E (30% of the model), and a model segment F (60% of the model), and they are configured to the terminal device <b>20</b>, the first network device <b>21</b>, and the second network device <b>22</b>, respectively. The terminal device <b>20</b> can choose to execute the model segment D when the power is low.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Accordingly, multiple dividing methods of the model are necessary. However, in the present disclosure, it is necessary to solve a problem of how to ensure that after the terminal device <b>20</b> selects the model segment A<b>1</b>, the model segment selected for execution by the first network device <b>21</b> is B<b>1</b> and the model segment selected for execution by the second network device <b>22</b> is C<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">First, an application scenario of the present disclosure is introduced.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of an application scenario provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure.

In the above embodiments, the data transmission modes between the UE and the model control function, between the UE and the base station, between the UE and the core network device are described. For example, when the model control function configures the model segment selection policy on the UE, it can send the model segment selection policy to the mobility management function first. Then, the mobility management function implements sending the model segment selection policy to the UE by carrying the model segment selection policy in the NAS message. For example, when the UE sends the identification of the model segment to the base station, it can send the identification of the model segment to the base station through the AS message. When the UE sends the identification of the model segment to the core network device, it can send the identification of the model segment to the core network device through the NAS message.
