No. 16/537,425, filed Aug. 9, 2019 and titled &#x201c;Strengthened Covers for Electronic Devices&#x201d; which is a nonprovisional patent application of and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/783,162, filed Dec. 20, 2018 and titled &#x201c;Strengthened Covers for Electronic Devices,&#x201d; the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The described embodiments relate generally to chemically strengthened covers for electronic devices and related methods. More particularly, embodiments described herein relate to glass covers which are processed using a combination of chemical strengthening and material removal in order to mitigate warping or distortion of a mounting surface of the cover.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional covers for portable electronic devices may be made of glass. Such conventional glass covers may be chemically strengthened through ion exchange. For example, chemical strengthening can improve the impact resistance of the glass cover.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, some conventional glass covers may warp during chemical strengthening. Warpage of the cover can make it more difficult to form a seal between the glass cover and another part of the electronic device housing. The tendency for warpage can increase with increasing amounts of chemical strengthening.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Aspects of the following disclosure relate to methods for chemically strengthening a cover for an electronic device. In embodiments, the cover defines a mounting surface that forms a seal with an enclosure component of the electronic device. In embodiments, the cover has a three-dimensional (3D) shape that includes a flange which defines the mounting surface.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The cover may be formed of an ion-exchangeable material, such as a glass. In some embodiments, the methods include at least two ion-exchange operations and an intermediate operation of locally removing material from the mounting surface of the cover. The operation of locally removing material from the mounting surface may at least partially counteract warping of the cover due to the preceding ion-exchange operation. The following ion-exchange operation can provide additional strength to the cover while retaining mounting surface flatness sufficient to allow the seal to be formed between the cover and the enclosure component.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A chemically strengthened cover as described herein may be included in a cover assembly of the electronic device. For example, a chemically strengthened glass cover or glass ceramic cover may serve as one component of a cover assembly. The cover assembly may also include one or more coating layers or other components.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The disclosure provides a method comprising placing a glass cover in a first ion-exchange bath to form a first ion-exchanged layer, the glass cover defining a central portion and a mounting surface at least partially surrounding the central portion. The method may further comprise removing the glass cover from the first ion-exchange bath. In addition, the method comprises removing material from the mounting surface, thereby locally reducing a depth of the first ion-exchanged layer along the mounting surface. After the operation of removing material from the mounting surface, the method further comprises placing the glass cover in a second ion-exchange bath to form a second ion-exchanged layer within the first ion-exchanged layer, thereby producing a compressive stress layer along the mounting surface. The glass cover is then removed from the second ion-exchange bath.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additional aspects of the disclosure relate to chemically strengthened covers produced by the methods described herein. In some cases, the chemically strengthened covers have a mounting surface that is flat to within a tolerance. In some embodiments, the chemically strengthened covers may have an ion-exchanged layer and a compressive stress layer whose properties vary along one or more surfaces of the cover. For example, the properties of the compressive stress layer may vary along the mounting surface. In addition, the properties of the compressive stress layer may vary between the mounting surface and one or more surfaces of a central portion of the cover. A tensile stress layer may also be present within the glass cover and be located inward from the compressive stress layer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The disclosure also provides an electronic device comprising an enclosure component defining a first mounting surface, a display, and a glass cover positioned over the display. The glass cover comprises a central portion and a flange at least partially surrounding the central portion. The flange defines a first segment extending along a first side of the central portion and defining a first region of a second mounting surface, a second segment extending along a second side of the central portion and defining a second region of the second mounting surface, and a corner segment extending from the first segment to the second segment and defining a third region of the second mounting surface. The glass cover further comprises a compressive stress layer having a first depth at the first region and a second depth, greater than the first depth, at the third region.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The disclosure further provides a strengthened glass cover for an electronic device, comprising a central portion, a mounting surface at least partially surrounding the central portion, and a compressive stress layer. The compressive stress layer has a first depth along a first region of the mounting surface and a second depth, greater than the first depth, along a second region of the mounting surface.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The disclosure will be readily understood by the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate like elements.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts a perspective view of an example electronic device including a strengthened cover.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> depicts an exploded view of the electronic device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> depicts an example of a cross-sectional view of the electronic device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> depicts another example of a cross-sectional view of the electronic device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an example of a strengthened cover positioned to show the interior surface of the cover.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> depicts a top view of a cover before chemical strengthening.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> depicts a top view of a cover after a first ion-exchange operation.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a flowchart of an example method for producing a chemically strengthened cover.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts a flowchart of an additional example method for producing a chemically strengthened cover.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B, and <b>7</b>C</figref> schematically depict ion-exchanged layers formed at various stages of the example method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> schematically depict ion distributions in the strengthened cover of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref> schematically depict stages in an example operation of removing material from the mounting surface of the cover.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref> depict examples of compressive stress layers in the strengthened cover of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref> depict examples of stress as a function of distance for the strengthened cover of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> depicts a block diagram of components for an electronic device.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The use of cross-hatching or shading in the accompanying figures is generally provided to clarify the boundaries between adjacent elements and also to facilitate legibility of the figures.

It should be understood that the following descriptions are not intended to limit the embodiments to one preferred implementation. To the contrary, the described embodiments are intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as can be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure and as defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Aspects of the following disclosure relate to methods for chemically strengthening a cover for an electronic device. In some embodiments, the cover has a mounting surface that is coupled to a corresponding mounting surface of another component of the electronic device (e.g., an enclosure component). The interface between the mounting surfaces may form a seal to prevent ingress of liquids, debris, or other contaminants into an interior volume of the electronic device. In some cases, the mounting surface of the chemically strengthened cover is sufficiently flat to allow formation of the seal while also maintaining a desired level of bend strength.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The mounting surface may be defined by a peripheral portion of the cover. The peripheral portion of the cover may further define a flange (or flange portion). In addition, the peripheral portion of the cover may have a reduced thickness as compared to a central portion of the cover.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, chemically strengthening the cover through a first ion-exchange operation warps the cover such that the mounting surface of the cover is not sufficiently flat to form a good seal against the enclosure component. In order to counteract warpage of the mounting surface, material may be removed from the mounting surface following the first ion-exchange operation and before a subsequent ion-exchange operation. The operation of removing material from the mounting surface may improve the flatness or planarity of the mounting surface by improving the overall balance of internal stresses in the cover. Removal of material may also serve to physically flatten a mounting surface that has become distorted or warped during strengthening or other processing. A second ion-exchange operation may then be used to further chemically strengthen the cover and obtain the desired strength. The ion exchange in the second ion-exchange operation may produce an ion-exchanged layer that is shallower than that resulting from the first ion-exchange operation. Notably, by removing material from the mounting surface between the first and second ion-exchange operations, the negative impact of the two ion-exchange operations on the flatness of the cover may be mitigated or eliminated, thereby producing a cover of sufficient flatness to form an adequate seal while maintaining some or all of the additional strength afforded by the dual ion-exchange operation.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some cases, material is removed locally from the mounting surface, rather than being removed uniformly from the entirety of the mounting surface. For example, a greater amount of material may also be removed from a first region of the mounting surface than from a second region of the mounting surface. In addition, the amount of material removed from the mounting surface may be greater than the amount of material removed from another surface of the cover. For example, a greater amount of material may be removed from an inner surface of a peripheral portion of the cover which defines the mounting surface than from an inner surface of a central portion of the cover.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the cover may not warp significantly during the first ion exchange operation, but removal of material from the mounting surface prior to the second ion-exchange operation may provide other benefits. For example, if a peripheral portion of the cover is thin relative to a central portion of the cover, symmetric chemical strengthening may produce a higher central tension in the peripheral portion than in the central portion. Removal of material from the mounting surface can decrease the overall depth of the compressive stress layer along the mounting surface and therefore help to prevent the central tension in the peripheral portion of the cover from exceeding specified levels.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Additional aspects of the disclosure relate to chemically strengthened covers. In embodiments, the methods described herein (including locally removing material from a mounting surface between two ion-exchange operations) produce an ion-exchanged layer whose properties, such as depth, vary along the mounting surface of the cover. In addition, a compressive stress layer formed within the ion-exchanged layer may vary in properties such as depth and surface compressive stress along the mounting surface. Further, the properties of the ion-exchanged layer and the compressive stress layer along a region of the mounting surface may differ from those along other surfaces of the cover, such as an exterior surface of a central region of the cover.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">These and other embodiments are discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>12</b></figref>.

In embodiments, the ion-exchange operations include exchanging ions in the cover for larger ions provided in a bath or paste external to the cover. Typically, an ion-exchange operation produces an ion-exchanged layer within the cover, modifies an ion-exchanged layer already present in the cover, or a combination thereof. When the ion-exchange operation occurs at a temperature below the strain point or a glass transition temperature of the glass, a compressive stress layer may be produced within the ion-exchanged layer. Typically, the cover is removed from the bath or the paste is removed from the cover after completion of the ion-exchange operation. The cover may be rinsed or washed after completion of the ion-exchange operation.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In embodiments, the cover may have a base composition (prior to ion-exchange) which includes alkali metal ions. For example, the cover may comprise an alkali aluminosilicate glass. In embodiments, the alkali aluminosilicate glass may include additional components, such as boron or an alkaline earth. In embodiments, the cover may have a base composition which includes lithium ions, with at least some of the lithium ions being exchanged for sodium ions and/or potassium ions during the ion-exchange operations. For example, the base composition may comprise lithium ions as the predominant alkali metal ions. As an additional example, the base composition may comprise from 0.1% to 10% lithium by weight of the base glass.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, alkali metal ions in the cover may be exchanged for alkali metal ions in the ion-exchange bath. Alkali metal ions from the ion-exchange bath are thus introduced into the cover. In other embodiments, the ion-exchange may involve other types of ion-exchangeable ions. The ion-exchange bath may comprise one or more molten ionic salts. In some cases, a single ionic salt is present in the ion-exchange bath. The ion-exchange bath temperature may be from the melting point of the salt to approximately 600&#xb0; C. In embodiments, ion-exchange occurs along multiple surfaces of the glass. For example, ion-exchange may occur over one or more of the mounting surface, an exterior surface of the flange portion, an interior surface of the flange portion, an exterior surface of the central portion, and an interior surface of the central portion.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The temperature of the ion-exchange bath may be below a strain point or a glass transition point of a glass in the cover, so that exchanging alkali metal ions in the cover with larger alkali metal ions tends to cause an expansion of an ion-exchanged zone of the cover. However, expansion of the ion-exchanged layer of the cover may be constrained by a remainder of the cover which is not ion-exchanged. As a result, a compressive stress region, such as a biaxial residual compressive stress region, may be created in the ion-exchanged layer.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the process <b>500</b> may include a first ion-exchange operation <b>502</b> to form a first ion-exchanged layer. The cover may have a base composition prior to operation <b>502</b>. In embodiments, operation <b>502</b> includes exchanging first ions, such as first alkali metal ions, in the cover with second ions, such as second alkali metal ions. The first ions have a first size and the second ions have a second size larger than the first size. The first ions may be exchanged for the second ions by immersing the cover in an ion-exchange bath comprising the second ions. The second ions are thus introduced into the cover and form the first ion-exchanged layer.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">By the way of example, the exchange of the first alkali metal ions in the cover for the second alkali metal ions may include exchanging lithium ions in the cover for sodium ions. When sodium ions are to be introduced into the cover the ion-exchange bath may comprise sodium nitrate or another suitable sodium salt. The concentration of the sodium salt may be from 30 mol % to 100 mol %. In embodiments, the concentration of the sodium salt may be greater than 50 mol %. In embodiments, the ion-exchange bath may further comprise additional alkali metal ions in a lesser amount, such as potassium ions and/or lithium ions. The temperature of the ion-exchange bath may be from 350-450&#xb0; C. and the time the cover spends in the ion-exchange bath may be from 4 hours to 10 hours.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The operation <b>502</b> may form an ion-exchanged layer along surfaces of the cover.

For example, for the cover shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, material may be removed from the mounting surface <b>452</b><i>a </i>of sidewall <b>458</b><i>a </i>and the mounting surface of the sidewall opposite sidewall <b>458</b><i>a. </i>In further embodiments, material is removed from two pairs of opposing sidewalls during operation <b>504</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Typically, local removal of material from the mounting surface will locally reduce a depth of the first ion-exchanged layer formed in the operation <b>502</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> schematically depicts a modified first ion-exchanged layer <b>710</b><i>b </i>along a length of the mounting surface after the operation <b>504</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, the depth of the modified first ion-exchanged layer <b>710</b><i>b </i>decreases from the corners towards the middle of the sidewall.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In embodiments, a polishing operation is used to remove material from the mounting surface of the cover. By the way of example, the cover may be positioned so that at least part of a first region of the mounting surface (e.g., defined by the sidewall of the flange) is in contact with a polishing surface while a second region of the mounting surface (e.g., defined by a corner of the flange) is not in contact with the polishing surface (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>). The polishing surface may comprise particles of an abrasive material, such as diamond or a ceramic (e.g., alumina, silicon carbide, and/or ceria). The polishing surface may be sufficiently hard or rigid to allow local removal of material from the mounting surface when the cover is pressed against and moved along the polishing surface. In embodiments, the particles of the abrasive material may be provided in a slurry comprising a carrier liquid and the abrasive material.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, the maximum depth of material removed from the mounting surface is small relative to a height of the flange. For example, material may be removed to a maximum depth of 0.05%, 1%, 2%, or 5% of a height of the flange. As examples, material may be removed from the mounting surface to a maximum depth of 10 microns to 50 microns or of 15 microns to 40 microns. In further embodiments, the maximum depth of material removed from a location on the mounting surface is less than a depth of the ion-exchanged layer formed at that location in the operation <b>502</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Following the operation <b>504</b>, the process <b>500</b> may further include a second ion-exchange operation <b>506</b>. In some cases, the second ion-exchange operation <b>506</b> may be regarding as forming a second ion-exchanged layer within the first ion-exchanged layer. Therefore, the extent of ion-exchange produced by the operation <b>506</b> may be shallower than that produced by the operation <b>504</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, the depth of the second ion-exchange layer produced by the second ion-exchange operation <b>506</b> is sufficiently shallow that little, if any, additional warpage is introduced into the cover. In embodiments, the flatness of the mounting surface after the second ion-exchange operation <b>506</b> is within 25 microns, 20 microns, 15 microns, 10 microns, or 5 microns. In additional embodiments, the mounting surface may be planar to within 5%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0.25% of the maximum height of the flange.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, the operation <b>506</b> includes exchanging second ions, such as the second alkali metal ions, in the cover with third ions, such as third alkali metal ions. The third ions have a third size larger than the second size and the first size. The second ions may be exchanged for the third ions by immersing the cover in an ion-exchange bath comprising the third ions. The third ions are thus introduced into the cover. In embodiments, the operation <b>506</b> further comprises other exchanges of ion. For example, first alkali metal ions remaining in the first ion-exchange layer may be exchanged for the third alkali metal ions. Additional exchange of the first alkali metal ions for the second alkali metal ions may also occur, thereby increasing the overall depth of the ion-exchanged layer.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">By the way of example, exchanging second alkali metal ions in the cover with third alkali metal ions may include exchanging sodium ions in the cover for potassium ions. When potassium ions are to be introduced into the cover, the ion-exchange bath may comprise potassium nitrate or another suitable potassium salt. The concentration of the potassium salt may be from 30 mol % to 100 mol %. In embodiments, the concentration of potassium salt is greater than 50 mol %. In further embodiments, the ion-exchange bath may further comprise additional alkali metal ions in a lesser amount, such as sodium ions. The temperature of the ion-exchange bath may be from 300-500&#xb0; C. The time the cover spends in the ion-exchange bath may be from 15 minutes to 4 hours.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, the composition of a second ion-exchange bath used in the operation <b>504</b> is different from the composition of a first ion-exchange bath used in the operation <b>502</b>. For example, the second ion-exchange bath may have a greater concentration of the third alkali metal ions and a lesser concentration of the second alkali metal ions than the first ion-exchange bath. In additional embodiments, the composition of the second ion-exchange bath used in the operation <b>502</b> may be about the same as the composition of the first ion-exchange bath used in the operation <b>504</b> and may include a mixture of ionic salts.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some cases, the ion-exchange operation <b>506</b> may be viewed as forming a second ion-exchanged layer within the first ion-exchanged layer. The overall or combined ion-exchanged layer after the ion-exchange operation <b>506</b> thus comprises the second ion-exchanged layer and a portion which extends beyond the second ion-exchanged layer and is derived from the first ion-exchanged layer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> schematically depicts an example of a second ion-exchanged layer formed within a first ion-exchanged layer.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, the portion <b>730</b> may have a non-uniform depth along the length of the mounting surface after the operation <b>506</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some embodiments, the depth of the second ion-exchanged layer, such as second ion-exchanged layer <b>720</b>, may be determined from the depth of the third ions (e.g., potassium ions) introduced by the second ion-exchange operation <b>506</b>. The overall depth of the ion-exchanged layer, such as overall ion-exchanged layer <b>710</b><i>c, </i>may be determined from the depth of the second ions (e.g., sodium ions) introduced by the first ion-exchange. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> schematically depicts the overall depth of the ion-exchanged layer <b>710</b><i>c </i>(varying from D&#x2032;<sub>MIN </sub>to D&#x2032;<sub>1</sub>) and the depth of the third ions (D<sub>2</sub>) after the operation <b>506</b>. The depth D&#x2032;<sub>1 </sub>may be greater than the depth D<sub>1 </sub>due to deeper diffusion of the second ions introduced by the first ion-exchange operation <b>502</b> into the cover during the second ion-exchange operation <b>506</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The ion-exchange operation <b>506</b> may also be viewed as forming an ion-exchanged layer having two zones of differing composition: a surface zone and an internal zone. The surface zone corresponds to the second ion-exchanged layer described above and the internal zone corresponds to the portion of the ion-exchanged layer extending beyond the surface zone (e.g., further into the glass than the surface zone). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> schematically depicts the ion-exchanged layer as a whole <b>710</b><i>c, </i>the internal zone <b>730</b>, and the surface zone <b>720</b> along the length of a sidewall region of the mounting surface.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some embodiments, the surface zone of the ion-exchanged layer is enriched in the third alkali metal ions (e.g., potassium ions) as compared to the internal zone. The surface zone extends from the surface of the cover to a depth determined from the depth of the third ions (e.g., potassium ions) introduced by the second ion-exchange. In some cases, the depth of the surface zone is uniform or nearly so over the mounting surface. Further, the depth of the surface zone may be uniform or nearly so along multiple surfaces of the cover. In other cases, the depth of the surface zone may vary along the mounting zone, such as when a mixed salt bath is used during the operation <b>502</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some embodiments, the internal zone of the ion-exchanged layer is enriched in the second alkali metal ions (e.g., sodium ions) as compared to the base composition of the glass. The internal zone extends from the depth of the surface zone to the overall depth of the ion-exchanged layer. Typically, the overall depth of the ion-exchanged layer varies along the mounting surface as a result of the operation <b>504</b>, as schematically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The ion-exchanged layer resulting from the operation <b>506</b> produces a compressive stress layer along surfaces of the cover.
