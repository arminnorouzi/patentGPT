The olefin polymer is withdrawn from said separation vessel to form a second product stream and the second product stream is directed into a second polymerization reactor.

The invention relates also to a process for recovering polymerization product from a gas phase reactor.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0030">According to an embodiment of the invention, the olefin is ethylene and correspondingly the polyolefin is polyethylene. According to an alternative embodiment of the invention, the olefin is propylene and correspondingly the polyolefin is polypropylene.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0031">The system comprises a gas phase reactor <b>1</b>. The gas phase reactor <b>1</b> is suitable for polymerizing an olefin to obtain polymerization product. Preferably, the gas phase reactor <b>1</b> is operated continuously. Preferably, the gas phase reactor <b>1</b> is a fluidized bed gas phase reactor. For example, the gas phase reactor <b>1</b> has a diameter of 2.9 to 5.5 m. Preferably, the gas phase reactor <b>1</b> has a circular cross-section. More preferably, the gas phase reactor <b>1</b> has an essentially cylindrical form.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0032">The gas phase reactor <b>1</b> comprises a gas distribution plate <b>11</b> arranged inside the gas phase reactor <b>1</b>. In the fluidized bed gas phase reactor, an olefin is polymerized in the presence of polymerization catalyst in an upwards moving gas stream. The reactor typically contains a fluidized bed comprising the growing polymer particles containing the active catalyst located above a distribution plate.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0033">The polymer bed is fluidized with the help of the fluidization gas comprising the olefin monomer, eventual comonomer(s), eventual chain growth controllers or chain transfer agents, such as hydrogen, and eventual inert gas. The fluidization gas is introduced into an inlet chamber at the bottom of the reactor. To make sure that the gas flow is uniformly distributed over the cross-sectional surface area of the inlet chamber the inlet pipe may be equipped with a flow-dividing element as known in the art, e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4,933,149 A and EP 684871 A. One or more of the above-mentioned components may be continuously added into the fluidization gas to compensate for losses caused, among other, by reaction or product withdrawal.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0034">From the inlet chamber, the gas flow is passed upwards through the gas distribution <b>11</b> plate into the fluidized bed. The purpose of the distribution plate is to divide the gas flow evenly through the cross-sectional area of the bed. Sometimes the distribution plate may be arranged to establish a gas stream to sweep along the reactor walls, as disclosed in WO 2005/087361 A. Other types of distribution plates are disclosed, among others, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,578,879 A, EP 600414 and EP 721798 A. An overview is given in Geldart and Bayens: The Design of Distributors for Gas-fluidized Beds, Powder Technology, Vol. 42, 1985.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0035">The fluidization gas passes through the fluidized bed. The superficial velocity of the fluidization gas must be higher that minimum fluidization velocity of the particles contained in the fluidized bed, as otherwise no fluidization would occur. On the other hand, the velocity of the gas should be lower than the onset velocity of pneumatic transport; as otherwise, the whole bed would be entrained with the fluidization gas. The minimum fluidization velocity and the onset velocity of pneumatic transport can be calculated when the particle characteristics are known by using common engineering practise. An overview is given, among others, in Geldart: Gas Fluidization Technology, J. Wiley &#x26; Sons, 1986.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0036">When the fluidization gas is contacted with the bed containing the active catalyst, the reactive components of the gas, such as monomers and chain transfer agents, react in the presence of the catalyst to produce the polymer product. At the same time, the gas is heated by the reaction heat.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0037">The unreacted fluidization gas is removed from the top of the reactor and cooled in a heat exchanger to remove the heat of reaction. The gas is cooled to a temperature, which is lower than that of the bed to prevent the bed from heating because of the reaction. It is possible to cool the gas to a temperature where a part of it condenses. When the liquid droplets enter the reaction zone, they are vaporised. The vaporisation heat then contributes to the removal of the reaction heat. This kind of operation is called condensed mode and variations of it are disclosed, among others, in WO 2007/025640 A, U.S. Pat. No. 4,543,399 A, EP 699213 A and WO 94/25495 A. It is also possible to add condensing agents into the recycle gas stream, as disclosed in EP 696293 A. The condensing agents are non-polymerizable components, such as n-pentane, isopentane, n-butane or isobutane, which are at least partially condensed in the cooler.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0038">The gas is then compressed and recycled into the inlet chamber of the reactor. Prior to the entry into the reactor, fresh reactants are introduced into the fluidization gas stream to compensate for the losses caused by the reaction and product withdrawal. It is generally known to analyse the composition of the fluidization gas and introduce the gas components to keep the composition constant. The actual composition is determined by the desired properties of the product and the catalyst used in the polymerization.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0039">The catalyst may be introduced into the reactor in various ways, either continuously or intermittently. Among others, WO 01/05845 A and EP 499759 A disclose such methods. Where the gas phase reactor is a part of a reactor cascade, the catalyst is usually dispersed within the polymer particles from the preceding polymerization stage. The polymer particles may be introduced into the gas phase reactor as disclosed in EP 1415999 A and WO 00/26258 A. Especially, if the preceding reactor is a slurry reactor, it is advantageous to feed the slurry directly into the fluidized bed of the gas phase reactor as disclosed in EP 887379 A, EP 887380 A, EP 887381 A and EP 991684 A.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0040">The top part of the gas phase reactor may include a so-called disengagement zone.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0041">In such a zone, the diameter of the reactor is increased to reduce the gas velocity and allow the particles that are carried from the bed with the fluidization gas to settle back to the bed.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0042">The bed level may be observed by different techniques known in the art. For instance, the pressure difference between the bottom of the reactor and a specific height of the bed may be recorded over the whole length of the reactor and the bed level may be calculated based on the pressure difference values. Such a calculation yields a time-averaged level. It is also possible to use ultrasonic sensors or radioactive sensors. With these methods instantaneous levels may be obtained, which of course may then be averaged over time to obtain a time-averaged bed level.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0043">Antistatic agent(s) may also be introduced into the gas phase reactor if needed. Suitable antistatic agents and methods to use them are disclosed, among others, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,026,795 A, 4,803,251 A, 4,532,311 A, 4,855,370 and EP 560035 A. They are usually polar compounds and include, among others, water, ketones, aldehydes and alcohols.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0044">The reactor may also include a mechanical agitator to facilitate mixing within the fluidized bed. An example of suitable agitator design is given in EP 707513 A.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0045">Typically, the gas phase reactor <b>1</b> is operated at a temperature within the range of from 50 to 100&#xb0; C., preferably from 65 to 90&#xb0; C.
