id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">I. FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">A connector system including a plurality of connectors having substantially identical structure each defining a pair of fluid conduits wherein a first one of the pair of fluid conduits terminating in a male fitting and a second one of said pair fluid conduits terminating in a female fitting, wherein the male fittings and the female fittings of a pair of connectors mate in a fluid transmission connection.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">II. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the electrical, mechanical, and medical trades and manufacturing, each half of a pair of mating connectors or fasteners is conventionally assigned the designation male or female. The structure of the male connector is different than the structure of the female connector. The female connector is generally a receptacle that receives and holds the male connector. There would be substantial advantages in a genderless connector system including a plurality of connectors each having substantially identical structure which can be releasably mated to provide a fluid connection. A genderless connector can reduce the expense of labor and materials in the production process, in the supply chain, and for the consumer by the elimination of the conventional structure of mated pairs of connectors in which a first connector has only a female configuration and a second connector has only a male configuration by replacement with a single configuration of genderless connector including both male and female fittings. In the production process of the instant inventive genderless connector only one set of production molds can yield all the parts for a single assembly process to produce the inventive genderless connector which does not require separate part identification, binning, packaging or inventory control, as required of conventional connectors which employ a discrete configuration of male connector and a discrete configuration of female connector, and which can releasably mate to provide a fluid connection.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">III. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, a broad object of particular embodiments of the invention can be to provide a connector having a first connector housing including a valve assembly defining a pair of fluid conduits, one of the pair of fluid conduits terminating in a male fitting and one of the pair fluid conduits terminating in a female fitting, the male fitting and said female fitting of a pair of connectors configured to mate in a fluid transmission connection.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another broad object of particular embodiments of the invention can be to provide a connector structured to reduce or obviate contamination of the matable male and female fittings, and without limitation to the breadth of the foregoing, examples of contamination include inorganic particles and organic particles; bodily tissues, fluids, or excrements; liquids fluids; microorganisms such as bacteria, arechaea, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. Particular embodiments of the inventive connector can include a first connector housing and a second connector housing having biased telescoping engagement to the first connector housing between an extended condition and a retracted condition, wherein the second connector housing has a pair of apertures aligned with the male fitting and the female fitting and a locking disk rotatably coupled to the second connector housing, and wherein the locking disk has a pair of apertures which can be disposed between a nonaligned condition covering the pair of apertures in said second connector housing with the locking disk and an aligned condition aligning the pair of apertures in the locking disk with the pair of apertures in said second connector housing allowing the male fitting and the female fitting to correspondingly pass through the pair of apertures in the second connector housing and the pair of apertures in the locking disk disposed in the aligned condition and with the second housing in the retracted condition.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another broad object of particular embodiments of the invention can be to provide a pair of connectors wherein each of the first connector and second connector of the pair of connectors includes a first connector housing including a pair of fluid conduits, one of the pair of fluid conduits terminating in a male fitting and one of said pair fluid conduits terminating in a female fitting and a second connector housing having telescoping engagement to the first connector housing between an extended condition and a retracted condition, wherein the second connector housing has a pair of apertures aligned with the male fitting and said female fitting and a locking disk rotatably coupled to the second connector housing and having a pair of apertures alignable with the pair of apertures in the second connector housing, wherein the locking disk of a first connector rotatably interlocks with the locking disk of a second connector to align the pair of apertures of each locking disk with the pair of apertures in the second connector housing to allow the male fittings and female fittings of the first connector and the second connector to pass through the respective pairs of apertures of the locking disk of the first connector and the locking disk of the second connector to mate in a fluid transmission connection.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Naturally, further objects of the invention are disclosed throughout other areas of the specification, drawings, photographs, and claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">IV.
