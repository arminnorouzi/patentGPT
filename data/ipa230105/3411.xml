Accordingly, it should be noted that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Heating, ventilation, and/or air conditioning (HVAC) systems are utilized in residential, commercial, and industrial environments to control environmental properties, such as temperature and humidity, for occupants of the respective environments (e.g., enclosed spaces). For example, an HVAC system may include one or more heat exchangers configured to place an air flow in a heat exchange relationship with a working fluid circulated by the heat exchanger. For example, a heat exchanger may circulate a refrigerant of a vapor compression circuit, combustion products generated by a furnace, or another type of working fluid. In general, the heat exchange relationship(s) may cause a change in pressures and/or temperatures of the air flow, the working fluid, or both. After exchanging heat via the heat exchanger, the air flow may be directed toward the environment (e.g., enclosed space) to condition the environment. Control features may be employed to control the above-described features such that conditions of the environment are adjusted in a desired manner. Unfortunately, traditional HVAC systems may be ill-equipped to determine whether, how, and/or when to operate heat exchangers to quickly and/or efficiently provide conditioning to the environment (e.g., enclosed space), which may result in inefficient heat exchange and/or extended amounts of time to condition the environment and satisfy a call for conditioning. Accordingly, it is now recognized that improved operation of heat exchangers is desired.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A summary of certain embodiments disclosed herein is set forth below.

In an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, not all features of an actual implementation are described in the specification. It should be noted that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be noted that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">When introducing elements of various embodiments of the present disclosure, the articles &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements. The terms &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d; are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements. Additionally, it should be noted that references to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; of the present disclosure are not intended to be interpreted as excluding the existence of additional embodiments that also incorporate the recited features.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for improving operation of heat exchangers of HVAC systems. More particularly, present embodiments include systems and methods for operating a heat exchanger (e.g., a modulating furnace) in multiple operating modes, including a quick heat operating mode or cycle. As used herein, a &#x201c;quick heat cycle&#x201d; refers to an operating mode for a modulating furnace in which one or more operating parameters of the modulating furnace is at an upper threshold (e.g., upper threshold value) and/or the modulating furnace is operated at a full (e.g., predefined maximum heating, maximum, 100 percent) capacity. For example, in the quick heat cycle, a fuel input rate to burner(s) of the modulating furnace may be at an upper threshold (e.g., maximum) value and/or an exhaust flow rate of a blower of the modulating furnace may be at an upper threshold (e.g., maximum) value. Additionally or alternatively, the predefined maximum heating capacity may be a selected (e.g., based on a user input received via a user interface) limit of the heating capacity of the modulating furnace. The modulating furnace may also be operated in a modulating heat mode or cycle. As used herein, a &#x201c;modulating heat cycle&#x201d; refers to an operating mode for a modulating furnace during which a capacity (e.g., heat output, rate of heat transfer, etc.) of the modulating furnace is modulated or varied. For example, in the modulating heat cycle, a fuel input rate to burner(s) of the modulating furnace and/or an exhaust flow rate of a blower of the modulating furnace may be adjusted or modulated, such as based on feedback and/or control signals from a controller of the HVAC system. In some embodiments, the feedback may include a temperature difference between a set point temperature and a measured (e.g., current) temperature in an environment (e.g., enclosed space) conditioned by the modulating furnace. As discussed below, present embodiments also include systems and methods to determining whether, how, and when to initiate the various operating modes of the modulating furnace.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A modulating furnace, such as a variable speed furnace, is configured to adjust an amount of heat output and/or temperature of heated air generated by the modulating furnace to provide heating to a conditioned space at a faster rate and/or more efficiently than traditional (e.g., fixed rate) furnaces. The modulating furnace may include one or more burners configured to receive fuel (e.g., gas) from a fuel source. A fuel valve (e.g., gas valve) associated with the modulating furnace may be controlled to supply a variable amount of fuel to the burner. In accordance with present embodiments, an amount and/or rate of fuel supplied to the burner may be based on an operating mode (e.g., a selected operating mode) of the modulating furnace. For example, the fuel valve may be adjusted to increase a fuel input rate to the modulating furnace during a quick heat cycle of the modulating furnace. The burners may also receive an oxidant (e.g., air), mix the oxidant with the fuel, and ignite the fuel-oxidant mixture to generate combustion products routed through heat exchange tubes or coils of the modulating furnace. The modulating furnace may also include one or more blowers (e.g., draft inducer blowers) configured to draw exhaust gas (e.g., combustion products) through the heat exchange tubes of the modulating furnace. For example, a blower associated with the modulating furnace may be controlled to generate a varying flow rate of the exhaust gas through the heat exchange tubes. In some embodiments, during the quick heat cycle, the blower may be adjusted to increase a flow rate of the exhaust gas through the heat exchange tubes. To enable the features described herein, the modulating furnace and/or the HVAC system may include a control system (e.g., a controller) to regulate operation of the modulating furnace (e.g., the fuel valve, the blower, etc.).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with present embodiments, a controller of the HVAC system and/or modulating furnace may receive a call (e.g., from a thermostat) to provide conditioning (e.g., heating) to a space conditioned by the HVAC system. The controller may include a processor and a memory, and the memory may include instructions stored thereon that, when executed by the processor, cause the controller to selectively execute one of the various operating modes of the modulating furnace. For example, instructions may include a quick heat algorithm. In the manner described below, the controller may execute the quick heat algorithm and, based on an output from the quick heat algorithm, initiate operation of the modulating furnace in the quick heat operating mode for a threshold time period. After the threshold time period, the controller may operate the modulating furnace in the modulating heat operating mode (e.g., if the call for conditioning remains after operation of the modulating furnace in the quick heat operating mode).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The quick heat algorithm may initiate operation of the quick heat operating mode based on various inputs, calculations, and/or factors. For example, the quick heat algorithm may initiate the quick heat operating mode based on a user input. The quick heat algorithm may also initiate the quick heat operating mode based on whether the quick heat operating mode was initiated in recent cycles of the modulating furnace. For example, the quick heat algorithm may determine a number of operating cycles completed (e.g., operating cycles executed to satisfy respective calls for conditioning) since execution of the last quick heat cycle. The quick heat algorithm may initiate the quick heat cycle based on a determination that the number of operating cycles completed without implementing the quick heat cycle meets or exceeds a threshold number or value. In general, the above-described quick heat algorithm improves heat exchange efficiency and/or reduces conditioning time relative to traditional systems. The improvements and benefits of the disclosed techniques is described in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Turning now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of a heating, ventilation, and/or air conditioning (HVAC) system for environmental management that may employ one or more HVAC units.

The residential heating and cooling system <b>50</b> may provide heated and cooled air to a residential structure, as well as provide outside air for ventilation and provide improved indoor air quality (IAQ) through devices such as ultraviolet lights and air filters. In the illustrated embodiment, the residential heating and cooling system <b>50</b> is a split HVAC system. In general, a residence <b>52</b> conditioned by a split HVAC system may include refrigerant conduits <b>54</b> that operatively couple the indoor unit <b>56</b> to the outdoor unit <b>58</b>. The indoor unit <b>56</b> may be positioned in a utility room, an attic, a basement, and so forth. The outdoor unit <b>58</b> is typically situated adjacent to a side of residence <b>52</b> and is covered by a shroud to protect the system components and to prevent leaves and other debris or contaminants from entering the unit. The refrigerant conduits <b>54</b> transfer refrigerant between the indoor unit <b>56</b> and the outdoor unit <b>58</b>, typically transferring primarily liquid refrigerant in one direction and primarily vaporized refrigerant in an opposite direction.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is operating as an air conditioner, a heat exchanger <b>60</b> in the outdoor unit <b>58</b> serves as a condenser for re-condensing vaporized refrigerant flowing from the indoor unit <b>56</b> to the outdoor unit <b>58</b> via one of the refrigerant conduits <b>54</b>. In these applications, a heat exchanger <b>62</b> of the indoor unit functions as an evaporator.

When operating as an air conditioner, the air is heated by the heat exchanger <b>60</b> within the outdoor unit <b>58</b> and exits the unit at a temperature higher than it entered. The indoor unit <b>56</b> includes a blower or fan <b>66</b> that directs air through or across the indoor heat exchanger <b>62</b>, where the air is cooled when the system is operating in air conditioning mode.

The furnace system <b>70</b> may include a burner assembly and heat exchanger, among other components, inside the indoor unit <b>56</b>. Fuel is provided to the burner assembly of the furnace system <b>70</b> where it is mixed with air and combusted to form combustion products. The combustion products may pass through tubes or piping in a heat exchanger, separate from heat exchanger <b>62</b>, such that air directed by the blower or fan <b>66</b> passes over the tubes or pipes and extracts heat from the combustion products.

In some embodiments, the compressor <b>74</b> may be a centrifugal compressor. The refrigerant vapor delivered by the compressor <b>74</b> to the condenser <b>76</b> may transfer heat to a fluid passing across the condenser <b>76</b>, such as ambient or environmental air <b>96</b>. The refrigerant vapor may condense to a refrigerant liquid in the condenser <b>76</b> as a result of thermal heat transfer with the environmental air <b>96</b>.

For example, the supply air stream <b>98</b> may include ambient or environmental air, return air from a building, or a combination of the two. The liquid refrigerant in the evaporator <b>80</b> may undergo a phase change from the liquid refrigerant to a refrigerant vapor. In this manner, the evaporator <b>80</b> may reduce the temperature of the supply air stream <b>98</b> via thermal heat transfer with the refrigerant.

As previously described, a modulating furnace, such as a variable speed furnace, is configured to adjust an amount of heat output by the modulating furnace and/or temperature of heated air generated by the modulating furnace. In this way, the modulating furnace is configured to provide conditioning (e.g., heating) to a conditioned space more quickly and/or more efficiently than traditional furnaces.

The furnace control system <b>106</b> is configured to regulate operation of components of the modulating furnace <b>104</b> to generate a conditioned (e.g., heated) air flow to be supplied to an interior space <b>119</b> (e.g., a space within the building <b>10</b>).

The fuel <b>124</b> may include natural gas, liquified petroleum gas, fuel oil, coal, or another suitable fuel. The burners <b>126</b> ignite the fuel <b>124</b> to generate thermal energy (e.g., combustion products, exhaust gas, etc.) for transfer to the air <b>118</b> via the heat exchanger <b>110</b>, as discussed in more detail below. The burners <b>126</b> may include any suitable body, nozzle, or tube having an inlet for receiving the fuel <b>124</b> and an outlet for directing the fuel <b>124</b> therefrom. As illustrated, a modulating gas valve <b>128</b> or gas regulation device is fluidly coupled between the fuel source <b>122</b> and the burner assembly <b>116</b> to regulate a fuel input rate of the fuel <b>124</b> provided to the burners <b>126</b> of the burner assembly <b>116</b>. Although described herein with reference to the modulating gas valve <b>128</b>, it is to be understood that the modulating furnace <b>104</b> may additionally or alternatively include any suitable gas regulation device or system, such as a pressure regulator, configured to regulate flow of the fuel <b>124</b>. Additionally, in some embodiments, an oxidant or combustion air source <b>132</b> may provide combustion air <b>134</b> or some other oxidant to the burners <b>126</b> of the burner assembly <b>116</b>. For example, the combustion air <b>134</b> may be drawn into each individual burner <b>126</b> of the burner assembly <b>116</b> to mix with the fuel <b>124</b> drawn into each individual burner <b>126</b> of the burner assembly <b>116</b>.

The air-fuel mixture may be ignited via an igniter <b>144</b> coupled to the burner assembly <b>116</b>. For example, a pulse (e.g., control signal) may be sent through the igniter <b>144</b> to instruct the igniter <b>144</b> to produce a spark adjacent or within the burners <b>126</b> of the burner assembly <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the air-fuel mixture is ignited in one ignitable burner <b>146</b> proximate the igniter <b>144</b>, which sequentially ignites the air-fuel mixture in adjacent burners <b>126</b>.

In the illustrated embodiment, once ignited, the air-fuel mixture drawn through the burners <b>126</b> of the burner assembly <b>116</b> may form combustion products, such as a hot exhaust gas <b>148</b>. The furnace control system <b>106</b> may control operation of the components of the modulating furnace <b>104</b> to maintain robust flames, such as flames extending outside of bodies of the burners <b>126</b>. In this way, the burner assembly <b>116</b> may produce the hot exhaust gas <b>148</b> at a desired temperature, composition, and/or efficiency. The hot exhaust gas <b>148</b> may be directed through the heat exchanger <b>110</b> (e.g., through tubes of the heat exchanger <b>110</b>) to enable heat transfer from the hot exhaust gas <b>148</b> to the air <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, the furnace control system <b>106</b> may include a flame sensor <b>150</b> coupled to the burner assembly <b>116</b> to sense or detect a presence of a flame on a sensed burner <b>152</b>, opposed from the ignitable burner <b>146</b> (e.g., relative to other burners <b>126</b> of the burner assembly <b>116</b>). As such, the flame sensor <b>150</b> enables the furnace control system <b>106</b> to verify whether the air-fuel mixture within each of the burners <b>126</b> has been ignited.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The modulating furnace <b>104</b> may also include a draft inducer blower <b>154</b> fluidly coupled to a distal portion <b>156</b> of the heat exchanger <b>110</b> (e.g., heat exchange tubes), opposite a proximal portion <b>158</b> of the heat exchanger <b>110</b> that is proximate the burner assembly <b>116</b>. In certain embodiments, the combustion air <b>134</b> may be drawn into the burners <b>126</b> of the burner assembly <b>116</b> at least partially due to a pressure difference generated by the draft inducer blower <b>154</b>, which may also operate to draw the hot exhaust gas <b>148</b> through the heat exchanger <b>110</b>. In other words, a flow path for the combustion air <b>134</b> and the hot exhaust gas <b>148</b> extends from the burners <b>126</b> of the burner assembly <b>116</b> to the draft inducer blower <b>154</b>.

For example, the controller <b>180</b> may instruct the draft inducer blower <b>154</b> to increase the flow rate of hot exhaust gas <b>148</b> in conjunction with instructing the modulating gas valve <b>128</b> to increase a fuel input rate of the fuel <b>124</b>. Increasing the fuel input rate of fuel <b>124</b> supplied to the burner assembly <b>116</b> and/or and increasing the speed of the draft inducer blower <b>154</b> may be referred to as &#x201c;ramping up&#x201d; the modulating furnace <b>104</b> to increase an amount of heat transferred to the air <b>118</b> and provided to the interior space <b>119</b> of the building <b>10</b> via the heated air <b>168</b>. Conversely, decreasing the fuel input rate and decreasing the speed of the draft inducer blower <b>154</b> may be referred to as &#x201c;ramping down&#x201d; the modulating furnace <b>104</b> to reduce an amount of heat transferred to the air <b>118</b> and provided to the interior space <b>119</b> of the building <b>10</b> via the heated air <b>168</b>. Further, in some embodiments, the controller <b>180</b> is communicatively coupled to the air blower <b>108</b> and is configured to transmit control signals to cause the air blower <b>108</b> to modify a flow rate of the air <b>118</b> across coils or tubes of the heat exchanger <b>110</b>. In this way, the modulating furnace <b>104</b> may adjust an amount of time the air <b>118</b> is in contact with the heat exchanger <b>110</b>, for example, while ramping up or ramping down the modulating furnace <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view of an embodiment of the modulating furnace <b>104</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the burner assembly <b>116</b> is located near a base <b>200</b> (e.g., a base surface) of the modulating furnace <b>104</b>, and the burner assembly <b>116</b> includes multiple burners <b>126</b>. As previously described, each burner <b>126</b> is configured to combust a mixture of combustion air <b>134</b> and fuel <b>124</b>. The combustion air <b>134</b> may be drawn into each burner <b>126</b> at least partially due to a pressure difference generated by the draft inducer blower <b>154</b> and/or at least partially due to air entrainment within a jet or stream of fuel <b>124</b> provided to each burner <b>126</b> of the burner assembly <b>116</b>. The fuel <b>124</b> may be provided from the fuel source <b>122</b> to a gas inlet <b>204</b> of the modulating gas valve <b>128</b>. The modulating gas valve <b>128</b> is fluidly coupled to a manifold <b>206</b>, which distributes the fuel <b>124</b> to a body <b>208</b> of each burner <b>126</b>. In some embodiments, the fuel <b>124</b> may be evenly or substantially evenly distributed via the manifold <b>206</b> to each burner <b>126</b>. As such, the modulating gas valve <b>128</b> may control a fuel input rate to the burners <b>126</b>. In this way, the modulating gas valve <b>128</b> controls a quantity or volume of the fuel <b>124</b> in the mixture of each burner <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Moreover, the draft inducer blower <b>154</b> is disposed on (e.g., mounted and/or attached to) an outer surface <b>210</b> of the enclosure <b>120</b> of the modulating furnace <b>104</b>.

Additionally, the air blower <b>108</b> may be disposed within the enclosure <b>120</b>, for example, near the base <b>200</b> of the enclosure <b>120</b>. However, in other embodiments, the air blower <b>108</b> may be disposed external to the enclosure <b>120</b>. During operation of the modulating furnace <b>104</b>, the air blower <b>108</b> forces or draws the air <b>118</b> over tubes of the heat exchanger <b>110</b>, and heat is transferred from the hot exhaust gas <b>148</b> to the air <b>118</b>. Thereafter, the heated air <b>168</b> may be discharged from the enclosure <b>120</b> and into a duct <b>214</b>, which may direct the heated air <b>168</b> toward the interior space <b>119</b>. As discussed above, the exhaust gas <b>160</b> may be drawn from the tubes of the heat exchanger <b>110</b> and directed into the exhaust stack <b>164</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As discussed above, the controller <b>180</b> is communicatively coupled to the modulating gas valve <b>128</b> and the draft inducer blower <b>154</b> and is configured to adjust operation of the modulating gas valve <b>128</b> and/or the draft inducer blower <b>154</b>. In accordance with present techniques, the controller <b>180</b> of the modulating furnace <b>104</b> is further configured to control operation of the various above-described components of the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in multiple, different operating modes. For example, the memory <b>184</b> may include instructions stored thereon that, when executed by the processor <b>182</b>, cause the controller <b>180</b> to control operation of the various components of the modulating furnace <b>104</b>. The controller <b>180</b> may be disposed inside a housing (e.g., enclosure <b>120</b>) of the modulating furnace <b>104</b>, may be disposed on a housing (e.g., on an external surface of the housing), or in another location separate from the modulating furnace <b>104</b>. For example, the controller <b>180</b> may be the control panel <b>82</b>, another controller of the HVAC system <b>100</b>, a controller of the HVAC unit <b>12</b>, a controller of the heating and cooling system <b>50</b>, or other controller. In accordance with present embodiments, the controller <b>180</b> may be configured to execute a quick heat cycle algorithm to determine whether, when, and how long to initiate a quick heat cycle mode of the modulating furnace <b>104</b>. Based on the determination, the controller <b>180</b> may then execute the quick heat cycle mode accordingly.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, in the quick heat operating mode, the controller <b>180</b> may control the modulating furnace <b>104</b> (e.g., the burner assembly <b>116</b>, the modulating gas valve <b>128</b>) to direct fuel <b>124</b> (e.g., gas) to the burners <b>126</b> at an upper threshold (e.g., maximum) flow rate.

In other words, in the quick heat operating mode, the controller <b>180</b> may control the modulating furnace <b>104</b> to operate at a full, 100 percent, upper threshold, predefined maximum, and/or maximum capacity (e.g., heat output, heat transfer rate, etc.)</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The controller <b>180</b> may also be configured to operate the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in a modulating heat operating mode in which the controller <b>180</b> controls the modulating furnace <b>104</b> (e.g., the burner assembly <b>116</b>, the modulating gas valve <b>128</b>) to supply a varying amount of fuel <b>124</b> (e.g., gas). For example, in the modulating heat operating mode, the controller <b>180</b> may instruct the modulating gas valve <b>128</b> to supply fuel <b>124</b> to the burners <b>126</b> based on feedback (e.g., sensor feedback). In some embodiments, the controller <b>180</b> may receive feedback including a set point temperature in the interior space <b>119</b> (e.g., from a thermostat) and a measured (e.g., current) temperature of the interior space <b>119</b> (e.g., from a sensor (e.g., interior space <b>119</b> sensor, return air sensor, etc.). The controller <b>180</b> may determine a temperature difference between the set point temperature and the measured temperature and instruct the modulating gas valve <b>128</b> to supply fuel <b>124</b> to the burners <b>126</b> based on the temperature difference. Additionally or alternatively, during the modulating heat operating mode, the controller <b>190</b> may control the draft inducer blower <b>154</b> (e.g., based on the temperature difference, sensor feedback, etc.) to operate at one or more speeds to draw the exhaust gas <b>160</b> through the heat exchanger <b>110</b> at a desired (e.g., variable) flow rate. The controller <b>180</b> may control a setting of the modulating gas valve <b>128</b> and/or the draft inducer blower <b>154</b> to correspond to the quick heat operating mode or the modulating heat operating mode. For example, the controller <b>180</b> may control a position of the modulating gas valve <b>128</b> to direct the above-described upper threshold amount of fuel <b>124</b> (e.g., an amount of fuel <b>124</b> provided at a maximum rate) to the burners <b>126</b> in response to initiation of the quick heat operating mode. The controller <b>180</b> may also control the position of the modulating gas valve <b>128</b> to direct a varying amount of fuel <b>124</b> to the burners <b>126</b> in response to initiation of the modulating heat operating mode.

It should be appreciated that the control system <b>220</b> may also be implemented, in accordance with the present techniques, with other modulating conditioning (e.g., heating, cooling, dehumidification, etc.) systems as previously described. In the illustrated embodiment, the control assembly <b>220</b> includes the controller <b>180</b>, which includes the processor <b>182</b> (e.g., one or more processors, processing circuitry, etc.), the memory <b>184</b> (e.g., non-transitory, computer-readable media having processor-executable instructions stored thereon), and communication circuitry <b>186</b>. The control system <b>220</b> further includes a thermostat <b>222</b>, which includes a user interface <b>224</b>. For example, the thermostat <b>222</b> may be a thermostat of the interior space <b>119</b>. It should be noted that the thermostat <b>222</b> may be a wall-mounted device or a handheld device such as a smart phone or some other network-connected device. In general, the thermostat <b>222</b> may be configured to receive an input (e.g., via the user interface <b>224</b> of the thermostat <b>222</b>, which may include buttons, a display, a graphic user interface [GUI], or any combination thereof) that sets a desired temperature of the conditioned space, referred to in certain instances as a set-point. Further, in some embodiments, the user interface <b>224</b> may be a component separate from the thermostat <b>222</b>. For example, the user interface <b>224</b> may be a mobile device, a tablet, a computer, or other apparatus configured to receive user input. In such embodiments, the user interface <b>224</b> may be communicatively coupled to the thermostat <b>222</b>, the controller <b>180</b>, and/or other component of the HVAC system <b>100</b>. For example, the controller <b>180</b> may be communicatively coupled with the thermostat <b>222</b> and configured to receive a call from the thermostat <b>222</b>. For example, the user interface of the thermostat <b>222</b> may receive an input indicative of operation of the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the quick heat operating mode. The control system <b>220</b> also includes a sensor <b>226</b> (e.g., one or more sensors), such as a temperature sensor disposed within the interior space <b>119</b>, a return air sensor of the HVAC system <b>100</b> (e.g., HVAC unit <b>12</b>, heating and cooling system <b>50</b>), and/or other sensors. The memory <b>184</b> may include instructions stored thereon that, when executed by the processor <b>182</b>, cause the controller <b>180</b> to perform various functions (e.g., execute a quick heat algorithm in accordance with the present disclosure). The controller <b>180</b>, the thermostat <b>222</b>, the user interface <b>224</b>, and/or the sensor <b>226</b> may be communicatively coupled via a wired and/or wireless arrangement (e.g., via a network system <b>228</b>, such as an Internet, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth system). While the controller <b>180</b> is described as a component of the modulating furnace <b>104</b>, any suitable control circuitry may be utilized to control operation of the modulating furnace <b>104</b>. For example, a mobile device, a personal computer, a smart device, a laptop, a tablet, or any other suitable device may be utilized to control operation of the modulating furnace <b>104</b> and/or execute the quick heat algorithm, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As previously described, the controller <b>180</b> may receive a call for conditioning (e.g., heating). For example, the controller <b>180</b> may receive the call for conditioning from the thermostat <b>222</b> (e.g., via the user interface <b>224</b>, which may include one or more buttons, displays, graphic user interfaces [GUIs], dials, touchscreens, or any combination thereof) and/or from the control panel <b>82</b>. In response to receiving the call, the controller <b>180</b> may execute a quick heat algorithm to initiate operation of the modulating furnace <b>104</b>. In some instances and as described further below, execution of the quick heat algorithm may cause the controller <b>180</b> to operate the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the quick heat operating mode, in the manner previously described, for a threshold time period. If the call for conditioning is not satisfied prior to expiration of the threshold time period, the controller <b>180</b> may then operate the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the modulating heat operating mode until the call is satisfied. For example, the controller <b>180</b> may operate the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the modulating heat operating mode subsequent to expiration of the threshold time period. Additionally or alternatively, the controller <b>180</b> may include a timer (e.g., a clock) configured to count an elapsed time from the call (e.g., receiving the call, initiating operation of the modulating furnace <b>104</b>). In certain embodiments, the controller <b>180</b> may compare the elapsed time from the timer to the threshold time period and/or may operate the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the modulating heat operating mode subsequent to expiration of the threshold time period. In some embodiments, the timer may count down from the threshold time period and the controller <b>180</b> may operate the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the modulating heat operating mode subsequent to expiration of the threshold time period on the timer.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the quick heat algorithm employed by the controller <b>180</b>, each previously satisfied call from the thermostat may be associated with a cycle of the modulating furnace that was used to satisfy the call. The quick heat algorithm employed to initiate operation of the modulating furnace <b>104</b> may be based at least in part on recent (e.g., previous) cycles of the modulating furnace <b>104</b>, whether the recent cycles, which satisfied previous calls from the thermostat <b>222</b>, employed quick heat cycle operation, an elapsed time of the current cycle, and comparing the elapsed time to a threshold time period. A modulating heat cycle refers to a cycle that was completed without initiating quick heat operation. A quick heat cycle refers to a cycle that was completed only after initiation of quick heat cycle operation (e.g., quick heat cycles may include quick heat cycle operation and then include modulating heat cycle operation to satisfy the call from the thermostat <b>222</b>).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The quick heat algorithm may include a comparison of the number of consecutive recent cycles which are modulating heat cycles and a threshold number of cycles. Thus, the controller <b>180</b> may compare a number of consecutive recent modulating heat cycles with a threshold number of cycles. If the number of consecutive recent modulating heat cycles meets or exceeds the threshold number of cycles, the controller <b>180</b> may initiate operation of the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the quick heat operating mode. Likewise, if the number of consecutive recent modulating heat cycles fails to meet or exceed the threshold number of cycles, the controller <b>180</b> may initiate operation of the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the modulating heat operating mode. For example, if the threshold number of cycles is five cycles, the modulating furnace <b>104</b> is controlled to operate in the modulating heat operating mode for at most five consecutive heating cycles, then the modulating furnace <b>104</b> is controlled to operate in the quick heat operating mode for the next cycle after the five consecutive modulating heat cycles.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Additionally, the controller <b>180</b> may also compare the elapsed time compared to a threshold time period and the comparison may be employed via the quick heat algorithm. The quick heat algorithm may include a comparison of the elapsed time for the current cycle and the threshold time period. Thus, if the elapsed time meets or exceeds the threshold time period, the controller <b>180</b> may operate the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the modulating heat operating mode. In certain embodiments, the controller <b>180</b> may continue to operate the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the quick heat operating mode until either of the call from the thermostat <b>222</b> is satisfied or the elapsed time meets or exceeds the threshold time period.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one embodiment, the thermostat <b>222</b> may call for a temperature increase (e.g., a difference between the desired temperature (e.g., set temperature) and a current temperature of the conditioned space) of a certain number of degrees (e.g., Fahrenheit, Celsius) in the enclosed space serviced by the modulating furnace <b>104</b>. The call may be in the form of a value indicative of a desired temperature differential, a value indicative of a desired temperature, a first value indicative of a desired temperature and a second value indicative of a current temperature, or the like. The controller <b>180</b> may receive the call from the thermostat <b>222</b> and, in response to the call, execute the quick heat algorithm to initiate operation of the modulating furnace for an elapsed time (e.g., an amount of time during which quick heat cycle operation is employed and after which modulating heat cycle operation is initiated if the call is not satisfied prior to the elapsed time meeting or exceeding a threshold time period). For example, if the threshold time period is 8 minutes, the modulating furnace <b>104</b> is controlled to operate in the quick heat operating mode for at most 8 minutes, and if the call from the thermostat <b>222</b> is not satisfied by the quick heat operating mode before or by the time the 8 minutes expire, then the modulating furnace <b>104</b> is controlled to operate in the modulating heat operating mode until the call from the thermostat <b>222</b> is satisfied.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Additionally or alternatively, the user interface of the thermostat <b>222</b> may receive an input indicative of setting and/or adjusting a threshold number of consecutive modulating heat cycles and/or a threshold time period to operate the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the quick heat operating mode. For example, the user interface may receive an input to increase the threshold time period (e.g., up to 4 minutes, 6 minutes, 8 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and so forth) and/or may receive an input to decrease the threshold time period (e.g., to 10 minutes, 8 minutes, 4 minutes, and so forth).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As mentioned above, the sensor <b>226</b> may be a temperature sensor configured to detect a temperature in the space (e.g., interior space <b>119</b>) being conditioned by the modulating furnace <b>104</b>. In certain embodiments, the sensor <b>226</b> may detect a temperature of return air (e.g., received by the HVAC system <b>100</b>). When the temperature detected by the sensor <b>226</b> indicates that the call from the thermostat <b>222</b> is satisfied (e.g., a set point temperature is reached), the controller <b>180</b> may suspend operation of the modulating furnace <b>104</b>. That is, the controller <b>190</b> may control the modulating furnace <b>104</b> to end the cycle (e.g., until another call for heating is received by the controller <b>180</b>). Additionally or alternatively, the controller <b>180</b> may control the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the modulating heat cycle based on feedback (e.g., indicative of the measured temperature of the conditioned space) from the sensor <b>226</b>. In certain embodiments, the controller <b>180</b> may determine a temperature difference between the temperature of the conditioned space (e.g., interior space <b>119</b>) monitored by the sensor <b>226</b> and a set point temperature (e.g., input via the thermostat <b>222</b> and/or interface <b>224</b>). The controller <b>180</b> may operate the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the modulating heat cycle operation mode based on the temperature difference. For example, the controller <b>180</b> may adjust the modulating gas valve <b>128</b> to control a flow rate of the fuel <b>124</b> supplied to the burners <b>126</b> of the modulating furnace <b>104</b> based on the temperature difference. In some embodiments, the controller <b>180</b> may adjust the modulating gas valve <b>128</b> to decrease the fuel <b>124</b> flow rate as the temperature difference decreases (e.g., the temperature of the interior space <b>119</b> approaches the set point temperature). The controller <b>180</b> may adjust the modulating gas valve <b>128</b> to increase the fuel <b>124</b> flow rate as the temperature difference increases (e.g., the temperature of the interior space <b>119</b> diverges from the set point temperature). In the modulating heat cycle operation, the controller <b>180</b> may additionally or alternatively control the draft inducer blower <b>154</b> similarly.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The quick heat algorithm employs additional features described in detail below with reference to later drawings. However, in general, a result (e.g., output or outcome) of the quick heat algorithm may be at least in part a function of the above-described elapsed time, threshold time period, and a number of cycles from the last quick heat cycle. The output or outcome includes initiation of the modulating furnace <b>104</b> during which the controller <b>180</b> operates the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the quick heat operating mode and, if the call from the thermostat <b>222</b> is not satisfied prior to the threshold time period expiring or lapsing, after which the controller <b>180</b> operates the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the modulating heat operating mode.

In the illustrated embodiment, the process <b>230</b> includes receiving (block <b>232</b>) a call for heating from a thermostat, such as the thermostat <b>222</b>. The controller <b>180</b> may receive the call and may associate (block <b>234</b>) the call with a quick heat cycle for the modulating furnace <b>104</b>. For example, the call may be indicative of a user selection of a quick heat cycle via the user interface, such as user interface <b>224</b> of the thermostat <b>222</b>.

In certain embodiments, in response to receiving the call and/or associating the call with the quick heat cycle, the controller <b>180</b> may initiate operation of the modulating furnace <b>104</b>. For example, the controller <b>180</b> may operate the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the quick heat operating mode, as described herein. In certain embodiments, the controller <b>180</b> may adjust the modulating gas valve <b>128</b> to increase a fuel flow rate of a fuel <b>124</b> to a threshold (e.g., maximum) flow rate during the quick heat operating mode. Additionally or alternatively, the controller <b>180</b> may adjust the draft inducer blower <b>154</b> to produce a threshold (e.g., maximum) flow rate of combustion products (e.g., exhaust gas <b>160</b>) through the heat exchanger <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The illustrated process <b>230</b> also includes determining (block <b>238</b>) an elapsed time for the current heating cycle. For example, the elapsed time may be a time period beginning when operation of the modulating furnace <b>104</b> is initiated in response to the thermostat call. The illustrated process <b>230</b> also includes comparing (block <b>240</b>) the elapsed time to a threshold time period. The threshold time period may be stored in the memory <b>184</b> of the controller <b>180</b>. The controller <b>180</b> may determine (block <b>242</b>) whether the elapsed time falls below or meets or exceeds the threshold time period.

As such, the controller <b>180</b> may compare the elapsed time to the threshold time period and determine the elapsed time falls below the threshold time period (YES path of block <b>242</b>). Accordingly, the controller <b>180</b> may continue to operate the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the quick heat operating mode until the threshold time period expires (e.g., the elapsed time meets or exceeds the threshold time period).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As another example, the elapsed time may be 6 minutes and the threshold time period may also be 6 minutes.

Accordingly, the controller <b>180</b> may operate (block <b>244</b>) the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the modulating heat operating mode, as described herein. For example, the controller <b>180</b> may adjust operation of the modulating furnace <b>104</b> from the quick heat operating mode to the modulating heat operating mode subsequent to the expiration of the threshold time period. In certain embodiments, the controller <b>180</b> may adjust the modulating gas valve <b>128</b> to decrease the fuel flow rate from the threshold (e.g., maximum) flow rate to a lower flow rate. Additionally or alternatively, the controller <b>180</b> may adjust the draft inducer blower <b>154</b> to produce a flow rate of combustion products (e.g., exhaust gas <b>160</b>) through the heat exchanger <b>110</b> that is lower than the threshold (e.g., maximum) flow rate.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a block diagram of a sequence <b>250</b> of cycles for the modulating furnace of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The sequence <b>250</b> may include any number of cycles, such as first cycle <b>252</b>, second cycle <b>254</b>, N&#x2212;1th cycle <b>256</b>, and Nth cycle <b>258</b>. In certain embodiments, N may be any number and may be a threshold number of modulating heat cycles before the controller <b>180</b> operates the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in a quick heat operating mode. Any number of cycles may occur between the illustrated second cycle <b>254</b> and the N&#x2212;1th cycle <b>256</b>. For example, N may be 7 cycles and the N&#x2212;1th cycle <b>256</b> may be the sixth cycle in the sequence <b>250</b>. In certain embodiments, the controller <b>180</b> may monitor the sequence of cycles to determine a number of consecutive modulating heat cycles. For example, the controller <b>180</b> may receive a call from the thermostat <b>222</b> for each cycle <b>252</b>, <b>254</b>, <b>256</b>, <b>258</b>. In some embodiments, the first cycle <b>252</b>, the second cycle <b>254</b>, and the N&#x2212;1th cycle <b>256</b> may be modulating heat cycles. For example, the controller <b>180</b> may operate the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the modulating heat operating mode for the first cycle <b>252</b>, the second cycle <b>254</b>, the N&#x2212;1th cycle <b>256</b>, and any number of cycles between the second cycle <b>254</b> and the N&#x2212;1th cycle. In certain embodiments, the controller <b>180</b> may compare the number of consecutive modulating heat cycles with a threshold number of cycles. For example, the controller <b>180</b> may receive a call from the thermostat <b>222</b> for heating. In response to the call, the controller <b>180</b> may determine the number of consecutive modulating heat cycles from previous calls for heating. Additionally or alternatively, the controller <b>180</b> may determine the number of cycles from the current call for heating and a previous call during which the modulating furnace <b>104</b> was operated in the quick heat operating mode.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The controller <b>180</b> may compare the number of consecutive modulating heat cycles to the threshold number of cycles and may operate the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in either a modulating heat operating mode or a quick heat operating mode based on the comparison. For example, if the number of consecutive modulating heat cycles meets or exceeds the threshold number of cycles, then the controller <b>180</b> may operate the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the quick heat operating mode in response to the call for heating from the thermostat <b>222</b>. As such, the Nth cycle <b>258</b> may be a quick heat cycle of the modulating furnace <b>104</b>. Alternatively, if the number of consecutive modulating heat cycles falls below the threshold number of cycles, then the controller <b>180</b> may operate the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the modulating heat operating mode in response to the call for heating from the thermostat <b>222</b>. Accordingly, the Nth cycle <b>258</b> may be a modulating heat cycle of the modulating furnace <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">With the foregoing in mind, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an embodiment of a process flow diagram illustrating a process <b>260</b> of executing the quick heat algorithm. In the illustrated embodiment, the process <b>260</b> includes receiving (block <b>262</b>) a call for heating from a thermostat, such as the thermostat <b>222</b>. In certain embodiments, the controller <b>180</b> may receive the call via a communication interface with the thermostat <b>222</b>. The illustrated process <b>260</b> may also include determining (block <b>264</b>) a number of consecutive cycles between the call and a previous call associated with a quick heat cycle for the modulating furnace <b>104</b>. In certain embodiments, the controller <b>180</b> may store information corresponding to any number of cycles in the memory <b>184</b>. For example, the controller <b>180</b> may receive information from the memory <b>184</b> for up to the last 20 cycles (e.g., the last 15 cycles, the last 10 cycles, the last 5 cycles, and so forth). The controller <b>180</b> may determine a number of completed consecutive cycles since the last quick heat cycle. For example, the controller <b>180</b> may determine five consecutive modulating heat cycles have been completed since the last quick heat cycle.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The controller <b>180</b> may also compare (block <b>266</b>) the number of consecutive modulating heat cycles with a threshold number of cycles, as described herein. The illustrated process <b>260</b> may also include determining (block <b>268</b>) whether the number of consecutive modulating heat cycles falls below or meets or exceeds the threshold cycle amount. For example, the controller <b>180</b> may determine the number of consecutive modulating heat cycles is 9 cycles and the threshold number of consecutive modulating heat cycles is 8 cycles. As such, the controller <b>180</b> may compare the number of consecutive modulating heat cycles with the threshold number of consecutive modulating heat cycles and determine the number of consecutive modulating heat cycles exceeds the threshold number of consecutive modulating heat cycles (NO path of block <b>268</b>). Accordingly, the controller <b>180</b> may operate (block <b>270</b>) the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in a quick heat operating mode. In certain embodiments, in response to receiving the call and/or determining the number of consecutive modulating heat cycles meets or exceeds the threshold cycle amount, the controller <b>180</b> may initiate operation of the modulating furnace <b>104</b>. For example, the controller <b>180</b> may operate the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the quick heat operating mode, as described herein. In certain embodiments, the controller <b>180</b> may adjust the modulating gas valve <b>128</b> to increase a fuel flow rate of a fuel <b>124</b> to a threshold (e.g., maximum) flow rate during the quick heat operating mode. Additionally or alternatively, the controller <b>180</b> may adjust the draft inducer blower <b>154</b> to produce a threshold (e.g., maximum) flow rate of combustion products (e.g., exhaust gas <b>160</b>) through the heat exchanger <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As another example, the controller <b>180</b> may determine the number of consecutive modulating heat cycles is 4 cycles and the threshold number of consecutive modulating heat cycles is 6 cycles. As such, the controller <b>180</b> may compare the number of consecutive modulating heat cycles with the threshold number of consecutive modulating heat cycles and determine the number of consecutive modulating heat cycles falls below the threshold number of consecutive modulating heat cycles (YES path of block <b>268</b>). Accordingly, the controller <b>180</b> may operate (block <b>272</b>) the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the modulating heat operating mode, as described herein. For example, the controller <b>180</b> may initiate operation of the modulating furnace <b>104</b> in the modulating heat operating mode. In certain embodiments, the controller <b>180</b> may adjust the modulating gas valve <b>128</b> to decrease the fuel flow rate from the threshold (e.g., maximum) flow rate to a lower flow rate. Additionally or alternatively, the controller <b>180</b> may adjust the draft inducer blower <b>154</b> to produce a flow rate of combustion products (e.g., exhaust gas <b>160</b>) through the heat exchanger <b>110</b> that is lower than the threshold (e.g., maximum) flow rate.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The present disclosure may provide one or more technical effects useful in the operation of an HVAC system.
