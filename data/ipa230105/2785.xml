Typically, the rAAV vector genome will only retain the one or more ITR sequence so as to maximize the size of the transgene that can be efficiently packaged by the vector. The structural and non-structural protein coding sequences may be provided in trans (e.g., from a vector, such as a plasmid, or by stably integrating the sequences into a packaging cell). In embodiments of the invention the rAAV vector genome comprises at least one ITR sequence (e.g., AAV ITR sequence), optionally two ITRs (e.g., two AAV ITRs), which typically will be at the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends of the vector genome and flank the heterologous nucleic acid, but need not be contiguous thereto. The ITRs can be the same or different from each other.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">An &#x201c;AAV inverted terminal repeat&#x201d; or &#x201c;AAV ITR&#x201d; may be from any AAV, including but not limited to serotypes 1, 2, 3a, 3b, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 13, snake AAV, avian AAV, bovine AAV, canine AAV, equine AAV, ovine AAV, goat AAV, shrimp AAV, or any other AAV now known or later discovered (see, e.g., Table 1). An AAV ITR need not have the native terminal repeat sequence (e.g., a native AAV ITR sequence may be altered by insertion, deletion, truncation and/or missense mutations), as long as the terminal repeat mediates the desired functions, e.g., replication, virus packaging, persistence, and/or provirus rescue, and the like, and comprises structural components required for function (e.g., such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The virus vectors of the invention can further be &#x201c;targeted&#x201d; virus vectors (e.g., having a directed tropism) and/or a &#x201c;hybrid&#x201d; AAV (i.e., in which the viral ITRs and viral capsid are from different AAV) as described in international patent publication WO 00/28004 and Chao et al., (2000) <i>Mol.

For the purpose of vector production, the template will typically be embedded within a larger nucleotide sequence or construct, including but not limited to a plasmid, naked DNA vector, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) or a viral vector (e.g., adenovirus, herpesvirus, Epstein-Barr Virus, AAV, baculoviral, retroviral vectors, and the like). Alternatively, the template may be stably incorporated into the chromosome of a packaging cell.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As used herein, AAV &#x201c;Rep coding sequences&#x201d; indicate the nucleic acid sequences that encode the AAV non-structural proteins that mediate viral replication and the production of new virus particles. The AAV replication genes and proteins have been described in, e.g., FIELDS et al. V<smallcaps>IROLOGY</smallcaps>, volume 2, chapters 69 &#x26; 70 (4th ed., Lippincott-Raven Publishers).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The &#x201c;Rep coding sequences&#x201d; need not encode all of the AAV Rep proteins. For example, with respect to AAV, the Rep coding sequences do not need to encode all four AAV Rep proteins (Rep78, Rep 68, Rep52 and Rep40), in fact, it is believed that AAV5 only expresses the spliced Rep68 and Rep40 proteins. In representative embodiments, the Rep coding sequences encode at least those replication proteins that are necessary for viral genome replication and packaging into new virions. The Rep coding sequences will generally encode at least one large Rep protein (i.e., Rep78/68) and one small Rep protein (i.e., Rep52/40). In particular embodiments, the Rep coding sequences encode the AAV Rep78 protein and the AAV Rep52 and/or Rep40 proteins. In other embodiments, the Rep coding sequences encode the Rep68 and the Rep52 and/or Rep40 proteins. In a still further embodiment, the Rep coding sequences encode the Rep68 and Rep52 proteins, Rep68 and Rep40 proteins, Rep78 and Rep52 proteins, or Rep78 and Rep40 proteins.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As used herein, the term &#x201c;large Rep protein&#x201d; refers to Rep68 and/or Rep78. Large Rep proteins of the claimed invention may be either wild-type or synthetic. A wild-type large Rep protein may be from any AAV, including but not limited to serotypes 1, 2, 3a, 3b, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 13, or any other AAV now known or later discovered (see, e.g., Table 1). A synthetic large Rep protein may be altered by insertion, deletion, truncation and/or missense mutations.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Those skilled in the art will further appreciate that it is not necessary that the replication proteins be encoded by the same polynucleotide. For example, for AAV, the p19 promoter may be inactivated and the large Rep protein(s) expressed from one polynucleotide and the small Rep protein(s) expressed from a different polynucleotide. Typically, however, it will be more convenient to express the replication proteins from a single construct. In some systems, the viral promoters (e.g., AAV p19 promoter) may not be recognized by the cell, and it is therefore necessary to express the large and small Rep proteins from separate expression cassettes. In other instances, it may be desirable to express the large Rep and small Rep proteins separately, i.e., under the control of separate transcriptional and/or translational control elements. For example, it may be desirable to control expression of the large Rep proteins, so as to decrease the ratio of large to small Rep proteins. In the case of insect cells, it may be advantageous to down-regulate expression of the large Rep proteins (e.g., Rep78/68) to avoid toxicity to the cells (see, e.g., Urabe et al., (2002) <i>Human Gene Therapy </i>13:1935).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As used herein, the AAV &#x201c;cap coding sequences&#x201d; encode the structural proteins that form a functional AAV capsid (i.e., can package DNA and infect target cells). Typically, the cap coding sequences will encode all of the AAV capsid subunits, but less than all of the capsid subunits may be encoded as long as a functional capsid is produced. Typically, but not necessarily, the cap coding sequences will be present on a single nucleic acid molecule.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The capsid structure of AAV are described in more detail in BERNARD N FIELDS et al., VIROLOGY, volume 2, chapters 69 &#x26; 70 (4th ed., Lippincott-Raven Publishers).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As used herein, the term &#x201c;synthetic AAV ITR&#x201d; refers to a non-naturally occurring ITR that differs in nucleotide sequence from wild-type ITRs, e.g., the AAV serotype 2 ITR (ITR2) sequence due to one or more deletions, additions, substitutions, or any combination thereof. The difference between the synthetic and wild-type ITR (e.g., ITR2) sequences may be as little as a single nucleotide change, e.g., a change in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 or more nucleotides or any range therein.

The AAV rep/cap sequences and, if present, the rAAV template are embedded in the adenovirus backbone and are flanked by the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; cis sequences, so that these sequences may be packaged into adenovirus capsids. As described above, the adenovirus helper sequences and the AAV rep/cap sequences are generally not flanked by TRs so that these sequences are not packaged into the AAV virions.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0127">Zhang et al.

For example, AAV and helper virus may be readily differentiated based on size. AAV may also be separated away from helper virus based on affinity for a heparin substrate. Deleted replication-defective helper viruses can be used so that any contaminating helper virus is not replication competent. As a further alternative, an adenovirus helper lacking late gene expression may be employed, as only adenovirus early gene expression is required to mediate packaging of AAV virus.

As another example, bone morphogenic proteins (including BNP 2, 7, etc., RANKL and/or VEGF) can be administered with a bone allograft, for example, following a break or surgical removal in a cancer patient.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0154">Thus, in some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of treating a disease in a subject in need thereof, comprising introducing a therapeutic nucleic acid into a cell of the subject by administering to the subject the virus vector and/or composition of the present invention, under conditions whereby the therapeutic nucleic acid is expressed in the subject.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0155">The invention can also be used to produce induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS). For example, a virus vector of the invention can be used to deliver stem cell associated nucleic acid(s) into a non-pluripotent cell, such as adult fibroblasts, skin cells, liver cells, renal cells, adipose cells, cardiac cells, neural cells, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and the like. Nucleic acids encoding factors associated with stem cells are known in the art. Nonlimiting examples of such factors associated with stem cells and pluripotency include Oct-3/4, the SOX family (e.g., SOX1, SOX2, SOX3 and/or SOX15), the Klf family (e.g., Klf1, Klf2, Klf4 and/or Klf5), the Myc family (e.g., C-myc, L-myc and/or N-myc), NANOG and/or LIN28.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0156">The invention can also be practiced to treat and/or prevent a metabolic disorder such as diabetes (e.g., insulin), hemophilia (e.g., Factor IX or Factor VIII), a lysosomal storage disorder such as a mucopolysaccharidosis disorder (e.g., Sly syndrome [&#x3b2;-glucuronidase], Hurler Syndrome [&#x3b1;-L-iduronidase], Scheie Syndrome [&#x3b1;-L-iduronidase], Hurler-Scheie Syndrome [&#x3b1;-L-iduronidase], Hunter's Syndrome [iduronate sulfatase], Sanfilippo Syndrome A [heparan sulfamidase], B [N-acetylglucosaminidase], C [acetyl-CoA:&#x3b1;-glucosaminide acetyltransferase], D [N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfatase], Morquio Syndrome A [galactose-6-sulfate sulfatase], B [&#x3b2;-galactosidase], Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome [N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase], etc.), Fabry disease (&#x3b1;-galactosidase), Gaucher's disease (glucocerebrosidase), or a glycogen storage disorder (e.g., Pompe disease; lysosomal acid &#x3b1;-glucosidase).</p><p id="p-0159" num="0157">Gene transfer has substantial potential use for understanding and providing therapy for disease states. There are a number of inherited diseases in which defective genes are known and have been cloned. In general, the above disease states fall into two classes: deficiency states, usually of enzymes, which are generally inherited in a recessive manner, and unbalanced states, which may involve regulatory or structural proteins, and which are typically inherited in a dominant manner. For deficiency state diseases, gene transfer can be used to bring a normal gene into affected tissues for replacement therapy, as well as to create animal models for the disease using antisense mutations. For unbalanced disease states, gene transfer can be used to create a disease state in a model system, which can then be used in efforts to counteract the disease state. Thus, virus vectors according to the present invention permit the treatment and/or prevention of genetic diseases.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0158">The virus vectors according to the present invention may also be employed to provide a functional RNA to a cell in vitro or in vivo. Expression of the functional RNA in the cell, for example, can diminish expression of a particular target protein by the cell. Accordingly, functional RNA can be administered to decrease expression of a particular protein in a subject in need thereof. Functional RNA can also be administered to cells in vitro to regulate gene expression and/or cell physiology, e.g., to optimize cell or tissue culture systems or in screening methods.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0159">In addition, virus vectors according to the instant invention find use in diagnostic and screening methods, whereby a nucleic acid of interest is transiently or stably expressed in a cell culture system, or alternatively, a transgenic animal model.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0160">The virus vectors of the present invention can also be used for various non-therapeutic purposes, including but not limited to use in protocols to assess gene targeting, clearance, transcription, translation, etc., as would be apparent to one skilled in the art. The virus vectors can also be used for the purpose of evaluating safety (spread, toxicity, immunogenicity, etc.). Such data, for example, are considered by the United States Food and Drug Administration as part of the regulatory approval process prior to evaluation of clinical efficacy.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0161">As a further aspect, the virus vectors of the present invention may be used to produce an immune response in a subject. According to this embodiment, a virus vector comprising a heterologous nucleic acid sequence encoding an immunogenic polypeptide can be administered to a subject, and an active immune response is mounted by the subject against the immunogenic polypeptide.

In some embodiments, a protective immune response is elicited.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0162">Alternatively, the virus vector may be administered to a cell ex vivo and the altered cell is administered to the subject. The virus vector comprising the heterologous nucleic acid is introduced into the cell, and the cell is administered to the subject, where the heterologous nucleic acid encoding the immunogen can be expressed and induce an immune response in the subject against the immunogen. In particular embodiments, the cell is an antigen-presenting cell (e.g., a dendritic cell).</p><p id="p-0165" num="0163">An &#x201c;active immune response&#x201d; or &#x201c;active immunity&#x201d; is characterized by &#x201c;participation of host tissues and cells after an encounter with the immunogen.

Herscowitz, <i>Immunophysiology: Cell Function and Cellular Interactions in Antibody Formation</i>, in IMMUNOLOGY: BASIC PROCESSES 117 (Joseph A. Bellanti ed., 1985). Alternatively stated, an active immune response is mounted by the host after exposure to an immunogen by infection or by vaccination. Active immunity can be contrasted with passive immunity, which is acquired through the &#x201c;transfer of preformed substances (antibody, transfer factor, thymic graft, interleukin-2) from an actively immunized host to a non-immune host.&#x201d; Id.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0164">A &#x201c;protective&#x201d; immune response or &#x201c;protective&#x201d; immunity as used herein indicates that the immune response confers some benefit to the subject in that it prevents or reduces the incidence of disease. Alternatively, a protective immune response or protective immunity may be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of disease, in particular cancer or tumors (e.g., by preventing cancer or tumor formation, by causing regression of a cancer or tumor and/or by preventing metastasis and/or by preventing growth of metastatic nodules). The protective effects may be complete or partial, as long as the benefits of the treatment outweigh any disadvantages thereof.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0165">In particular embodiments, the virus vector or cell comprising the heterologous nucleic acid can be administered in an immunogenically effective amount, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0166">The virus vectors of the present invention can also be administered for cancer immunotherapy by administration of a virus vector expressing one or more cancer cell antigens (or an immunologically similar molecule) or any other immunogen that produces an immune response against a cancer cell. To illustrate, an immune response can be produced against a cancer cell antigen in a subject by administering a virus vector comprising a heterologous nucleic acid encoding the cancer cell antigen, for example to treat a patient with cancer and/or to prevent cancer from developing in the subject. The virus vector may be administered to a subject in vivo or by using ex vivo methods, as described herein. Alternatively, the cancer antigen can be expressed as part of the virus capsid or be otherwise associated with the virus capsid (e.g., as described above).</p><p id="p-0169" num="0167">As another alternative, any other therapeutic nucleic acid (e.g., RNAi) or polypeptide (e.g., cytokine) known in the art can be administered to treat and/or prevent cancer.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0168">As used herein, the term &#x201c;cancer&#x201d; encompasses tumor-forming cancers.

The ends of the genome are flanked by 145 nucleotide inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequences that are predicted to fold back upon themselves to form hairpin structures (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>). The Cap gene produces the capsid VP proteins and also contains the reading frame for AAP which helps in assembly of the capsid. The AAV2 Rep gene produces four proteins named for their approximate weights: Rep78, Rep68, Rep50, and Rep42. The small Reps, 50 and 42, can act as motor proteins to package nascent genomes into preformed capsids. The large Reps, 78 and 68, have endonuclease and ATP-dependent helicase functions that are used for genomic replication. These large Reps can initiate genome replication by binding to the Rep Binding Element (RBE) in the A region of the ITR. This initial binding may help to unwind the DNA strands and form a nicking stem that is cleaved by Rep at the dinucleotide TT terminal resolution site (trs). In addition, the large Rep proteins also make contact with the RBE&#x2032; region at the tip of the C-loop (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>). The ITR plays a fundamental role in the life cycle of AAV by containing the replication of origin, packaging signals, and the ability to confer persistence to AAV genomes after infection.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0226">For AAV serotypes 1-4 and 6-7, the predicted structure of the ITR is similar but there are sequence differences throughout, notably in the number of GAGC repeats in the RBE, the TTT or TCT at the RBE&#x2032;, the nucleotides in the hairpin loops, and the nucleotides in the D-region that do not participate in the formation of the nicking stem (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>). Even with these differences, the AAV2 Reps are capable of replicating and cross-packaging genomes from serotypes 1, 3, 4, and 6 into numerous, non-AAV2 capsids.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0227">Currently, recombinant AAV (rAAV) vector production platforms rely on an AAV2 Rep-AAV2 ITR replication and packaging system. In rAAV, the internal genes of AAV are removed, leaving only the ITRs to flank the therapeutic cassette. Thus, in a clinical setting, patients receiving gene therapy are exposed not only to the capsid proteins, but also the native viral AAV2 ITR sequences. The impact of these sequences in cells has been historically understudied, but it is known that the AAV ITR may interact with a number of host proteins and may stimulate anti-viral and DNA damage response pathways (Julien et al. 2018 <i>Sci</i>.

These ITRs were ordered with one ITR per plasmid to prevent potential intermolecular recombination during synthesis and propagation. These plasmids were electroporated into SURE Electroporation-Competent Cells (Agilent, 200227). Colony plasmids were screened for intact ITR sequences using restriction enzymes specific to the ITR genotype and then cloned into a pUC19 backbone with a 20 nucleotide stuffer sequence chosen randomly from lambda phage DNA, followed by the reading frame for luciferase or cre recombinase, an SV40 early polyA signal, and 2172 nucleotides of lambda phage DNA stuffer sequence to bring the total length of the AAV vector genome to 4395 or 3778 bases, respectively. After plasmid construction, the ITR sequences were verified using the illustra TempliPhi Sequence Resolver Kit (GE Life Sciences, 28903529) followed by Sanger sequencing.

AAV2-ITR-luciferase and AAV2-CBA-luciferase were packaged into AAV2 capsids and used to infect HEK293 cells at 1E5 vg/cell. Two days post-infection, luciferase activity was measured and found to be over 4 logs higher from the CBA-promoted luciferase compared to ITR2-promoted luciferase (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). This demonstrated that ITR2 promoter activity could be successfully measured using a luciferase reporter system.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0236">The use of ITR7 in an AAV2 Rep packaging system has yet to be reported in the literature. To test the feasibility of using ITR7 in combination with AAV2 Rep and an AAV2 capsid, ITR7 containing vectors were transfected into HEK293 cells with an adenoviral helper and pXR2. Resulting virus was titered by qPCR. ITR7 vectors had similar titers to ITR1 and ITR2 vectors made at the same time (Table 2). HEK293, HeLa, and Huh7 cells were infected with AAV1/2, AAV2/2, and AAV7/2-ITR-luciferase at 2E5 vg/cell. Luciferase activity was measured two days post-infection. Relative light units (RLU) were normalized to total amount of cellular protein added to the luciferase assay as determined by a BCA assay and then further normalized to ITR2 RLU values (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B-<b>2</b>D</figref>). RLUs from ITR1-promoted luciferase were consistently lower than that of ITR2 across all three cells lines (p&#x3c;0.0001). In HEK293 cells, ITR1 had an average of 29% activity compared to ITR2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). This activity was slightly higher in HeLa cells at 35% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) and in Huh7 cells at 32% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>). In contrast, ITR7 displayed different promoter activity across the cell lines. In Huh7 cells, ITR7 and ITR1 had the same expression level, 33% and 31% respectively, compared to ITR2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>), but ITR7 had higher expression than ITR1 in HeLa cells at 62% (p&#x3c;0.0001) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). In HEK293 cells, ITR7-promoted luciferase activity rose to an average of 83%, with one preparation of virus having reduced activity compared to the other two preparations of virus (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), but this over all activity was still lower than that of ITR2 (p=0.0029).</p><p id="p-0239" num="0237">To determine if ITRs 3, 4, and 6 also displayed promoter activity in these cell lines, ITR-luciferase plasmids were used to create AAV(1-4, 6)/2-ITR-luciferase vectors where AAVN/N is AAV(ITR genotype)/capsid serotype. All ITRs were able to be replicated and packaged by AAV2 Rep and batch titers were within 4-fold of each other. Of note, under these replication, packaging and purification conditions, titers from ITR2 containing vector plasmids were usually the highest, while ITR6 or ITR7 were always the lowest (Table 2).</p><p id="p-0240" num="0238">HEK293, HeLa, and Huh7 cells were infected with AAV(1-4, 6 or 7)/2-ITR-luciferase vectors at 2E5 vg/cell. Luciferase activity was measured as described above. ITRs 3, 4, and 6 also resulted in luciferase activity in the cell lines tested, but to varying degrees (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>E-<b>2</b>G</figref>). In all three cells lines, ITR2 and ITR3 resulted in the highest luciferase activity. Only in Huh7 cells was there a significant difference between ITR2 and ITR3 (p=0.0082), with ITR3 averaging 30% more activity than ITR2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>G</figref>). Across all cell types, ITR1 and ITR6 had the lowest activity and were not statistically different than each other, except in HEK293 cells in which ITR1 was 10% lower than ITR6 (p&#x3c;0.0001) with a mean of 19% compared to 29% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>). ITR4 consistently had 62-66% luciferase activity compared to ITR2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E-<b>2</b>G</figref>) and was significantly lower than ITR3 as well in all three cell lines (p&#x3c;0.01). Thus, the observed activity from the ITRs fell into three classes: Class I ITRs with the highest relative activity: ITR2 and ITR3, Class II with an intermediate level of activity: ITR4, and Class III which had the lowest activity: ITR1 and ITR6. Of all the ITRs tested, only ITR7 showed cell-specific activity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B-<b>2</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0241" num="0239">The differing levels of luciferase activity from ITR sequences 1-4, 6 implied that the ITR sequence itself was a significant determinate of luciferase activity, but alternatively, the high luciferase activity from the ITR2-containing vectors could be due to a capsid-specific interaction since this ITR was paired with its cognate capsid. To test if ITR sequences packaged into their corresponding capsid influenced luciferase production, ITR1 and ITR2 luciferase vectors were packaged into AAV1 capsids and used to infect HEK293 cells at 2E5 vg/cell. While the overall activity was reduced compared to AAV1/2 and AAV2/2, luciferase activity from AAV1/1-ITR-luciferase vectors was still lower than AAV2/1 vectors. When normalized to AAV2, the activity was equivalent, regardless of the capsid used (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Hence, ITR1 is still a Class III ITR, even when paired with its cognate capsid.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0240">The ITR sequences contain multiple transcription start sites (TSS). The ITR sequences of all the genotypes tested are high in CG content (64-70%) and lack a traditional TATA-box consensuses sequence. To determine if the luciferase transcripts were originating from a single, focused TSS or multiple, dispersed TSSs, 5&#x2032; rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was employed to find the originating nucleotide position(s). HEK293 cells were infected with AAV(1-4, 6 or 7)/2-ITR-luciferase at 2E5 vg/cell. Three days post-infection, total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed using a 5&#x2032; Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) kit. Luciferase-specific cDNA was amplified and analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). For all ITRs, multiple TSSs were found within each sequence and tended to cluster at the RBE, although ITR1 had more widespread start sites than the other ITRs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). For each ITR, 3-4 nucleotides represented that majority of reads, but these hot spots were different for each ITR. These results indicate that the transcripts for ITR-promoted luciferase can originate from multiple start sites within the ITR.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0241">Cre-recombinase driven by ITRs sequences 1-6 is capable of activating luciferase production in vivo. To see how the in vitro findings translated to an in vivo model, the ITR promoter ability was tested in a floxed luciferase reporter mouse strain. The FVB.129S6(B6)-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1(Luc)Kael</sup>/J mouse line contains a luciferase open reading frame inserted into the ROSA26 locus. Luciferase expression is prevented by a loxP-stop-LoxP sequence which can be removed by cre recombinase. 4-6 week old male mice were injected with 100 ul of 1E9 vg of AAV(1-4, 6)/9-ITR-cre recombinase via the tail vein (N=2). AAV9 was chosen for its ability to highly transduce most tissues, thus likely the best to identify tissue-specific differences, if any, between the ITR promoters. As a positive control, two mice were injected with AAV2/9-CMV-Cre vectors. Mice were imaged at 3, 5, 7, and 9 weeks post-injection. By three weeks post-injection, luciferase activity could be observed in the abdominal area of all mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>). As expected, the positive control mice which had been injected with CMV promoted cre recombinase had more recombined cells expressing luciferase and under the same imaging setting these mice entirely saturated the camera. By four weeks post-injection, luciferase signal from one of the mice injected with AAV2/9-ITR-cre recombinase could no longer be detected. During the 9-week time course, luciferase signal remained steady in the remaining mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). The loss of expression from the mouse injected with AAV2/9-ITR-cre recombinase was likely due to capsid antigen reactive CD8+ T-cells, but this was not specifically investigated.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0242">ITR serotype sequence influences promoter activity in vitro. The ITR promoter activity for ITRs 1-4 and 6 was consistent enough that they could be broken into three Classes: I, II, and III, with I being the highest activity. Across each cell line, ITR2 and ITR3 (Class I) consistently had the highest values for luciferase activity, implying these sequences also have more promoter activity than the other ITRs tested, while ITR1 and ITR6 (Class III) had the lowest (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>G</figref>). The similar expression values for ITR1 and ITR6 would be expected given the high degree of similarity between the two sequences, which differ from each other only by the last nucleotide in the D-region and only 4 nucleotides outside of the D region (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>). A sequence analysis between Class I and Class III sequences revealed several points of variance that could explain the different activities (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>). Specifically, ITR2 and ITR3 contained a TTT sequence in the RBE&#x2032;, whereas ITR1 and ITR6 contain TCT. There was also a consistent difference in the B-loop (positions 45:59 and 46:60) and C-loop (68:80 and 70:78), and a C to G change in the tips of the nicking stem loops at positions 3 and 122. ITR7 is also similar to the ITR1 sequence, but had a different promoter activity profile (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B-<b>2</b>D</figref>). Since there are only a few nucleotides that differ between ITR1 and ITR7, a mutational analysis may be able to find the specific sequence(s) involved in the differential expression of ITR7-promoted luciferase in various cell types. The T:A pair in ITR7 at position 110:15 is the same pair seen at ITR3, 4, and 6 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>), so it is unlikely to be involved in the varying levels of luciferase activity we observed across the cell types tested. Like ITR2, 3 and 4, ITR7 also has a G near the nicking site at position 3 and a C at position 122, so these nucleotides may influence promoter strength. Another variable region of interest that could be influencing luciferase expression among the ITRs is the last 11 nucleotides of the D region where only a CTAG motif is conserved, but there is no readily discernable pattern between the different classes of ITRs. Still, this region could be of interest since several host proteins have been shown to interact with the D region of ITR2. The question of which sequences have effects on transgene production may be addressed with position specific ITR mutants, but given that complex DNA secondary structure may play diverse roles in transcription, this question may be difficult to unravel fully.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0243">Under the conditions used here, ITR1 was still a Class III, even when packaged into an AAV1 capsid. This argues against an ITR-capsid interaction as having a strong influence on promoter activity. In this study, an AAV2 Rep was used, so it may still be that having the cognate Rep for these ITR sequences could influence various aspects of replication, packaging, and transducing units of rAAV.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0244">Start sites for ITR-promoted luciferase transcripts. Previous work identified the A region of ITR2 as important for ITR2-promoted GFP transgene expression (Haberman et al. 2000 <i>J. Virol. </i>74:8732-8739). Here it was also found that the A region was hotspot for transcriptional activity, but by using NGS it was possible to identify multiple starts and transcription factor binding sites throughout the ITR sequences, primarily focused within a 40 base-pair region that included the RBE (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>). Lacking a traditional TATA-box within the defined ITR sequence, but enriched in cytosine and guanine, these sequences bear striking similarity to the transcriptionally active CpG islands (CGI) found in vertebrate genomes. It is now appreciated that CGIs are the most common promoter type in the vertebrate genome, occurring at 60-70% of annotated genes. CGIs are commonly defined as sequences with a C+G ratio of greater than 50% and an observed-to-expected CpG dinucleotides at 60% or higher. The AAV ITR sequences fit this definition both in C+G content and CpG frequency (Table 3). CGIs are often origins of replication and are generally associated with multiple TSSs dispersed over a 50-100 base-pair region. This is in contrast to promoters with a single, focused TSS that are more commonly associated with specifically positioned core promoter elements including the TATA-box, INR, TCT, and XCPE motifs. The data from this study supports a hypothesis that the ITR sequences from the AAV genotypes examined are functioning as CGI type promoters in the context of transgene promotion. That said, another interpretation of this data could be that these TSS are actually arising from distinct and variable episomal sequences. Since the resulting sequence that arises from the recombination of the two ITR ends after infection is variable, it may be that each episome has a different start site.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0245">ITR1-4, 6 are capable of promoting cre recombinase in a mouse model. The in vivo data demonstrates that ITRs 1-4, 6 were able to promote high enough levels of cre recombinase to induce recombination and luciferase production. In this strain of mice, all ITR sequences 1-4, 6 were active promoters and this may have important implications for gene therapy applications. These mice were injected with 1E11 vg which an approximate equivalent to 5E12 vg/kg and thus a clinically relevant dose. In the context of a strong ubiquitous promoter, these ITR sequences would likely have no effect on overall transgene production, but there are scenarios in which more targeted or sensitive applications could be affected, such as when using AAV delivered cre recombinase or CRISPR.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0246">More importantly, the bidirectional activity of the ITR2 promoter may be inducing the dsRNA response pathway. A prior study found that AAV transduction stimulated MDA5, a dsRNA response protein that recognizes dsRNA products over 2000 nucleotides long, at 8 days post-infection (Shao et al. 2018 <i>JCI insight </i>3(12):e120474). It was proposed that the promoter activity of the ITR when in an episome confirmation may be driving minus strand RNA production which could bind to positive strand RNA and accumulate in transduced cells. In this scenario, a promoter with less activity would be desirable to help blunt this arm of the innate immune response. Eliminating all the CpG islands in the ITR would necessitate changing the RBE sequence, which has 5 CpGs, such that Rep could no longer efficiently bind it. Other strategies such as adding insulating sequences that flank the ITRs to prevent transcription read through may be fruitful.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0247">The data presented here show that the ITRs sequences from AAV serotypes 1-4, 6 and 7 have inherent promoter activity and this promoter activity is not at equal strength amongst the ITRs. Specifically, ITR2 and ITR3 sequences resulted in higher luciferase expression across multiple cell types when compared to ITRs 1, 4, and 6. ITR7 was the only ITR to display cell-specific differences in luciferase expression. The TSS were mapped to multiple locations within each ITR sequence, of which the bulk originated from a 40 base-pair region that contained the RBE. In vivo, all the ITRs tested had the ability to promote cre recombinase at high enough levels to induce cre-mediated recombination by 3 weeks post-injection. These data may help inform vector design strategies when sensitive or cell-specific therapies are needed. Thus, this study shows for the first time that the ITR sequences for AAVs 1-4, 6, and 7 have varying ability to promote transgene expression in vitro and that these sequences contain multiple TSS. Additionally, a sensitive reporter mouse strain was utilized to demonstrate that at clinically relevant doses, the ITRs 1&#x2dc;4 &#x26; 6 have the ability to promote enough cre recombinase protein in vivo to have biological effects at the cellular level.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0248">The foregoing is illustrative of the present invention, and is not to be construed as limiting thereof.</p><p
