In 1982, Seeman proposed to use DNA as building materials to assemble geometric objects with nanoscale features. This revolutionary idea laid foundation for a new research field, which is now called &#x201c;structured DNA nanotechnology&#x201d;. A rigid branched DNA pattern was developed based on complementary Watson-Crick base pairs between fragments of a given oligonucleotide group by using self-identification characteristics of DNA. In 2006, Rothemund introduced scaffold-based DNA origami technologies, which makes an extraordinary breakthrough in construction of nano-scale DNA objects.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Invention of DNA origami technology is a milestone of DNA nanotechnology, in which long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is folded into a specified shape with assistance of hundreds of short DNA strands. Therefore, the DNA origami technology provides ability to generate nano-objects with complex shapes and complete molecular addressability in a predefined size, which makes DNA origami an important tool for constructing DNA-based nanostructures.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An emulsion is a mixture of two or more liquids, which are usually immiscible due to liquid-liquid phase separation. In the emulsion, one liquid (a dispersed phase) is dispersed in another liquid (continuous phase). Two liquids can form different types of emulsions. For example, oil and water can firstly form an oil-in-water emulsion, where oil is the dispersed phase and water is the continuous phase. Secondly, they can form water-in-oil emulsion, in which water is the dispersed phase and oil is the continuous phase. A variety of emulsions are also possible, including &#x201c;water-in-oil-in-water&#x201d; (W/O/W) and &#x201c;oil-in-water-in-oil&#x201d; (O/W/O) emulsions. The emulsion is widely used in fields of food, cosmetics and medicines for its excellent loading capacity.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A double emulsion has attracted much attention because it can be embedded with both water-phase substances and oil-phase substances. The double emulsion refers to a complex liquid dispersion system of &#x201c;emulsion being dispersed in emulsion&#x201d;, in which droplets of a dispersed phase itself contain smaller dispersed droplets, for example, W/O/W and O/W/O emulsions. Because of its internal partition structure, the double emulsion has more advantages than a common emulsion in controlled release, active substance protection and catalysis. Although it has some advantages over a common single emulsion, a stable double emulsion is usually not formed by single emulsifiers and it is necessary to use hydrophilic and hydrophobic emulsifiers to prepare the double emulsion. For example, in preparing a W/O/W emulsion, firstly, a hydrophobic emulsifier (with hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value of 3-8) is used to prepare a primary W/O emulsion, and then the prepared emulsion is further dispersed in an external water phase containing a hydrophilic emulsifier (HLB=9-10) to form a W/O/W double emulsion. Due to a fact that curvatures of two types of interfaces in the double emulsion are opposite and it is difficult for a single emulsifier to stabilize the two types of interfaces at the same time, it is extremely difficult to stabilize the double emulsion with one emulsifier.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Arbutin and coumaric acid both are phenolic substances, and both have anti-melanin effect, so they have whitening effect. However, arbutin is a hydrophilic substance while coumaric acid is a hydrophobic substance, and their simultaneous application is challenging. In addition, in order to ensure optimal efficacy of arbutin and coumaric acid, it is necessary to maintain their concentration, and thus it is necessary to achieve simultaneous delivery and controlled release of arbutin and coumaric acid.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the disclosure is to provide a single emulsifier based on a novel DNA triangular origami technology.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of the present disclosure is to provide a preparation method of a double emulsion stabilized with the single emulsifier, which realizes stabilization of the double emulsion by using single component DNA triangular origami as an emulsifier, which can deliver arbutin and coumaric acid at the same time and realize controlled release to ensure that arbutin and coumaric acid provide optimal whitening effect.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A third object of the present disclosure is to provide application of the double emulsion based on DNA origami technology as a phenolic delivery system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to achieve the above object, the disclosure adopts following technical schemes.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an aspect of the disclosure, a single emulsifier based on DNA triangular origami technology is provided.
