The electronic devices <b>101</b> may respectively establish a connection with the server <b>102</b> and perform information exchange through a network protocol such as Hyper Text Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer (HTTPS). Wherein, the electronic device can be a device with communication function, such as a mobile phone, a tablet, a desktop computer, a notebook, a vehicle-mounted terminal, a wearable device, an all-in-one machine, a smart home appliance, and the like. The server <b>102</b> may be a device with storage and computing functions, such as a cloud server or a server cluster.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Based on the foregoing architecture, users who use the electronic device <b>101</b> can communicate in real time through a designated network platform installed on the electronic device <b>101</b>.

In the embodiment shown in the present disclosure, during the user's real-time call, when the electronic device <b>101</b> detects that a video sharing event is triggered, the electronic device <b>101</b> can replace the call interface with a sharing interface, and display a shared video in the sharing interface. Therefore, each user of the real-time call can simultaneously watch the shared video displayed on the sharing interface, so as to realize the sharing of the shared video among individual users of the real-time call, thereby improving the user's experience of real-time call and video sharing.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, when the electronic device <b>101</b> detects a first trigger operation of a first user on a call interface for triggering video sharing, the electronic device <b>101</b> can determine that it is detected that the video sharing event is triggered.

That is, after an electronic device of the first user is switched to the target sharing interface, the shared first video can be displayed while keeping the real-time call with the second user through the target sharing interface.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the electronic device of the first user can detect a video sharing event in real time during the process of displaying the target call interface, and when it detects that the video sharing event is triggered, it can switch the target call interface currently displayed to a target sharing interface, and display a first video for sharing between the first user and at least one second user in the target sharing interface, and keep the ongoing real-time call through the target sharing interface.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Accordingly, while the electronic device of the first user is switched to be displayed as the target sharing interface, an electronic device of the second user who is in a real-time call with the first user can also switch the call interface currently displayed to a shared interface, and display the first video on the shared interface. The sharing interface has the same functions and displayed the same video as the above-mentioned target sharing interface, and other information may differ depending on users.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this embodiment, a video screen synchronized with the electronic device of the second user is displayed in the target sharing interface. That is, the video screen of the first video displayed in the target sharing interface can be displayed on the electronic device of the second user synchronously, which improves the experience of the first user and the second user watching the video synchronously.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As such, by introducing the function of watching videos together during a real-time call between multiple users, the shared video can be watched simultaneously, which enriches the user experience during the call, and increases interaction time and depth of interaction between different users.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, the target sharing interface may also be used to display call controls, and the call controls may include a call window for the first user and a call window for the second user.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Wherein, the call control can be a functional control used to characterize the real-time call process. The display parameters of the call control in the target sharing interface can be set according to actual conditions, and the display parameters can include display position and display size. The call control can include the call windows for the first user and at least one second user who are in a real-time call. Each call window corresponding to one user.
