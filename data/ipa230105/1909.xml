The disclosure also relates to a pneumatic valve arrangement and a pneumatic braking system for a vehicle, in particular for a trailer vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Here, fluid valves are understood to be valves for all flowing media, in particular pneumatic valves, preferably for use in pneumatic braking systems. Pneumatic braking systems in trailer vehicles with park release valves can perform various safety functions. For example, what is referred to as a park/save function can be provided, which is intended to avoid a dangerous situation in conjunction with incorrect operation. When a trailer vehicle is being coupled to a tractor vehicle, the park release valve should be in the parking position. However, even if the park release valve is in its driving position, the as yet uncoupled trailer vehicle is braked since existing spring-loaded brakes are then vented and active. If, in this situation with the park release valve in the driving position, the supply pressure line of the trailer vehicle is now first of all connected to the tractor vehicle by mistake, the spring-loaded brakes are supplied with air and released if the braking system of the trailer vehicle does not have a park/save function. The trailer vehicle can move, even though this is not desired at this time and there is a risk for operators. The park/save function, in contrast, has the effect that the spring-loaded brakes are not yet supplied with air and released under these conditions. On the contrary, the service brake must be actuated at least once. The brake pressure introduced in this case acts as a control pressure for canceling the park/save function. The park/save function and a possible design solution are illustrated in DE 10 2016 005 625 A1, in particular in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> to <b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The park/save function can be integrated into a &#x201c;park release&#x201d; valve or can be a component of a valve arrangement via which a park release function is realized. In this regard, FIG. 7 of DE 10 2016 005 625 A1 shows a pneumatic circuit diagram, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> to <b>11</b></figref> show a highly integrated park release valve matching the pneumatic circuit diagram. The park/save function is obtained from the interaction of a control slide <b>105</b> with a blocking slide <b>104</b> and associated seals and flow channels.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A simpler construction of the individual components is possible by lower integration. The park release valve can be configured as a simple slide valve, while the park/save function can be implemented by a valve provided specifically for this purpose.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the present disclosure to provide a fluid valve which is suitable as a parking safety valve or for implementing the park/save function. In particular, the fluid valve should be as reliable, smooth-running and maintenance-free as possible.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object can, for example, be achieved via a fluid valve having a pressure inlet and a pressure outlet. The fluid valve is provided with a lip seal having a sealing lip between the pressure inlet and the pressure outlet, wherein a position of the sealing lip can be varied to vary a passage cross section. According to the disclosure, the sealing lip can assume different positions, thus enabling a passage cross section between the pressure inlet and the pressure outlet to be set. It is preferable if the sealing lip is not moved as a whole. On the contrary, only part of the sealing lip is angled or bent relative to the lip seal. To achieve this, the sealing lip can be produced from a correspondingly elastic material, as can the lip seal as a whole.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The fluid valve is provided, in particular, for pneumatic braking systems in trailer vehicles but can also be used for other applications in connection with flowing media. In contrast to conventional slide valves or seat valves, the frictional forces in the illustrated fluid valve with a switchable lip seal are relatively low.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a further concept of the disclosure, provision is made for the sealing lip to rest against a sealing surface in a blocking position and to be at a distance from the sealing surface in a passage position. The passage cross section is defined by the distance and the given geometric conditions.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a further concept of the disclosure, provision can be made for the sealing lip to have an internal stress which acts on the sealing lip to reduce the passage cross section. This means that, without being influenced by other components, the sealing lip tends to assume the position with the smallest passage cross section. In particular, the sealing lip then rests against a sealing surface. It is advantageous if the sealing lip extends at an acute angle to the sealing surface and is arranged in a self-retaining manner, that is, when there is a higher pressure at the pressure inlet than at the pressure outlet, the sealing lip is pressed against the sealing surface by the pressure difference and thus holds the abovementioned blocking position.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a further concept of the disclosure, provision can be made for the position of the sealing lip to be variable by pressure of a switching element. Via the switching element, the passage cross section is varied indirectly. Here, the pressure of the switching element preferably acts against the internal stress of the sealing lip. The switching element is used to vary the position of the sealing lip and can itself be controlled, for example, by a fluid.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">By moving the switching element, it is possible to exert the pressure of the switching element and to switch the sealing lip, thus making it possible optionally to open and close the connection from the pressure inlet to the pressure outlet, or merely to vary the passage cross section. By varying the passage cross section, the sealing lip can thus be switched in a continuously variable manner. Actuation of the sealing lip by the switching element can take place directly or indirectly. For example, an additional component can be provided between the switching element and the sealing lip. The switching element then acts only indirectly on the sealing lip.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a further concept of the disclosure, provision can be made for the sealing lip to be supported on the switching element in a blocking position. In the blocking position, the sealing lip then rests, on the one hand, against the sealing surface and, on the other hand, is supported by the switching element, preferably by an edge or collar of the switching element.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a further concept of the disclosure, the switching element can rest against the sealing lip, wherein the sealing lip can be acted upon by the switching element to enlarge the passage cross section. In particular, the switching element acts on the sealing lip to a greater extent in a passage position than in the blocking position.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a further concept of the disclosure, the lip seal can have a lip holder, on which the sealing lip is held. An angle of the sealing lip relative to the lip holder can be variable by mechanical pressure of the switching element. The change in the angle can also be obtained by deformation of the sealing lip.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a further concept of the disclosure, the switching element can be of mushroom-shaped configuration with a stem and a cap. The lip holder can be of cup-shaped configuration with a cup opening and a bottom, wherein the bottom has a bottom opening. The stem can extend into the cup opening as far as the bottom opening. The cap can then rest against the lip seal in the passage position. The lip seal or the cap can be provided with a sealing bead. In this way, the cap seals the cup opening in the passage position of the lip seal.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a further concept of the disclosure, the cap can have a circumferential collar which is inclined toward the bottom of the lip holder, wherein the sealing lip extends circumferentially outward from an edge adjacent to the cup opening, and wherein the sealing lip is acted upon by the collar of the cap in the passage position. The collar preferably acts on the sealing lip during the entire actuation of the sealing lip, in particular also in the blocking position.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a further concept of the disclosure, the switching element can be acted upon by a return spring in the direction of relief of the sealing lip. The return spring acts against the switching element and must be additionally overcome by pressure at the control port or pressure outlet, as must the internal stress of the sealing lip.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The fluid valve can have a housing.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a further concept of the disclosure, provision can be made for the switching element to be movable in the housing counter to the action of the return spring, and for a widened portion of the switching element to rest against a shoulder of the housing with a minimized passage cross section as a result of the action of the return spring. The return spring, the widened portion and the shoulder define an end position of the switching element movable in the housing of the fluid valve.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a further concept of the disclosure, the lip holder can be arranged in a fixed manner in the housing. Like the sealing lip, the lip holder is then part of the lip seal. The lip holder is provided in a fixed manner, while the sealing lip is movable or flexible. When the passage cross section is varied, the sealing lip changes its shape, its position and/or its angle relative to the lip holder.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a further concept of the disclosure, the housing can have a cylindrical interior space. The switching element can be movable in the axial direction in the interior space. In addition, the lip seal can be held in the interior space. The switching element and the lip seal are preferably matched to the cylindrical shape of the interior space.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a further concept of the disclosure, when the passage cross section is closed, the sealing lip can divide the interior space into an outlet volume, which is connected to the pressure outlet, and an inlet volume, which is connected to the pressure inlet. When the passage cross section is not closed, the outlet volume and the inlet volume are connected to one another via the passage cross section.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to a further concept of the disclosure, a relief volume connected to a relief outlet can be formed between the lip seal and the switching element, wherein the relief volume and the outlet volume are connected to one another via a flow channel in the switching element, at least in a blocking position of the sealing lip. As a result, in the blocking position, a defined pressure is present in the outlet volume, namely as in the relief volume, which is connected to the relief outlet. The pressure at the relief outlet typically corresponds to an ambient pressure of the fluid valve.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to a further concept of the disclosure, a connection from the relief volume to the flow channel can be closed by a seal between the lip seal and the switching element in the passage position of the sealing lip. The seal separates the relief volume from the flow channel and the outlet volume connected thereto. In this way, the flow channel is securely closed in the passage position.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to a further concept of the disclosure, a control piston, which can be moved between an initial position and an actuating position, can be present in a housing of the fluid valve, can be moved out of its initial position by pressure at a control port and, in the actuating position, acts on a switching element to actuate the sealing lip. With the movement of the control piston into the actuating position, the sealing lip moves into the passage position. According to a further concept of the disclosure, the control piston can separate a control volume, which is connected to the control port, from an outlet volume, which is connected to the pressure outlet. For this purpose, the control piston is preferably provided with a circumferential seal. The control piston can be moved to reduce the outlet volume by rising pressure in the control volume.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a further concept of the disclosure, at least two switching positions can be provided, namely the blocking position and the passage position. Furthermore, at least four ports can be provided, namely the pressure inlet, the pressure outlet, a relief outlet and a control port. Furthermore, a switching element can be movable in the housing. The movable switching element can be provided for the purpose of selectively opening or closing the passage cross section from the pressure inlet to the pressure outlet depending on the pressure at the pressure outlet and at the control port. The switching element can have a holding function, the holding function being configured such that the passage cross section is open when the pressure at the control port is above a first limit value, and remains open even when the pressure at the control port falls below the first limit value again but, at the same time, there is a pressure above a second limit value at the pressure outlet. As a result of the holding function provided, special functions can be performed with the fluid valve, for example as a parking safety valve in a pneumatic braking system. The limit values mentioned are preferably between 1 and 3.5 bar, in particular between 2 and 3 bar. The first and second limit values may be identical, but may also differ.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A pneumatic valve arrangement having a park release valve can have a fluid valve as described herein. In this case, the fluid valve preferably has the function of a parking safety valve. The valve arrangement is preferably provided for a braking system of a vehicle, in particular for a braking system of a trailer vehicle.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to a further concept of the disclosure, the pressure inlet of the fluid valve can be connected to a supply port, which is at supply pressure, of the valve arrangement, wherein the pressure outlet of the fluid valve is connected to a port of the park release valve, and a control port of the fluid valve is connected to a control port of the valve arrangement. The control port of the valve arrangement can preferably be acted upon by brake pressure from the pneumatic braking system. In a trailer vehicle, the supply port of the valve arrangement receives the supply pressure from a &#x201c;supply&#x201d; coupling head, while the brake pressure is fed in via a &#x201c;brake&#x201d; coupling head.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The disclosure also relates to a pneumatic braking system for a trailer vehicle, having a fluid valve as disclosed herein or having a valve arrangement as disclosed herein.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The invention will now be described with reference to the drawings wherein:</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an axial section through a fluid valve in a first switching position, namely in a blocking position;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an axial section corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in a second switching position, namely in a passage position;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an axial section corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in a third switching position, namely in a self-holding passage position;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a pneumatic circuit diagram of a valve arrangement having a park release valve, a parking safety valve, a switchable check valve and an emergency brake valve;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a pneumatic circuit diagram, modified as compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, with the valve arrangement in the same first switching position;</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a pneumatic circuit diagram corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> with the valve arrangement in a second switching position;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a pneumatic circuit diagram corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> with the valve arrangement in a third switching position;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an axial section through a parking safety valve in the first switching position according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows an axial section corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> with the parking safety valve in the second switching position according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>; and,</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows an axial section corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> with the parking safety valve in the third switching position according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A fluid valve F illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref> is preferably a 3/2-way valve, can be provided for hydraulic or pneumatic or mixed applications and has at least two switching positions and at least three ports for inlets and outlets.
