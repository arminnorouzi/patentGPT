The power source is configured to supply a power signal to one or more of the electrodes for electrically effecting an object or anatomical feature with the electrodes.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">During a medical procedure, ancillary instruments, such as a light source and/or smoke evacuator, may be used to illuminate a surgical site and/or remove smoke from the surgical site, respectively. These ancillary instruments are typically powered by power sources that are different from the power source that is configured to supply the power signal to the medical instrument and the electrodes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to energizing the electrodes, it may be desirable to utilize a power signal from the medical instrument power source for other purposes, such as powering ancillary instruments, such as a light source or smoke evacuator. It may also be desirable to combine an electrosurgical medical instrument with one or more ancillary instruments, and power the one or more ancillary instruments with the same power source that is used to power the medical instrument.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These teachings provide an electrosurgical assembly comprising a medical instrument and an ancillary instrument, which may be referred to herein as a functional element, a DC powered functional element or DC load, an AC powered functional element or DC load, or a combination thereof.

According to these teachings, a rectifier is electrically connected to both the power source and the functional element, and the rectifier is configured to convert the AC power signal from the power source into a DC power signal to power the functional element. Advantageously, by combining the medical instrument and the ancillary instrument, the surgical site is decluttered. Moreover, a clinician performing a medical procedure can operate the medical instrument and ancillary instrument with one hand and without relying on another clinician to operate either the medical instrument or the ancillary instrument. Furthermore, operating and instrument costs may be reduced by powering one or more ancillary medical instrument with the same power source configured to power a medical instrument.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">These teachings provide an electrosurgical assembly.

The anatomical feature may be any anatomical feature, such as a vessel, tissue, vein, growth, tumor, artery, etc.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The medical instrument can be used in virtually any procedure, whether medically related or not. In medical procedures, the medical instrument can be used in open procedures, laparoscopic procedures, or both.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The medical instrument may be an electrosurgical instrument. The medical instrument may be forceps. The medical instrument may be electrosurgical forceps. The medical instrument may be a pencil or spatula. The medical instrument may be an electrosurgical pencil spatula. The medical instrument may be a debrider or shaver.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The medical instrument is electrically connected to one or more power sources. The power source may be of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,282,048B2, the teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The power source may be configured to generate and output or supply an AC power signal to the medical instrument, the one or more electrodes, the rectifier, the functional element, or a combination thereof via one or more conductors or wires (e.g., AC conductors). The one or more AC conductors may be configured to electrically connect the one or more electrodes to a power source so that power from the power source can be transmitted to the one or more electrodes via the one or more AC conductors. The AC power signal from the power source may be an RF output or power signal.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The AC power signal may be provided or passed to the one or more electrodes to activate the electrodes for electrically effecting an object or anatomical feature. For example, the AC power signal provided by the power source to the one or more electrodes may be monopolar energy, bipolar energy, blended energy, or a combination thereof. The AC power signal may include a cut waveform, a coagulation waveform, and/or a blended waveform. During use, an electrical circuit may be completed by passing monopolar energy from the power source to one or more electrodes, to the object or anatomical feature of interest, and to a remote pad or electrode. During use, an electrical circuit may be completed by passing bipolar energy from the power source to an active electrode(s) on the medical instrument, through the object or anatomical feature of interest, and to a return sealing member(s) on the medical instrument.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The medical instrument comprises a hand piece. The hand piece may function to be held by a user. The hand piece may include one or more user controls for operating, actuating, moving, reciprocating, opening, closing, retracting, extending, rotating, turning ON, turning OFF, and/or manipulating the medical instrument, the effector, one or more of the jaws, the jaw assembly, one or more of the electrodes, a cut blade, the functional element, or a combination thereof.

The one or more user controls may be adapted to send, transmit, provide, increase, or decrease the DC power signal from the rectifier to the functional element. The one or more user controls may comprise one or more buttons, levers, triggers, knobs, wheels, or a combination thereof. A user control may also be a foot pedal or other button, lever, trigger, knob, wheel, or a combination thereof that is not part of the immediate hand piece.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The medical instrument, the hand piece, the effector, or a combination thereof may comprise one or more electrical terminals, or two or more electrical terminals. The one or more or two or more electrical terminals that are on the medical instrument, the hand piece, the effector, or a combination may be electrically connected (e.g., a power signal can be communicated to) the rectifier.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The functional element or housing of the functional element may comprise one or more electrical terminals, or two or more electrical terminals that correspond to the electrical terminals on the hand piece. The one or more or two or more electrical terminals that are on the functional element may be electrically connected (e.g., a power signal can be communicated to) the light source, smoke ionizer, etc.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The corresponding electrical terminals may be brought together and may function to electrically connect the hand piece and/or the power source and the functional element. The electrically connected electrical terminals may function to transmit AC power signals and/or DC power signals between the hand piece or power supply and the functional element or the DC load, or the AC load, between the hand piece and the rectifier, or a combination thereof. The electrical terminals may connect with corresponding electrical terminals via a snap fit so that the functional element snaps into the hand piece so that the functional element is retained with the hand piece. Each of the electrical terminals may be in electrical communication with a corresponding AC conductor, DC conductor, or both described herein.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The medical instrument comprises an end effector. The end effector may be configured to perform one or more effecting functions on an anatomical feature. For example, the one or more effecting functions may include: capturing an object or anatomical feature; grasping an object or anatomical feature; providing a clamping force to secure an object or anatomical feature; providing retraction of an object or anatomical feature; providing a compression force across an object or anatomical feature; or a combination thereof. The effector may be used in electrosurgery to perform one or more electrically effecting functions, such as cutting, coagulating, cauterizing, dissecting, and/or fulgurating the object anatomical feature. The end effector may extend from a distal end of the hand piece, and may be manipulated with one or more of the user controls.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The medical instrument or the end effector may comprise a jaw assembly. The jaw assembly may be configured to perform one or more effecting functions discussed above.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The jaw assembly may comprise one or more jaws. One or more of the jaws may be moved relative to one another to move the jaw assembly into a closed configuration and an open configuration by manipulating one or more of the user controls. One or more both the jaws may be, or may comprise, one or more electrodes that are electrically connected to the power source via one or more conductors so that the one or more jaws or the jaw assembly can be used to electrically effect an object or anatomical feature by passing an electrical therapy current to or through the anatomical feature during a medical procedure.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The instrument or end effector may comprise a cut blade. The cut blade may function to cut an object or anatomical feature. The cut blade may be a cutting blade or a scalpel. The cut blade may be or may be connected with an electrode that is electrically connected to the power source via the one or more conductors so that the cut blade can be used to electrically effect an anatomical feature by passing an electrical therapy current to or through the anatomical feature during a medical procedure.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The cut blade may be moved or reciprocated or extended or retracted within the jaw assembly or a blade slot provided therein by moving or manipulating one or more of the user controls. The cut blade can be moved or extended to cut an anatomical feature captured between the jaw assembly when the jaw assembly is in a closed or clamping configuration. The cut blade may cut an anatomical feature after the anatomical feature is clamped and/or coagulated or sealed between the jaws of the jaw assembly.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The end effector, the jaw assembly, or both may comprise one or more electrodes. Each jaw of the jaw assembly may comprise one or more electrodes. The cut blade may comprise one or more electrodes. Each of the electrodes may be in electrical communication with the power source via one or more discrete, corresponding AC conductors or wires so that one or more AC power signal can be provided between the power source and the electrodes. By supplying the one or more electrodes with an AC power signal, the one or more electrodes can be used to electrically effect an anatomical feature during an electrosurgical procedure by cutting, coagulating, cauterizing, dissecting, and/or fulgurating the anatomical feature.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The electrosurgical assembly, the medical instrument, or both comprises one or more functional elements.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The functional element may be an element that is powered by the same power source that is configured to power the medical instrument. The functional element may be an AC load or a DC load that is a target electrical component or powered element that is powered by the power source to produce some function (e.g., a light that turns ON or flashes; a smoke ionizer that gathers, reduces, and/or eliminates smoke particles, etc.). An AC load is a functional element or power element that is powered directly by AC power from the AC power source. A DC load is a functional element or power element that is also powered by AC power from the power source, but the AC power is converted into DC power to power the DC load.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The functional element may be, or may comprise one or more powered elements. A powered element may be one or more lights or a light source, which may be one or more illumination lights, indicator lights, spot lights, LED lights, incandescent lights, halogen lights, fluorescent lights, or a combination thereof that are powered by a DC power signal, a signal from the rectifier, or both. An LED, being a diode, may advantageously provide additional smoothing beyond what the rectifier with the optional filter capacitor can provide, for incrementally improvement of the uniformity of light output. The one or more lights may function to illuminate a surgical site and/or feature of interest.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A powered element may be smoke ionizer or evacuator. The smoke ionizer or evacuator may comprise the teachings disclosed in Applicant's International Application No. PCT/US2016/53717 filed on Sep. 26, 2016, which claims the benefit of U.S. Ser. No. 14/865,420 filed on Sep. 25, 2015, both of which are entirely incorporated by reference herein and form part of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The functional element may removably attached to the medical instrument, the hand piece, the effector, or a combination thereof. Removably attached means that the functional element or the housing can be separated or removed from the medical instrument, the hand piece, the end effector, or a combination thereof without damaging the medical instrument, the hand piece, the effector, the functional element, the housing, or a combination thereof. A removably attached functional element may be advantageous in order to provide a medical instrument that can be individually customized with various functional elements. For example, a removable smoke ionizer or evacuator can be attached to the medical instrument, and then, the smoke ionizer or evacuator can be detached or separated from the medical instrument, and a removable light can be attached to the medical instrument. The medical instrument may also have capability to have two or more functional elements attached to the medical instrument; for example, both a smoke ionizer and a light.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The functional element may be removably connected to the hand piece by way of one or more, or preferably two or more electrical terminals. In addition to connecting the hand piece and the removable component, the electrical terminals may function to send, transmit, or communicate one or more AC power signals, DC power signals, or both between the medical instrument and the functional element.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The functional element may, however, be configured to be permanently attached, or integrally attached to the medical instrument, the hand piece, the end effector, or a combination thereof. Permanently attached means that the functional element or the housing thereof cannot be, or is not intended to be, separated or removed from the medical instrument, the hand piece, the effector, or a combination thereof without damaging the medical instrument, the hand piece, the effector, the functional element, the housing or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The functional element or the powered element of the functional element may be powered by a DC power signal or an AC power signal. The DC power signal may be supplied by the power source that powers the medical instrument, the electrodes, or both. The DC power signal may be a converted AC power signal from the same power source that is configured to power the medical instrument, the effector, the one or more electrodes, or a combination thereof. The AC power signal may be converted into a DC power signal by one or more rectifiers.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The medical instrument or the functional element may comprise one or more rectifiers. The rectifier may function to convert an AC power signal into a DC power signal. The rectifier may function to convert an AC power signal into a DC power signal; the AC signal may be generated or provided by the power source that is configured to supply a therapy current or power to the one or more electrodes of the medical instrument. The rectifier may convert the AC power signal into a DC power signal by rectifying the AC power signal, and then filtering the power signal. The rectified signal may then be regulated to maintain a constant voltage or current. The rectifier may function to convert or transform an AC power signal from the power source into a DC power signal to turn ON and/or operate the one or more functional elements.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The rectifier may be in electrical communication with one or more AC conductors that are configured to communicate AC power or RF power from the power source to the one or more electrodes. At least some of the AC or RF power intended to be communicated to the one or more electrodes is thus communicated to the rectifier for converting into a DC power signal to power the one or more functional elements. Thus, the rectifier may &#x201c;piggy back&#x201d; and/or may be &#x201c;parasitically attached&#x201d; to the medical instrument and draw some power from the medical instrument to power the DC powered element.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The DC power signal from the rectifier may be communicated, transmitted or otherwise sent from the rectifier, one or more filter capacitors, or other powered elements of the functional element via one or more conductors or wires (e.g., DC conductors). The one or more DC conductors may be configured to electrically connect the functional element to the rectifier so that power from the rectifier can be transmitted to the removable component via the one or more DC conductors.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The rectifier may be any device or circuit that is configured to convert the AC power signal to the DC power signal for powering the functional element. For example, the rectifier may be a half-wave rectifier or a full-wave rectifier. For example, the full-wave rectifier may be a center-tapped design that uses a transformer with a center-tapped secondary winding and two diodes. For example, the full-wave rectifier may be a full-wave bridge that comprises a plurality of diodes.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The rectifier may comprise one or more Zener diodes, one or more series resistors, or both for voltage regulation after rectification. A Zener diode is a diode that will allow reverse current once a threshold voltage has been surpassed.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The rectifier may be part of, included within, located inside, and/or attached to the medical instrument, the hand piece, the end effector, the functional element, the housing, the power source, or a combination hereof.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The medical instrument, the rectifier, the functional element, the housing, or a combination thereof may comprise one or more electrical connections. An electrical connection may be a point or location on a circuit, an electrical feature or element, or a combination thereof where two or more conductors are electrically connected, coupled or joined. An electrical connection may be a point or location on a circuit, an electrical feature or element, or a combination thereof where the rectifier is connected to the power source, one or more conductors or wires in electrical communication with the power source, or both. An electrical connection may be a point or location on a circuit, an electrical feature or element, or a combination thereof where the functional element is connected to the effector, hand piece, or both. An electrical connection may be a location where two or more conductors are hard-wired together. An electrical connection may comprise a capacitor. An electrical connection may comprise an inductor.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The medical instrument, the rectifier, the functional element, the electrical connection, or a combination thereof may comprise one or more capacitors. The one or more capacitors function to store an electric charge, which may be an AC power signal from the power source. The one or more capacitors may function to create a point of electrical attachment or contact between the rectifier and the power source. That is, one or more conductors may extend from the rectifier to a capacitor, and one or more other conductors may extend from capacitor to the power source.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The one or more capacitors may be smoothing capacitors that function to smooth or even out fluctuations in the AC power signal or the DC power signal. That is, one or more smoothing capacitors may be provided downstream of the power source but upstream of the rectifier to smooth or even out fluctuations in the AC power signal. Additionally, or alternatively, one or more smoothing capacitors may be provided downstream of the rectifier but upstream of the functional element to smooth or even out fluctuations in the DC power signal.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The one or more capacitors may be provided between the AC conductors and/or the DC conductors for EMI filtering to suppress conducted interference that may be present on the corresponding AC conductors or DC conductors.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">One or more capacitors may be provided downstream or after the rectifier for filtering of the DC power signal that leaves the rectifier, or to act as a buffer. One or more capacitors may be provided downstream or after the rectifier, but before or upstream of the functional element to stabilize the rectified voltage level from the rectifier by reducing voltage ripple.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The medical instrument, the rectifier, the functional element, the electrical connection, or a combination thereof may comprise one or more inductors. An inductor is an electrical component that stores electrical energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it. The one or more inductors may function to create a point of electrical attachment or contact between the rectifier and the power source. That is, one or more conductors may extend from the rectifier to an inductor, and one or more other conductors may extend from inductor to the power source. The inductor may function to smooth or reduce ripple after rectification (i.e., after the AC power signal is converted into a DC power signal) for changing load currents.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate an electrosurgical assembly <b>100</b>.
