As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, the packaging structure comprises an annular rear casing <b>1</b> and a soft rubber member <b>2</b>. The soft rubber member <b>2</b> is disposed between the rear casing <b>1</b> and two lenses of the head mounted terminal to realize the sealing between the rear casing <b>1</b> and the lens. The rear casing <b>1</b> is used to support the rear part of the head mounted terminal. The two lenses of the head mounted terminal are disposed in the inner ring of the rear casing <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The outer edge of the soft rubber member <b>2</b> is fixed on the inner ring of the rear casing <b>1</b>. The soft rubber member <b>2</b> comprises two lens barrels <b>3</b> arranged symmetrically. The two lens barrels <b>3</b> are respectively sleeved on the two lenses of the head mounted terminal, and can move with the movement of the lens.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The soft rubber member <b>2</b> further comprises an extending and folding part <b>4</b> disposed on an outer periphery of the lens barrel <b>3</b>, which is used to realize the extension of the lens barrel <b>3</b> with the left and right movement of the lens. For example, when the driving device in the head mounted terminal drives a lens to move towards the right for pupil spacing adjustment, the extending and folding part <b>4</b> on the right side retracts while the extending and folding part <b>4</b> on the left side extends.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In sum, in the packaging structure of the present embodiment, the soft rubber member <b>2</b> is provided between the rear casing <b>1</b> of the head mounted terminal and the two lenses of the head mounted terminal, and the extending and folding part <b>4</b> on the soft rubber member <b>2</b> can extend with the left and right movement of the lens, so the spacing between the two lenses can be adjusted without setting a gap between the rear casing <b>1</b> and the lens, the dust-proof performance is better, the packaging structure is simple and beautiful, and the manufacturing cost is low.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the soft rubber member <b>2</b> further comprises arc-shaped corrugated part <b>5</b> disposed between two lens barrels <b>3</b> to make the soft rubber member <b>2</b> closely fit the user's nose bridge. The upper part of the arc-shaped corrugated part <b>5</b> is strip-shaped, and the lower part of the arc-shaped corrugated part <b>5</b> is fan-shaped, so that the arc-shaped corrugated part <b>5</b> can fit with different nose shapes. When the user wears the head mounted terminal, since the arc-shaped corrugated part <b>5</b> fit with the user's nose bridge, there is no need to provide other soft materials between the rear casing <b>1</b> of the head mounted terminal and the user's nose bridge for protection and shielding.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Preferably, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the lens barrel <b>3</b> is provided with a flange <b>6</b>, and the flange <b>6</b> engages with a groove on the outer circumference of the lens to realize the connection between the lens barrel <b>3</b> and the lens.
