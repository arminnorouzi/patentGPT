In the VRR mode, the frame rate of a display panel usually changes at any time and is affected by the image scene. The VRR mode may eliminate the phenomenon of intermittent delay and screen tearing, so as to generate smoother images. In addition, the response speed of liquid crystal of a liquid-crystal display (LCD) panel is too slow, which causes motion blur. Demotion blur is a technology developed for the motion blur of the display panel. Currently, the conventional backlight panel driving method cannot satisfy VRR and demotion blur at the same time. How to perform dimming on multiple backlight zones of the backlight panel to adapt to the VRR mode of the display panel and to have the demotion blur function is one of the many technical issues in the field of backlight technology.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The disclosure provides a backlight driving device and an operating method thereof to drive multiple backlight zones of a backlight panel to provide backlight to different display regions of a display panel.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the backlight driving device includes an interface circuit and a driving circuit. The interface circuit is adapted for receiving first main backlight data corresponding to a first backlight zone among the backlight zones from a former stage device. The driving circuit is adapted for driving the first backlight zone among the backlight zones according to a first main current level in a display refresh period of a first backlight frame period with respect to the first backlight zone, not driving the first backlight zone in a demotion blur period of the first backlight frame period which is prior to the display refresh period, and driving the first backlight zone according to a first compensation current level in a vertical blanking period of the first backlight frame period which succeeds the display refresh period of the first backlight frame period. The driving circuit determines the first main current level according to the first main backlight data, and the first compensation current level is lower than the first main current level.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the operating method includes the following steps. First main backlight data corresponding to a first backlight zone among the backlight zones is received from a former stage device by an interface circuit of a backlight driving device. The first backlight zone among the backlight zones is driven by a driving circuit of the backlight driving device according to a first main current level in a display refresh period of a first backlight frame period with respect to the first backlight zone. The first backlight zone is not driven by the driving circuit in a demotion blur period of the first backlight frame period which is prior to the display refresh period. The first backlight zone is driven by the driving circuit according to a first compensation current level in a vertical blanking period of the first backlight frame period which succeeds the display refresh period of the first backlight frame period. The driving circuit determines the first main current level according to the first main backlight data, and the first compensation current level is lower than the first main current level.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Based on the above, the backlight panel according to the embodiments of the disclosure has multiple backlight zones, and different backlight zones correspond to different display regions of the display panel. For any backlight zone, the backlight frame period thereof corresponds to the display frame period of the display panel. Each backlight frame period includes the demotion blur period, the display refresh period, and the vertical blanking period. The driving circuit does not drive the backlight zone in the demotion blur period, that is, the backlight zone does not provide backlight to the corresponding display region of the display panel in the demotion blur period, so as to prevent a viewer from perceiving the motion blur of the display panel. In the display refresh period which succeeds the demotion blur period, the driving circuit drives the backlight zone with the main current level corresponding to the main backlight data, so as to provide brighter backlight to the corresponding display region of the display panel. In the vertical blanking period which succeeds the display refresh period, the driving circuit drives the backlight zone with the compensation current level lower than the main current level, so as to provide darker backlight to the corresponding display region of the display panel. Therefore, the dimming of the backlight zone may be adapted to the variable refresh rate (VRR) mode of the display panel.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order for the features and advantages of the disclosure to be more comprehensible, the following specific embodiments are described in detail in conjunction with the drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a circuit block of a display device according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an equivalent circuit of a backlight zone of a backlight panel and a schematic diagram of different dimming manners.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a timing schematic diagram of a driving manner (line-by-line scanning) of a display panel and a local dimming manner (zoned dimming) of a backlight panel according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a waveform of a driving current of a backlight zone according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a timing diagram of a driving manner (line-by-line scanning) of a display panel and a local dimming manner (zoned dimming) of a backlight panel according to another embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a waveform of a driving current of a backlight zone according to another embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a timing diagram of a driving manner (line-by-line scanning) of a display panel and a local dimming manner (zoned dimming) of a backlight panel according to yet another embodiment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a waveform of a driving current of a backlight zone according to yet another embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of an operating method of a backlight driving device according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a circuit block of a backlight driving device according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a circuit block of a backlight driving device according to another embodiment of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DISCLOSED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The term &#x201c;coupling (or connection)&#x201d; used in the entire specification (including the claims) of the disclosure may refer to any direct or indirect connection means.

For example, taking the backlight frame period Fb_A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> as an example, the former stage device <b>110</b> may calculate D*m/(n+m) to generate the backlight compensation data corresponding to the backlight zone Z<b>1</b>, where D represents the main backlight data corresponding to the backlight zone Z<b>1</b>, m represents the length of the display refresh period of the backlight frame period Fb_A, and n represents the length of the demotion blur period of the backlight frame period Fb_A. The interface circuit <b>121</b> of the backlight driving device <b>120</b> may receive the main backlight data and the backlight compensation data corresponding to the backlight frame period Fb_A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> from the former stage device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the backlight driving device <b>120</b> further includes a latch <b>1130</b>, a latch <b>1140</b>, and a multiplexer (MUX) <b>1150</b>. For a driving circuit <b>122</b>_<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, reference may be made to the relevant description of the driving circuit <b>122</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. An input terminal of the latch <b>1130</b> is coupled to the interface circuit <b>121</b> to receive and store the main backlight data corresponding to the backlight zone Z<b>1</b> of the backlight panel <b>130</b>. An input terminal of the latch <b>1140</b> is coupled to the interface circuit <b>121</b> to receive and store the backlight compensation data corresponding to the backlight zone Z<b>1</b> of the backlight panel <b>130</b>. A first input terminal of the multiplexer <b>1150</b> is coupled to an output terminal of the latch <b>1130</b> to receive the main backlight data corresponding to the backlight zone Z<b>1</b>.

When the multiplexer <b>1150</b> transmits the backlight compensation data corresponding to the backlight zone Z<b>1</b> to the driving circuit <b>122</b>_<b>2</b>, the driving circuit <b>122</b>_<b>2</b> may determine the driving current ILED_<b>1</b> to be the compensation current level <b>182</b> according to the backlight compensation data.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In summary, the backlight panel <b>130</b> of the foregoing embodiments has multiple backlight zones, such as the backlight zones Z<b>1</b> to Z<b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Different backlight zones correspond to different display regions of the display panel. For any backlight zone, the backlight frame period thereof corresponds to the display frame period of the display panel. Each backlight frame period includes the demotion blur period, the display refresh period, and the vertical blanking period. The driving circuit <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> may not drive the backlight zone in the demotion blur period, that is, the backlight zone does not provide backlight to the corresponding display region of the display panel <b>140</b> in the demotion blur period, so as to prevent the viewer from perceiving the motion blur of the display panel. In the display refresh period which succeeds the demotion blur period, the driving circuit <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> drives the backlight zone of the backlight panel <b>130</b> with the main current level (for example, the main current level <b>181</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) corresponding to the main backlight data, so as to provide brighter backlight to the corresponding display region of the display panel. In the vertical blanking period which succeeds the display refresh period, the driving circuit <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> drives the backlight zone of the backlight panel <b>130</b> with the compensation current level (for example, the compensation current level <b>182</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, that is, the original driving current level calculated based on the dimming algorithm) lower than the main current level, so as to provide the original backlight brightness calculated based on the dimming algorithm to the corresponding display region of the display panel <b>140</b>. Therefore, the dimming of the backlight zone may be adapted to the variable refresh rate (VRR) mode of the display panel <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Although the disclosure has been disclosed in the above embodiments, the embodiments are not intended to limit the disclosure.
