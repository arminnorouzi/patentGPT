Renters of the light electric vehicles are very diverse and interact with the ride share vehicles in a number of different ways. Users sometimes forget to complete a ride and may be billed for time due to human error. This creates a poor user experience.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is important to both the users and ride share companies to accurately track rentals of ride share vehicles. Charging renters for time when a vehicle is not in use may upset the renter and lead to less repeat business or complaints. Alternatively, failing to charge a renter for time during which a vehicle was in use or being reserved results in lost profits. The problem is compounded in computer-automated systems in which hundreds, thousands, or tens-of-thousands of rides may occur in one day in one city or across the world.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Methods of ride termination include requiring a user to complete a ride or setting a timer for a maximum ride time, such as 1.5 hours, so that if a rider forgets to terminate a ride via, for example, a smartphone app, the ride will automatically terminate after 2 hours. A rider may also be unable to complete a ride because the light vehicle is in an no-parking zone, their phone dies, they lose an Internet connection, etc. This means that the system will bill the rider for a full 1.5 hours of ride time when they actually only used the light vehicle for a fraction of that period. Billing for a full 1.5-hour period also results in increase of failed credit card charges because they are larger than they should have been, or a user may cancel the charge due to the mistake or a refund due to a dissatisfied rider. The light vehicle is also unavailable for others to use during the period that the rider forgot to complete their ride.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The systems and methods disclosed herein ensure fair treatment of renters by providing accurate bills. This in turn will result in higher customer satisfaction, increased ridership, reduce uncollected revenue, refunds, chargebacks, and customer service inquiries. Additional benefits include more accurate and speedy ride termination by, for example, detecting vehicle speed, current location, and the time. Earlier ride termination also means that the light electric vehicles are available more quickly for other users to rent. Embodiments may be used on various types of vehicles, such as bikes, scooters, and mopeds.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a first example, the system can automatically detect a ride has ended, without any manual rider input, using various hardware and software inputs from computing devices in the light vehicle, user devices, nearby light vehicles, ride time, Bluetooth connection status, and other inputs. The system may use these inputs to determine whether the light vehicle is for example, idle for a period of time, not actively in motion, or separated from a user device of a rider. User devices may contain an app that periodically sends an app activity heartbeat to a server. Light vehicles may similarly transmit periodic vehicle activity heartbeats to the server. The system may use various combinations of these inputs, including heuristics, to predict or determine accurately and automatically if a ride has ended. This may allow a rider to end a ride by leaving the light vehicle and walking away without providing any manual signals that they are done riding.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one example, the system can detect that a maximum 1.5 hour ride time was reached, and assume this was a mistake, as a ride longer than 1.5 hours is very rare. As such, the system may only bill the user for the period of time from the beginning of a ride to the time the vehicle became idle. If a rider is still actually using the light vehicle, the system will terminate the ride automatically and in a safe manner (to avoid sudden stops in traffic). Doing this will allow light vehicles to go into a lower-power standby mode sooner, thereby reducing battery usage and ensuring we can recover the vehicle before it goes offline.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

These aspects may be combined, other aspects may be utilized, and structural changes may be made without departing from the present disclosure. Examples may be practiced as methods, systems or devices. Accordingly, examples may take the form of a hardware implementation, an entirely software implementation, or an implementation combining software and hardware aspects. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present disclosure is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Light electric vehicles (e.g., scooters, bicycles, etc.) may be coupled to a system comprising a network of backend and user computing devices. Each of these devices may be coupled to one another via various networks connected to the Internet.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present disclosure describes systems and methods for terminating rides in vehicles, such as light electric vehicles or automobiles.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an example, a server may receive an input indicating that a rider is reserving a vehicle. The server may then start a ride clock. The server also receives a plurality of inputs corresponding to the vehicle, wherein the plurality of inputs include vehicle speed and vehicle location. The server can determine whether the plurality of inputs match a plurality of criteria, wherein the plurality of criteria include whether an input, received from the vehicle, indicates that the vehicle has moved within a predetermined period, wherein the plurality of criteria further comprises determining whether the vehicle has moved more than a predetermined distance within the predetermined period. The server can terminate the ride clock if the plurality of inputs match the plurality of criteria. The server can calculate a ride cost, wherein the ride cost comprises a duration of use of the vehicle, minus the predetermined period. The server can transmit the ride cost to an application running on a user device. An application on the user device can display the ride cost.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Although aspects of the disclosure describe the light electric vehicle, other types of vehicles can benefit from this system and method for ride termination. For example, mopeds, skateboards, cars, skates, and other vehicles may benefit from aspects of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates an example environment <b>100</b> in which aspects of the present disclosure may be practiced. As illustrated, environment <b>100</b> includes at least one electric scooter <b>110</b>, at least one electric bicycle <b>120</b>, and a rechargeable battery kiosk <b>130</b>. The electric scooter <b>110</b> and the electric bicycle <b>120</b> are examples of light electric vehicles. Aspects described herein apply to other types of light electric vehicles or larger vehicles.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The environment <b>100</b> may include a network service that receives information from the electric scooter <b>110</b> or the electric bicycle <b>120</b> (also referred to herein as light electric vehicles) over a network communication channel (e.g., one or more networks, the Internet, etc.). The information enables a user, using a client application executing on a computing device (e.g., a mobile application running on a mobile device), to locate, request, and/or reserve (e.g., rent or borrow for a duration of time) one or more light electric vehicles. The information may also enable a user to locate, request, and/or reserve a rechargeable battery for the light electric vehicles. In some examples, the rechargeable battery may be used across different light electric vehicles. For example, the same rechargeable battery may be used by the electric scooter <b>110</b> and the electric bicycle <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some examples, the network service includes one or more computing systems or servers that are remote from the computing device of the user and the light electric vehicles. The one or more computing systems include an application programming interface (API) that enables the one or more computing systems to receive information from, send information to, and otherwise interact with the computing device, the light electric vehicles <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> or the rechargeable battery kiosk <b>130</b>. For example, a mobile device application may have interfaces to access information on a mobile device, such as using APIs to location from a location interface (e.g., GPS), accelerometer, data, to send and receive data via a network communication interface, or use other aspects of the mobile device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For example, the client application executing on the computing device of the user receives, from the network service over the network communication channel, information about a location of one or more of the light electric vehicles. The location of each of the light electric vehicles can then be provided on a user interface of the client application. Additionally or alternatively, the location information about a location of one or more of the light electric vehicles may be communicated between a plurality of light electric vehicles and/or a plurality of client applications executing on one or more computing devices.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one example, the user interface of the client application includes a map that displays a determined location of the user and/or a determined location of the light electric vehicles. In some examples, the determined location of the user and/or the determined location of the light electric vehicles is based, at least in part, on Global Positioning System (GPS) data (or other location information) received by the network service over the network communication channel.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The user interface of the client application may display the location information of the user and the light electric vehicles as different icons (or other such representations). Once the location information is displayed, the user may select an icon representing a type of light electric vehicle (e.g., an icon for an electric scooter <b>110</b> or an icon for an electric bicycle <b>120</b>). The user interface of the client application then generates or determines a route (e.g., provides directions) from the user's current location to the selected light electric vehicle. Selection of one of the icons may also enable the user to reserve (e.g., place a hold on) the light electric vehicle (to ensure that the light electric vehicle will be at the determined location when the user arrives), rent the light electric vehicle and/or borrow the light electric vehicle for a period of time.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each light electric vehicle and/or the network service also includes a location tracking system that tracks, receives, and/or determines a location of each light electric vehicle as it is used. In some examples, the location tracking system tracks the location information of the light electric vehicle in real-time or substantially real-time. In other examples, the location tracking system determines the location information of the light electric vehicle at periodic intervals (e.g., every minute, every five minutes, every ten minutes, etc.). These periodic intervals can be called heartbeats. In yet other examples, the location tracking system may track the location of the light electric vehicle in real-time or substantially real-time when the light electric vehicle is rented or otherwise used by a user and may track location information at periodic intervals when the light electric vehicle has been reserved or is otherwise not is use. The location information may be communicated directly between the light electric vehicle and the network service and/or may be communicated among any variety of peer-to-peer interactions. For example, the location information of a first electric vehicle may be sent to a second electric vehicle, which may send the location information for the first electric vehicle and/or location information for the second electric vehicle to the network service. Additionally or alternatively, location information may be sent to the network service via client application running on a computing device. For example, the light electric vehicle may send location information to the client device and the client device may then send the location information to the network service.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The one or more computing systems of the network service may also include a matching system. The matching system receives, manages or otherwise handles various requests from the user. The requests may include light electric vehicle rental requests and light electric vehicle reservation requests. For example, when a vehicle rental request is received from the client application executing on the user's computing device, the matching system may communicate with the location tracking system and determine which light electric vehicle should be matched with or otherwise assigned to the requesting user. Additionally or alternatively, the matching system may be used by the vehicle provider to collect or locate one or more light electric vehicles.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The one or more computing systems of the network service may also include one or more databases that store information about each of the light electric vehicles, their locations, the number of rides, and the revenue generated by each light electric vehicle. The one or more computing systems of the network service may also include a payment system that processes payment information of the rider. For example, when a rider rents and uses a light electric vehicle, the rider may be charged for the usage based on a duration of use and/or a travel distance. Once the rider has finished using the light electric vehicle (e.g., by arriving at their intended destination, a check-in point, a battery kiosk <b>130</b>, etc.), the payment system may automatically terminate the ride and process the payment information of the rider.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As discussed above, the environment <b>100</b> includes one or more light electric vehicles including, but not limited to, an electric scooter <b>110</b> and an electric bicycle <b>120</b>. In examples, the electric scooter <b>110</b> includes vehicle components (e.g., wheels, axles, baseboard, handlebar, braking mechanisms, etc.), one or more electric motors, control systems, sensors, speakers, and/or lights, which may be powered by a rechargeable battery. The rechargeable battery may be secured to the electric scooter <b>110</b> by a battery holster.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Likewise, and in some examples, the electric bicycle <b>120</b> includes vehicle components (e.g., wheels, axles, chains, gears, bicycle seat, handlebar, bicycle frame, braking mechanisms, etc.), one or more electric motors, control systems, sensors, speakers, and/or lights, which may also be powered by a rechargeable battery. The sensors can include a location component (e.g., GPS), speedometer, accelerometer, or pressure sensors for grips or seat.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates a schematic of components of a electric scooter <b>110</b>. In various aspects, electric scooter <b>110</b> may include a battery, a drive train, and a head unit. The battery may be used to power both the drive train and the head unit of the electric scooter <b>110</b>. The head unit may include a processor and a communication link. As described herein, the processor may help to determine whether a ride is terminated. For example, the processor may transmit and receive various signals from user devices, other light electric vehicles, or the server. The signals can be associated with reserving and terminating rides, as discussed in detail throughout this specification.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As described herein, the communication link may be capable of communicating via a variety of communication channels, such as 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. The processor and/or the communication link may select and/or restrict or limit the use of one or more communication channels. As an example, communication channels may be used based on detecting that a computing device is available to receive communications sent over the associated communication channel.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a system <b>200</b> for ride termination for a light electric vehicle <b>210</b>. In addition to the light electric vehicle <b>210</b>, the system <b>200</b> may include a network <b>220</b>, a light electric vehicle <b>230</b> (which may be proximate to the light electric vehicle <b>210</b>), a computing device <b>240</b>, and a server <b>250</b>. The light electric vehicle <b>210</b> and the light electric vehicle <b>230</b> may have components and functions similar to those discussed for light electric vehicles <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> and battery kiosk <b>130</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>. The light electric vehicle <b>210</b> may wirelessly communicate with the network <b>220</b>, the light electric vehicle <b>230</b> and/or the computing device <b>240</b> over a communication channel (as described herein) using a communication link (e.g., communication link <b>174</b>). As described herein, information about the light electric vehicle <b>210</b> may be required or desired by the network <b>220</b> (otherwise referred to herein as a network service) and/or by the computing device <b>240</b> (as may be associated with a potential rider of the light electric vehicle <b>210</b>).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown, there may be a variety of network communication paths for the light electric vehicle <b>210</b> to send information to the network <b>220</b>. For example, information may be sent from the light electric vehicle <b>210</b> directly to the network <b>220</b> over a communication channel. In other aspects, the light electric vehicle <b>210</b> may indirectly communicate or send information to the network <b>220</b>. For example, indirect communication may include information being sent from the light electric vehicle <b>210</b> to a computing device <b>240</b> via a communication channel, which may be relayed from the computing device <b>240</b> to the network <b>220</b> at a time when a communication channel between the computing device <b>240</b> and the network <b>220</b> is available. As another indirect communication example, the light electric vehicle <b>210</b> may send information to a proximate light electric vehicle <b>230</b>. The light electric vehicle <b>230</b> may then relay the information to a computing device <b>240</b> and/or the network <b>220</b> at a time when a communication channel between the light electric vehicle <b>230</b> and either the computing device <b>240</b> and/or the network <b>220</b> is available. If the light electric vehicle <b>230</b> relays the information to a computing device <b>240</b>, the information may be relayed from the computing device <b>240</b> to the network <b>220</b>, at a time when a communication channel between the computing device <b>240</b> and the network <b>220</b> is available. In any of these methods, communication to the network <b>220</b> may be directed to any of the devices or the server via the network <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Additionally, there may be a variety of client communication paths for the light electric vehicle <b>210</b> to send information to the computing device <b>240</b>. For example, information may be sent from the light electric vehicle <b>210</b> directly to the computing device <b>240</b> over a communication channel. In other aspects, the light electric vehicle <b>210</b> may indirectly communicate or send information to the computing device <b>240</b>. For example, indirect communication may include information being sent from the light electric vehicle <b>210</b> to a network <b>220</b> via a communication channel, which may be relayed from the network <b>220</b> to the computing device <b>240</b> at a time when a communication channel between the computing device <b>240</b> and the network <b>220</b> is available. As another indirect communication example, the light electric vehicle <b>210</b> may send information to a light electric vehicle <b>230</b>. The light electric vehicle <b>230</b> may then either relay the information to a computing device <b>240</b> and/or the network <b>220</b> at a time when a communication channel between the light electric vehicle <b>230</b> and either the computing device <b>240</b> and/or the network <b>220</b> is available.

In an example, the information may be shared across multiple light electric vehicles until the information is received at a desired location or device (e.g., received by the network <b>220</b> and/or a computing device <b>240</b>). For example, information about a first vehicle may be sent to a second vehicle, which is then sent to a third vehicle, etc., until a vehicle that has received the information is capable of communicating the information to a computing device <b>240</b> and/or the network <b>220</b>. In another example where the light electric vehicle <b>210</b> sends information to a light electric vehicle <b>230</b>, the light electric vehicle <b>230</b> may send the information associated with the light electric vehicle <b>210</b> in addition to information associated with the light electric vehicle <b>230</b> and/or other information received from other light electric vehicles (such that information about more than one light electric vehicle is communicated). Sharing of information about multiple light electric vehicles may shared across the peer-to-peer network.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example flow <b>300</b> for an auto-termination process. In this example, a user can reserve a vehicle using a mobile device (step <b>310</b>). The mobile device can include a mobile application corresponding to a ride share service for personal rides, such as scooters, automobiles, or bikes. The user can initiate a ride or reservation by, for example, clicking a button on a mobile application. The mobile application may then send a message to a server <b>250</b> indicating the beginning of a ride (step <b>320</b>). The server <b>250</b> may then begin a ride clock starting at 00:00:00. In step <b>330</b>, the server may receive signal inputs from a plurality of devices, including the vehicle being ridden, a user device associated with the rider, or other vehicles nearby to the vehicle being ridden, as discussed above in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The signal inputs can include vehicle speed, which may be obtained from a speedometer on the vehicle, or GPS signals from the vehicle or the user device. Additional signal inputs can include vehicle location, which can also be obtained via GPS or other similar location service. Still more inputs can include detection of movement from, for example, one or more accelerometers on the user device or the vehicle, inputs from a throttle or brake on the vehicle, pressure sensors on the grips, seat, or other surface the user is contacting on the vehicle. More inputs may include a magnetometer to indicate direction, a hall effect sensor to detect whether a lock is engaged, a gyroscope to sense the orientation of the vehicle, or a proximity sensor for sensing whether a vehicle is in use.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The illustrated embodiment includes a loop <b>340</b> for allowing a user to pause a ride by, for example, pressing a pause button on a mobile device application, which causes the server to receive a pause indication. This allows a user to continue a reservation while a user makes a brief stop, for example to get coffee or see a friend. This embodiment can allow for the vehicle to enter a lower power state to reduce the number of heartbeats sent to the server <b>250</b>, or to stop the heartbeats entirely. Alternative embodiments may continue to send signals to the server <b>250</b>. The server <b>250</b> may charge the user a reduced rate during the paused period, or the server <b>250</b> may charge the same rate. In either case, the server <b>250</b> will not terminate the ride during the pause period, unless, for example, the pause period exceeds a predetermined period of time, e.g., 30 minutes. The user may be able to select the length of a pause period in some embodiments, e.g., in increments of 10 minutes up to 1 hour. The server <b>250</b> will remain in the pause period during this period of time.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Step <b>350</b> illustrates the server <b>250</b> determining whether signal inputs received from one or more of the vehicle or mobile application match predetermined criteria. Embodiments can use various criteria. One criteria can be the identity of the rider, for example, is the rider a customer or an employee. The ride termination algorithm may differ depending on whether the rider is a customer or an employee testing a vehicle. The algorithm may also differ depending on whether the rider is solo or part of a group ride, e.g., one rider unlocks multiple vehicles for a group of riders. Further criteria can include whether the last heartbeat speed was 0 mph. If the vehicle remains idle for a predetermined period of time, e.g., 5 minutes, the server <b>250</b> can provide an transmit a command to the mobile application to display a warning that the ride will terminate within 5 minutes. Then the ride may terminate if the vehicle remains idle for an additional 5 minutes. Embodiments may also require that the vehicle has not moved a predetermined distance, e.g., 500 m, within this time. The server <b>250</b> may then terminate the ride after the vehicle meets the criteria, which in this example is 10 minutes. The system may or may not bill the user for this idle period.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Additional embodiments may send a user one or more warning messages that a ride will terminate during a paused state. For example, the server <b>250</b> may cause one or more warnings at intervals until a maximum time limit is reached, at which point the server <b>250</b> can terminate the ride. Alternatively, a mobile application on the user's mobile device may allow the user to extend the pause period. The server <b>250</b> can then choose to charge or not charge the rider for the paused period.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Another criteria for terminating a ride can be whether the server <b>250</b> has received any heartbeat signals from a vehicle for a predetermined period, e.g., 15 minutes. This can happen when, for example, the vehicle loses power, suffers a technical failure, or loses network connection. The server <b>250</b> may then terminate the ride if it has not received a heartbeat signal for the predetermined period. The server <b>250</b> may or may not bill the user for that predetermined period. The server <b>250</b> may also send a warning message to the user if it has not received a heartbeat signal before the end of the predetermined period. The server <b>250</b> may be able to log the location of the user device via the mobile application even if it is out of contact with the vehicle. The server <b>250</b> may store this information to help find the vehicle that it lost communication with.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Another useful criteria is the distance between the rider's mobile device and the vehicle. If the vehicle is idle and the user's mobile device location is farther than a predetermined threshold distance from the vehicle, the system can assume the user's ride is complete. Any of these criteria may be used alone or in combination with any of the other criteria as required for any specific applications. Scooter, bikes, mopeds, and automobiles may have different us cases and treated differently. It is therefore beneficial to allow for adjustments to the criteria to suit different situations.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The system may also consider the battery level of a user's mobile device. For example, if a user's mobile device has very little power, e.g., 5% life remaining, the mobile device may lose power before the end of the ride, leaving the user unable to manually terminate a ride. The system may allow the user to continue riding for a predetermined period, e.g., 5 minutes, before terminating the ride and locking the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The system may also end a ride if a vehicle is detected in a no-parking zone. Users may not know that they are leaving the vehicle in a no-parking zone, and therefore fail to terminate a ride properly. In this case, the system may automatically terminate the ride if the vehicle remains idle in a no-parking zone for a predetermined period.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Another embodiment can set an upper bound for the length of a trip, e.g., 1.5 hours, after which the ride will automatically terminate.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The system may terminate of a ride in various ways. For example, the server <b>250</b> may instruct the vehicle to stop at a safe location. The server <b>250</b> could also slowly reduce the throttle of the vehicle until it stops. The server <b>250</b> could also instruct the vehicle to slowly apply the brakes until the vehicle is stopped. Different types of vehicles may have different termination protocols. Large vehicles, for example, need to be more concerned with collisions than lighter vehicles, such as scooters. Large vehicles, therefore, may have a slower termination process to avoid any quick changes that could result in a collision. A scooter, on the other hand, is less likely to need to maintain speed in heavy traffic, and could therefore have a faster termination process.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The server <b>250</b> may then calculate the ride cost and perform additional termination processes in step <b>360</b>. These processes can include determining the billing period, such as whether to include paused portions of the ride or idle periods at the end of a ride but before termination. The server may also change the state of the vehicle in a database from in use to available, and similarly change the state of a ride from in-progress to terminated. The server <b>250</b> may then generate a message include the cost and trip summary, e.g., path traveled, to the mobile application on the user device. The cost of the trip may be determined based on the total ride time and can include fixed costs, such as an unlock fee. The final cost may be a percentage of this total amount based on the total ride time divided by the total reserved time. As such, the percentage may affect not only the cost associated with the ride time but also the fixed costs. This cost can also incorporate any discounts or promotions that the user is eligible for. The trip summary is similar to a receipt. Finally, the server may lock the vehicle until another user rents it or it needs service.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates example embodiments of a solo trip summary <b>400</b> and a group trip summary <b>410</b>.
