Devices are configured to be easily transitioned from the expanded configuration to a retracted configuration for storage or transport of the devices when not in use.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Garden covers and greenhouses provide many benefits to gardeners and gardening efforts. Garden covers protect plants from wildlife and adverse weather and are often used to keep plants warmer to promote plant growth and health during colder weather. Many garden covers function as greenhouses and operate by allowing sufficient light to reach the plants and retaining moisture within the interior of the greenhouse.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many existing garden covers and greenhouses require tools for assembly, installation, and disassembly, or are otherwise inconvenient or difficult to assemble, install, and disassemble, and are often not structurally durable. Many gardeners assemble and install these devices initially and leave them installed and covering the garden throughout the year due to the difficulty involved with disassembly. This results in these devices being constantly exposed to weather and environmental stressors which causes rapid deterioration and failure of these devices. For example, metal frames and joints of such devices, which may be within an interior of the cover of the greenhouse and exposed to the higher humidity therein, are at greater risk for rusting and becoming immobile, unusable, or destroyed. As another example, frames and covers of these devices are constantly exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light which causes UV damage and deterioration of components. As yet another example, these devices may be too lightweight or may catch the wind and be removed from the intended location, resulting in damage to the devices or nearby people, animals, plants, or objects. It is typical that, after a relatively short period of use, these devices must either be intensively repaired or replaced entirely.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, many existing garden covers and greenhouses are not effective for certain gardens or environments, such as gardens placed on or near a portion of uneven ground. After installation in these environments, gaps appear between the cover and the irregular terrain. These gaps may result from the cover being pulled taut between structures of the frame, such that the bottom edge of the cover does not effectively or reliably contact lower portions of the terrain and fails to form a seal around the perimeter of the device. The lack of the seal causes loss of moisture from the interior of the greenhouse which in turn inhibits growth of the plants.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a need for high-quality portable garden cover devices that are easier to assemble, install, store, and transport, and which are of a more durable construction designed to withstand continuous and repeated uses. The present disclosure addresses these unmet needs.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This disclosure provides improved durable ground cover devices that may be easily assembled for use and disassembled for storage or transport, without necessarily requiring a user to use tools or to follow a large number of complex steps. A ground cover device includes a frame that is configured to expand and contract to transition the frame between a contracted configuration and an expanded configuration, and a cover that is attachable to the frame to contact the ground and create a greenhouse space within the cover.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For use of the device, the cover may be attached to the frame such that the cover is positioned within an interior volume formed by the frame and the frame is positioned outside an exterior surface of the cover, or alternatively, the cover may be attached to the frame such that the cover is positioned outside of the interior volume formed by the frame and the frame is positioned inside an interior surface of the cover. A configuration with an external frame and an internal cover may prevent humidity within the cover from causing rust or deterioration of the frame, and in addition, may enable lower portions of an outer perimeter of the cover to consistently and reliably contact the ground surface thereunder to form and maintain a seal around the greenhouse space, even in the presence of irregular terrain and adverse weather such as rain and wind. A configuration with an internal frame and an external cover may prevent exposure of the frame to adverse weather conditions such as rain, wind, and sunlight, and may provide other benefits as well.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The ground cover devices are easily assembled for use when needed and are easily disassembled for storage or transport when not needed, such as may occur during the Spring season. The devices may be provided as greenhouse devices that allow sunlight in and also retain sufficient moisture to encourage plant growth. The devices are portable and are of an improved quality and durability, and include innovative features that, individually and collectively, provide various benefits as described herein and as may be apparent upon practicing the invention in any of its various forms, whether explicitly or implicitly disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Various objects, features and advantages of the

The greenhouse devices are easily transitioned between an expanded configuration and a contracted configuration for use and storage or transport and provide significant improvements compared to previous ground cover devices in usability, durability, and utility.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>F, <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F, and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>F</figref>, there are shown perspective views of a first exemplary medium-sized ground cover device (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>C, <b>1</b>E</figref>), a second exemplary medium-sized ground cover device (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>D, <b>1</b>F</figref>), a first exemplary large-sized ground cover device (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>C, <b>3</b>E</figref>), a second exemplary large-sized ground cover device (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B, <b>3</b>D, <b>3</b>F</figref>), a first exemplary small-sized ground cover device (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>C, <b>4</b>E</figref>), and a second exemplary small-sized ground cover device (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>B, <b>4</b>D, <b>4</b>F</figref>).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">While it is generally intended that any of the exemplary ground cover devices disclosed herein (<b>1</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>47</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>) may be any size, in certain embodiments, larger ground cover devices (<b>47</b>, <b>48</b>) may have improved stability with inclusion of additional components in the design compared to medium-sized ground cover devices (<b>1</b>, <b>27</b>), and smaller ground cover devices (<b>53</b>, <b>54</b>) may not have as many components compared to medium-sized ground cover devices (<b>1</b>, <b>27</b>). In various instances, the decision to include or omit components in a design may be made based on various economic or technical factors such as cost of materials and shipping, design and manufacturing considerations, scalability of a particular design or configuration, market demand, and intended uses, among others. Similarly, particular forms of the ground cover device may be particularly beneficial or advantageous for particular uses or situations; for example, an urban gardener may prefer a small (<b>53</b>, <b>54</b>) or a medium-sized (<b>1</b>, <b>27</b>) ground cover device due to limited space available in urban environments for gardening, while a suburban or rural gardener may prefer a medium-sized (<b>1</b>, <b>27</b>) or a large (<b>47</b>, <b>48</b>) ground cover device to utilize the generally greater amount of space available for gardening in these types of areas. However, these general considerations do not limit the utility of any embodiment of the ground cover device to a particular scenario or the scope of this disclosure to a particular embodiment or embodiments. As would be understood by the person having ordinary skill in the art, any particular form of the ground cover device may be used in any of these and other uses or situations.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">a.

The frame <b>2</b> includes a plurality of ground poles <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, and <b>11</b> (see also additional ground poles of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F</figref>) that are connectable via a plurality of cross members <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> (see also <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>C, <b>1</b>E, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>C, <b>3</b>E, <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>C, and <b>4</b>E</figref>). As cross members are adjusted such that lengths of the adjusted cross members increase, ground poles move further apart toward an expanded configuration of the frame. As cross members are adjusted such that lengths of the adjusted cross members decrease, ground poles move closer together toward a contracted configuration of the frame. While the frame is in an expanded configuration (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B</figref>) the ground cover device may be configured for use to cover at least a portion of a ground or a garden, and while the frame is in a contracted configuration (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>E, <b>1</b>F, <b>3</b>E, <b>3</b>F, <b>4</b>E, <b>4</b>F</figref>) the ground cover device may be configured for storage or transport. In this manner, the device may be easily assembled, expanded for use, contracted for storage or transport, and disassembled for long-term storage, as needed. Connections between components may be made by hand without necessarily needing tools, and components are made of durable materials to provide sufficient support to the frame for long-term use.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In embodiments, the arrangement of ground poles may be rectangular, and the plurality of ground poles includes a first ground pole <b>8</b>, a second ground pole <b>9</b>, a third ground pole <b>10</b>, and a fourth ground pole <b>11</b> (see also additional ground poles of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F</figref>). The first ground pole <b>8</b> is connectable to the fourth ground pole <b>11</b> via a first adjustable cross member <b>19</b>, and the second ground pole <b>9</b> is connectable to the third ground pole <b>10</b> via a second adjustable cross member <b>20</b>. In the shown embodiments, the first and second adjustable cross members are scissor cross members <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> (see also additional adjustable cross members as scissor cross members <b>45</b>, <b>46</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F</figref>), but other adjustable cross member structures, including but not limited to telescopic adjustable cross members, may be used without departing from the scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In various implementations, the scissor cross members <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> (and <b>45</b>, <b>46</b>) may each be comprised of a plurality of members connected at scissor joints, which provide pivot points to the members that allow the members to pivot relative to each other as part of a scissoring movement. If the members are free to move about the scissor joints, the scissor cross members <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> (and <b>45</b>, <b>46</b>) can be contracted such that a vertical height of the scissor cross members <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> (and <b>45</b>, <b>46</b>) increases and a horizontal width of the scissor cross members decreases (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>E, <b>1</b>F, <b>3</b>E, <b>3</b>F, <b>4</b>E, <b>4</b>F</figref>), and can be expanded such that the vertical height of the scissor cross members <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> (and <b>45</b>, <b>46</b>) decreases and the horizontal width of the scissor cross members increases (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B</figref>). If the members are not free to move about the scissor joints, then the scissor cross members <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> (and <b>45</b>, <b>46</b>) would not be able to be contracted or expanded and the frame would be secured in a particular configuration.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In various embodiments, ground poles may be connectable via scissor cross members, and in the shown embodiments, at each terminal end of each scissor cross member, an upper member is hingedly attached to an adjacent ground pole and does not slide vertically along the adjacent ground pole, and a lower member is hingedly attached to a sleeve which, in turn, is slidingly attached to the adjacent ground pole. The hinged connection between the lower member and the sleeve allows an angle between the lower member and the sleeve to change with scissor movements of the scissor cross member, and the sliding connection between the sleeve and the ground pole allows for defined movements. The sleeve slides along the ground pole during adjustments of the scissor cross member and may be securable at an upper position of the ground pole (e.g., by looping a hinged loop over a securement member) and may be securable at a lower position of the ground pole (e.g., by force of gravity) to secure the frame in the expanded and retracted configurations, respectively.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the shown embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>F, <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F, and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>F</figref>, the first and fourth ground poles (<b>8</b>, <b>11</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>F</figref>; see corresponding ground poles of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>F</figref>) and the second and third ground poles (<b>9</b>, <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>F</figref>; see corresponding ground poles of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>F</figref> and see also additional ground poles of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F</figref>) may be connectable via the scissor cross members <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> (see also <b>45</b>, <b>46</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F</figref>), such that sleeves <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b> (see also <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F</figref>) of the scissor cross members slide along the first <b>8</b>, second <b>9</b>, third <b>10</b>, and fourth <b>11</b> ground poles (see also additional ground poles of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F</figref>) during adjustments of the scissor cross members <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> (and <b>45</b>, <b>46</b>), may be securable at upper positions of the ground poles to secure the frame in the expanded configuration (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>4</b>A, and <b>4</b>B</figref>), and may be securable at lower positions of the ground poles to secure the frame in the contracted configuration (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>E, <b>1</b>F, <b>3</b>E, <b>3</b>F, <b>4</b>E, and <b>4</b>F</figref>).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the expanded configuration the sleeves <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b> (and <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>) may be relatively distal to lower ends of the ground poles and the ground thereunder, and in the contracted configuration the sleeves <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b> (and <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>) may be relatively proximal to lower ends of the ground poles and the ground thereunder (see, for example, sleeve <b>24</b> of inset <b>31</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>H</figref>). In both the expanded configuration and the contracted configuration, as well as an intermediate configuration (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C, <b>1</b>D, <b>3</b>C, <b>3</b>D, <b>4</b>C, and <b>4</b>D</figref>), hinged connections of the upper members of the ends of the scissor members (see, for example, upper member <b>41</b> of scissor cross member <b>19</b> of inset <b>31</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>M</figref>) may be consistently positioned relative to lower ends of the ground poles and the ground thereunder. Because the lower members of the ends of the scissor cross members may be hingedly connected to the sleeves, vertical movements of the sleeves along the ground poles correlate with hinged movements of these lower members relative to the sleeves.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In various situations, the device may be subjected to wind and other forces which may cause unwanted or untimely movements, transitions, or reconfigurations of the frame. Accordingly, in various embodiments, any of various securement structures, such as sleeves <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b> (and <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>) that may be rigidly attached to lower members of the scissor cross members <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> (and <b>45</b>, <b>46</b>) and slidingly attached to ground poles, may be used to define acceptable ranges of movement that may occur during reconfiguration of the frame. The securement structures may be locked to secure the frame in place to prevent unwanted or untimely movements of the frame and may be unlocked to release the frame for a reconfiguration of the frame.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the shown embodiment, the sleeves <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b> (and <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>) slidingly envelop or attach to the ground poles and may be configured to slide along the ground poles as along a track, a groove, or another regular structure suitable for a sliding movement or a rolling movement and may be secured to upper positions of the ground poles to hold the frame in place. For example, as shown at insets <b>31</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>H and <b>2</b>M</figref>, sleeve <b>24</b> may be secured to the upper position of ground pole <b>11</b> by hooking a hinged loop <b>36</b>, which may be hingedly attached to a body <b>37</b> of the sleeve <b>24</b>, over a securement member <b>35</b> which extends outward from the ground pole <b>11</b>. This arrangement prevents the sleeve <b>24</b> from sliding downward along the ground pole <b>11</b>, which keeps the frame and the device in an upright stance and in an expanded configuration. Since the upper member <b>41</b> of the end of the scissor member <b>19</b> is unable to slide vertically along the ground pole <b>11</b>, securing the sleeve <b>24</b> to the ground pole <b>11</b> in this manner secures the scissor cross member <b>19</b> in a stationary position relative to the ground pole <b>11</b> and prevents unwanted movements and reconfigurations of the frame. While these structures are explicitly shown for sleeve <b>24</b>, it is intended that these or equivalent or similar structures are or may be implemented for each of the other sleeves and are shown for sleeve <b>24</b> to facilitate this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In embodiments, the first ground pole <b>8</b> may be connectable to the second ground pole <b>9</b> via a third cross member (<b>4</b> and <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>C, <b>1</b>E, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>C, <b>3</b>E, <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>C, and <b>4</b>E</figref>), and the third ground pole <b>10</b> may be connectable to the fourth ground pole <b>11</b> via a fourth cross member (<b>6</b> and <b>7</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>C, <b>1</b>E, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>C, <b>3</b>E, <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>C, and <b>4</b>E</figref>; see also additional cross member <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>C, and <b>3</b>E</figref>). The third and fourth (and additional) cross members may be comprised of a first member (<b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>43</b>) and a second member (<b>5</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>44</b>) which may be affixed to each other such that the cross member as a whole has a constant length or, alternatively, may be connected to each other such that the cross member as a whole has a variable length, as may be achieved with a telescopic arrangement between the first and second members. In a telescopic arrangement, the first member may be slidingly received by, or slidingly engaged with, the second member, or vice versa, and the first and second members may be secured together (e.g., with a fastener to secure the first and second members together, with a locking pin insertable through apertures of the first and second members to secure the first and second members together, etc.) to define a length of the cross member as a whole and a resultant width of the coverage able to be provided by the device in that configuration.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In certain implementations, the third and fourth (and additional) cross members (e.g., <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>) may be attached to upper portions of the ground poles, adjacent to and below upper chords (<b>12</b> and <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>F</figref>; see corresponding upper chords of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>F</figref>) of the frame, rather than being attached to lower portions of the ground poles. In such an arrangement, the third and fourth (and additional) cross members may be referred to as lower chords of the frame of the device. The lower chords act as a tension tie between the ground poles and prevent outward thrust of the frame, as may occur during high winds or other external forces applied against the cover <b>3</b>, which may catch the wind and attempt to move the device away from an area of the ground. The lower chords (e.g., <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>) may therefore provide improved stability to the frame. However, in various implementations of the device, the lower chords may not necessarily be needed for the frame to maintain stability and may be omitted from the frame or may be included with the frame and installed by a user only if needed, for example, if the user installs the device in an area that regularly experiences high winds. In addition, while not necessarily needed for many installations of the device, other components may included with the frame to secure the device to the ground if needed, including but not limited to stakes, weights, ropes, and tie-downs, for example.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In various implementations, upper portions of the first and second ground poles <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> may be connectable via a first upper chord <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> that includes a first apex <b>25</b> and upper portions of the third and fourth ground poles <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> may be connectable via a second upper chord <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> that includes a second apex <b>26</b>. The first apex <b>25</b> may be connectable to the second apex <b>26</b> via an adjustable ridge member (<b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>). In the shown embodiment the first apex <b>25</b> connects a first limb <b>12</b> of the first upper chord to a second limb <b>13</b> of the first upper chord, and the second apex <b>26</b> connects a first limb <b>14</b> of the second upper chord to a second limb <b>15</b> of the second upper chord. The limbs (<b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>) provide support to elevate and hold the adjustable ridge member (<b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>) in place, and transfer the weight of the adjustable ridge member (<b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>) and the cover <b>3</b> downward through the ground poles and toward the ground to improve stability of the device when installed and in the expanded configuration.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In various embodiments, a hinge joint <b>18</b> flexibly connects a first limb <b>16</b> of the adjustable ridge member to a second limb <b>17</b> of the adjustable ridge member, and may be lockable to secure the first and second limbs (<b>16</b>, <b>17</b>) of the adjustable ridge member in a parallel and colinear arrangement (e.g., an approximately parallel and colinear arrangement) (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>; expanded configuration), and may be unlockable to release the first and second limbs (<b>16</b>, <b>17</b>) of the adjustable ridge member from the approximately parallel and colinear arrangement (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D</figref>). The first limb <b>16</b> may be hingedly attached to the first apex <b>25</b> and the second limb may be hingedly attached to the second apex <b>26</b>. As the frame is transitioned from the expanded configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>) to the intermediate configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D</figref>), the hinge joint <b>18</b> folds downward and the first and second limbs (<b>16</b>, <b>17</b>) rotate downward about hinged connections with the apexes (<b>25</b>, <b>26</b>) as the frame collapses, which may be facilitated by force of gravity. The apexes (<b>25</b>, <b>26</b>) may hingedly engage the limbs (<b>16</b>, <b>17</b>) at inner portions of the apexes (<b>25</b>, <b>26</b>) to allow the limbs (<b>16</b>, <b>17</b>) to rotate in this manner, and in embodiments, one or more of the apexes (<b>25</b>, <b>26</b>) may be configured to hingedly engage additional limbs at outer portions of the apexes (<b>25</b>, <b>26</b>) to allow the additional limbs to rotate in this manner as well.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Accordingly, in embodiments, additional ground poles, additional upper chords, and, in certain implementations, additional adjustable cross members, may be utilized with a particular design of the frame, as may be needed for larger frames (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F</figref>). The inclusion of additional components such as these may involve changes in structure or function of some of these components or may involve a utilization of a structure or feature that may not be utilized for smaller frames (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>F and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>F</figref>). For example, a larger frame (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F</figref>) may include an intermediate apex <b>50</b> positioned at an upper portion of an intermediate upper chord, which rests between the first apex <b>25</b> and the second apex <b>26</b>. As the larger frame is transitioned from the expanded configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>) to the intermediate configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>C and <b>3</b>D</figref>), hinge joints <b>18</b>, <b>49</b> of adjustable ridge members fold downward and the limbs of the adjustable ridge members rotate downward about hinged connections with the apexes (<b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>50</b>) as the frame collapses, which may be facilitated by force of gravity. The apexes (<b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>50</b>) may hingedly engage the limbs of the adjustable ridge members at inner portions of the apexes <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and at both portions of the intermediate apex <b>50</b>, to allow the limbs to rotate in this manner. In embodiments the first and second apexes <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> may be the same structure as the intermediate apex <b>50</b>, with a difference being that the inner portions of the first and second apexes <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> are utilized while the outer portions of the first and second apexes <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> are not utilized, and both portions of the intermediate apex <b>50</b> are utilized. However, in other embodiments, the first and second apexes <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> may be different structures or structurally distinct from the intermediate apex <b>50</b>; for example, the intermediate apex <b>50</b> may be configured for two hinged connections while the first and second apexes <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> may be configured for one hinged connection.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In various embodiments, a hinge joint <b>18</b> flexibly connects a first limb <b>16</b> of the adjustable ridge member to a second limb <b>17</b> of the adjustable ridge member, and may be lockable to secure the first and second limbs <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> of the adjustable ridge member in an approximately parallel and colinear arrangement (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>4</b>A, and <b>4</b>B</figref>), and unlockable to release the first and second limbs <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> of the adjustable ridge member from the approximately parallel and colinear arrangement (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C, <b>1</b>D, <b>3</b>C, <b>3</b>D, <b>4</b>C, and <b>4</b>D</figref>) (see also additional adjustable ridge members and additional hinge joint <b>49</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref>). While the hinge joints <b>18</b>, <b>49</b> may be comprised of any suitable lockable joint for securing the limbs in place, in the shown embodiments, the hinge joints <b>18</b>, <b>49</b> include a push button locking system (see, e.g., inset <b>59</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>, <b>2</b>J, and <b>2</b>K</figref>) that includes a hinge <b>58</b> that hingedly connects the limbs <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> to the hinge joint <b>18</b>. As the limbs <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> are moved upward, they pivot about the hinge of the hinge joints <b>18</b>, <b>49</b> and may snap into place and be secured in the approximately parallel and colinear arrangement by a push button locking system (<b>55</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>57</b>), as shown. If the hinge joint needs to be released, for example to reconfigure or disassemble the frame, a user may engage a release mechanism <b>38</b> of the locking system which depresses an exposed portion of a ball <b>56</b> of a spring member <b>55</b> through an aperture <b>57</b> of limb <b>16</b>. The spring member <b>55</b> is shown in broken lines and may be positioned within hollow limb <b>17</b>, as shown. The spring member <b>55</b> may be a metal or metallic member that exhibits a bias, such that there may be a resistance felt by a user when depressing the ball <b>56</b> of the spring member <b>55</b> with the release mechanism <b>38</b>. The bias may be helpful to prevent the spring member <b>55</b> from moving and causing the hinge joint <b>18</b> from becoming unlocked when not intended. Depression of the spring member <b>55</b> in turn unlocks the hinge joint <b>18</b> and allows the limbs <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> to move freely (e.g., within a range defined by structures of the components) relative to the hinge joint <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In various embodiments, the covers (e.g., <b>3</b>) of the ground cover devices may be attached to the frames such that the frame is entirely exterior to the cover when these components are connected, such that an interior volume of the cover does not contain any portion of the frame. In this configuration, the cover drapes the ground to create and maintain a seal with the ground (including uneven and irregular areas of the ground). The seal may help retain moisture within the interior of the cover, which encourages plant growth. By having the frame outside the cover, the frame may be protected from rusting and deterioration that may occur due to exposure to humidity within the interior of the cover, and in this manner the lifespan of the frame may be prolonged. This configuration may also reduce stress and strain on the cover because the cover is not stretched or pulled around the frame which may cause tearing and damage to the cover, and in this manner the lifespan of the cover may be prolonged. However, in other configurations, the frame may be interior to the cover. In such configurations, the frame may be protected from adverse weather and UV light exposure due to sunlight.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In various embodiments, the cover includes a transparent portion that allows all or part of sunlight to pass therethrough to reach the interior volume of the cover. An appropriate amount of sunlight may facilitate plant growth within the greenhouse device. The transparent portion may be comprised of an optically transparent flexible material, such as an optically transparent plastic, which can fold and flex with the cover as needed. In this manner, the transparent portion may not be susceptible to damage with folding and flexing of the cover.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In embodiments, the ground cover device may be provided as a standalone configuration and may not be modular or may not be able to be combined with additional ground cover device components to create additional or alternative configurations or arrangements of the components. However, in other embodiments, the ground cover device may be provided as a modular ground cover device that is comprised of components that may be assembled into any number of repeatable units to create a variety of sizes and configurations. The decision to implement the ground cover device as a modular or non-modular device may be driven by cost-benefit or design considerations. In addition, in various embodiments, the ground cover device components may include anti-weathering features, such as anti-weathering coatings or materials or anti-UV light coatings or materials, which preserve the components and prevent them from being deteriorated with ordinary use and exposure to the elements. In this manner, the lifespan of the ground cover may be extended, and the consumer may not need to repair or replace the device for a longer period of time.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">b. Assembly and Use</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, there are shown a perspective view of several components of a ground cover device, in an unassembled state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), and a perspective view of an assembly of a cover (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). A ground cover device may be provided as a collection of components (e.g., a kit) that includes a cover <b>3</b>, upper chords <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>15</b>, an adjustable ridge member (<b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>) that is hingedly connected with apexes <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and scissor members <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> that are connected with ground poles <b>8</b> and <b>11</b>, and <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>. The cover <b>3</b> may be unfolded to reveal a plurality of upper chord sleeves <b>28</b>, as shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, prior to assembly. The cover <b>3</b> may include vents of any of various sizes and shapes that may be opened to ventilate the interior of the greenhouse device as needed and closed as not needed. The vents may be shaped as elongated apertures and may be operable with a zipper, a hook and loop attachment, a button attachment, or another type of attachment suitable for opening and closing the vents. To assemble the cover <b>3</b>, the upper chords <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>15</b> may be inserted through the upper chord sleeves <b>28</b>, as shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">After the cover is assembled with the upper chords inserted, the cover may be laid down on a surface, such as an area of flat ground, as shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, and the adjustable ridge member unfolded, as shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, such that the first and second limbs (<b>16</b>, <b>17</b>) of the adjustable ridge member form the approximately parallel and colinear arrangement. The unfolded adjustable ridge member may be laid upon the cover, as shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, with the hinge joint <b>18</b> oriented such that it will fold downward, toward the cover, when released from the approximately parallel and colinear arrangement. The upper chords may be connected to the apexes by inserting lower portions of the apex into upper ends of the upper chords, as indicated by broken arrows at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>. The scissor members <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> may be attached to the upper chords, as shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>E and <b>2</b>F</figref>, by inserting upper portions of the ground poles <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> into lower ends of the upper chords <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>; this operation may be repeated for the other ground poles <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> to be attached to the other upper chords <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, as shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>G</figref>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Various steps may be involved with attaching the cover to the frame for a particular embodiment, as shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>H</figref> at insets <b>29</b> and <b>30</b>. The cover <b>3</b> may include a plurality of elastic loops <b>32</b> attached at attachment points <b>34</b> of the exterior of the cover <b>3</b>. The loops <b>32</b> may be stretched and looped around securement members <b>33</b> that extend from the frame at certain locations on the frame, such as an angled portion of the ground pole <b>11</b> (inset <b>29</b>) and a lower portion of the ground pole <b>11</b> (inset <b>30</b>). The elastic loops <b>32</b> may be bungee cords or rubber cords and may hold the cover <b>3</b> firmly but not overly taut, such that the cover <b>3</b> may be able to form and maintain an effective seal the with the ground. As shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>H</figref> at insets <b>31</b>, the sleeve <b>24</b> may be secured to the upper position of ground pole <b>11</b> by hooking a hinged loop <b>36</b>, which may be hingedly attached to a body <b>37</b> of the sleeve <b>24</b>, over a securement member <b>35</b> which extends outward from the ground pole <b>11</b>. This arrangement prevents the sleeve <b>24</b> from sliding downward along the ground pole <b>11</b>, which keeps the frame and the device in an upright stance and in an expanded configuration.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Once the ground cover device is assembled and in the expanded configuration, it may be transitioned to an intermediate configuration and a contracted configuration as shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>L</figref>, including at insets <b>42</b> and <b>31</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>L</figref> (see also insets <b>42</b> and <b>31</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>H</figref>). As shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>L</figref>, a user may engage a release mechanism <b>38</b> of the locking system which unlocks the hinge joint <b>18</b> and allows the limbs to move freely relative to the hinge joint <b>18</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>, <b>2</b>J, and <b>2</b>K</figref>). The user may also unlock the sleeve <b>24</b> from the upper position of the ground pole <b>11</b> by unhooking the hinged loop <b>36</b>, which may be hingedly attached to the body <b>37</b> of the sleeve <b>24</b>, from the securement member <b>35</b> which extends outward from the ground pole <b>11</b> (see also insets <b>31</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>H</figref>). This manipulation allows the sleeve <b>24</b> to slide downward along the ground pole <b>11</b>, which allows the frame and the device <b>27</b> to transition out of the upright stance and the expanded configuration and toward an intermediate configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>L</figref>, right). From there, the user can manually compress the frame such that the device <b>27</b> is transitioned toward the contracted configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>L</figref>, left). In the contracted configuration, the ground cover device may be more easily stored when not in use, for example, in a garage, next to a building or home, in a vehicle, in a shed, etc.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">III.
