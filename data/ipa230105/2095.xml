More particularly, this disclosure is directed to an apparatus and a method of packaging articles which are to be shipped from a packaging and shipping facility, such as a large conventional fulfillment center, in response to purchases made online Specifically, this disclosure is directed to an apparatus and a method of packaging articles in packaging materials which materials are produced in real time by an automated packaging system. In the method, the packaging material is customized to one or more parameters of each particular article to be shipped. The one or more parameters are identified by scanning each article as it moves along a conveyor system from a storage location to a shipping location within the facility. The customized packaging for any particular article is formed in real time.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Background Information</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As the electronic commerce (ecommerce) industry continues to grow, so do the issues encountered by facilities, such as fulfillment centers, which are involved with packaging a large number of articles for shipment, particularly articles which are dissimilar in configuration. Typically packaging systems in such facilities utilize standard packaging, such as cardboard boxes or envelopes, for packaging and shipping articles. The standard packaging is pre-fabricated in standard sizes. Typically, articles which are ordered online are picked for shipping by pickers at a picking station who place the picked article into a bin. The bin is moved by conveyors from the picking station to a packaging station. At the packaging station, a packer is notified via a computer terminal of the most appropriately-sized packaging for that particular article. The packer selects that appropriately-sized packaging from an array of standard sizes of packaging, assembles the packaging, removes the picked article from the bin, places the article in the assembled packaging, seals the packaging, and then places the packaging with the article inside it onto another conveyor which transfers the packaged article to a shipping station for shipment. Robots are also being utilized in some facilities to package articles in custom-sized boxes. In other words, the robots select the most appropriately-sized box, will assemble the box, place the article to be shipped into the same, seal the box, and then send the packaged article to the shipping station for shipment to a customer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above-described situations can result in a relatively-small article being enclosed in a substantially much larger box, envelope, or other packaging than the article warrants. This occurs even though an algorithm informed the packer or the robot of the most-appropriately-sized box of the standard size boxes for use with respect to a particular article. Because the packaged article is surrounded by a lot of empty space, the article may become damaged during shipment unless filler materials are inserted into the box, envelope, or other package to surround the article. The unnecessarily larger packaging and the quantity of filler materials required to ship smaller articles is simply a waste of resources. The extra packaging also results in a larger than necessary volume of garbage being generated, even if that garbage is disposed of at locations remote from the packaging facility, i.e., at the end-customer's home or business. Shipping larger than necessary packaging takes up more space that necessary in shipping and delivery vehicles. This, in turn, requires that more shipping and delivery vehicles be utilized to deliver packages than would otherwise be needed if article-customized packaging was used instead of standard-sized packaging. Using larger than necessary packaging utilizes more space in each delivery vehicle than if article-customized packaging was used. Since more space is required in the vehicles to ship a fixed number of packages, more shipping and delivery vehicles are needed to deliver the fixed number of packages. This not only affects bottom lines but it is also bad for the environment to have an unnecessary number of vehicles leaving a carbon footprint.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to the above-mentioned issues, many conventionally-used packaging systems utilize packaging materials comprised of more than one material. The packaging materials are typically not fully recyclable or are expensive to separate and recycle. This is also bad for the bottom line and may be bad for the environment.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure is directed to a system, apparatus, and method for forming article-size-appropriate packaging on demand and in real time. In one embodiment, the present disclosure is further directed to a system, apparatus, and method of forming packaging on material utilizing a fully recyclable packaging material. The fully recyclable packaging material is fabricated from a single type of material and therefore does not require separation into various streams during recycling operations. It will be understood that in other instances, the packaging material utilized in the system and apparatus may be only partially recyclable or is non-recyclable. The system, apparatus, and method disclosed herein therefore reduce overall costs for packaging dissimilar articles at a packaging and shipping facility, reduce storage space required at the facility to store large numbers of standard size boxes and packages, reduce the need for filler materials to be introduced into the packaging, and reduce the complexity of recycling the packaging once delivery of the article is completed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A system, apparatus, and method for automatically packaging one or more articles is disclosed. The system, apparatus, and method processes incoming articles having different and/or similar shapes and in random orientations for packaging.

shaped and sized articles in customized packaging for shipment to customers. In one embodiment, the packaging material utilized to produce the customized packaging is fully recyclable. In other embodiments, the packaging material utilized to produce the customized packaging is partially recyclable. In yet other embodiments, the packaging material utilized to produce the customized packaging is not recyclable.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In particular, the disclosed system <b>10</b> and method are useful for packaging a variety of dissimilar articles in settings such as online retail fulfillment centers and other packaging and shipping facilities. (It will be understood that the system <b>10</b> and method may also be used for packaging substantially identical articles, should that be desired.)</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">It should be noted that the figures do not necessarily represent the component parts of system <b>10</b> to scale. Additionally, many component parts of system <b>10</b> are not illustrated in the attached figures for clarify of illustration but a person of ordinary skill in the art will realize that these non-illustrated or omitted components are needed to actuate and operate system <b>10</b>. For example, wiring and drive which power the various components may be only partially illustrated in the drawings or may be completely omitted from the drawings.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a diagrammatic side elevation view of a first embodiment of a system in accordance with the present disclosure, generally indicated at <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a diagrammatic top plan view of part of system <b>10</b> plus an additional component not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. System <b>10</b> includes a first conveyor <b>12</b> and a second conveyor <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). First conveyor <b>12</b> is configured to move a plurality of differently shaped and sized articles <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, and <b>22</b> from a picking station (not shown) in the packaging and shipping facility towards a packaging station <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) therein. Packaging station <b>24</b> may also be referred to as a &#x201c;load zone&#x201d;. The movement of first conveyor <b>12</b> is in a first direction, as indicated by arrow &#x201c;A&#x201d;. As will be later described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in the packaging station <b>24</b> the individual articles <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> will be enclosed in packaging which is customized as closely as reasonably possible to suit the three dimensional characteristics of that particular article. The packaging will be customized in real time to suit the dimensions and configuration of each individual article <b>16</b>-<b>22</b>. Once the customized packaging is formed in real time and an individual article has been enclosed in its customized packaging, the packaged article is moved onto the second conveyor <b>14</b>. The second conveyor <b>14</b> is a discharge conveyor of the system <b>10</b> which removes the packaged article in the direction &#x201c;A&#x201d; from the packaging station <b>24</b> towards a shipping station (not shown) of the facility. At the shipping station the packaged article is shipped out to a customer who ordered the article online. It will be understood that second conveyor <b>14</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> as being aligned with first conveyor <b>12</b> such that movement towards the packaging station <b>24</b> and away from the packaging station is in the same direction &#x201c;A&#x201d;. However, in other embodiments, second conveyor <b>14</b> may intersect the direction &#x201c;A&#x201d; and move the packaged article away from packaging station <b>24</b> at different direction from how the article was originally moved toward the packaging station <b>24</b>. For example, if the second conveyor <b>14</b> is oriented at ninety degrees to first conveyor <b>12</b> then the direction of movement of the packaged article away from packing station <b>24</b> will be in a direction at ninety degrees to the direction &#x201c;A&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It should be noted with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> that the articles <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> moving along first conveyor <b>12</b> are not only differently shaped and sized, but may also be placed at random different orientations on the first conveyor <b>12</b>. The presently-disclosed system <b>10</b> and method do not require that the articles <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> be rearranged into a specifically-required orientation on first conveyor <b>12</b> in order to be packaged. However, a repositioning or reorienting device or mechanism may be utilized as part of system <b>10</b> to change the orientation of any particular article <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> on first conveyor <b>12</b> or to otherwise manipulate any article <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> on first conveyor <b>12</b> as needed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an exemplary repositioning or reorienting device or mechanism in the form of a robotic arm <b>13</b> being used to adjust a position of article <b>16</b> on first conveyor <b>12</b>. In other embodiments, a repositioning or reorienting device or mechanism may include, but is not limited to, a vibrating belt, static or actuating rods and rails, and/or a drop in elevation such as a step down. It will be understood that robotic arm <b>13</b> is only one way of orienting and/or manipulating articles <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> as needed, and any suitable way or mechanism may be utilized in system <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, the orienting of the article <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> may be integrated to the system <b>10</b> or may be a stand-alone solution using its own logic and devices independent of the primary packaging machine <b>10</b>. Vision devices and/or verification sensors or scanners (not shown) may also be provided in system <b>10</b> to confirm that the repositioning or reorienting device or mechanism <b>13</b> has successfully accomplished the needed change in orientation of the article <b>16</b>-<b>22</b>. Some or all of the vision devices and/or verification sensors or scanners may be omitted in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">System <b>10</b> further includes a detecting device <b>26</b> which is utilized to scan articles <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> as they move on first conveyor <b>12</b> in the direction &#x201c;A&#x201d;.

No. 63/111,544, filed Nov. 9, 2020 entitled &#x201c;Paper-Based Packaging System&#x201d;, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 63/153,918, filed Feb. 25, 2021 entitled &#x201c;Packaging Material with Expanding Layer&#x201d;; and U.S. application Ser. No. 17/514,005 filed Oct. 29, 2021 entitled &#x201c;Packaging Material With Expanding Layer And Packaging Final package Formed Therewith&#x201d;. The entire disclosures of these three patent applications are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Before discussing the operation of system <b>10</b> in the real time packaging of article <b>16</b>, the packaging material <b>30</b> will be discussed in some detail, reference being had to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 63/153,918 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/514,005 referred to above. Packaging material <b>30</b> is comprised of one or more expandable layers which are preferably formed from materials that are entirely recyclable, such as paper. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A through <b>3</b>H</figref> show packaging material <b>30</b> comprised of two layers <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> that are adhered to one another. It should be understood, however, that additional layers may be utilized in packaging material <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> show a portion of an exemplary first layer, or substrate layer <b>100</b> utilized in packaging material <b>30</b>. First layer <b>100</b> is comprised of paper that may be reduced in length by a process of creping or folding the paper to form multiple wrinkles or multiple folds, e.g. Z-shaped wrinkles or folds <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, which extend substantially normal to side edges of the first layer <b>100</b>. Creping or folding first layer <b>100</b> will initially reduce the overall length of the first layer <b>100</b> from a length &#x201c;L<b>1</b>&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>) to a length &#x201c;L&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>). As will be described later herein, during use of packaging material <b>30</b>, first layer <b>100</b> will be selectively expanded to its original, unwrinkled or unfolded length &#x201c;L<b>1</b>&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>). First layer <b>100</b> is capable of expanding longitudinally when one end of the first layer <b>100</b> is pulled in a first direction &#x201c;B&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) that is normal to the wrinkles or folds <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. When first layer <b>100</b> is pulled in the direction &#x201c;B&#x201d;, the multiple wrinkles or folds <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> unfold, thereby lengthening the first layer <b>100</b> from its wrinkled or folded length &#x201c;L<b>1</b>&#x201d; and returning first layer <b>100</b> to a generally unwrinkled or unfolded condition and generally to its original length &#x201c;L&#x201d;. First layer <b>100</b> once expanded will form an outside surface of a final package that will ultimately be produced using packaging material <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one embodiment, the first layer <b>100</b> may be formed of paper so that the packaging material formed therewith is paper-recyclable but in other embodiments the first layer may not be recyclable or may only be partially recyclable. The width of first layer <b>100</b> is indicated as &#x201c;W&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>C and <b>3</b>D</figref> and this width &#x201c;W&#x201d; remains unchanged whether packaging material <b>30</b> is in a folded condition or an expanded condition. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> show that a row of perforations <b>106</b>, i.e., lines of weakness, may be formed a short distance inwardly from a first side edge of first layer <b>100</b>. Alternatively, or additionally, another line of weakness may be formed a short distance inwardly from a second side edge of first layer <b>100</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref>, the first end of first layer <b>100</b> aligns with a first end <b>30</b><i>a </i>of a desired length of packaging material <b>30</b>. The first side edge of first layer <b>100</b> aligns with a first side edge <b>30</b><i>b </i>of packaging material <b>30</b>. The second side edge of first layer <b>100</b> aligns with a second side edge <b>30</b><i>c </i>of packaging material <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The packaging material <b>30</b> further includes a second layer <b>200</b> in the form of a cut-patterned layer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>C and <b>3</b>D</figref>). Second layer <b>200</b> preferably is formed of paper so that it too is fully recyclable but in other embodiments second layer may not be recyclable or may only be partially recyclable. Second layer <b>200</b> includes a plurality of cuts <b>202</b> arranged in any suitable pattern. A lower surface of second layer <b>200</b> is adhered to first layer <b>100</b>. In particular, the lower surface of second layer <b>200</b> may be spot-adhered to an upper surface of first layer <b>100</b>. For example, adhesive may secure first and second layers <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> to one another along regions proximate one or more wrinkles or folds <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> in first layer <b>100</b>. Second layer <b>200</b> is generally of the same length &#x201c;L&#x201d; as the first layer <b>100</b> when first layer is in the creped or folded condition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>), i.e., wrinkled or folded condition. The width of second layer <b>200</b> is indicated by the reference character &#x201c;W<b>1</b>&#x201d; when in an unexpanded condition as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>. As is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>C and <b>3</b>D</figref>, the width &#x201c;W<b>1</b>&#x201d; of second layer <b>200</b> is smaller than the width &#x201c;W&#x201d; of first layer <b>100</b>. As a result, a region <b>100</b><i>a </i>of first layer <b>100</b> is left on either side of second layer <b>200</b>. The region <b>100</b><i>a </i>proximate first side edge <b>30</b><i>b </i>of first layer <b>100</b> includes the row of perforations <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Second layer <b>200</b> is capable of being pulled or expanded in at least a first direction (e.g., two planes such as X, Y, or X and Y) that is effective to cause the second layer <b>200</b> to expand into at least one plane as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>H</figref>. The expansion of first layer <b>100</b> causes the expansion in the second layer <b>200</b>. Stated differently, first layer <b>100</b> is expandable in a horizontal plane (X or Y) and second layer <b>200</b> is expandable in the horizontal plane (X or Y), and also in a vertical plane (Z-direction) that is oriented substantially at right angles to the horizontal plane. When first layer <b>100</b> expands, second layer <b>200</b> tends to contract in a second direction (X or Y), which may include the direction normal to the direction in which the first layer <b>100</b> is pulled or extended. For example, when the first layer <b>100</b> expands and causes an expansion in second layer <b>200</b>, the width of second layer <b>200</b> may decrease to a width &#x201c;W<b>2</b>&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In order to compensate for the contraction in a particular direction discussed above, the second layer <b>200</b> may initially be made longer and/or wider based on the direction in which the first layer <b>100</b> is expandable and therefore the direction in which second layer <b>200</b> will tend to contract. For example, second width <b>200</b> is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> as being of a width &#x201c;W<b>1</b>&#x201d; but second layer <b>200</b> is actually wider than the width &#x201c;W<b>1</b>&#x201d;. The extra width is accommodated in one or more wrinkles or folds <b>204</b>. Wrinkles or folds <b>204</b> are aligned with the direction of unroll of packaging material <b>30</b> and will unfold as second layer <b>200</b> expands, thereby compensating for a reduction in the width thereof. During unfolding of the wrinkles or folds <b>204</b> the second layer <b>200</b> maintains the attached to first layer <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref> shows that when first layer <b>100</b> and the second layer <b>200</b> are fully expanded, first layer <b>100</b> is of a width &#x201c;W&#x201d; and the unfolded and expanded second layer <b>200</b> remains of the width &#x201c;W<b>1</b>&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Preferably in such instances where second layer <b>100</b> is selected in a wider width than &#x201c;W<b>1</b>&#x201d;, when second layer <b>200</b> is expanded, the reduced width of the expanded second layer <b>200</b> will tend to leave regions <b>100</b><i>a </i>on either side of the second layer <b>100</b> uncovered, and the row of perforations <b>106</b> will also not be covered by second layer <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>G and <b>3</b>H</figref>, when first layer <b>100</b> and second layer <b>200</b> are in a non-expanded condition (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>G</figref>), the overall thickness of the packaging material <b>30</b> is a height &#x201c;H&#x201d;. When the packaging material <b>30</b> is expanded in the direction indicated by arrow &#x201c;B&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>), the length of first layer <b>100</b> increases to length &#x201c;L<b>1</b>&#x201d;. Similarly, the length of second layer <b>200</b> increases to the length &#x201c;L<b>1</b>&#x201d;. The expansion of second layer <b>200</b> in an X or Y direction with first layer <b>100</b> will simultaneously cause expansion of the second layer <b>200</b> in the Z-direction. Expansion in the Z-direction will result in the overall height or thickness of the second layer <b>200</b> increasing, and therefore packaging material <b>30</b> increases to a height &#x201c;H<b>1</b>&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>H</figref>).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As second layer <b>200</b> expands in the Z-direction, the cuts <b>202</b> in second layer <b>200</b> will tend to open up and fill with air, and the expanded cut-patterned layer <b>200</b> thereby creates structural strength in the packaging material <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The difference between packaging material source <b>31</b> and packaging material source <b>30</b> is that the roll stock <b>31</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is pre-fabricated to include the first layer <b>100</b> and second layer which are adhered to one another as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>C through <b>3</b>H</figref>. The packaging material source <b>131</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> includes roll stock <b>131</b><i>a </i>that is comprised entirely of first layer <b>100</b> and roll stock <b>131</b><i>b </i>that is comprised entirely of second layer <b>200</b>. The roll stock <b>131</b><i>a</i>, <b>131</b><i>b </i>are arranged so that first layer <b>100</b> is fed from roll stock <b>131</b><i>a </i>into assembly and laminating mechanism <b>131</b><i>c </i>and second layer <b>200</b> is fed from roll stock <b>131</b><i>b </i>and into assembly and laminating mechanism <b>131</b><i>c</i>. In the assembly and laminating mechanism <b>131</b><i>c</i>, the first and second layers <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> are engaged with one another to form packaging material <b>30</b> which exits mechanism <b>131</b><i>c </i>and is put into use in system <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>4</b> through <b>11</b></figref>, a method of using system <b>10</b> to custom package an article <b>16</b> will be discussed in greater detail. It will be understood that the method applies equally to the system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows article <b>16</b> being moved in direction &#x201c;A&#x201d; by first conveyor <b>12</b> towards packaging station <b>24</b> of system <b>10</b> and towards a field of view of detecting device <b>26</b>. As article <b>16</b> moves with first conveyor <b>12</b> into the field of view of detecting device <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>4</b></figref>), the detecting device <b>26</b> scans article <b>16</b> to gather data about the external appearance of article <b>16</b>. For example, detecting device <b>26</b> may measure the length, width, and height of article <b>16</b>. Detecting device <b>26</b> will communicate the detected measurement data to PLC <b>27</b>. Programming provided in PLC <b>27</b> will calculate the required length of packaging material <b>30</b> to form customized packaging for article <b>16</b>. In other words, if article <b>16</b> is detected to be relatively small then a relatively small length of packaging material <b>30</b> will be required to form customized packaging for the article. If the article <b>16</b> is detected to be relatively large, then a relatively long length of packaging material <b>30</b> will be required to form customized packaging for the article.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">System <b>10</b> includes a tensioning mechanism which is operatively engaged with the packaging material <b>30</b> and is actuated to apply tension to a length of the packaging material <b>30</b> proximate the packaging station <b>24</b> and move the packaging material <b>30</b> from an unexpanded condition (such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>G</figref>) to an expended condition (such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>H</figref>). The tensioning mechanism illustrated as being used in system <b>10</b> is gripper mechanism <b>32</b> which is operatively engaged with PLC <b>27</b> and is controlled thereby. PLC <b>27</b> signals gripper mechanism <b>32</b> to extend and grasp a first end <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the packaging material <b>30</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>4</b></figref>) and then move in the direction indicated by arrow &#x201c;C&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) to unwind a required length of the packaging material from the packaging material source <b>31</b>. The length of packaging material <b>30</b> unwound from packaging material source <b>31</b> is the required length for the particularly shaped and sized article <b>16</b> as calculated by the programming of the PLC <b>27</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">It should be noted that the packaging material <b>30</b> of roll stock <b>31</b> is in a flat and unexpanded condition (such as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>C and <b>3</b>G</figref>). In other words, the first layer <b>100</b> is in a folded condition and the second layer <b>200</b> is flat and not expanded in the Z-direction. Additionally, the overall height (i.e., thickness) of the packaging material <b>30</b> is of the height &#x201c;H&#x201d; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>G</figref>. As gripper mechanism <b>32</b> begins to move in the direction &#x201c;C&#x201d;, as illustrated in in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, roll stock <b>31</b> will rotate about the axis &#x201c;X<b>1</b>&#x201d; and will begin to unroll the specific required length of packaging material <b>30</b> therefrom as determined by PLC <b>27</b> from the measurement data received from detecting device <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As mentioned above, the packaging material <b>30</b> is initially in a flat, unexpanded condition as it is unrolled from roll stock <b>31</b> and tension (i.e., pulling force) is applied to the packaging material <b>30</b> by gripper mechanism <b>32</b>. The application of tension causes first layer <b>100</b> of packaging material <b>30</b> to expand in a horizontal plane and in a longitudinal direction as gripper mechanism <b>32</b> moves in the direction &#x201c;C&#x201d;. The expansion of first layer <b>100</b> in the horizontal plane causes second layer <b>200</b> to expand in the same horizontal plane and to simultaneously expand in the Z-direction.

However, the manner of expansion of layers <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> will be based on the arrangement of the wrinkles or folds <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> in first layer <b>100</b> and therefore the direction in which expansion of first layer <b>100</b> is possible. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A through <b>3</b>H</figref> shows wrinkles or folds <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> in first layer <b>100</b> arranged to permit longitudinal expansion of first layer <b>100</b>. The expansion of first layer <b>100</b> may simply occur through the application of tension to packaging material <b>30</b> based on the pulling motion applied to packaging material by gripping mechanism <b>32</b> in unwinding the length of the packaging material <b>30</b> from the packaging material source <b>31</b>. The tension applied as gripping mechanism <b>32</b> unwinds the packaging material <b>30</b> will cause longitudinal expansion of first layer <b>100</b> in a manner similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B through <b>3</b>D</figref>. Expansion of first layer <b>100</b> will, in turn, cause the second layer <b>200</b> to expand longitudinally and thereby second layer <b>200</b> will expand in the Z-direction as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>D and <b>3</b>H</figref>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In other embodiments (not illustrated herein) instead of tension applied by gripper mechanism <b>32</b> causing expansion of packaging material, the PLC may control a powered unwind of roll <b>31</b> and an air bladder in a core of the material roll <b>31</b> may power the unwind and may or may not be synched to the gripping mechanism <b>32</b> to work together to unwind the packaging material <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In other embodiments (not illustrated herein) instead of the tension applied by gripper mechanism <b>32</b> causing expansion through unwinding of the packaging material <b>30</b> from the packaging material source <b>31</b> being the force that expands first layer <b>100</b>, PLC <b>27</b> may temporarily halt rotation of packaging material source <b>31</b> after the desired length of packaging material for article <b>16</b> has been unwound. PLC <b>27</b> may signal gripper mechanism <b>32</b> to continue to move in the direction &#x201c;C&#x201d; and this continued movement of gripper mechanism <b>32</b> away from the packaging material source <b>31</b> will cause first layer <b>100</b> to expand longitudinally. In other embodiments, the gripping mechanism <b>32</b> may be synched to travel slightly faster than the unwinding of the material roll <b>32</b> in order to cause the tension needed to expand the first layer. As first layer <b>100</b> expands longitudinally, second layer <b>200</b> will expand longitudinally and as it does so, second layer <b>200</b> will also expand in the Z-direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>3</b>H</figref>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In yet other embodiments (not illustrated herein) when the desired length of packaging material <b>30</b> has been unwound from packaging material source <b>31</b>, the jaws of an auxiliary gripper mechanism (not shown) may be brought into engagement with the upper and lower surfaces of the packaging material <b>30</b> a distance longitudinally away from gripper mechanism <b>32</b> and in a location between the packaging material source <b>31</b> and gripper mechanism <b>32</b>. The jaws of the auxiliary gripper mechanism may clampingly engage the packaging material therebetween. One or both of the gripper mechanism <b>32</b> and the auxiliary gripper mechanism may then be moved away from the other, thereby increasing the longitudinal distance between the two gripper mechanisms. The tension applied by the two gripper mechanisms moving apart from one another will cause the first layer <b>100</b> of the packaging material <b>100</b> to expand longitudinally, thereby expanding the second layer longitudinally, and thereby causing the second layer <b>200</b> to expand in the Z-direction.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">It will be understood that if the wrinkles or folds <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> in first layer <b>100</b> are arranged parallel to the first side edge <b>30</b><i>b </i>and second side edge <b>30</b><i>c </i>of the packaging material <b>30</b> then expansion aligned with a transverse axis of the packaging material <b>30</b> is possible but expansion in a longitudinal direction will not be possible. The mechanisms for expanding the first layer as described above will not be able to cause lateral expansion of the first layer. Consequently, when the first layer is differently folded, different expansion mechanisms are required in the system <b>10</b>. For example, a pair of auxiliary gripping mechanisms may be moved into engagement with the first side edge <b>30</b><i>b </i>and second side edge <b>30</b><i>c </i>of the packaging material <b>30</b>. One or both of the pair of auxiliary gripping mechanisms may be moved away from the other of the pair, thereby causing the first layer <b>100</b> of the packaging material <b>30</b> to expand transversely. The transverse expansion of the first layer <b>100</b> will cause an expansion of the second layer <b>200</b> in the transverse direction, and subsequent expansion of the second layer <b>200</b> in the Z-direction.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">It will further be understood that if there are more than just the first layer <b>100</b> and second layer <b>200</b> present in the packaging material <b>30</b>, then appropriate tensioning, halting of rotation of the packaging material source <b>31</b> and continued movement of the gripper mechanism <b>32</b>, and the use of one or more auxiliary gripping mechanisms (acting to cause longitudinal expansion and/or lateral expansion of packaging material) may be utilized to expand the multiple layers of the packaging material appropriately.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In one aspect, the packaging material <b>30</b> will include a third layer that is adhered to a surface of the second layer <b>200</b> opposite to the surface of the second layer <b>200</b> that is adhered to the first layer <b>100</b>. The third layer will be substantially identically configured to the first layer <b>100</b> and will expand in a similar manner.
