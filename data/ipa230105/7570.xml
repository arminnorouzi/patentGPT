In the IEEE 802.11a standard, only a bandwidth of 20 megahertzes (MHz) is supported, and the bandwidth continuously increases in a subsequent standard evolution process. The 802.11n standard supports a maximum bandwidth of 40 MHz, the 802.11ac/ax standard supports a maximum bandwidth of 160 MHz, and the 802.11be standard supports a maximum bandwidth of 320 MHz.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An access point (AP) device may establish a basic service set (BSS), and indicate a channel bandwidth and location of the BSS to a station (STA).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a solution in the conventional technology, with respect to an extended bandwidth, for example, a bandwidth higher than 160 MHz, when a channel bandwidth of a BSS is configured for an extremely high throughput (EHT) STA, the EHT STA needs to read a very high throughput (VHT) operation element, a high throughput (HT) operation element and an EHT operation element, or a high efficiency (HE) operation element and an EHT operation element that is/are delivered by an AP. However, a VHT STA or HE STA reads an operating mode notification element or an Operating Mode Notification frame to ignore a bandwidth indication of the VHT operation element or the HE operation element and update a channel bandwidth configuration of the BSS. Therefore, the conventional technology requires that the EHT STA should ignore the Operating Mode Notification frame. However, the previous protocol specifies that a legacy STA (including an HT STA, a VHT STA, or an HE STA) and a new generation STA (EHT STA) can both read the Operating Mode Notification frame. In other words, to implement the foregoing manner in the conventional technology, usage of the Operating Mode Notification frame in the previous protocol needs to be changed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This application provides a channel bandwidth configuration method and a device to reduce signaling overheads to some extent.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To achieve the foregoing objective, the following technical solutions are used in this application.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a channel bandwidth configuration method.

For example, a plurality of processing units mean two or more processing units. A plurality of systems mean two or more systems.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">To help a person skilled in the art better understand the technical solutions of this application, the related background is briefly described first.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">(1) Channel Bonding</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">A channel bandwidth used in the 802.11a and 802.11g standards is 20 MHz. Standards starting from 802.11n support bonding of two adjacent 20 MHz channels, to achieve a channel bandwidth of 40 MHz and increase a transmission rate. Starting from 802.11ac, existing protocols further support bonding of non-overlapping and non-contiguous channels, to achieve a larger channel bandwidth. For example, to achieve a channel bandwidth of 160 MHz, two contiguous channels whose channel bandwidths are 80 MHz may be bonded, or two non-contiguous channels whose bandwidths are 80 MHz may be bonded. This bonding manner may be indicated as 80+80 MHz. In other words, given a channel bandwidth of 160 MHz, if the channel bandwidth is continuous 160 MHz, the channel bandwidth may be directly indicated as 160 MHz. If the channel bandwidth is discontinuous, that is, if the channel bandwidth is generated by bonding two non-contiguous channels, the channel bandwidth is indicated as 80+80 MHz. Manners of indicating other possible channel bandwidths are similar to the manner in the foregoing example, and are not exhaustively illustrated herein.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">As specified in the 802.11 standard, one of two bonded channels is a primary channel, and the other one is a secondary channel. A difference between the primary channel and the secondary channel lies in that the primary channel carries a management frame. Optionally, the management frame may be a beacon frame.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">A channel whose channel bandwidth is 160 MHz is used as an example. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in the channel, a channel whose channel bandwidth is 20 MHz needs to be selected as a primary channel for carrying a management frame. In this example, the channel carrying the management frame is referred to as a primary 20 MHz channel, an 80 MHz channel to which the primary 20 MHz channel belongs is referred to as a primary 80 MHz channel, and another channel whose bandwidth is 80 MHz in the 160 MHz channel is referred to as a secondary 80 MHz channel. In the primary 80 MHz channel, a 40 MHz channel to which the primary 20 MHz channel belongs is referred to as a primary 40 MHz channel, and another 40 MHz channel is a secondary 40 MHz channel. In the primary 40 MHz channel, a 20 MHz channel other than the primary 20 MHz channel is referred to as secondary 20 MHz.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">(2) Channel Puncturing</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">The channel bandwidth is becoming larger. For example, a maximum of 160 MHz is supported in the 802.11ax standard. However, in actual deployment, it is difficult to achieve complete 160 MHz due to interference or other reasons. Therefore, a puncture mode is proposed in 802.11ax. Specifically, a channel puncturing technology using a channel bandwidth of 20 MHz as a granularity is used to alleviate the problem. Likewise, a BSS whose channel bandwidth is 320 MHz is used as an example. In the puncture mode, a channel whose channel bandwidth is 20 MHz in the BSS is a punctured channel. Apart from the punctured channel, remaining 300 MHz spectrum resources can still be used for data transmission. Therefore, an overall throughput of the BSS is improved.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">(3) Backward Compatibility</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">It may be understood that a legacy STA cannot recognize signaling of a new protocol, but a new STA can recognize signaling of a previous protocol. In addition, a legacy AP cannot send signaling of the new protocol, but a new AP can send signaling of the previous protocol.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The following describes in detail a meaning of backward compatibility with reference to each standard. Table 1 shows each protocol version and related parameters corresponding to the protocol version.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="91pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Protocol</entry><entry>Publication</entry><entry>Frequency</entry><entry>Channel bandwidth</entry><entry>Data rate</entry></row><row><entry>version</entry><entry>time</entry><entry>(GHz)</entry><entry>(MHz)</entry><entry>(Mbit/s)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="91pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>802,11</entry><entry>1997</entry><entry>2.4</entry><entry>20</entry><entry>&#x2009;1 and 2</entry></row><row><entry>802.11b</entry><entry>1999</entry><entry>2.4</entry><entry>20</entry><entry>5.5 and 11</entry></row><row><entry>802.11a</entry><entry>1999</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>20</entry><entry>6 to 54</entry></row><row><entry>802.11g</entry><entry>2003</entry><entry>2.4</entry><entry>20</entry><entry>1 to 54</entry></row><row><entry>802.11n</entry><entry>2009</entry><entry>&#x2003;&#x2009;2.4 and 5</entry><entry>20 and 40</entry><entry>&#x2002;6 to 600</entry></row><row><entry>802.11ac</entry><entry>2016</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>20, 40, 80, 160, and 80 + 80</entry><entry>&#x2003;6 to 6933</entry></row><row><entry>(VHT)</entry></row><row><entry>802.11ax</entry><entry>2019</entry><entry>2.4, 5, and 6</entry><entry>20, 40, 80, 160, and 80 + 80;</entry><entry>&#x2003;&#x2002;&#x2009;6 to 9607.8</entry></row><row><entry>(HE)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry>and supporting a specific</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>preamble puncture mode</entry></row><row><entry>802.11be</entry><entry/><entry>2.4, 5, and 6</entry><entry>20, 40, 80, 160, 80 + 80,</entry></row><row><entry>(EHT)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry>320, and 160 + 160; and</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>supporting channel</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>puncturing</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0155" num="0153">Refer to Table 1. The legacy STA described above refers to &#x201c;previous&#x201d; in a relative sense. To be specific, depending on the publication time of the standard, for a STA supporting the 802.11ax protocol (HE STA for short), a STA supporting 802.11ac (VHT STA for short) and a STA supporting the 802.11n protocol (HT STA for short) are legacy STAs; and conversely, for a VHT STA and the like, an HE STA is a new STA.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0154">An existing protocol specifies that a legacy STA can only recognize signaling of a previous protocol, but cannot recognize signaling of a new protocol. For example, a VHT STA can only recognize signaling of the 802.11ac protocol and earlier versions, such as an HT operation element and a VHT operation element, but cannot recognize signaling of 802.11ax and later versions, such as an HE operation element and an EHT operation element.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0155">A new STA can recognize signaling of a previous protocol. For example, an EHT STA can recognize signaling of 802.11ac and earlier versions, including signaling of protocols such as 802.11n, 802.11ax, and 802.11be, for example, the HT operation element, the VHT operation element, the HE operation element, and the EHT operation element.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0156">(4) Manner of Configuring the BSS for a STA</p><p id="p-0159" num="0157">The following briefly describes a manner of configuring the BSS for different types of STAs.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0158">a. HT Operation Element and a Manner in which an HT STA Obtains Channel Bandwidth Information of the BSS</p><p id="p-0161" num="0159">Specifically, the HT operation element carries the channel bandwidth information of the BSS, and the HT STA may obtain the channel bandwidth information of the BSS by reading the HT operation element.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0160">For example, a schematic diagram of a format of the HT operation element is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The HT operation element carries a primary channel field, and the field is used to indicate a location of a primary 20 MHz channel. The Primary Channel field includes primary channel information, and specifically, channel information of the primary 20 MHz channel. For example, the channel information may be identification information of the primary 20 MHz channel. For example, the identification information may be a channel index number or a number.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0161">For example, the HT operation element further carries an HT operation information field used to indicate the channel bandwidth information of the BSS. For example, the HT Operation Information field carries a secondary channel offset (SCO) field used to indicate whether a secondary channel exists and a location of the secondary channel. For example, when a value of the Secondary Channel Offset field is 1, it indicates that a secondary 20 MHz channel is above the primary 20 MHz channel, that is, a frequency of the secondary 20 MHz channel is higher than a frequency of the primary 20 MHz channel; or when a value of the Secondary Channel Offset field is 3, it indicates that a secondary 20 MHz channel is below the primary 20 MHz channel, that is, a frequency of the secondary 20 MHz channel is lower than a frequency of the primary 20 MHz channel. When a value of the Secondary Channel Offset field is 0, it indicates that no secondary 20 MHz channel exists. Optionally, the HT Operation Information further carries other fields, for example, a reserved field. For meanings of the other fields, refer to definitions in an existing standard. Details are not described in this application.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0162">Still refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The HT operation element further carries fields such as an element identifier (Element ID) field, a length field, and a basic HT modulation and coding set (Basic HT-MCS Set).

Optionally, the Operating Mode field may be carried in an Operating Mode Notification Element, or may be carried in an Operating Mode Notification frame. In other words, the Operating Mode field may be carried in an Operating Mode Notification Element in a management frame (for example, a beacon frame), or may be carried in a separately sent Operating Mode Notification frame.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0189">The following describes usage of the Operating Mode field by using a specific example. When the AP needs to change an operation parameter, for example, the channel bandwidth of the BSS, the AP may carry an Operating Mode Notification Element in a beacon frame to indicate a channel bandwidth update of the BSS. The Operating Mode Notification Element carries an Operating Mode field, and the Operating Mode field includes an updated channel bandwidth of the BSS. In another optional manner, the AP sends an Operating Mode Notification frame by broadcast, where the Operating Mode Notification frame carries an Operating Mode field, to indicate a channel bandwidth update of the BSS. The VHT STA, the HE STA, and the EHT STA may all obtain an updated operation parameter, for example, the channel bandwidth of the BSS, by reading the Operating Mode field. For example, the EHT STA is used as an example for description. The EHT STA may obtain the channel bandwidth information of the BSS by reading the EHT operation element in the beacon frame. For example, the channel bandwidth of the BSS is 320 MHz. If the beacon frame further carries the Operating Mode Notification Element, the EHT STA may further read the Operating Mode Notification Element to update the channel bandwidth information of the BSS. For example, the channel bandwidth is updated to 20 MHz.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0190">It should be noted that the standard specifies that the AP sends the corresponding Operating Mode field only when the AP needs to change the operation parameter.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0191">In the conventional technology, in a manner of configuring the channel bandwidth of the BSS for the EHT STA, the newly defined EHT operation element is used to indicate whether the channel bandwidth of the BSS is greater than 160 MHz or 80+80 MHz. In other words, in the conventional technology, for the BSS whose channel bandwidth is greater than 160 MHz or 80+80 MHz, the EHT STA may obtain the channel bandwidth configuration of the BSS by reading the newly defined EHT operation element. When the channel bandwidth of the BSS is less than or equal to 160 MHz or 80+80 MHz, the EHT STA may obtain the channel bandwidth configuration of the BSS by reading the HT operation element, the VHT operation element, or the HE operation element, that is, the EHT operation element is only used to indicate that the channel bandwidth is greater than 160 MHz or 80+80 MHz.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0192">In the conventional technology, in presence of channel puncturing, the beacon frame carries the Operating Mode field, the HT operation element, the VHT operation element, the HE operation element, and the EHT operation element at the same time. The VHT STA and the HE STA ignore bandwidth indication information of the VHT operation element and the HE operation element based on the Operating Mode field, to obtain channel bandwidth configuration information of the BSS. However, the EHT STA ignores the Operating Mode field, and obtains the bandwidth configuration information of the BSS by reading the newly defined HT operation element, the VHT operation element, the HE operation element, and the EHT operation element.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0193">Definitely, to configure the channel bandwidth of the BSS for the EHT STA, the conventional technology requires the EHT STA to ignore the Operating Mode field. Therefore, conventional usage of the Operating Mode field needs to be changed, that is, in presence of channel puncturing, it is required that the beacon frame should always carry the Operating Mode field to indicate the channel bandwidth configuration information to the VHT STA or HE STA. This causes an increase in signaling overheads.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0194">This application provides a channel bandwidth configuration method, to resolve the foregoing disadvantage in the conventional technology.

The puncture bitmap includes at least one bit, and each bit corresponds to a channel whose channel bandwidth is 20 MHz in the channel. In this application, each channel whose bandwidth is 20 MHz in the channel bandwidth may be referred to as a channel element. As described above, each punctured channel in the channel bandwidth uses a 20 MHz bandwidth as a granularity. In this embodiment, a bit location corresponding to a punctured channel is a preset value, for example, 0, used to indicate that the channel element is a punctured channel. For example, if the channel bandwidth is 40 MHz or 80 MHz, a length of the puncture bitmap is 1 byte; if the channel bandwidth is 160 MHz or 80+80 MHz, a length of the puncture bitmap is 2 bytes; or if the channel bandwidth is 320 MHz or 160+160 MHz, a length of the puncture bitmap is 4 bytes. A specific identification manner is described in the following embodiment.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0277">In another possible implementation, the puncture information may be a puncture mode or a puncture pattern.

A light gray shaded part indicates that a channel element is unpunctured or punctured.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0285">The foregoing describes a structure and an indication manner of the EHT operation element newly defined in this application. Specific usage of the EHT operation element is described in detail by using an example in the following embodiment.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0286">In a possible implementation, when the BSS is established in the 5 GHz frequency band, that is, when the EHT STA receives, in the 5 GHz frequency band, the beacon frame carrying the EHT operation element, the EHT STA may further receive the HT operation element in the beacon frame, and may obtain channel information of the primary 20 MHz channel by reading a Primary Channel field (for a related concept, refer to the foregoing description) carried in the HT operation element, for example, identification information of primary 20 MHz channel, for example, an index number or a channel number of the primary 20 MHz channel. In this way, a specific location of the channel of the BSS on a frequency domain resource is determined with reference to the obtained channel bandwidth information of the BSS.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0287">In another possible implementation, when the BSS is established in the 6 GHz frequency band, that is, when the EHT STA receives, in the 6 GHz frequency band, the management frame carrying the EHT operation element, because the HT operation element is absent from 6 GHz, the EHT STA may receive the HE operation element in the management frame, and may obtain channel information of the primary 20 MHz channel by reading a Primary Channel field (for a related concept, refer to the foregoing description) carried in the HE operation element, for example, identification information of primary 20 MHz, for example, an index number or a channel number of the primary 20 MHz channel. In this way, a specific location of the channel of the BSS on a frequency domain resource is determined with reference to the obtained channel bandwidth information of the BSS.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0288">In still another possible implementation, if the AP needs to change at least one of a channel bandwidth, a maximum quantity of receivable spatial streams, and a low-density parity-check code (LDPC) preference indication of the AP, the AP may add an Operating Mode Notification Element (for a related concept, refer to the foregoing description) to the beacon frame. The EHT STA may obtain an updated channel bandwidth configuration of the BSS by reading the Operating Mode Notification Element. A specific update manner is described in the following embodiment.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0289">In still another possible implementation, if the channel bandwidth of the BSS is 80+80 MHz, 160+160 MHz, or the like and is formed by bonding two non-contiguous channels, optionally, the two channels may be located in different frequency bands. For example, one channel is located in the 5 GHz frequency band, and the other channel is located in the 6 GHz frequency band. In this embodiment, the reserved field in the Control field may include indication information, for example, operating class present (OCP), used to indicate whether the EHT operation element carries an Operating Class field, or understandably, used to indicate whether the two channels are located in different frequency bands. For example, when OCP=1, it indicates that the EHT operation element carries the Operating Class field, that is, the two channels are located in different frequency bands, and the corresponding Operating Class field may include frequency band indication information used to indicate a frequency band in which a secondary 80 MHz channel or a secondary 160 MHz channel is located.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0290">In summary, the EHT STA may obtain the channel bandwidth configuration of the BSS by reading the EHT operation element without reading the VHT operation element. However, the VHT STA and the HE STA may obtain the channel bandwidth configuration of the BSS by reading the VHT operation element. Therefore, usage of the Operating Mode field is not affected, and the Operating Mode field may still be sent according to a specification in a previous protocol, that is, the Operating Mode field is sent only when an operation parameter changes, and the VHT STA, the HE STA, and the EHT STA may all read the Operating Mode field to update the channel bandwidth configuration of the BSS.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0291">The following describes in detail the technical solution of the embodiment in the scenario 1 by using several specific embodiments.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0292">Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> are examples of several different cases of the BSS.
