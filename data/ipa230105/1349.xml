Cost-effective and scalable technologies are being sought for carbon capture from emission sources to reduce anthropogenic CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions. Various carbon capture technologies, such as physical adsorption, chemical absorption, and membrane separation, have been widely investigated. Compared with other modes, membrane gas separation provides many inherent advantages, such as high energy efficiency, low capital investments, operational simplicity and flexibility to scale up, and is considered a very promising technology (e.g., N. Du et al., <i>Energy Environ. Sci., </i>5, 7306-7322, 2012).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Membrane separation relies on the difference in permeation rates of different gases traversing the membrane. Unfortunately, although polymeric membranes have been successfully commercialized since the 1980s, the separation performance is limited by an undesirable trade-off relationship between permeability (P) and selectivity (a). Thus, the separation performance is constrained by an upper limit, which has been illustrated empirically by Robeson (L. M. Robeson, <i>J. Membr. Sci., </i>320, 390-400, 2008) and theoretically by Freeman (B. D. Freeman, <i>Macromolecules, </i>32, 375-380, 1999). Ongoing research efforts have been directed to the design and preparation of nanoporous polymeric materials to overcome this limit by, for example, using thermally rearranged (TR) polymers, polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), and mixed-matrix membranes (MMM). However, such efforts have resulted in limited improvements in separation performance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Highly selective carbon dioxide separation from flue gas or other sources is a particularly challenging task. Chemical absorption methods that utilize, for example, ethanolamine for CO<sub>2 </sub>capture, require large amounts of energy to regenerate the adsorbent and release the CO<sub>2 </sub>gas. The development of a gas separation membrane that could efficiently separate carbon dioxide from other gases with substantial permeability and selectivity would be a significant advance in the field of gas separation technology.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to crosslinked polymer membranes that exhibit exceptional gas permeabilities and selectivities for separating gases, such as separating CO<sub>2 </sub>from other gas molecules, such as N<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>2</sub>. Hence, these polymer membranes have excellent potential for large-scale gas separations of commercial and environmental relevance. Aside from containing a multiplicity of crosslinked aromatic rings, the polymer membranes described herein are fluorinated and microporous. The micropores have a pore size of up to 2 nm, and may include ultramicropores having a size of less than 1 nm, or 0.1 nm to 1 nm, or no more than or less than 0.5 nm.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">More particularly, the crosslinked polymer is constructed of the following components: (i) an aromatic polymer containing a multiplicity of benzene rings; (ii) a multiplicity of fluorinated aromatic moieties; and (iii) a multiplicity of methylene (&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;) linkages; wherein, throughout the microporous membrane, at least two methylene linkages are attached to each fluorinated aromatic moiety, and each methylene linkage functions to connect the fluorinated aromatic moiety and a benzene ring on the aromatic polymer, thereby connecting each fluorinated aromatic moiety with at least two different benzene rings of the aromatic polymer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">More particularly, the crosslinked polymer is constructed of the following components: (i) an aromatic polymer containing a multiplicity of benzene rings; (ii) a multiplicity of fluorinated aromatic moieties, wherein each fluorinated aromatic moiety contains at least two separate methylene (&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;) linkages connected to benzene rings on the aromatic polymer. Throughout this disclosure, the structures of fluorinated aromatic moieties are depicted with methylene linkages as part of the fluorinated aromatic moieties.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method of producing the above described crosslinked polymer and membranes composed thereof. In the method, an aromatic polymer is reacted with a fluorinated aromatic molecule containing benzyl alcohol groups under conditions (e.g., in presence of a superacid) in which hydrogen atoms on aromatic rings of the aromatic polymer undergo dehydration with hydroxy groups of the fluorinated aromatic molecule via a dehydrative Friedel-Crafts reaction, thereby resulting in methylene linkages connecting the fluorinated aromatic moiety and aromatic rings (e.g., benzene rings) on the aromatic polymer. By this process, each fluorinated aromatic moiety is connected with at least two different aromatic rings of the aromatic polymer. To produce a membrane, a non-porous aromatic polymer membrane may be immersed in a mixture of the fluorinated aromatic molecule and superacid at an elevated temperature (e.g., at least 80&#xb0; C.) to promote crosslinking via the dehydrative Friedel-Crafts reaction. The resulting crosslinked and fluorinated membrane may be washed with water and/or organic solvent, followed by drying. Notably, the reaction process converts the non-porous polymer membrane into a highly porous (i.e., microporous) crosslinked membrane.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method of at least partially separating carbon dioxide gas from a carbon dioxide-containing mixture of gases by use of the above described crosslinked polymer and membranes composed thereof. In the method, a mixture of gases is passed through the crosslinked polymer, with the result that one or more gases pass through and exit the membrane, while one or more gases are hindered or prevented from passing through and exiting the membrane. The selective passage or retainment of the gases can be attributed to differences in physisorption and pore size distribution. In particular embodiments, the method includes passing a carbon dioxide-containing mixture of gases (such as from flue gas) through the crosslinked polymer membrane, wherein gas exiting the membrane has an increased carbon dioxide concentration relative to the original (starting) carbon dioxide-containing mixture of gases.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a microporous carbon material containing elemental carbon doped with fluorine and oxygen atoms. The microporous carbon membrane typically has a fluorine content of at least or above 20 wt %. The microporous carbon material can be produced by carbonization (e.g., at 400-600&#xb0; C.) of the crosslinked polymer described above. When the crosslinked polymer membrane described above is carbonized, a microporous carbon membrane doped with fluorine and oxygen atoms results. The micropores in the microporous carbon material have a size up to 2 nm, or within a range of 0.1 nm to 2 nm or within a sub-range thereof, and typically at least a portion thereof are ultra-micropores having a size of less than 1 nm, or within a range of 0.1 nm to 1 nm or below 0.5 nm. The microporous carbon membrane typically has a thickness of no more than 100 microns.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In yet another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method of at least partially separating one gas from a mixture of gases by use of the above described microporous carbon material and membranes composed thereof. In the method, a mixture of gases is passed through the microporous carbon membrane, with the result that one or more gases pass through and exit the membrane, while one or more gases are hindered or prevented from passing through and exiting the membrane. The selective passage or retainment of the gases can be attributed to differences in physisorption and pore size distribution. More particularly, the present disclosure is directed to a method of at least partially separating carbon dioxide gas from a carbon dioxide-containing mixture of gases by use of the above described microporous carbon material and membranes composed thereof. In particular embodiments, the method includes passing a carbon dioxide-containing mixture of gases (such as from flue gas) through the microporous carbon membrane, wherein gas exiting the membrane has an increased carbon dioxide concentration relative to the original (starting) carbon dioxide-containing mixture of gases.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The patent or application file contains at least three drawings executed in color.

The CMM composition is at least partially fluorinated and contains (i) an aromatic polymer containing a multiplicity of benzene rings; (ii) a multiplicity of fluorinated aromatic moieties; and (iii) a multiplicity of methylene (&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;) linkages linking between benzene rings of components (i) and fluorinated aromatic moieties of component (ii). The crosslinked polymer described above may alternatively be described as having the following components: (i) an aromatic polymer containing a multiplicity of benzene rings; and (ii) a multiplicity of fluorinated aromatic moieties, wherein each fluorinated aromatic moiety contains at least two separate methylene (&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;) linkages connected to benzene rings on the aromatic polymer. Throughout this disclosure, the structures of fluorinated aromatic moieties are depicted with methylene linkages as part of the fluorinated aromatic moieties. The term &#x201c;aromatic ring,&#x201d; as used herein, includes single, i.e., monocyclic, rings (e.g., benzene or pyridine ring), as well as two or more aromatic rings that are linked or fused to result in a fused or unfused bicyclic, tricyclic, tetracyclic, or higher cyclic ring system, as described in further detail below. In some embodiments, component (i) and/or (ii), or more specifically, benzene rings and/or fluorinated aromatic moieties, is substituted with one or more hydrocarbon groups (R) containing 1-12 carbon atoms. The term &#x201c;membrane&#x201d; refers to a substantially planar shape, such as a sheet or film.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a first embodiment, the term &#x201c;hydrocarbon group&#x201d; (identified as R) is a group composed solely of carbon and hydrogen. In different embodiments, one or more of the hydrocarbon groups can independently contain, for example, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, or twelve carbon atoms, or a number of carbon atoms within a particular range bounded by any two of the foregoing carbon numbers. In other embodiments, the hydrocarbon group includes one or more fluorine atoms (i.e., may be partially or completely fluorinated) in addition to carbon and hydrogen. In the case where all hydrogen atoms are substituted with fluorine atoms, the hydrocarbon groups may be composed of only carbon and fluorine atoms. Generally, the hydrocarbon group does not contain heteroatoms, such as oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The hydrocarbon group (R) can be, for example, a saturated and straight-chained hydrocarbon group (i.e., straight-chained or linear alkyl group). Some examples of straight-chained alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, n-nonyl, n-decyl, n-undecyl, and n-dodecyl groups. Some examples of partially fluorinated versions of such groups include fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, and 2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl groups. Some examples of fully fluorinated versions of such groups include trifluoromethyl, perfluoroethyl, perfluoropropyl, and perfluorobutyl groups.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The hydrocarbon group (R) can alternatively be a saturated and branched hydrocarbon group (i.e., branched alkyl group), which may or may not be fluorinated. Some examples of branched alkyl groups include isopropyl (2-propyl), isobutyl (2-methylprop-1-yl), sec-butyl (2-butyl), t-butyl, 2-pentyl, 3-pentyl, 2-methylbut-1-yl, isopentyl (3-methylbut-1-yl), 1,2-dimethylprop-1-yl, 1,1-dimethylprop-1-yl, neopentyl (2,2-dimethylprop-1-yl), 2-hexyl, 3-hexyl, 2-methylpent-1-yl, 3-methylpent-1-yl, and isohexyl (4-methylpent-1-yl), wherein the &#x201c;1-yl&#x201d; suffix represents the point of attachment of the group.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The hydrocarbon group (R) can alternatively be a saturated and cyclic hydrocarbon group (i.e., cycloalkyl group), which may or may not be fluorinated. Some examples of cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, and cyclooctyl groups. The cycloalkyl group can also be a polycyclic (e.g., bicyclic) group by either possessing a bond between two ring groups (e.g., dicyclohexyl) or a shared (i.e., fused) side (e.g., decalin and norbornane).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The hydrocarbon group (R) can alternatively be an unsaturated and straight-chained hydrocarbon group (e.g., a straight-chained olefinic or alkenyl group), which may or may not be fluorinated. The unsaturation occurs by the presence of one or more carbon-carbon double bonds and/or one or more carbon-carbon triple bonds. Some examples of straight-chained olefinic groups include vinyl, propen-1-yl (allyl), 3-buten-1-yl (CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2550;CH&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;), 2-buten-1-yl (CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH&#x2550;CH&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;), butadienyl, 4-penten-1-yl groups, 3-hexen-1-yl, 7-octen-yl, 9-decen-1-yl, and 9,11-dodecadienyl. An example of a straight-chained alkynyl group is a propargyl group.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The hydrocarbon group (R) can alternatively be an unsaturated and branched hydrocarbon group (e.g., branched olefinic or alkenyl group), which may or may not be fluorinated. Some examples of branched olefinic groups include propen-2-yl, 3-buten-2-yl (CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2550;CH&#x2014;CH.&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>), 3-buten-3-yl (CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2550;C.&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>), 4-penten-2-yl, 4-penten-3-yl, 3-penten-2-yl, 3-penten-3-yl, and 2,4-pentadien-3-yl, wherein the dot in the foregoing exemplary formulas represents the point of attachment of the group.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The hydrocarbon group (R) can alternatively be an unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon group, which may or may not be fluorinated. The unsaturated cyclic group can be aromatic or aliphatic. Some examples of unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon groups include cyclopentenyl, cyclopentadienyl, cyclohexenyl, cyclohexadienyl, phenyl, benzyl, cycloheptenyl, cycloheptadienyl, cyclooctenyl, cyclooctadienyl, and cyclooctatetraenyl groups. The unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon group can also be a polycyclic group (such as a bicyclic or tricyclic polyaromatic group) by either possessing a bond between two of the ring groups (e.g., biphenyl) or a shared (i.e., fused) side, as in naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, phenalene, or indene.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Component (i) of the microporous membrane composition is an aromatic polymer containing a multiplicity of benzene rings. The multiplicity of benzene rings may be in the backbone or pendant positions of the aromatic polymer, or both. Some examples of polymers containing benzene rings in pendant positions include polystyrene (PS) and copolymers thereof, such as a copolymer with polybutadiene (e.g., PS-b-PB, wherein PB is polybutadiene). Some examples of polymers containing benzene rings in the backbone include poly(ether sulfone), poly(ether ketone), polyimide, polyphenyl ether, polycarbonate, poly(divinylbenzene), poly(p-phenylene vinylene), and copolymers thereof. The copolymer may be a block, alternating, random, or periodic copolymer, and may be binary or ternary. In some embodiments, the aromatic polymer is non-fluorinated. In other embodiments, the aromatic polymer is partially fluorinated by retaining some hydrogen atoms on benzene rings of the aromatic polymer. For purposes of the present invention, the aromatic polymer is typically not fully fluorinated.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Component (ii) of the microporous membrane composition is a multiplicity of fluorinated aromatic moieties. The fluorinated aromatic moieties contain aromatic rings that are at least partially fluorinated. In some embodiments, the aromatic rings are precisely or at least 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80% fluorinated. In some embodiments, the aromatic rings are completely fluorinated (i.e., all available hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring have been substituted with fluorine atoms). The term &#x201c;aromatic ring&#x201d;, as used herein, includes carbocyclic aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) and heteroaromatic rings (e.g., pyridine, pyrazine, pyrimidine, imidazole, or pyrrole). A portion or all of the carbocyclic or heterocyclic monocyclic rings may also be linked or fused to result in one or more bicyclic, tricyclic, tetracyclic, higher cyclic, or fused ring systems. Some examples of carbocyclic aromatic rings and ring systems include phenyl (benzene), biphenyl, terphenyl (o-, m-, and p-isomers), quaterphenyl, 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene, quinquephenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl, pyrenyl, chrysenyl, and fluorenyl.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The fluorinated aromatic moiety typically contains at least 6 carbon atoms, and may contain up to, for example, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, or 72 carbon atoms, or a number of carbon atoms within a range bounded by any two of the foregoing values (e.g., 6-72 carbon atoms). In one set of embodiments, at least a portion or all of the fluorinated aromatic moieties are bivalent (i.e., each fluorinated aromatic moiety crosslinks via two connecting positions). In another set of embodiments, at least a portion or all of the fluorinated aromatic moieties are trivalent (i.e., each fluorinated aromatic moiety crosslinks via three connecting positions).

The peak pore volume is generally in the micropore size range. In some embodiments, the crosslinked polymer or microporous carbon possesses a bimodal, trimodal, or higher modal pore size distribution, which can be identified by the presence of, respectively, two, three, or a higher number of peak volume concentrations. In the case of a bimodal pore size distribution, the pore size distribution may be defined by a minimum pore size in the micropore size range and a maximum pore size also in the micropore size range or in the mesopore size range, with either two peak pore volumes in the micropore size range, or one peak pore volume in the micropore size range and another peak pore volume in the mesopore size range. In the case of a trimodal pore size distribution, the pore size distribution may be defined by two peak pore volumes in the micropore size range and one peak pore volume in the mesopore size range, or one peak pore volume in the micropore size range and two peak pore volumes in the mesopore size range.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0066">Generally, for purposes of the present invention, the pore volume attributed to micropores in the crosslinked polymer or microporous carbon is greater than the pore volume attributed to mesopores or larger size pores. For example, in different embodiments, the percent pore volume attributed to micropores (or a sub-range within micropores, such as ultramicropores) may be at least or above 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% pore volume (by total pore volume) wherein it is understood that the total pore volume corresponds to 100% pore volume. The percent pore volume attributed to mesopores (if present) in the crosslinked polymer or microporous carbon is generally less than 50%, more typically no more than or less than 45%, 40%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 2%, or 1% by total pore volume. Macropores (i.e., pores above 50 nm) are generally not present. In some embodiments, the crosslinked polymer or microporous carbon possesses a substantial absence of mesopores and macropores. By a &#x201c;substantial absence&#x201d; of mesopores or macropores is generally meant that no more than or less than 1%, 0.5%, or 0.1% of the total pore volume, or none of the pore volume, can be attributed to the presence of mesopores and/or macropores.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0067">The pores of the crosslinked polymer or microporous carbon can also possess a level of uniformity, generally either in pore diameter, pore shape, and/or pore interspacing. In some embodiments, the pores may possess an average pore size corresponding to any of the pore sizes exemplified above, subject to a degree of variation of no more than, for example, &#xb1;10 nm, &#xb1;8 nm, 6, nm, &#xb1;5 nm, &#xb1;4 nm, 3 nm, 2 nm, 1 nm, or &#xb1;0.5 nm. In some embodiments, any one of the types of pores described above (e.g., the micropores or size range therein) are substantially uniform in size.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0068">The crosslinked polymer or microporous carbon may possess a BET surface area of about or at least, for example, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 900, 1000, 1500, 1800, or 2000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, or a surface area within a range bounded by any two of these values. The crosslinked polymer or microporous carbon may also possess a total pore volume of precisely, about, or at least, for example, 0.2 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 0.3 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 0.4 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 0.5 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 0.6 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 0.7 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 0.8 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 0.9 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 1.0 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 1.2 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 1.5 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 1.8 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 2 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 2.2 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 2.5 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 3.0 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 3.5 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 4.0 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 4.5 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, or 5.0 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, or a pore volume within a range bounded by any two of these values.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0069">The crosslinked polymer or microporous carbon membrane may or may not also function as part of a layered composite material, wherein the crosslinked polymer or microporous carbon membrane either overlays, underlies, or is sandwiched between one or more layers of another material. In some embodiments, the one or more layers of another material provides greater structural integrity to the membrane. If used in gas or liquid separation, filtration, or purification, the one or more layers of another material necessarily include structural features (e.g., pores or slits) that permit the gas or liquid to flow through the membrane. The one or more layers of another material may be porous or non-porous, and can be composed of, for example, a metal (e.g., aluminum or chrome), ceramic (e.g., silica, alumina, or aluminosilicate), paper, plastic, graphite, metal oxide, metal sulfide, metal selenide, metal telluride, metal nitride, metal phosphide, or an organic, inorganic, or hybrid polymer, or combination thereof, depending on the particular application. In some embodiments, the membrane is monolithic (i.e., not disposed on or overlaid with a substrate).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0070">In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method of gas separation by passing a mixture of at least two gases through the crosslinked polymer or microporous carbon membrane described above. Since at least one gas in the mixture of gases is substantially or completely prevented from passing (i.e., traversing) through the membrane, the phrase &#x201c;passing a mixture of at least two gases through the porous polymer membrane&#x201d; includes the possibility that only one or more select gases of the gas mixture will actually pass through and exit the membrane while one or more select gases may substantially or absolutely not pass through and exit the membrane even though they may initially enter the membrane to some degree. The gas separation can be a partial or complete separation of gases. In any event, the end result is that gas exiting the crosslinked polymer or microporous carbon membrane will have an increased concentration of a gas (e.g., carbon dioxide) separated from the original gaseous mixture relative to the initial concentration of the gas (e.g., carbon dioxide) in the initial gaseous mixture before being passed through the membrane. In the case where only a partial separation has been achieved, the partially separated gases may be passed through the membrane one or more additional times to improve on the separation. Moreover, the separation process may be conducted at a higher or lower temperature than room temperature (ca. 25&#xb0; C.) and/or at a higher or lower pressure than normal atmospheric pressure (ca. 1 atm) in an effort to improve the separation.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0071">The gases being separated may be or include, for example, carbon dioxide and nitrogen, or carbon dioxide and methane, or carbon dioxide and oxygen, or carbon dioxide and water vapor, or nitrogen and oxygen, or nitrogen and hydrogen, or oxygen and hydrogen, or oxygen and hydrogen, or ammonia and oxygen, or ammonia and hydrogen, or hydrogen and helium, or methane and nitrogen, or methane and hydrogen, or a mixture of three or more of any of the foregoing or other gases (e.g., carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water vapor and/or oxygen and/or methane). Any one of the aforesaid gases may alternatively be separated from a gaseous mixture containing more than two gases, such as air or gaseous emission from an industrial or combustion process.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0072">In some embodiments, the gas separation process may be integrally connected with a gaseous output emanating from an industrial or chemical process. In other embodiments, one or more gases (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, or carbon dioxide) may be selectively passed through the porous membrane from air or an industrial gaseous emission while one or more other gases from air or an industrial gaseous emission are substantially inhibited from passing through or do not pass through the porous membrane. In practice, the mixture of gases is typically transported into a chamber capped on one end by the membrane, which is typically clad in a metal (e.g., aluminum) or ceramic except for a space in which the membrane is exposed for the gaseous mixture to make contact. The chamber should be sealed to ensure that the gaseous mixture has no exit but through the membrane. In some embodiments, the gas mixture is pressurized to a pressure at or above 1 atm. In other embodiments, the gas mixture is at a pressure of less than 1 atm (e.g., 0.4-0.9 atm).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0073">In particular embodiments, the method is directed to separation of carbon dioxide from a mixture of gases. Aside from carbon dioxide, the mixture of gases typically also includes a substantial proportion of nitrogen gas and some amount of water vapor. Although some degree of separation of carbon dioxide from air may be possible, the present disclosure is primarily concerned with separation of carbon dioxide from industrial or combustion emissions in which carbon dioxide is present in substantially higher concentrations, e.g., at least or above 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 vol %, more typically 5-20 vol %, or more typically 5-14% in the case of flue gas.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0074">In some embodiments, the gas separation process described above is integrated with a process that uses a gas being separated by the above described process. More particularly, the above described process may provide an in situ-generated separated gas for use in a process requiring the separated gas. Such an integrated process may be particularly advantageous in supplying a useful gas (e.g., oxygen or hydrogen) over time (i.e., as produced in situ), which dispenses with the need to house a large stock of the useful gas. A source of carbon dioxide produced by the instant process may be integrated with, for example, a process of making a food or beverage, a process for the production of liquid carbon dioxide or dry ice or a process in which liquid carbon dioxide or dry ice is used, or a process for bioconversion of carbon dioxide to fuel. A source of oxygen or oxygen-enriched air produced by the instant process may be integrated with, for example, a medical process, a welding process, a smelting process, or a chemical production process. A source of nitrogen or nitrogen-enriched air produced by the instant process may be integrated with, for example, a chemical production process (e.g., the production of ammonia by the Haber process), or a process requiring an inert gas to protect oxygen-sensitive compounds and materials, or a process for the production of liquid nitrogen or a process in which liquid nitrogen is used. A source of hydrogen produced by the instant process may be integrated with, for example, a process in which a fuel cell uses hydrogen as a reactant, a chemical production process (e.g., production of ammonia, hydrogenation, petroleum processing, production of syngas, or a reduction process), or a process for the production of liquid hydrogen or a process in which liquid hydrogen is used. A source of methane (natural gas) produced by the instant process may be integrated with, for example, a process that uses methane as fuel.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0075">Using either the crosslinked polymer or microporous carbon membrane, a carbon dioxide to nitrogen (CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) selectivity of at least 10 is typically achieved. In some embodiments, a carbon dioxide to nitrogen selectivity of at least or greater than 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 32, or 35 is achieved. Any of the foregoing selectivities may alternatively be achieved for carbon dioxide over methane, or carbon dioxide over oxygen, or carbon dioxide over water vapor, or nitrogen over oxygen, or nitrogen over hydrogen, or nitrogen over methane, or oxygen over hydrogen, or oxygen over hydrogen, or ammonia over oxygen, or ammonia over hydrogen, or hydrogen over helium, or methane over nitrogen, or methane over hydrogen.

The process uses dense and non-porous polystyrene (M<sub>PS</sub>) membrane as the precursor template. By employing a dehydrative Friedel-Crafts reaction with highly fluorinated benzylic alcohols, M<sub>PS </sub>membranes were cross-linked in situ upon exposure to strong Br&#xf8;nsted acid (e.g., trifluoromethanesulfonic acid), affording hyper cross-linked fluorinated microporous polymeric membranes. The structural properties of the membranes may be tuned by using different fluorinated benzylic alcohol cross-linkers, with a surface area up to 523 m<sup>2 </sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and micropore distribution centered at 1.1&#x2dc;1.3 nm and ultra-micropores (&#x2dc;0.6 nm) being obtained, overall exhibiting good ideal CO<sub>2 </sub>permeability of 797 barrer and CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>selectivity of 28.5. In addition, high fluorine content (up to 28.5 wt %) and thermal stability of the as-synthesized polymeric membranes make them suitable candidates to produce fluorinated carbon molecular sieve membranes by tuning the pyrolysis temperature, leading to improved textural properties, e.g., high surface areas (up to 1020 m<sup>2 </sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), abundant ultra-micropores (&#x2dc;0.4 nm) and fluorine functionalities decorated on the pore surface.

In general, a piece of polymeric membrane precursor, F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 or F-M<sub>PS</sub>-2, was placed in a tube furnace at certain temperature and maintained at this temperature for 12 h under a nitrogen gas flow (heating rate: 10&#xb0; C. min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0094">Results and Discussion</p><p id="p-0107" num="0095">To demonstrate the basic principle for the in situ cross-linking approach, PS membrane precursor (M<sub>PS</sub>) was fabricated by dissolving commercially available PS in toluene (10 wt %) and casting the obtained solution in a glass petri dish. Subsequently, the non-porous PS membrane was immersed in a mixture of the cross-linker 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-1,4-benzenedimethanol (F-OH-1) and the solvent/catalyst CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H, which was then treated at 100&#xb0; C. for cross-linking reaction to take place. The resultant membrane (F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1) was washed with deionized water, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and ethanol, and then dried under vacuum at 60&#xb0; C. The size and shape of the cross-linked membrane can be adjusted depending on the PS membrane precursor. In this work, M<sub>PS </sub>with thickness of 33 m and diameter of 12 mm was used for the subsequent cross-linking. Influence of the reaction time on the properties of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 (denoted as F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-t, t=reaction time) was investigated first. After the cross-linking treatment, the translucent and colorless M<sub>PS </sub>became light (F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-12 h) and dark brown (F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-24 h) depending on the reaction time (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Notably, the cross-linked membrane F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 was completely insoluble in common organic solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane and toluene, in which the membrane precursor MPS was readily soluble. In addition, acids with lower acidity than CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H exhibiting Hammett acidity function (H<sub>0</sub>) of &#x2212;14.1, i.e., CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H (H<sub>0</sub>=&#x2212;7.86) and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>(H<sub>0</sub>=&#x2212;12) showed rather low catalytic activity in the dehydrative Friedel-Crafts cross-linking reaction of pristine MPS with F-OH-1 under the same reaction conditions (100&#xb0; C., 24 h), with the resultant membranes still soluble in toluene and THF. Compared with the original M<sub>PS</sub>, the membrane thickness of F-M<sub>P</sub>S-1 increased to 41 and 49 m after reaction time of 12 h and 24 h, respectively, which was caused by the introduction of porous structures into the dense phase of MPS (total pore volume: 0 cm<sup>3 </sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), as reflected by the significantly increased total pore volume in F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 (0.13 cm<sup>3 </sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-12 h and F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-24 h was 139 and 246 m<sup>2 </sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, respectively, as evaluated by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. While further increasing the reaction time to 48 h had almost no effect on the surface area of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 (249 m<sup>2 </sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). This indicated that in the presence of excess cross-linker (2 mmol F-OH-1+0.43 mmol benzene rings in M<sub>PS</sub>) and under the current conditions, the reaction reached a completion within 24 h via C&#x2014;C bond formation. The porosity of the membrane cannot be further increased after all the reactive sites on the benzene rings in MPS are connected with the fluorinated cross-linker. As for Friedel-Crafts reactions, introduction of electron-withdrawing groups (fluorinated aromatic rings) will significantly suppress the reactivity of the monomers for the subsequent electrophilic attacks. Therefore, the reaction time of 24 h was used for other cross-linking reactions in this work, and F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 obtained with the reaction time of 24 h was selected for further characterization and separation performance investigation. The density of the membrane increased from 1.05 cm<sup>3 </sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(M<sub>PS</sub>) to 1.21 cm<sup>3 </sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-24 h) due to addition of heavier F atoms within the skeleton.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0096">The occurrence of the cross-linking reaction and structure of the afforded membrane was confirmed and characterized by the Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of M<sub>PS </sub>and F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref>). The following characteristic peaks were observed in the skeleton of both M<sub>PS </sub>and F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1: stretching of the C&#x2014;H bond connected to the benzene ring (1026 cm-1), C&#x2550;C bond vibration of the benzene ring (1495 and 1606 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), and multi peaks located at 2950 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>being assigned to the &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014; moieties. The relatively diminished intensity of the peaks belonging to methylene groups in F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 was caused by the introduction of large amounts of fluorinated aromatic rings into the skeleton of M<sub>PS</sub>. Compared with the pristine membrane template M<sub>P</sub>s, F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 obtained after being cross-linked by F-OH-1 showed additional signals for C&#x2014;F bond (1005 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and residual C&#x2014;O bond (1270 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). Furthermore, solid-state cross-polarization magic-angle spinning 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (SS CP/MAS <sup>13</sup>C NMR) analysis further confirmed the efficiency of cross-linking reaction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>D</figref>). The spectrum of the original M<sub>PS </sub>exhibited the peaks for methylene units (peak a, 40.4 ppm) and benzene rings (peak b-d, 125.8-145.1 ppm). After cross-linking with F-OH-1, carbon signal of the alkyl chains upfield-shifted to 24.3 ppm (peak a) due to introduction of &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014; groups connected to the fluorinated benzene ring into the membrane skeleton. Aromatic rings in the original M<sub>PS </sub>skeleton were still present in F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 (peak c and e), together with the signal for C&#x2014;F bond (134.8 ppm) and the other two carbons in the fluorinated benzene rings (114.6 ppm). In the solid-state <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1, two broad peaks located at 0.62 and 0.97 ppm were observed, being assigned to aliphatic and aromatic protons, respectively. In the SS <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectrum of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>), the peak being assigned to C&#x2014;F is located at &#x2212;145.8 ppm, confirming the successful introduction of C&#x2014;F moieties into the membrane framework. As shown by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>F</figref>), in the survey spectra of F-Mps-1, C, O and F were the predominant elements, and the overall surface compositions were 77.8%, 2.9% and 18.9%, respectively, as determined using the core level spectra. In the C1s spectrum (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>F</figref>), three peaks could be deconvoluted. The peak with binding energy (BE)=285.2 eV was ascribed to carbons in aromatic rings, methylene groups, and C&#x2014;O bonds. The presence of characteristic carbon in C&#x2014;F bonds was confirmed by the presence of the peak with BE=287.9 eV. A small peak with BE of 293.4 eV was assigned to saturated carbon signals (e.g., in residual CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H). F1s spectrum for C&#x2014;F bond (BE=688.7 eV) and O1s spectrum for residual oxygen-containing group (BE=533.6 eV) also confirmed the successful polymerization of the MPS precursor with the fluorinated benzylic alcohol cross-linkers. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of MPS showed that it began to lose weight at 280&#xb0; C. in air and 365&#xb0; C. under nitrogen atmosphere and completely decomposed at &#x2dc;400&#xb0; C. both under air and nitrogen atmosphere (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>H</figref>). While the TGA results of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 revealed its excellent thermal stability up to 385&#xb0; C. in air and 455&#xb0; C. under nitrogen atmosphere, with a significant improvement compared with MPS. Residual weight of 51 wt % was still obtained up to 800&#xb0; C. under N<sub>2</sub>, which indicates the possibility to fabricate F-doped porous carbonaceous membrane from F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0097">The morphology and nanostructure variation of the membranes before and after cross-linking were further characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the surface of M<sub>PS </sub>membrane was smooth, defect-free and non-porous. The cross-section of M<sub>PS </sub>was also uniform, smooth and defect-free (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>).

Comparatively, the top view SEM image of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 clearly revealed the structure composed of small polymer nanoparticles (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>). The cross-sectional SEM images of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 showed homogeneous morphology from the surface to the center region of the membrane involving small polymer particles, indicating thorough cross-linking of the original M<sub>PS </sub>membrane (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>). TEM images of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1, obtained after intensively grinding it, exhibited the presence of small particles within the film-like membrane morphology (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref>). The corresponding elemental maps of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 demonstrated uniform distributions of carbon, fluorine, and residual small amount of oxygen atoms on the surface and cross-section of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>G and <b>3</b>H</figref>). The energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) profile collected during the TEM observation also demonstrated the successful introduction of fluorinated moieties into the skeleton of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 and the presence of carbon, fluorine, and oxygen within the afforded membrane. The mechanical property of the membranes afforded after cross-linking was relatively inferior owing to flexibility limitation of the M<sub>PS </sub>precursor and the cross-linker (e.g., F-OH-1), so robust Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>support was introduced to address this issue. Using robust Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-supported M<sub>PS </sub>as the precursor, the cross-linking reaction was conducted under the otherwise identical conditions to those used for the fabrication of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1. SEM images of the as-synthesized Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-supported F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 (both surface and cross sections) exhibited the same morphology as the bare F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 composed of small polymer particles. In addition, the porous channel structures of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>support are well maintained. The corresponding elemental maps of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>supported F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 (both surface and cross sections) further demonstrated the uniform distribution of C, F, and residual 0 within the membrane skeleton, indicating the successful introduction of the fluorinated aromatic rings into the membrane skeleton.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0098">The porosity variation of the membranes before and after cross-linking was evaluated by N<sub>2 </sub>sorption and desorption analysis measured at 77 K (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>).

Comparatively, the as-afforded F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 showed a microporous architecture with a typical type-I reversible sorption profile.

Horvath-Kawazoe pore size distribution curve of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 demonstrated the formation of ultra-micropores around 0.6 nm within the membrane skeleton (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>), which will bring further benefit in the separation of small gas molecules.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0099">Notably, the structural properties and fluorine content of the cross-linked membranes could be modulated by employing cross-linkers with different structures, e.g. 4,4&#x2032;-octafluorobibenzenedimethanol (F-OH-2).

This was further verified by the F1s spectrum for C&#x2014;F bond (688.1 eV) and O1s spectrum for C&#x2014;O (533.0 eV). F-M<sub>PS</sub>-2 also showed high thermal stability under nitrogen atmosphere up to 490&#xb0; C., making it a potential precursor to fabricate fluorinated carbon molecular sieve membrane (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>H</figref>).

Density of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-2 was measured to be 1.32 cm<sup>3 </sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>due to the introduction of more &#x201c;heavy&#x201d; F species into the membrane skeleton, compared with that of the pristine M<sub>PS </sub>(1.05 cm<sup>3 </sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 (1.21 cm<sup>3 </sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0100">However, when F-OH-3 was utilized as the cross-linker, the M<sub>PS </sub>membrane precursor dissolved in the mixture of F-OH-3/CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H, and only polymer powder was collected after the reaction, probably owing to the decreased polarity of the solvent (CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H) upon addition of F-OH-3 with very high fluorine content. This in situ cross-linking method can be extended to other PS-based block polymer membranes. For example, using PS-block-polybutadiene-block-PS (denoted as M<sub>BuPS</sub>) membrane as the original precursor instead of M<sub>PS</sub>, after cross-linking with F-OH-1, the fluorinated membrane could be obtained (denoted as F-M<sub>BuPS</sub>-1). FTIR spectrum of F-M<sub>BuPS</sub>-1 included the signals of benzene rings (1478 and 1600 cm<sup>1</sup>), C&#x2550;C bond of alkene (1706 cm<sup>1</sup>), and aliphatic C&#x2014;H bond (2930 cm<sup>1</sup>), together with C&#x2014;O bond (1268 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and C&#x2014;F bond (1003 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) arising from the cross-linker F-OH-1.

The XPS survey spectrum of F-M<sub>BuPS</sub>-1 confirmed the successful introduction of fluorine atoms into the skeleton, as well as C and O elements. The presence of C&#x2014;F bond was further confirmed by the Cis spectrum (BE=287.5 eV) and F1s spectrum (BE=687.7 eV). TGA analysis of F-M<sub>BuPS</sub>-1 under N<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere showed the initial decomposition onset of 435&#xb0; C., which was comparable to that of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1. The surface area of F-M<sub>BuPS</sub>-1 was measured to be 77 m<sup>2 </sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>as evaluated by N<sub>2 </sub>adsorption isotherm at 77 K, which was relatively low due to the flexibility of the polybutadiene chains.

The CO<sub>2 </sub>adsorption performance of the fluorinated molecular sieve membranes were first assessed by CO<sub>2 </sub>isotherms (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>). The M<sub>PS </sub>precursor with nonporous architecture had fairly low CO<sub>2 </sub>uptake capacity (0.036 mmol g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>at 273 K and 0.024 mmol g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>at 298 K).

The porosity evaluation results demonstrated that the surface area of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-2 (523 m<sup>2 </sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) was higher than F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 (246 m<sup>2 </sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), and they exhibited similar pore size distributions, but similar CO<sub>2 </sub>uptake capacity was achieved by F-M<sub>PS</sub>-2 (1.60 mmol g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>at 273 K and 1.08 mmol g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>at 298 K), owing to the higher F content in F-M<sub>PS</sub>-2 compared with F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 and higher molecular weight of F compared with H.

As stated above, introducing more C&#x2014;F bonds into the membrane backbone led to the significant increase in the CO<sub>2 </sub>separation performance. However, the CO<sub>2 </sub>permeability and selectivity were still unsatisfactory for practical applications due to relatively low surface area (compared with the carbon molecular sieve membranes shown below) and relatively broader pore size distribution (0.3-2.0 nm).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0103">For molecular sieve membranes, rigid frameworks and engineered ultramicropores (&#x3c;0.7 nm) were attractive to provide good separation performance for small gas molecule pairs, permitting enhancement in intrinsic diffusion selectivity by tuning aperture size and simultaneous enhancement in intrinsic sorption selectivity by tuning the structural properties through introduction of CO<sub>2</sub>-philic functionality. Cleavage of C&#x2014;F bond during the pyrolysis process led to formation of ultramicropores (&#x2dc;0.5 nm) in the synthesis of carbonaceous molecular sieve membranes. This is a very attractive strategy for molecular sieve membrane development. In addition, high thermal stability of both F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 and F-M<sub>PS</sub>-2 made them suitable precursors to fabricate fluorinated carbon molecular sieve membranes (F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1/2-T, T=pyrolysis temperature).

The fluorine content on the surface of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-500 was found to be 2.0 at. % according to the XPS analysis. Therefore, the good separation performance of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-500 was derived from the synergistic effect of high surface area, abundant ultramicropores, and decoration with CO<sub>2</sub>-philic C&#x2014;F bonds within the backbone. Ultra-microporosity (around 0.37 and 0.55 nm) persisted in carbon molecular sieve membranes obtained even at higher pyrolysis temperature, and F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-600 and F-M<sub>PS</sub>-700 exhibited much higher surface areas of 728 and 847 m<sup>2 </sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref>), as well as CO<sub>2 </sub>uptake capacity up to 5.62 (273 K) and 4.85 mmol g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(298 K), respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>G</figref>).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0105">The separation performance (P<sub>CO2</sub>, (&#x3b1;(CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>)) of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-600 (1988 barrer, 26.4) and F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-700 (5080 barrer, 15.7) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>H</figref>) indicated that although high surface area led to increased CO<sub>2 </sub>permeability, the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>selectivity decreased probably due to the cleavage of additional C&#x2014;F bonds within the membrane skeleton at higher pyrolysis temperature. Indeed, the surface fluorine content was determined to be 1.0 at. % in F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-600 and only 0.1 at. % in F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-700, further highlighting the important role fluorine functionalities play in achieving high CO<sub>2 </sub>separation selectivity. Subsequently, carbon molecular sieve membranes derived from F-M<sub>PS</sub>-2 were fabricated by thermal treatment under nitrogen atmosphere at 500&#xb0; C. Structural properties of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-2-500 featured by high residual surface fluorine content of 10.0 at. %, surface area of 743 m<sup>2 </sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and the presence of ultra-micropores led to a significantly improved CO<sub>2 </sub>separation performance (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>D-<b>5</b>H</figref>), with P<sub>CO2 </sub>of 18761 barrer and &#x3b1;(CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of 13.3, superposed with the most recent upper bound. Further increasing the pyrolysis temperature to 600&#xb0; C. produced F-M<sub>PS</sub>-2-600 with the highest surface area of 1020 m<sup>2 </sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and also the highest P<sub>CO2 </sub>of 21600 barrer, but decreased &#x3b1;(CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of 9.7, probably due to the decreased fluorine content (3.9 at. %). As stated above, the fluorinated carbon molecular sieve membranes with high surface area and abundant ultra-micropores were successfully fabricated with the as-synthesized fluorinated polymeric membranes as templates, which exhibited improved CO<sub>2 </sub>separation performance superposing or even exceeding the Robeson 2008 upper bound limit.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0106">Performance of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 and F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-500 after aging was conducted to study their stabilities. The membranes were exposed to air for one week after each run. The results showed that for F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1, slight decrease of both the P<sub>CO2 </sub>and &#x3b1;(CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) was observed in the initial three cycles, that is, from P<sub>CO2 </sub>of 343 barrer together with &#x3b1;(CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of 29.9 in the 1<sub>st </sub>run, to P<sub>CO2 </sub>of 312 barrer with &#x3b1;(CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of 28.0 in the 2nd run, and P<sub>CO2 </sub>of 299 barrer with &#x3b1;(CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of 27.7 in the 3rd run. Subsequently, the performance of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 was steady within a time span of 10 weeks. The initial decrease was probably attributed to the interaction of the surface functionalities on F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 with H<sub>2</sub>O vapor or other gaseous moieties in air, occupying the reactive sites for CO<sub>2 </sub>and the porosity within the skeletons. Comparatively, the carbon molecular sieve membrane (F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-500) obtained after high temperature treatment under N<sub>2 </sub>showed higher stability in air, with only slight decrease in performance in the 2<sup>nd </sup>run (P<sub>CO2 </sub>of 1889 barrer with &#x3b1;(CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of 35.1) compared with fresh one (P<sub>CO2 </sub>of 1898 barrer with &#x3b1;(CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of 35.6). Its performance was consistent during the following 10 weeks. The foregoing results may be a result of the presence of fewer functionalities on the surface of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-500 compared to that of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1 and hence fewer sites that could potentially interact with air components, which can diminish the material's CO<sub>2 </sub>separation performance.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0107">Generally, gas separation performance of membranes in mixed gas test will be inferior compared with the single gas runs mainly ascribed to the competitive sorption effect. To probe the behavior of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-500, a binary CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation test was conducted at 298 K with the feeding ratio of 15:85. Compared with the single gas separation behavior (P<sub>CO2 </sub>of 1898 barrer with &#x3b1;(CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of 35.6), a decreased &#x3b1;(CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of 27 together with slightly increased P<sub>CO2 </sub>of 2329 barrer was observed. With the feeding ratio of CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>increased to 50:50, higher P<sub>CO2 </sub>of 3261 barrer was achieved but with inferior &#x3b1;(CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of 21.4. For gas separation in practical circumstances, another inevitable composition possessing competing adsorption ability with CO<sub>2 </sub>in the atmosphere is H<sub>2</sub>O molecules, which will lead to decreased selectivity upon occupation of the active sites. For example, in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O, the CO<sub>2 </sub>separation performance of MOF-derived materials was significantly diminished owing the structural collapse caused by H<sub>2</sub>O introduction. Under relatively high humidity (90%) conditions, the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation performance of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-500 was assessed with CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>feeding ratio of 50:50. The result demonstrated that only slightly decreased P<sub>CO2 </sub>of 3008 barrer together with a similar &#x3b1;(CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of 20.9 was obtained, compared with that obtained under dry conditions (P<sub>CO2 </sub>of 3261 barrer with &#x3b1;(CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of 21.4). The &#x201c;waterproof&#x201d; feature of F-M<sub>PS</sub>-1-500 was ascribed to its stable skeleton mainly composed of C&#x2014;C bond and the involvement of hydrophobic fluorinated moieties, making it a promising candidate for practical gas separation applications.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0108">The cross-linking agent is not limited to perfluorinated bis-benzylic alcohols. In addition, corresponding benzylic esters (acetate, benzoate etc.) or benzyl halides or pseudo halides (Cl, Br, OTs, OTf etc.) could be used. Additionally, corresponding aldehydes could be used as well. Moreover, any halogen, or heteroatom functional group on the aryl ring can be used, especially if all available hydrogen atoms in the parent aromatic ring are substituted. With the presence of electron withdrawing groups, only one group per substrate is sufficient (NO<sub>2</sub>, CF<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>R, and the like). Polymeric substrate is not limited to only pure polystyrene. Block co-polymers and random polymers and/or any combination of polymers may be used, as long as they contain aromatic fragments amenable to electrophilic reactions.
