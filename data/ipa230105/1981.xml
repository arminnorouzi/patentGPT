Accordingly, the conventional SBW related invention mainly focuses on improving the steering feel of a driver.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the SBW type steering device is driven by a road wheel actuator (RWA), and is problematic in that the airtightness of the road wheel actuator is not maintained uniformly depending on driving environment, so that a component of the road wheel actuator may become rusty, and the performance of the road wheel actuator may be deteriorated.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITED DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2018-95059 (Jun. 21, 2018)</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the above, the present disclosure provides a steering device detecting the airtightness of a road wheel actuator, in which a pressure sensor and a temperature sensor are mounted on the road wheel actuator, thus detecting the airtightness of the road wheel actuator by measuring a change in pressure or a change in pressure depending on a change in temperature.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The objects to be solved by the present disclosure are not limited to the above-mentioned objects, and may be variously expanded without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to accomplish the object, exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure provide a steering device detecting the airtightness of a road wheel actuator, in which a controller measures temperature data and/or pressure data of the road wheel actuator, and compares the measured temperature data or pressure data with reference pressure data or reference temperature-pressure data, thus checking the airtight state of the road wheel actuator.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A steering device detecting the airtightness of a road wheel actuator according to an embodiment of the present disclosure can detect the airtightness of the road wheel actuator.

The pressure sensor measures internal pressure of the housing and the bellows surrounding the body unit, the motor unit, and the controller.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an embodiment, the controller includes reference pressure data. The controller receives pressure data from the pressure sensor, compares the received pressure data with the reference pressure data, and determines that there is an abnormality in the airtightness of the road wheel actuator when the received pressure data is lower than the reference pressure data. The reference pressure data is pressure data measured by the pressure sensor when the airtightness of the road wheel actuator is in a normal state.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an embodiment, the steering device further includes a display unit. The display unit is electrically connected to the controller to display an airtight state of the road wheel actuator. The controller transmits an electrical signal to the display unit when it is determined that there is an abnormality in the airtightness of the road wheel actuator.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to an embodiment, the display unit displays the abnormality in the airtightness of the road wheel actuator, when the display unit receives the electrical signal from the controller.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to an embodiment, a temperature sensor is attached to the controller. The temperature sensor measures internal temperature of the housing and the bellows surrounding the body unit, the motor unit, and the controller.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an embodiment, the controller includes reference temperature-pressure data. The controller receives temperature data and pressure data from the temperature sensor and the pressure sensor, respectively, calculates pressure data corresponding to the temperature data, compares the pressure data corresponding to the temperature data with the reference temperature-pressure data, and determines that there is an abnormality in the airtightness of the road wheel actuator when the pressure data corresponding to the temperature data is lower than the reference temperature-pressure data.
