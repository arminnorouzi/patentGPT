Such user accounts may allow the user to access and play a variety of media titles on the gaming network platform. Gaming network <b>104</b> may further provide its registered users with options for verified accounts (e.g., for professional, semi-pro, or other celebrity users), team management, community tools, events tracking, social tools (e.g., friends lists), following other accounts, instant messaging, browsing live and archived streams, and other features related to playing or spectating games on the platform.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The competition server <b>112</b> may engage in team building and/or team management. The players <b>108</b>-<b>110</b>, in response to reporting a skill profile may be matched with other players or teams based on reported skill levels or abilities. Matching may occur with an aim toward matching similarly skilled players in head-to-head competition. Matching may occur with respect to creating virtual groups or &#x201c;houses&#x201d; whereby players' skills are complimentary to one another.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Gaming network <b>104</b> may be integrated with competition server <b>112</b> so as to allow for automatic communication of gameplay data and/or gameplay statistics. The gameplay data can be received by competition server <b>112</b>, for example, using an application programming interface (API), such as API <b>114</b>. Depending on implementation, gameplay data can be collected via active monitoring of an online game environment, or received from one or more external systems, for example, as part of a game performance data set that includes information describing individual player performance for one or more game titles and/or genre categories.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Competition server <b>112</b> may create and support competitions between various players <b>108</b> (or teams of players) and for various game titles. Players who register may be ranked during predetermined time periods, and such rankings may be used to determine placement during competitions. Such rankings may carry over to a certain extent between different seasons but may also be adjusted based on certain factors (e.g., lack of activity). In some aspects, players that have played in previous seasons may enter the following season at a higher tier than brand new players. Further, the highest-ranked players may be dropped down a level so that they have room improve throughout the season.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The competition server <b>112</b> may further provide a way for players having a user account in the gaming network platform to register for competitions. Because the registering player may already have a user account, registration for competitions may involve linking or otherwise accessing the user account information for use in tournament registration, as well as for associated qualification verification, recruiting and invitations, team-building, notifications, reminders, match scheduling and check-ins, updated brackets, results verification, real-time reporting, dispute management, and broadcast/stream production. A player account may be associated with a group of friends, for example, which may be a basis for sending out invitations to participate in competitions, team-building, or organizing spectator watch parties.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A personal profile may be received for each of the one or more players. Each personal profile may include player biographical or identifying information and other non-skill specific information, such as email address. A skill profile may be received for each of the one or more players. Each skill profile may include player skill (and/or skill division), motto, logo, and/or charity for a corresponding one of the players. An example of a skill division is a skill, such as baseball, and a division such as Major League. The personal and skill profiles may be saved in a database, which may be stored, e.g., in a storage device associated with the competition server <b>112</b>. Each skill profile may further associate a particular style of game play with a corresponding player based on player statistics corresponding to the player. In various aspects, the player profile of each user and/or the skill profile of each user may be stored on the competition server <b>112</b>. Alternatively, the player profile, skill profile, or both may be stored at various locations and/or devices within the network <b>100</b>. By way of example, and not by way of limitation, each player profile may include a style identifier related to the particular style of game play. The player profile for a given one of the one or more players may be accessed by the competition server <b>112</b> and presented to a client device of one or more different players in response to a request from the client device for information relating to the given one of the one or more players.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">During gameplay, a player may accumulate various statistics, meet various benchmarks, or trigger certain events related to game play. Some statistics, benchmarks, and trigger events may be provided as scoring information. Game play information may include more than scoring information or win-loss records. Depending on the game, such information may include details on how a player fared in response to certain game events, in certain game environments, or while interacting with certain team members.

In some instances, a series of metrics (e.g., different metrics for different tasks and even from different players and/or in different games) may be analyzed collectively and/or combined to develop a more complex reporting metric reflective of various sub-sets of information.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition to the features discussed above, competition server <b>112</b> may further use such data from user and team accounts and profiles to track progress, update leaderboards, and schedule competitions. Conversely, information regarding each individual player's or team's progress or activities within the competition may be automatically populated to the respective player or team profile. For example, a player profile may be tagged or include some other indicator that the player is participating in a particular competition, what ranking the player is assigned, opponents (and associated rankings), real-time competition game data related to the player, etc.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Analysis of the metrics may indicate that a particular player is well versed in certain skills of game play or lacking in others. Analysis may also indicate that a particular player performs well with particular objects, weapons, or tools during the course of game play. Analysis may likewise indicate that a particular player performs well when working with other players, players with certain skills, and/or under certain game conditions.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Because the metrics that are used to evaluate player performance for a particular game can vary widely between game title and type, the ability to rank players require consideration of certain metrics. Such metrics may be converted from data generated in existing game titles or may be tracked at the platform during certain specified gameplay modes. Some legacy game titles may have their own ranking systems, which a tournament organizer may or may not rely on. A tournament organizer may elect to convert some or all of the existing ranking systems for use in tournament play. Creation of a tournament and corresponding parameters can be managed at the platform level, for example, by one or more of players <b>108</b>-<b>110</b>. That is, individual players, player collectives, or other parties can specify the game-performance attributes desired for structuring the tournament.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Such standardization further allows for an objective comparison of skill level, which may provide a basis for rankings. Different genres of games&#x2014;and different roles within each game&#x2014; may involve different standards. Team-based gameplay, for example, may involve teammates with different types of skill sets (e.g., different weaponry, resources, in-game abilities, powers, etc.). As such, the game play of different team members may be evaluated in accordance with the different standards despite playing in the same game title.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For game titles that may be played in teams, a team may be associated with a team account or profile that includes such data for use by competition server <b>112</b>. Such a team profile may be linked to the individual team member profiles. The competition server <b>112</b> may provide team management tools for use in scheduling and otherwise managing tournament participation by the team.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The competition server <b>112</b> may evaluate the game performance attributes, and gameplay statistics to determine a skill level for each player. Determinations of skill level can vary depending upon the specified game performance attributes, and can vary between game titles, and/or game genres. By way of example, skill level for a given player can be based on one or more of: collected points, a number of wins/losses, total game time, achieve difficulty level, and/or a number of &#x201c;kills,&#x201d; etc. Because game play occurs on the gaming network <b>104</b> platform, competition server <b>112</b> may obtain such results automatically and in real time, thereby by allowing for metrics generation, evaluation, and use in updating rankings, achievements designations, and leaderboards.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Different ranking systems may be available for different game titles. A competition may involve multiple game titles, for example, and as such, a ranking system may combine and/or weight different individual rankings within the game titles. An overall ranking for any combination of games played on the platform may also be available. As such, a player may distinguish themselves as a skilled player not only in one or a few game titles (or even a game family or genre), but within multiple different types of games.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Moreover, because the competition server <b>112</b> is in communication with gaming network <b>104</b>, the competition server <b>112</b> may receive and analyze game data in real-time. As such, competition server <b>112</b> may detect when a match has started, when the match is particularly active or competitive, and other in-game events. For example, certain in-game events may be associated with certain game data or metrics. Use of certain weaponry, exhibition of certain character moves or maneuvers, scoring in a certain amount or pattern, etc., may be indicative of an unusual or otherwise notable in-game event. As such, screenshots or video may be captured regarding such events and published with links that can take a spectator to the stream, whether at the beginning of the match or directly to illustrated point of interest. Such links may be accessed in real-time (e.g., as the match is occurring) or in association with an archived stream. In some aspects, such links may be published on the gaming network <b>104</b> platform (e.g., landing pages, leaderboards, communities, forums, user profiles, team profiles, tournament profiles, bookmarks) or on sites associated with the player, team, developer, tournament organizer, broadcaster, or other content producer or streamer.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The competition server <b>112</b> communicates with the authority, such as game title leaderboards, of each skill's scoring system. The leaderboards is a ranking list, which displays each player's score, overall ranking, etc. A leaderboard provides an overall picture about the players who have played a game title. Such leaderboards typically comprise a list of user IDs and their score or other performance metric relating to a game or some aspect of a game. In an example, leaderboards may be provided quarterly or annually. In an example, at the end of a week, village scores are totaled and the village leaderboards are locked in. Typically, a subset of this list, such as the top N ranking users by score, is provided for display. A total score may also given for the player's performance. This may be calculated using any suitable method, and can take into account any suitable range of factors. By recording a total score in this way, the player is able to have an overall indicator of the quality of their performance. Behavioral data is collected, entered, or requested from players, and a profile of each player is created from the data.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some aspects, players registered for a competitions can be ranked into multiple categories or tiers of skill level. For example, players may be categorized into a platinum tier for being in the top 2% of players, into a gold tier for being in the next 20% of players, into a silver tier for being in the next 28% of players, and into a bronze tier designated for the last 32%. Such tiers may further be subdivided as needed into + or &#x2212; subdivisions. A player categorized as gold+ may be close to being moved into the platinum tier, for example, while a player categorized as gold&#x2212; may be close to falling into the silver tier.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Designations of prizes, achievement or skill level can be provided based on the overall ranking of a player or group of players. Periodic and year-end prizes may be distributed to the players in the competitions. For example, digital badges, trophies, or medals can be provided to the top-ranked player (or player team), and published on an associated player (or team) profile. Such designations may be awarded as to a current season and remain visible in future seasons. Different designations may be provided for different game titles, different combinations of achievements, overall ratings, etc. Such designations and tier levels serve as the basis for matching competitors. Various search and sorting options may be provided (e.g., game title, ranking, stream parameters) so that players may filter through the available game streams, players, teams, tournaments, etc. to find other players of interest. A player may wish to find a similarly-skilled practice sparring partner, for example, or a teammate with complementary skills. Such spectators may choose to follow such players, for example, and request notifications, reminders, and schedules relating to matches involving the player(s) of interest. In some aspects, such designations may be made available through other outlets (e.g., stream sources) for searching and filtering based on a standardized skill evaluation system.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a method <b>300</b> for providing cross skill competition. The methods <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be embodied as executable instructions in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium including but not limited to a CD, DVD, or non-volatile memory such as a hard drive. The instructions of the storage medium may be executed by a processor (or processors) to cause various hardware components of a computing device hosting or otherwise accessing the storage medium to effectuate the method. The steps identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> (and the order thereof) are exemplary and may include various alternatives, equivalents, or derivations thereof including but not limited to the order of execution of the same.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">At step <b>302</b>, a plurality of game titles is hosted on the gaming network <b>104</b>. At step <b>304</b>, a skill profile from one or more player devices associated with one or more players is received by the competition server <b>112</b>. The skill profile includes one or more supported skills. At step <b>306</b>, real-time gameplay data involving the plurality of game titles is tracked by the competition server <b>112</b>. At step <b>308</b>, a subset of the players with a same skill profile are invited by the competition server <b>112</b> to join a house. At step <b>310</b>, the subset of the players in the house are invited to join a neighborhood. The neighborhood includes one or more houses with unique skill sets. At step <b>312</b>, the subset of the players in the neighborhood are invited to a village. The village competes against other villages with a same skill set. At step <b>314</b>, one or more scores is received by the competition server <b>112</b> for each of the players in the village. At step <b>316</b>, the scores for each of the players in the village at the end of a predetermined time period are aggregated. The aggregate score of the village equally combines the scores of each house.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The scores are based on skill subdivisions, such as national organizations or major/minor league divisions. A village may compete with another village when all skill and skill subdivisions match between villages. In an example, a village with major and minor league baseball houses competes against other villages with major and minor league baseball houses. For example, in various aspects the village members may include professional sports teams selected or adopted by one or more user. As such, the villages may include competitions based upon the performance of professional sports. In one example, a village may select the New York Yankees, while in another village may select the St. Louis Cardinals, both of which are professional baseball teams in Major Leagues Baseball. Video games generally do not have a fixed schedule so gameplay and scoring may happen at any time. Athletic leagues often have fixed schedules and do not allow play at any time. Village competition is house-to-house or skill subdivision against skill subdivision, such that any village that has at least one house that has had play during a week will continue to score and will not be at a disadvantage versus any other village it plays against. In the examples where villages include professional sports teams, the performances of the professional team on a weekly, monthly, or even season long period may be evaluated. The corresponding scores or other statistics evaluated during the period may be determined and added to each respective village.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A player in a village may assume the role of &#x201c;mayor&#x201d; for a village. The mayor may request a minimum skill level. The mayor of a village is in charge of sending invitations to houses and/or neighborhoods anywhere to join the village. Mayors may be in as many villages as desired, but must remain active in each village. If the mayor or any other player in a village is not active, the house they are in is dropped from scoring. One or more other players in the village may nominate a replacement for the mayor. One or more other players in the village may nominate a replacement for another player.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exemplary user device <b>400</b>.

The camera may be integrated into or attached as a peripheral device to user device <b>400</b>. In typical eye-tracking devices, infrared non-collimated light is reflected from the eye and sensed by a camera or optical sensor. The information is then analyzed to extract eye rotation from changes in reflections. Camera-based trackers focus on one or both eyes and record their movement as the viewer looks at some type of stimulus. Camera-based eye trackers use the center of the pupil and light to create corneal reflections (CRs). The vector between the pupil center and the CR can be used to compute the point of regard on surface or the gaze direction. A simple calibration procedure of the viewer is usually needed before using the eye tracker.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Alternatively, more sensitive trackers use reflections from the front of the cornea and that back of the lens of the eye as features to track over time. Even more sensitive trackers image features from inside the eye, including retinal blood vessels, and follow these features as the eye rotates.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Most eye tracking devices use a sampling rate of at least 30 Hz, although 50/60 Hz is most common. Some tracking devises run as high as 1250 Hz, which is needed to capture detail of very rapid eye movement.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">A range camera may instead be used with the present disclosure to capture gestures made by the user and is capable of facial recognition. A range camera is typically used to capture and interpret specific gestures, which allows a hands-free control of an entertainment system.
