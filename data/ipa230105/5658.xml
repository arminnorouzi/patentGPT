More specifically, devices, structures and related techniques disclosed herein relate to systems and methods for improving winding losses in planar transformers used in power conversion circuits. In some embodiments, a planar transformer may include a first magnetic core that is in contact with a second magnetic core, where a first section of the first magnetic core forms an air gap with the second magnetic core. The planar transformer can further include a first primary formed around the first section. The planer transformer may further include a first secondary winding formed on a first layer, and a second secondary winding forming an n<sup>th </sup>layer, where the first secondary winding and the second secondary winding are formed around the first section. The primary windings may be positioned between the first layer and the n<sup>th </sup>layer. The n<sup>th </sup>layer may be pulled back from the air gap by a keep-away distance. By increasing a distance between the n<sup>th </sup>layer and the air gap, the winding losses in the transformer can be reduced thereby increasing an efficiency of the power conversion circuit. In various embodiments, a method of optimizing a ratio of the keep-away distance to a thickness of the air gap is disclosed. By optimizing this ratio, embodiments of the disclosure can enable a reduction of winding losses in the transformer, thereby improving an overall efficiency of the power conversion circuit.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In various embodiments, the planar transformer can include an E-core and an I-core. In some embodiments, the planar transformer can include an I-core with a recess adjacent the first section of the E-core. The recess may be formed in various shapes, for example, but not limited to, a rectangle, a trapezoid, or an arc-trapezoid. The formation of a recess enables a reduction winding losses and improve overall efficiency of the power conversion circuit. In various embodiments, a method of optimizing a ratio of depth of the recess to the air gap thickness of is disclosed.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, material from some regions of the I-core that are adjacent to the n<sup>th </sup>layer can be removed, forming recessed regions in the I-core. This can result in a reduction of winding losses in the planar transformer. In various embodiments, a method of optimizing a ratio of depth of the recess to the air gap thickness of is disclosed. Various inventive embodiments are described herein, including methods, processes, systems, devices, and the like.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Several illustrative embodiments will now be described with respect to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. The ensuing description provides embodiment(s) only and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the disclosure. Rather, the ensuing description of the embodiment(s) will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing one or more embodiments. It is understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of certain inventive embodiments. However, it will be apparent that various embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. The figures and description are not intended to be restrictive.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, planar transformer <b>100</b> can include a first magnetic core <b>106</b>, a second magnetic core <b>102</b>, primary winding <b>112</b> and secondary windings <b>108</b>, and an air gap <b>110</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the planar transformer <b>100</b> can include an EI-core and an 8-layer printed circuit board (PCB) winding, however other embodiments can have other suitable configurations, e.g., number of layer can vary according to specific application. The air gap <b>110</b> can be formed between the middle leg of an E-core and a center portion of an I-core. A length of the air gap is denoted by <b>103</b> (lg). The length lg of the air gap can be, for example, 0.24 mm. However, other suitable air gap lengths can be used. The primary windings <b>112</b> can include, for example, 14 turns, which is illustrated as w<sub>2 </sub>to w<sub>15</sub>, however other embodiments can have other suitable number of turns. The secondary windings <b>108</b> can include, for example, 2 turns, which is described as w<sub>1 </sub>and w<sub>16</sub>, however other embodiments can have other suitable number of turns. In the illustrated embodiment, winding w<sub>16 </sub>can be pulled away from the air gap <b>110</b> to create a keep-away distance <b>104</b> (y). An effect of air gap fringing flux on the winding w<sub>16 </sub>can be minimized by increasing a distance between w<sub>16 </sub>and the air gap <b>110</b>, thus reducing winding losses. In the illustrated embodiment, a ratio (N) of the keep-away distance <b>104</b> to the air gap length <b>103</b> (lg) can be given by:</p><p id="p-0040" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>N=y/lg </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0041" num="0000">In some embodiments, the ratio N can be set approximately equal to or close to an integer. By keeping the ratio N approximately equal or close to an integer, an optimum keep-away distance between the windings and the air gap can be determined. In various embodiments, systems and methods for improving winding losses in planar transformers can determine an optimal ratio of the keep-away distance to the air gap length for any transformer core shapes such as, but not limited to, EIR, EI, U, or C-shaped cores, and to any number of winding layers in the planar transformer.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a graph <b>200</b> showing winding losses as a function of ratio N, where N is increased from 0 to 8, according to embodiments of the disclosure. As can be seen in graph <b>202</b>, there is an optimal value where the winding losses are at a minimum. For example, in graph <b>202</b>, a ratio value of 2 (i.e. when the keep away distance is twice the length of the air gap) produces an optimal reduction of winding losses. As appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure, a value for ratio N be set to any suitable value for a specific application to minimize transformer winding losses. In some embodiments, a value of ratio N that can minimize transformer winding losses may vary from 0.01 to 10, while in other embodiments a value of ratio N that can minimize transformer winding losses may vary from 0.05 to 8, while in yet other embodiments a value of ratio N that can minimize transformer winding losses may vary from 1 to 3.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0040">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a planar transformer <b>300</b> is shown where some portions of a second magnetic core are removed according to an embodiment of the disclosure.

In some embodiments, recessed regions <b>304</b> and <b>314</b> may cause the air gap magnetic field to move down, resulting in a further weakening of the influence of air gap fringing magnetic flux, thus resulting in reduced windings losses.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> illustrates a graph <b>400</b>C showing winding losses as a function of air gap thickness <b>305</b> (lg) in planar transformer <b>300</b>, according to embodiments of the disclosure. Graph <b>400</b>C shows the transformer winding loss as a function of a ratio of a thickness of removed sections <b>304</b>/<b>314</b> to the air gap length. As illustrated in graph <b>400</b>C, depth <b>324</b>, which may be approximately equal to depth <b>344</b>, can increases from 0 to five times a value of the air gap length (5lg). As can be seen in graph <b>400</b>C, when a depth of the recessed regions is twice the length of the air gap (2lg), the winding loss is approximately equal to 2.46 W, and when the depth of the recessed regions is 5lg , the winding loss is reduced to approximately 2.11 W. As appreciated by one of skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure, in some embodiments a ratio of depth <b>324</b> to I<sub>g </sub>may vary from 0.01 to 10, while in other embodiments the ratio may vary from 0.05 to 8, while in yet other embodiments the ratio may vary from 1 to 3.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0043">As can be seen in graph <b>400</b>C, the winding loss of planar transformer <b>300</b> can be reduced by removing sections <b>304</b> and <b>314</b> from of the I-core <b>302</b>. Therefore, the larger depth of removed sections <b>304</b> and <b>314</b> in the I-core <b>302</b> results in smaller transformer winding losses.

Planar transformer <b>500</b> can include a magnetic E-core <b>506</b> and I-core <b>502</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, a middle section of the magnetic E-core <b>506</b> can be extended into the I-core <b>502</b> in order to create a recessed section <b>512</b> in the I-core <b>502</b>, where the air gap <b>508</b> can be moved inside the recessed section <b>512</b>. In some embodiments, the air gap <b>508</b> can be partially inside the I-core <b>502</b>. In various embodiments, the air gap <b>508</b> can be completely inside the I-core <b>502</b>. In some embodiments, an optimum reduction in winding loss can be achieved by having a structure where extension distance <b>504</b> of the middle leg of the magnetic E-core <b>506</b> can be approximately equal to air gap length <b>510</b> (lg).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0045">Various shapes of the recessed section <b>512</b> in the I-core can produce varying amounts of reduction in the winding loss of the planar transformer.

As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, trapezoidal shape <b>804</b> and arc-trapezoidal shape <b>806</b> produce relatively larger reduction in the transformer winding losses. As can be seen in graph <b>800</b>, the winding losses of planar transformer can be reduced by sinking the middle leg of E-magnetic core into the I-magnetic core.
