During insertion of the annular barrier into the borehole or during the process of setting the annular barrier, e.g. when an expandable metal sleeve has been expanded, fractures or cracks in the sealing elements may develop, and tests have shown that these fractures or cracks may cause fluid to leak across the seals after expansion as the fractures or cracks open up during expansion.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is an object of the present invention to wholly or partly overcome the above disadvantages and drawbacks of the prior art.
