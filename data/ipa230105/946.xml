pertains to a) Beta-lactoglobulin or b) a nutritional composition comprising beta-lactoglobulin for use in preventing and/or treating a metabolic disorder and/or muscle atrophy. It also pertains to a method of preventing and/or treating a metabolic disorder and/or muscle atrophy in a subject. It furthermore pertains to use of a) beta-lactoglobulin or b) a nutritional composition comprising beta-lactoglobulin for increasing the level of insulin and/or glucagon in the blood of a subject and the present invention also pertains to a non-therapeutic use or method of a) beta-lactoglobulin or b) a nutritional composition comprising BLG. The present invention furthermore pertains to beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) for use in preventing and/or treating diabetes or prediabetes in a subject. It furthermore pertains to a nutritional composition for use in preventing and/or treating diabetes or prediabetes in a subject.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Insulin and glucagon are important hormones in the human metabolism as they play an important role in regulating the levels of blood glucose and lipids in the body. Insulin and glucagon thus work together to balance the blood glucose and lipid levels, keeping them in the narrow range that the body requires. Insulin lowers the blood glucose level while glucagon raises the level. Regulating these hormones is therefore very important for the treatment and/or prevention of a number of diseases such as metabolic disorders and muscle atrophy.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Insulin is an essential hormone produced in the beta-cells of the pancreatic gland, and the main role of insulin is to transport glucose from the bloodstream into the body's cells, where glucose is converted into energy. The lack of insulin or the inability of the cells to respond to insulin (decreased insulin sensitivity) leads to high levels of blood glucose, hyperglycaemia, which in time causes a variety of complications (e.g. cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, kidney disease and eye disease). Insulin also plays an important role in dampering lipid concentrations in the blood stream as insulin increases the uptake of lipids in the muscles.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Glucagon is also an essential peptide hormone, produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas. It works to raise the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream, and it is considered to be the main catabolic hormone of the body. Glucagon also has an ability to increase energy expenditure and inhibit appetite. Administration of proteins that increases the level of glucagon in the blood will therefore have a potential in the fight against for example obesity and fatty liver disease.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Insulin and glucagon are thus also closely related to diabetes mellitus (diabetes), the prevalence of which continues to increase in the western world. At present nearly half a billion people live with diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic condition that occurs when levels of glucose in the blood are elevated, due to an imbalance between insulin sensitivity and insulin production. Diabetes thus has a severe health impact, if not treated. However, if appropriate management of diabetes is achieved, the serious complications of diabetes can be delayed or prevented.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A number of attempts have therefore been taken to treat and/or prevent diabetes, see for example &#x201c;Postprandial glucose-lowering effect of premeal consumption of protein-enriched, dietary fibre fortified bar in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus or normal glucose tolerance, J Diabetes Investig Vol. 9 No. 5 September 2018 Jae Hyun Bae, Lee Kyung Kim, Se Hee Min, Chang Ho Ahn, Young Min Cho.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present inventors have made the surprising discovery that administration of BLG or a nutritional composition comprising BLG in a purity of at least 75% relative to total protein has both an insulinotropic effect and a glucagonotropic effect in human subjects. The insulin and glucagon stimulatory effects are superior to those obtained by using similar doses of whey protein isolate (WPI) as a protein source.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This opens up for using BLG-enriched products to prevent and/or treat disorders relating to imbalances of these hormones related to metabolic disorders and/or muscle atrophy or for therapeutic or non-therapeutic treatment to stimulate e.g. muscle synthesis and increasing energy expenditure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus an aspect of the present invention pertains to a) Beta-lactoglobulin or b) a nutritional composition comprising beta-lactoglobulin in an amount of at least 75% w/w relative to total protein in a therapeutically effective amount, for use in preventing and/or treating a metabolic disorder and/or muscle atrophy.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Yet an aspect of the invention pertains to a method of preventing and/or treating a metabolic disorder and/or muscle atrophy in a subject, the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a) beta-lactoglobulin or b) a nutritional composition comprising beta-lactoglobulin in an amount of at least 75% w/w relative to total protein to a subject in need thereof.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another aspect of the invention pertains to use of a) beta-lactoglobulin or b) a nutritional composition comprising beta-lactoglobulin in an amount of at least 75% w/w relative to total protein for increasing the level of insulin and/or glucagon in the blood of a subject.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Yet another aspect of the invention pertains to a non-therapeutic use of a) beta-lactoglobulin or b) a nutritional composition comprising BLG in an amount of at least 75% w/w relative to total protein for one or more of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0013">stimulating or prolonging satiety or increasing satiation</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0014">reducing food intake</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0015">increasing energy expenditure</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0016">reducing adiposity</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0017">anabolic effect</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0018">muscle anabolic effect in a subject</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0014" num="0019">Another aspect of the invention pertains to a non-therapeutic method for one or more of:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0020">stimulating or prolonging satiety or increasing satiation</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0021">reducing food intake</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0022">increasing energy expenditure</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0023">reducing adiposity</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0024">anabolic effect</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0025">muscle anabolic effect,<br/>in a subject comprising administering a) beta-lactoglobulin or b) a nutritional composition comprising beta-lactoglobulin in an amount of at least 75% w/w relative to total protein.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0015" num="0026">Yet an aspect of the invention pertains to a method of increasing the level of insulin/and or glucagon in the blood of a subject, the method comprising administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a) beta-lactoglobulin or b) a nutritional composition comprising BLG in an amount of at least 75% w/w relative to total protein.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0027">The present inventors have for example made the surprising discovery that administration of BLG has an insulinotropic effect in human subjects and therefore can be used to prevent and/or treat diabetes or prediabetes.

The insulin and glucagon stimulatory effects are superior to those obtained by using similar doses of whey protein isolate (WPI) as a protein source.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0055">This opens up for using BLG-enriched products to prevent or treat disorders relating to imbalances of these hormones related to metabolic disorders and/or muscle atrophy or for therapeutic or non-therapeutic treatment to stimulate e.g. muscle synthesis and increasing energy expenditure and reducing adiposity.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0056">An aspect of the invention pertains to a) Beta-lactoglobulin or b) a nutritional composition comprising beta-lactoglobulin in an amount of at least 75% w/w relative to total protein in a therapeutically effective amount, for use in preventing and/or treating a metabolic disorder and/or muscle atrophy.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0057">The inventors have found that BLG has superior insulinotropic and glucagonotropic effects relative to other milk proteins and BLG can therefore advantageously be used to prevent and/or treat metabolic disorder and/or muscle atrophy. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref> as well as example 4 and 5.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0058">Insulin is known to effectively damper lipid concentrations in the blood stream as insulin increase the uptake of lipids in the muscles, while glucagon have a positive impact on energy expenditure and inhibit appetite. Administration of BLG to a subject having metabolic disorder will therefore be beneficial, as this will result in an increase in the circulating glucagon and insulin concentrations.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0059">The inventors have shown that BLG intake increases the concentration of the circulating insulin, glucagon and specific amino acids such as leucine, phenylalanine, methionine, proline, tyrosine, aspartate, glutamate and lysine. The combination of insulin and especially leucine has shown particularly effective anabolic effects in muscles and may therefore be useful for preserving or building up muscle during condition such as cancer, cachexia, sarcopenia, inflammatory disease, following gastric bypass/sleeve and malnutrition, and also in the general population (including athletes) where maintenance or accretion of muscle tissue/mass is desired.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0060">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;metabolic disorder&#x201d; pertains to a condition, wherein abnormal chemical reactions in the body alter the normal metabolic process. Examples of metabolic disorders are metabolic syndrome, obesity, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, diabetes, prediabetes, and glucose intolerance.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0061">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;muscle atrophy&#x201d; pertains to a condition of loss of skeletal muscle mass that can be caused by for example sarcopenia, cachexia, endocrinopathies, malnutrition, immobility and/or reduced physical activity, side effect of medication, anabolic resistance, insulin resistance, eating disorders and hypoalbuminaemia.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0062">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;beta-lactoglobulin&#x201d; or &#x201c;BLG&#x201d; pertains to beta-lactoglobulin from mammal species, e.g. in native, unfolded and/or glycosylated forms and includes the naturally occurring genetic variants. The term furthermore includes aggregated BLG, precipitated BLG and crystalline BLG. When referring to the amount of BLG, reference is made to the total amount of BLG including aggregated BLG. The total amount of BLG is determined according to Example 1.18. The term &#x201c;aggregated BLG&#x201d; pertains to BLG which is at least partially unfolded and which, furthermore, has aggregated with other denatured BLG molecules and/or other denatured whey proteins, typically by means of hydrophobic interactions and/or covalent bonds.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0063">The term BLG pertains to non-hydrolysed BLG i.e. full length mature BLG as present in milk, which can be determined using gel filtration and/or gel electrophoresis. The term BLG thus does not include peptide fragments of BLG.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0064">BLG is the most predominant protein in bovine whey and milk serum and exists in several genetic variants, the main ones in cow milk being labelled A and B. The amino acid sequences of the genetic variants of BLG are well-known to the skilled person. The amino acid sequence of the mature bovine BLG variant B is for example found under accession number: P02754 (updated 16 Oct. 2019) in uniprot.org (amino acids 17-178).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0065">BLG is a lipocalin protein, and can bind many hydrophobic molecules, suggesting a role in their transport. BLG has also been shown to be able to bind iron via siderophores and might have a role in combating pathogens. A homologue of BLG is lacking in human breast milk.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0066">BLG is a relatively small protein of approx. 162 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of approx. 18.3-18.4 kDa. Under physiological conditions, it is predominantly dimeric, but dissociates to a monomer below about pH 3, preserving its native state as determined using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Conversely, BLG also occurs in tetrameric, octameric and other multimeric aggregation forms under a variety of natural conditions.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0067">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;non-aggregated beta-lactoglobulin&#x201d; or &#x201c;non-aggregated BLG&#x201d; also pertains to beta-lactoglobulin from mammal species, e.g. in native, unfolded and/or glycosylated forms and includes the naturally occurring genetic variants. However, the term does not include aggregated BLG, precipitated BLG or crystallised BLG. The amount or concentration of non-aggregated BLG is determined according to Example 1.4.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0068">The percentage of non-aggregated BLG relative to total BLG is determined by calculate (m<sub>total BLG</sub>&#x2212;m<sub>non-aggregate BLG</sub>)/m<sub>total BLG</sub>*100%. m<sub>total BLG </sub>is the concentration or amount of BLG determined according to Example 1.18 and m<sub>non-aggregated </sub>BLG is the concentration or amount of non-aggregated BLG determined according to Example 1.4.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0069">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;crystal&#x201d; pertains to a solid material whose constituents (such as atoms, molecules or ions) are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0070">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;BLG crystal&#x201d; pertains to protein crystals that primarily contain non-aggregated and preferably native BLG arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions. The BLG crystals may e.g. be monolithic or polycrystalline and may e.g. be intact crystals, fragments of crystals, or a combination thereof. Fragments of crystals are e.g. formed when intact crystals are subjected to mechanical shear during processing. Fragments of crystals also have the highly ordered microscopic structure of crystal but may lack the even surface and/or even edges or corners of an intact crystal. See e.g. FIG. 18 of PCT application no. PCT/EP2017/084553 for an example of many intact BLG crystals and FIG. 13 PCT application no. PCT/EP2017/084553 for an example of fragments of BLG crystals. In both cases, the BLG crystal or crystal fragments can be identified visually as well-defined, compact and coherent structures using light microscopy. BLG crystal or crystal fragments are often at least partially transparent. Protein crystals are furthermore known to be birefringent and this optical property can be used to identify unknown particles having a crystal structure. Non-crystalline BLG aggregates, on the other hand, often appear as poorly defined, non-transparent, and as open or porous lumps of irregular size.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0071">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;crystallise&#x201d; pertains to the formation of protein crystals. Crystallisation may e.g. happen spontaneously or be initiated by the addition of crystallisation seeds.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0072">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;preventing&#x201d;, &#x201c;prevent&#x201d; or &#x201c;prevention&#x201d; pertains to postponing, slowing or avoiding development of a condition such as metabolic disorder such as diabetes or prediabetes or muscle atrophy in a subject.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0073">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;treating&#x201d;, &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; and &#x201c;treat&#x201d; pertains to alleviating, curing or eliminating a condition such as metabolic disorder such as diabetes or prediabetes or muscle atrophy in a subject. Alleviating may result in reduced medication dosage of for example glucose-lowering medicaments.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0074">In some preferred embodiments of the invention, the metabolic disorder is selected from one or more of: metabolic syndrome, obesity, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, diabetes, prediabetes, and glucose intolerance.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0075">In the context of the present invention, &#x201c;metabolic syndrome&#x201d; is a complex disorder associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is linked to increased arterial blood pressure, elevated fasting glucose and insulin resistance, overweight (e.g., body mass index (BMI) greater or equal to 25 kg/m2), abdominal obesity, habitual physical inactivity, hypertension (e.g., greater or equal to 140/90 mmHg in adults, HDL cholesterol greater or equal to 35 mg/dl; triglyceride levels greater or equal to 250 mg/dl.

Parikh and Viswanathan Mohan1).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0076">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;obesity&#x201d; pertains to a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to an extent that it may have a negative effect on certain health conditions or increased mortality. Humans are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI) is over 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. BMI is a measurement, which is obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0077">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;overweight&#x201d; is defined for an adult when the BMI is in the range of 25-30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0078">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;dyslipidemia&#x201d; pertains to a condition where the person has an abnormal amount of lipids (e.g. triglycerides, cholesterol and/or fat phospholipids) in the blood. When only cholesterol levels are high or low, this is referred to as hypercholesterolemia or hypocholesterolemia.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0079">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;hypercholesterolemia&#x201d; thus pertains to a condition of the presence of high levels of non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in the blood.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0080">HDL means high density lipoprotein. &#x201c;Non-HDL cholesterol&#x201d; is often referred to as the bad cholesterol as it refers to a person's total cholesterol value minus the HDL cholesterol. LDL cholesterol means low density lipoprotein.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0081">Hypercholesterolemia is thus a form of hyperlipidemia, high blood lipids, and hyperlipoproteinemia (elevated levels of lipoproteins in the blood). Elevated levels of non-HDL cholesterol and LDL in the blood may be a consequence of diet, obesity, inherited (genetic) diseases (such as LDL receptor mutations in familial hypercholesterolemia), or the presence of other diseases such as type 2 diabetes and an underactive thyroid.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0082">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;hepatic steatosis&#x201d; or &#x201c;fatty liver disease&#x201d; refers to a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver. Often there are no or few symptoms. Occasionally there may be tiredness or pain in the upper right side of the abdomen. Complications may include cirrhosis, liver cancer, and esophageal varices.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0083">There are two types of fatty liver disease: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic liver disease. NAFLD is made up of simple fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The primary risks include alcohol, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Other risk factors include certain medications such as glucocorticoids, and hepatitis C.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0084">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;hypertriglyceridemia&#x201d; pertains to high (-hyper) blood levels (-emia) of triglycerides, the most abundant fatty molecule in most organisms. Elevated levels of triglycerides are associated with atherosclerosis, even in the absence of hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol levels), and predispose to cardiovascular disease. Very high triglyceride levels also increase the risk of acute pancreatitis. Hypertriglyceridemia itself is usually symptomless, although high levels may be associated with skin lesions known as xanthomas.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0085">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;glucose intolerance&#x201d; (GI) pertains to dysglycemia that comprises both prediabetes and diabetes. It includes the conditions of impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and diabetes mellitus (DM).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0086">In the context of the present invention the term &#x201c;diabetes&#x201d; or &#x201c;diabetes mellitus&#x201d; pertains to a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreatic beta cells do not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0087">Using WHO's definition of diabetes; a human is diagnosed with diabetes either when:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0088">1) the fasting glucose is &#x2265;126mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0089">2) 2 hour plasma glucose (PG)&#x2265;200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

Type 1 diabetes results from a cellular mediated autoimmune destruction of the beta-cells of the pancreas. The rate of beta-cell destruction is quite variable, being rapid in some individuals (mainly infants and children) and slow in others (mainly adults). Particularly adults may retain residual &#x3b2;-cell function sufficient to prevent ketoacidosis for many years. A way to determine whether a subject has a preserved beta-cell function is by measuring the subject's blood C-peptide level.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0096">A non-insulin treated subject (measured after an overnight fast) having a plasma C-peptide level above the lower reference level of 370 &#x3bc;mol/L has at least some preserved beta-cell function.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0097">Administration of BLG to a subject having type 1 diabetes, but with some preserved beta cell function, will be beneficial as this will result in an increase in the circulating GIP and/or GLP-1 and insulin concentrations.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0098">Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes and it accounts for 90-95% of patients with diabetes. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity. It occurs more frequently in women with prior Gestational diabetes (GDM) and in individuals with hypertension or dyslipidemia, and its frequency varies in different racial/ethnic subgroups. It is often associated with a strong genetic predisposition. Hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes stem from an imbalance between insulin sensitivity and beta cell function. Thus, low beta cell function and/or low insulin sensitivity leads to high blood glucose concentrations, which may be effectively avoided by improving either insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0099">Gestationel diabetes (GDM) develops in 4-5% off all pregnancies in Denmark. Most of the time, this type of diabetes is transient. However, it is well-known that GDM is associated with a substantial risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the years following the pregnancy.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0100">Latent autoimmune diabetes in adulthood (LADA) is a diabetes subtype which is primarily caused by decreasing beta cell function (e.g. low C-peptide) and treatment may initially include usual medicaments for type 2 diabetes for a certain amount of time, after which exogenous insulin treatment will become essential as it is for type 1 diabetes subjects. This has lead to the term type 1.5 diabetes.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0101">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;prediabetes&#x201d; pertains to a condition associated with higher risk of developing diabetes later in life. A subject with prediabetes is typically insulin resistant, has impaired glucose tolerance, has metabolic syndrome, is obese or is predisposed (e.g. by family history/genetics; carrying alleles that result in a higher occurrence of diabetes than in the average population or have parents or siblings with diabetes).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0102">Without lifestyle changes, a subject with prediabetes is at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0103">In some preferred embodiments of the present invention the metabolic disorder is metabolic syndrome, obesity and/or dyslipidemia.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0104">Insulin is known to effectively damper lipid concentrations in the blood stream, as insulin increases the uptake of lipids in the muscles.

It is characterized by the degenerative loss of skeletal muscle mass, quality, and strength. There are many proposed causes of sarcopenia and it is likely the result of multiple interacting factors. Understanding of the causes of sarcopenia is incomplete.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0113">Potential causes of sarcopenia are for example changes in hormones, immobility, age-related muscle changes, nutrition and neurodegenerative changes.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0114">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;cachexia&#x201d; pertains to a syndrome associated with an underlying illness causing ongoing muscle loss that is not entirely reversed with nutritional supplementation. A range of diseases can cause cachexia, most commonly cancer, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease and AIDS. Cachexia is a serious clinical consequence of almost all chronic diseases at advanced stages, it affects 50-80% of cancer patients and accounts for up to 20% of cancer deaths, with similar numbers valid for chronic heart failure. Systemic inflammation from these conditions can cause detrimental changes to metabolism and body composition.

Common endocrinopathies include hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0116">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;malnutrition&#x201d; pertains to a condition that results from eating a diet, which does not supply a healthy/sufficient amount of one or more nutrients. This includes diets that have too little nutrients so that the diet causes health problems. The nutrients involved can include calories, protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins or minerals. A lack of nutrients is called undernutrition or undernourishment while a surplus of nutrients cases overnutrition.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0117">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;immobility&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;reduced physical activity&#x201d; pertains to a condition of disuse of the muscles for a longer period of time. For example due to bedrest this will result in a significant muscle wasting. A reduced level of physical activity will also lead to loss of muscle mass, which may in part relate to a reduced sensitivity/responsiveness of the muscle.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0118">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;side effect of medication&#x201d; pertains to a condition of a medication having the unwanted side effect of negatively affecting muscle mass/quality/function.

As a result, the pancreas makes more insulin to help glucose enter the cells. As long as the pancreas can make enough insulin to overcome the cells' weak response to insulin, the blood glucose levels will stay in the healthy range.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0121">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;eating disorders&#x201d; such as anorexia nervosa and/or bulimi nervosa pertains to a condition of a mental disorder defined by abnormal eating habits that negatively affect a person's physical and/or mental health.

Without being bound by theory the insulinotrophic effect of BLG might be mediated through increased levels of GIP from the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p id="p-0531" num="0588">Previous studies have found that serving a protein pre-meal may effectively damper glucose fluctuations following a meal or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). These effects have primarily been attributed to GIP and GLP-1 release and subsequent insulin release. We therefore believe that BLG compared to whey proteins or casein may be especially potent and serve as a strategy to alleviate, treat, or hinder diabetes and high circulating concentrations of glucose.</p><heading id="h-0049" level="1">Example 5</heading><heading id="h-0050" level="1">Investigation of the Insulinotropic Effects of Beta-Lactoglobulin and Whey in Participants with T2DM</heading><p id="p-0532" num="0589">Methods</p><p id="p-0533" num="0590">Participants:</p><p id="p-0534" num="0591">Inclusion criteria were: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), age between 18 and 80 years old, BMI between 20 and 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, hemoglobin(Hb)-A1c between 40 and 69 mmol/L, and c-peptide between 370 and 1200 &#x3bc;mol/L. participants were recruited through social media (Facebook) and local newspapers.

If data were not normally distributed data were log transformed (natural logarithm). Data are presented as means with 95% confidence intervals or medians with ranges. Curves were fitted using random effects models with a natural cubic spline specification for time. Interaction terms were included for each time term and a binary variable that coded for the two pre-meals. This was combined with appropriate contrast matrices to estimate curves for both pre-meals and their difference at any time point during the study. As the outcomes were log-transformed (natural logarithm) before running the models due to their skewed distribution, the difference between curves is given in percentages. We included individual specific random intercepts and slopes in the models to account for the dependence within the data due to its repeated measurement nature. For the analysis on glucose following breakfast, measurements were included for analysis if their time points were after the recorded time of breakfast and dinner, but within three hours of the recorded time of the meals. The incremental area under the curve (iAUC) was calculated using the trapezoidal approach and a paired t-test was used for comparing each outcome during the laboratory day, and One way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare iAUC of glucose home measurements. A random effects model was used to compare CGM-based summary variables between interventions and controls.

We had expected BLG to lower glucose more in T2DM individuals because of its higher insulinotropic effects. However, as BLG surprisingly also has a higher glucagonotropic effect than WPI, the glucose lowering effect of BLG compared with WPI is not as high. The difference between the proteins in insulin and glucagon increasing abilities might be found in BLG's unique composition of amino acids. BLG contains more leucine and phenylalanine which have both been shown to stimulate insulin secretion. Likewise, methionine and tyrosine have been shown to increase glucagon concentrations. Studies on dogs and rodents have shown aspartate, glutamate, lysine, and proline to stimulate glucagon secretion as well. All these aforementioned amino acids were more elevated in plasma after BLG consumption compared with WPI. There were no difference in GIP concentrations (an important stimulator of glucagon). We therefore find it likely that the difference in insulin and glucagon concentrations is attributable to the specific AA composition of BLG.</p><p id="p-0562" num="0616">Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)&#x2014;Glucose Trajectories</p><p id="p-0563" num="0617">Both BLG and WPI pre-meals lowered postprandial interstitial fluid (ISF)-glucose concentration following breakfast compared to CTR/water.

CTR, control; WPI, whey protein isolate; BLG, beta-lactoglobulin.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="left" id="FOO-00002">*P &#x3c; 0.05</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="left" id="FOO-00003">**P &#x3c; 0.01</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0567" num="0620">Glycemic variability, maximum glucose levels and glucose excursions were all reduced after consumption of both pre-meal proteins compared with the control/water making both proteins effective pre-meals in lowering glucose in T2DM. In conclusion, BLG can be used as a pre-meal protein in the treatment of T2DM.</p><p id="p-0568" num="0621">Conclusions:</p><p id="p-0569" num="0622">BLG pre-meals elevate insulin, glucagon and glucose concentrations following an OGTT in patients with T2DM in comparison with WPI. Both protein pre-meals, WPI and BLG, lowered glucose trajectories and glycemic variability in comparison with tap-water.</p><p id="p-0570" num="0623">Glucagon has been shown to increase energy expenditure and inhibit appetite. At the moment bi-agonist of GIP and glucagon and triagonists of GIP, GLP-1 and glucagon are under development for treating obesity. BLG increases the concentrations of all these three hormones and BLG may therefore also be relevant in the treatment and/or prevention of obesity.</p><p id="p-0571" num="0624">We found that BLG increases insulin concentrations more compared with WPI. Insulin is known to effectively damper lipid concentrations in the blood stream, as insulin increases the uptake of lipids in the muscles. Hence, BLG might be effective in the treatment of dyslipidemia.</p><p id="p-0572" num="0625">Metabolic syndrome is characterized by obesity, dyslipidemia and reduced glucose tolerance. The elevation of insulin concentrations after BLG consumption lowers glucose and lipid levels. As mentioned, glucagon has been shown to increase energy expenditure, and therefore we believe, that BLG may have positive effects in weight management.</p><p id="p-0573" num="0626">Whey has been shown to promote muscle protein synthesis, improve nutritional status in cachexic patients and improve muscle mass and inhibit inflammation in patients with sarcopenia. These effects have been attributed to the high content of leucine in whey. BLG has a higher leucine content compared with WPI and in addition to this we have found that BLG surprisingly promotes a greater insulin response. We therefore believe that BLG is beneficial in patients with sarcopenia, cachexia, malnutrition and immobilization or reduced physical activity.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230000947A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="9.48mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230000947A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-64" num="01-64"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>64</b>.
