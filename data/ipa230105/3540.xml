In this case, in the terminal device T, for example, a situation is assumed in which a passenger riding on a rear seat or a passenger seat of a vehicle on which the in-vehicle system SS is mounted uses the terminal device T and wireless communication between the terminal device T and the in-vehicle equipment M is established. In the guidance processing in this case, as indicated in Table 1, the control unit <b>1</b> of the terminal device T searches for a movement route on which the vehicle on which the in-vehicle system SS is mounted moves as a vehicle route. In this case, the control unit <b>1</b> searches for the aforementioned vehicle route on the basis of, for example, destination data indicating a destination in movement using the vehicle separately input using the operation unit <b>5</b> of the terminal device T, present position data indicating the present position of the vehicle obtained by receiving a navigation radio wave, for example, from a navigation satellite of a global positioning system (GPS), which is not illustrated, and the like. Then, the control unit <b>1</b> transmits an audio signal corresponding to a guidance audio necessary for the guidance processing along the vehicle route to the in-vehicle equipment M via, for example, the connection units provided in the attachment unit <b>7</b> and the attachment unit BS, and causes the guidance audio corresponding to the audio signal to be emitted via the vehicle speaker SP connected to the in-vehicle equipment M. Further, since the terminal device T performing the guidance processing as the in-vehicle mode is assumed to be used by the aforementioned passenger (that is, the passenger who visually recognizes the image displayed on the display <b>4</b>), it is not necessary to present images of the front, rear, inside, and the like of the vehicle as the driving support information to the passenger, and therefore, the control unit <b>1</b> prohibits image interrupt to the display on the display <b>4</b> on the basis of the aforementioned image interrupt request data, which is performed by acquiring the aforementioned image data corresponding to the imaging result by the camera <b>14</b> from the in-vehicle equipment M. Furthermore, the control unit <b>1</b> also prohibits travel restriction (that is, the restriction of the display of a moving image or the like on the display <b>1</b> at a speed equal to or higher than the aforementioned threshold speed from the viewpoint of safe driving) based on the aforementioned travel restriction instruction data from the in-vehicle equipment M.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0035">On the other hand, in the determination in step S<b>2</b> described above, in a case where the aforementioned attachment detection signal is output, that is, in a case where the terminal device T is attached to the in-vehicle equipment M (step S<b>2</b>: YES), the control unit <b>1</b> controls each of the constituent members of the terminal device T and the in-vehicle equipment M so as to execute the aforementioned guidance processing as the &#x201c;driver mode&#x201d; to be described below (step S<b>5</b>). The guidance processing as the driver mode will be described in detail below with reference to Table 1.

In this case, a situation in which the terminal device T is used by the aforementioned driver to receive movement guidance is assumed. In the guidance processing in this case, the control unit <b>1</b> of the terminal device T searches for the aforementioned vehicle route as indicated in Table 1. Then, the control unit <b>1</b> causes the guidance audio necessary for the guidance processing along the vehicle route to be emitted via the vehicle speaker SP similarly to the guidance processing as the aforementioned in-vehicle mode, and displays an image such as a map image necessary for the guidance processing on the display <b>4</b>. Further, the control unit <b>1</b> executes both the aforementioned image interrupt as necessary on the basis of the aforementioned image interrupt request data from the in-vehicle equipment M and the aforementioned travel restriction as necessary on the basis of the aforementioned travel restriction instruction data from the in-vehicle equipment M.

In a case where it is determined in the determination in step S<b>6</b> that the aforementioned attachment detection signal is not output and thus the terminal device T is not attached to the in-vehicle equipment M (step S<b>6</b>: NO), for example, the control unit <b>1</b> displays, on the display <b>4</b>, for example, a setting screen that urges setting of wireless communication between the wireless communication unit <b>10</b> of the in-vehicle equipment M and the wireless communication unit <b>2</b> of the terminal device T so as to urge the person who uses the terminal device T to set the wireless communication (step S<b>8</b>).

In this case, for example, a situation in which the terminal device T is taken out of the vehicle (that is, carried) and used is assumed. In the guidance processing in this case, as indicated in Table 1, the control unit <b>1</b> of the terminal device T searches for a movement route on which the person who carries the terminal device T moves, for example, on foot (without using the vehicle on which the in-vehicle system SS is mounted) as a walking route. In this case, the control unit <b>1</b> searches for the aforementioned walking route on the basis of, for example, destination data indicating a destination in walking movement input using the operation unit <b>5</b> of the terminal device T, current position data indicating the current position of the terminal device T, and the like. Then, the control unit <b>1</b> causes a guidance audio necessary for the guidance processing along the walking route to be emitted via the speaker <b>6</b> of the terminal device T. Further, since the terminal device T performing the guidance processing as the terminal device mode is assumed to be used outside the vehicle as described above, the control unit <b>1</b> displays an image necessary for the guidance processing on the display <b>4</b>. Further, the control unit <b>1</b> does not perform the aforementioned image interrupt or the aforementioned travel restriction.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0040">As described above, according to the information processing mainly by the terminal device T of the in-vehicle system SS of the example, the operation mode (in-vehicle mode and the like (see Table 1)) is switched on the basis of the
