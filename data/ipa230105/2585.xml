to the technical field of binders that can replace bitumen, particularly in the field of road construction. More specifically, the invention relates to pitch compositions, methods for their preparation and their use in road and industrial applications.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A deasphalting pitch can be incorporated into bitumen compositions, in a mixture with a bitumen base. The deasphalting pitch constitutes an economical component which gives the composition hardness. However, the main defect of deasphalting pitch is its low penetration index defined in standard EN 1427-Appendix B, which is below &#x2212;1.5, making it highly sensitive to temperature contrary to standard bitumen. Pitches thus do not correspond to the road construction requirements defined in standard EN 12591 and EN 13924-1, particularly standard EN 12591. Moreover, a deasphalting pitch is more sensitive to oxidation compared to standard bitumen, due to its higher content in asphaltene. When it is incorporated into a bitumen composition, this is generally in a limited quantity, usually not exceeding 20 to 30% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the composition. In the case where it is mixed with an oxidised bitumen base, a higher content, possibly reaching 75% by weight of the total composition, can be adopted.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Within the scope of the invention, the applicant proposes novel pitch compositions which are adapted to act as binders, particularly in the field of road construction, and, in particular, which can be used to manufacture mixes or asphalts.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The pitch compositions according to the invention could therefore constitute a substitute for bitumen compositions, which would be particularly advantageous in the case of bitumen shortages. In addition, within the context of the decision by the World Maritime Organisation to reduce in 2020 the maximum sulphur limit in maritime fuels to 0.5% by weight, the available pitch tonnage could increase and the invention would be a new way of upgrading deasphalting pitches.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Invention</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this context, the inventors have developed new pitch compositions which have an elevated penetration index, measured according to standard EN 1427-Appendix B, compared to the same pitch compositions which do not contain sodium hydroxide.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention relates to a pitch composition comprising a mixture of:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0008">deasphalting pitch, which represents at least 50% by weight, and preferably at least 80% by weight, and preferentially at least 90% by weight, of the total weight of the composition, and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0009">a hydroxide XOH with X=Na or K, which represents from 0.001 to 1% by weight, preferably from 0.002 to 0.5% by weight, and preferentially from 0.01 to 0.5% by weight of the total weight of the composition.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0010">Advantageously, a composition according to the invention has one of the following characteristics, several of the following characteristics, if not all of the following characteristics:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0011">the hydroxide XOH, with X=Na or K, forms particles which have a mean maximum size in the range from 10 to 100 &#x3bc;m, preferably in the range from 20 to 60 &#x3bc;m and/or which have a maximum size less than or equal to 100 &#x3bc;m, preferably less than or equal to 60 &#x3bc;m;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0012">the hydroxide XOH is soda;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0013">it has a penetration index determined according to standard EN 1427-Appendix B, greater than &#x2212;1.5, preferably greater than or equal to &#x2212;1.3;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0014">it has needle penetration at 25&#xb0;

Deasphalting pitches, also called pitches within the scope of the invention for reasons of simplicity, present characteristics that differ from those of bitumen, particularly in terms of penetration index and, consequently, do not belong to the bitumen class.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0034">A deasphalting pitch can be obtained by the usual methods applied in oil refineries. During refining processes, petroleum is subjected to a succession of atmospheric distillations and distillations under reduced pressure (commonly known as vacuum distillation). The distillation under atmospheric pressure and distillation under reduced pressure, used in petroleum refining are known to the person skilled in the art, as reported in the field of the invention presentation. All distillation processes under atmospheric pressure, leading to a distillation residue under atmospheric pressure and all distillation processes under reduced pressure, and leading to a residue of distillation under reduced pressure (or under vacuum) can be used.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0035">Conventionally, to begin with, petroleum is subjected to distillation under atmospheric pressure (i.e. at 1013.25 hPa), which produces a gas phase, various distillates and a residue of atmospheric distillation. This first distillation step makes it possible to recover various hydrocarbon fractions (gas: butane and propane, light petroleum, heavy naphtha, kerosene, gasoil, domestic fuel, . . . ) separated according to their boiling point. Atmospheric distillation is carried out in a plate column. At the end of this distillation under atmospheric pressure, there remains a heavy residual fraction, which is called the atmospheric residue or the atmospheric distillation residue. This atmospheric residue contains long-chain hydrocarbons which, due to this, are fragile and therefore likely to be cleaved into smaller chains, if heating is carried out under atmospheric pressure. Next, the atmospheric distillation residue itself is subjected to distillation under reduced pressure, called vacuum distillation, which makes it possible to separate heavy diesel, various distillate cuts and a vacuum distillation residue. The reduced pressure used for this second distillation is, in general, in the range from 10 to 150 hPa. Such reduced pressure reduces the temperature at which components evaporate, and thus allows heating to be reduced. Distillation under reduced pressure is also carried out in plate column or packed column, or a dual system combining these columns. At the end of this vacuum distillation step, there remains a heavy residual fraction, which is called the vacuum distillation residue, or the reduced pressure distillation residue.

It is also possible that the method for preparation of pitch compositions according to the invention comprises a storage step of the hydrocarbonated composition IC for at least one hour and for example for a period of 1 to 30 days, particularly at a temperature in the range from 10 to 40&#xb0; C. and, preferably, at a temperature in the range from 20 to 30&#xb0; C., and, particularly in ambient air. The hydrocarbonated composition IC is fairly stable under such conditions, so that even the same hydrocarbonated composition IC with specific characteristics may be used for the preparation of several pitch compositions. Moreover, the hydrocarbonated composition IC can be stored and transported without particular precautions, contrary to the hydroxide XOH.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0095">According to the embodiments, which can be combined with the preceding, before the addition of the hydroxide to the initial pitch composition, the method according to the invention can include a verification step, for example by microscopy, and advantageously by visible light microscopy, that the hydroxide forms particles in the hydrocarbonated composition IC with at least 80% by number of said particles having a mean maximum size in the range from 10 to 100 &#x3bc;m, and preferentially in the range from 20 to 60 &#x3bc;m and/or said particles having a maximum size less than or equal to 100 &#x3bc;m, preferably less than or equal to 60 &#x3bc;m. In an even more preferred manner, the method according to the invention can include a verification step, for example by microscopy, and advantageously by visible light microscopy, that the hydroxide XOH is found in the hydrocarbonated composition IC in the form of particles having a maximum size in the range from 10 to 100 &#x3bc;m, preferably in the range from 20 to 60 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0096">When an intermediary composition IC is used, before its introduction in the initial pitch composition, the hydrocarbonated composition IC will be, preferably, heated at a temperature in the range from 30 to 50&#xb0; C., preferably in the range from 40 to 50&#xb0; C., advantageously with stirring and, in particular, stirring at 300 to 1000 rpm, preferably stirring from 400 to 800 rpm and/or for a period of 10 to 120 minutes, preferably from 10 to 20 minutes. A low temperature, preferably 40 to 50&#xb0; C., is also advantageous to promote control of the size of the particles of hydroxide XOH.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0097">Such a temperature is, in particular, used when the component CH has a kinematic viscosity at 60&#xb0; C. in the range from 20 to 20,000 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, preferably in the range from 50 to 150 mm<sup>2</sup>/s. Here again, the mixing and temperature are adjusted by the person skilled in the art as a function of the hydrocarbonated component CH selected.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0098">Conventionally, the hydroxide, whether introduced directly in the form of a powder, solution or hydrocarbonated composition IC, is done so, in the initial pitch composition, with mixing and heating. In general, the initial pitch composition is heated with stirring, prior to incorporation of the hydroxide. The mixing and heating parameters will be adjusted by the person skilled in the art as a function of the properties of the pitch used.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0099">The incorporation of hydroxide particles, whether this is in the form of a powder, a solution or a hydrocarbonated composition IC, may be carried out by mixing at a temperature in the range from 150 to 220&#xb0; C., preferably at a temperature in the range from 160 to 190&#xb0; C. and/or with stirring in the range from 100 to 500 rpm, preferably in the range from 200 to 400 rpm and/or for a period of 10 to 180 minutes, preferably for a period of 10 to 120 minutes. Here again, the mixing and temperature parameters will be adjusted by the person skilled in the art as a function of the selected components. The mixing and heating can be maintained for a period of time at the end of incorporation, in particular at a temperature ranging from 160 to 190&#xb0; C. and/or with stirring in the range from 100 to 500 rpm, and/or for a period of 10 to 240 minutes.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0100">Whatever the method used, the final pitch composition can correspond to the composition obtained directly at the end of step b. When the pitch composition includes one or several additives, these additive(s) may be incorporated in the pitch composition before introduction of the hydroxide or introduced after the hydroxide. When the composition includes several additives, it is, also, possible that one or other additives might already be present and that one or several additive(s) are introduced later. According to a preferred embodiment, the method according to the invention includes after step b, an additional step corresponding to the addition of an additive leading to a final pitch composition.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0101">In particular, when the final pitch composition includes an adhesion promoter such as that described within the scope of the invention, such an adhesion promoter is, preferably, introduced in step c, subsequently to step b after introduction of the hydroxide.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0102">In the method according to the invention, initial pitch composition refers to the composition comprising the pitch into which the hydroxide is introduced. The latter may consist entirely of pitch, a mixture of pitch with one or several additives(s) and/or a bitumen base. The components of the initial pitch compositions will be present in amounts adapted to obtain the desired amounts in the pitch composition according to the invention. Although this is not preferred, it is not excluded that the initial pitch composition includes bitumen, and in particular a hard-grade bitumen, particularly of grade 10/20 or 15/25 specified by standard 13924-1 or 20/30 or 30/45 or 35/50 specified by standard EN 12591, but in limited amounts, such that in the end, pitch represents at least 50% by weight, and preferably at least 80% by weight, and preferentially at least 90% by weight, of the total weight of the pitch composition obtained. In particular, the absence of hard-grade bitumen in the initial pitch composition makes it possible to make up just one mixture in the drum, as incorporation of the hydroxide can be carried out in-line directly.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Compositions According to the Invention&#x2014;Preferred Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0096" num="0103">The invention relates to modified pitch compositions comprising a deasphalting pitch and a hydroxide XOH such as described within the scope of the invention.
