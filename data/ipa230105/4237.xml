Users simply need to place an electronic product with a receiving coil on a wireless charger with a transmitting coil for wireless charging without requiring any cable connection. Charging can be performed anytime and anywhere, which is very convenient.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the wireless charging technology, magnetic resonance is used to achieve the effect of wireless charging. A magnetic resonance type wireless charging uses resonant devices (including inductors and capacitors) to drive a transmitting end and a receiving end to reach a specific frequency, so as to generate magnetic field resonance and energy.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although the magnetic resonance type wireless charging has the advantage of high transmission efficiency and becomes a focus of the development of the related industry, surrounding rings of a coil cannot be arranged side by side with one another when the magnetic resonance principle is used to achieve the wireless charging effect, and the substrate for accommodating the coil must requires a plurality of grooves for the surrounding rings. Moreover, the process of forming many grooves on the same substrate has certain technical issues, and it is necessary to overcome a large barrier to integrate the wireless charging function into a mouse pad because the process of forming many grooves on the same substrate is very difficult.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, it is a primary objective to provide a flexible wireless charging mouse pad that adopts the principle of electromagnetic induction together with a coil module formed by arranging a plurality of surrounding rings side by side with one another to overcome the technical issue of forming many grooves on the same flexible board layer of the related-art wireless charging mouse pad and this disclosure only requires to set or form one single-ring groove on the flexible board layer.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To achieve the aforementioned and other objectives, this disclosure discloses a flexible wireless charging mouse pad, including; an anti-slip cushion layer with a topside and having a single-ring groove concavely formed on the topside in a longitudinal direction, and an inner bottom groove wall formed on a concave end point of the single-ring groove; a double-sided adhesive layer, attached and adhered to the topside; and a coil, having a plurality of surrounding rings arranged side by side with one another in a lateral direction, and each of the surrounding rings of the coil in the single-ring groove being stacked and coupled between the double-sided adhesive layer and the inner bottom groove wall in the longitudinal direction and adhered by the double-sided adhesive layer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Compared with the related art, this disclosure has the following effect. Only one single-ring groove is set or formed on the flexible board layer to achieve the wireless charging of a mouse by the mouse pad. This disclosure has the advantages of reducing manufacturing difficulty, lowering manufacturing cost, and improving market competitiveness.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded view of a mouse pad of this disclosure, viewing from the bottom;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic view of an assembled mouse pad of this disclosure mouse pad, viewing from the top; and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an assembled mouse pad of this disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The technical contents of this disclosure will become apparent with the detailed description of embodiments accompanied with the illustration of related drawings as follows. It is intended that the embodiments and drawings disclosed herein are to be considered illustrative rather than restrictive.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref> for a flexible wireless charging mouse pad of this disclosure (hereinafter referred to as the &#x201c;mouse pad&#x201d;), the mouse pad is a flexible mouse pad with a wireless charging function. The mouse pad of this disclosure includes an anti-slip cushion layer <b>1</b>, a double-sided adhesive layer <b>5</b>, and a coil <b>6</b>. In some embodiments, the mouse pad further includes a contact layer <b>2</b>, a plastic sheet layer <b>3</b>, and a cloth layer <b>4</b> as described below.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The anti-slip cushion layer <b>1</b> may be any soft (flexible) anti-slip pad, as long as it is a soft (flexible) pad with an anti-slip effect and capable of setting or forming a groove as described below. In this embodiment, the anti-slip cushion layer <b>1</b> may be a rubber anti-slip pad or a silicone anti-slip pad, but this disclosure is not limited to such arrangement only. The anti-slip cushion layer <b>1</b> has a topside <b>11</b> and an underside <b>12</b> opposite to each other, and only one single-ring groove <b>13</b> is set or formed on the topside <b>11</b> of the anti-slip cushion layer <b>1</b>. In some embodiments, a communicating slot <b>14</b> is set or formed and the communicating slot <b>14</b> communicates between the single-ring groove <b>13</b> and the outside. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the anti-slip cushion layer <b>1</b> has a length and a width extending along respectively a lateral direction D<b>2</b> and the other lateral direction (not labeled and perpendicular to D<b>2</b> and D<b>1</b>), and a thickness extending along a longitudinal direction D<b>1</b>, so that the aforementioned single-ring groove <b>13</b> is concavely formed on the topside <b>11</b> along the longitudinal direction D<b>1</b>, and an inner bottom groove wall <b>131</b> is formed on a concave end point.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The single-ring groove <b>13</b> may be set or formed openly, that is, the required single-ring groove <b>13</b> may be directly formed on the underside <b>12</b>. In other words, the single-ring groove <b>13</b> is directly evacuated from the underside <b>13</b>. The aforementioned method may be in a stacking form in which the anti-slip cushion layer is stacked and combined to form the required single-ring groove <b>13</b>. For example, two bottom plates are stacked under a large top plate, and the two bottom plates are separated from each other, so that the required single-ring groove <b>13</b> is formed between the top plate and the two bottom plates. In other words, the single-ring groove <b>13</b> is sunken into the underside <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The double-sided adhesive layer <b>5</b> is a one-piece form of double-sided adhesive tape having an area corresponding to the area of the anti-slip cushion layer <b>1</b>, but this disclosure is not limited to this arrangement, and the area of the double-sided adhesive layer <b>5</b> may also be slightly greater than or smaller than the area of the anti-slip cushion layer <b>1</b> (not shown in the figure). The double-sided adhesive layer <b>5</b> has a side attached or adhered to the topside <b>11</b> of the anti-slip cushion layer <b>1</b> and the other side adhered and fixed to the contact layer <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The coil <b>6</b> has a plurality of surrounding rings <b>61</b>. In particular, the surrounding rings <b>61</b> are arranged side by side with one another to form a coil module (which is not labeled with a numeral and is formed by connecting a plurality of wires (or the surrounding rings <b>61</b>)) side by side with one another along the lateral direction D<b>2</b>, and the coil module is installed into the single-ring groove <b>13</b> along the longitudinal direction D<b>1</b> and stacked and coupled between a side of the double-sided adhesive plate <b>5</b> and the inner bottom groove wall <b>131</b> along the longitudinal direction D<b>1</b>, and the coil module is adhered by the double-sided adhesive plate <b>5</b>. It is noteworthy that the coil <b>6</b> may be used to adhere the coil module with a side of the double-sided adhesive layer <b>5</b> first, and then the side of the double-sided adhesive layer <b>5</b> is attached and adhered to the topside <b>11</b> of the anti-slip cushion layer <b>1</b>, while the coil module of the coil <b>6</b> is set and fixed into the single-ring groove <b>13</b> along the longitudinal direction D<b>1</b> correspondingly. The coil <b>6</b> may also be used to set the coil module into the single-ring groove <b>13</b> along the longitudinal direction D<b>1</b>, and then a side of the double-sided adhesive layer <b>5</b> is attached and adhered to the topside <b>11</b> of the anti-slip cushion layer <b>1</b> while the coil module of the coil <b>6</b> is adhered by a side of the double-sided adhesive layer <b>5</b> and fixed into the single-ring groove <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Both the head and tail of the coil <b>6</b> are arranged to form an overhang <b>611</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), and the overhang <b>611</b> is disposed in the communicating slot <b>14</b>, so that the coil <b>6</b> may be connected to an external power supply through the overhang <b>611</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Although the other side of the double-sided adhesive layer <b>5</b> has a little effect of contacting the mouse for use, the mouse pad of this disclosure further includes a contact layer <b>3</b> stacked and coupled the other side of the double-sided adhesive layer <b>5</b> along the longitudinal direction D<b>1</b> and adhered and fixed by the double-sided adhesive layer <b>5</b> to further improve the contact effect. The contact layer <b>3</b> may be a piece of cloth, a film or a plastic sheet.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">After the mouse pad of the disclosure is electrically connected to a power, a user may put a mouse (not shown in the figures) with the wireless charging function in a corresponding position on the other side of the double-sided adhesive layer <b>5</b> or on the contact layer to charge the mouse on the mouse pad by the principle of electromagnetic induction. Since the anti-slip cushion layer <b>1</b> only has one single-ring groove <b>13</b>, therefore this disclosure may overcome the difficulty of forming a number of grooves in the same flexible board layer <b>1</b> of related art, and has the effects of reducing the manufacturing difficulty, lowering the manufacturing cost, and improving the market competitiveness. In addition, the anti-slip cushion layer <b>1</b> acts as the anti-slip pad at the same time as well as a substrate used for setting or forming the single-ring groove <b>13</b> to achieve the effect of saving the material cost.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The mouse pad of this disclosure further includes a plastic sheet layer <b>3</b> stacked and coupled between the contact layer <b>2</b> and the other side of the double-sided adhesive layer <b>5</b> along the longitudinal direction D<b>1</b>. The plastic sheet layer <b>3</b> may be a rubber sheet or a sheet made of a material similar to plastics, and the plastic sheet layer <b>3</b> has a topside <b>31</b> and an underside <b>32</b> opposite to each other, and the contact layer <b>2</b> is stacked and fixed to the topside <b>31</b> of the plastic sheet layer <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the mouse pad of this disclosure further includes a cloth layer <b>4</b> stacked and coupled between the underside <b>32</b> of the plastic sheet layer <b>3</b> and the other side of the double-sided adhesive layer <b>5</b> in the longitudinal direction D<b>1</b>. In addition to the cloth layer <b>4</b> being adhered and fixed by the other side of the double-sided adhesive layer <b>5</b>, the plastic sheet layer <b>3</b> and the cloth layer <b>4</b> may also be engaged with each other by hot pressing. The cloth layer <b>4</b> is a non-woven fabric or any other fabric capable of engaging with the plastic sheet layer <b>3</b> by hot pressing. Therefore, the coil module of the coil <b>6</b> may be stacked and coupled between the inner bottom groove wall <b>131</b> and a side of the double-sided adhesive layer <b>5</b> inside the single-ring groove <b>13</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.
