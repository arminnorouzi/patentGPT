However, recently, the interval between the image sensor and the lens can be adjusted by a lens driving device such as a voice coil motor, so that the mobile phone can obtain a more improved image.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A conventional voice coil motor includes a mover, a stator, an elastic member, and a cover can. The mover includes a coil block that produces a magnetic field to drive a lens up and down. The stator faces the mover, and produces a magnetic field to drive the mover. The elastic member elastically supports the mover that moves up and down. The cover can covers the mover, the stator and the elastic member.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, in order to produce the magnetic field from the coil block, the coil block is electrically connected to the elastic member, and the elastic member is electrically connected to an external circuit board.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In recent years, in order to block harmful electromagnetic waves produced from the voice coil motor, the cover can covers surfaces of the voice coil motor other than a bottom surface thereof. Such a construction causes a portion of the elastic member for connecting the elastic member to the external circuit board and the cover can to be short-circuited, so that the malfunction of the voice coil motor frequently occurs.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, the present invention provides a voice coil motor, which is intended to inhibit a cover can for blocking harmful electromagnetic waves and a portion of an elastic member supplying power to a coil block from being electrically short-circuited, thus inhibiting the malfunction of the voice coil motor.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one general aspect of the present invention, there is provided a voice coil motor, the motor comprising: a mover including a bobbin equipped with a lens and a coil block secured to an outer circumference of the bobbin; a stator including a magnet that is disposed in such a way as to face the coil block; elastic members coupled to a lower end of the bobbin and connected to both ends of the coil block; a base supporting the elastic members and the stator; and a cover can covering the mover, the stator and the base, with an opening being formed in the cover can to expose the lens therethrough, wherein each of the elastic members comprises a terminal portion that extends between the cover can and a side surface of the base, the terminal portion including a short-circuit prevention portion so as to inhibit a short-circuit between the terminal portion and the cover can.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view showing a voice coil motor in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view showing an external appearance of the voice coil motor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sectional view taken along line I-I&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an enlarged view showing portion &#x2018;A&#x2019; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a sectional perspective view showing a short-circuit prevention portion of a voice coil motor in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a sectional perspective view showing a short-circuit prevention portion of a voice coil motor in accordance with a further exemplary embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a sectional perspective view showing a short-circuit prevention portion of a voice coil motor in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a sectional perspective view showing a short-circuit prevention portion and a guide portion of a voice coil motor in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention; and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a perspective view showing the guide portion and the short-circuit prevention portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.
