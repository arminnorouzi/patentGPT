A filter head is described on which a serviceable filter cartridge arrangement is positioned in use. Methods of assembly and use are also provided.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Circulating liquid systems such as hydraulic fluids and lubricating fluids, typically require a filter arrangement. The filter arrangement is typically positioned so that the fluids are filtered by passage through filter media positioned within the filter arrangement. Typically the filter arrangement is configured so that the componentry containing the media is a service part, i.e., the media can, periodically, be removed and be replaced.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are two common types of liquid filter arrangements. The first, typically referred to herein as a &#x201c;spin-on&#x201d; type, involves a filter head installed on equipment, and a spin-on filter member or cartridge. The filter member or cartridge is often referred to as &#x201c;spin-on&#x201d; because the assembly including the filter media is typically secured to the filter head by threading. In spin-on arrangements, the filter media is typically non-removably secured within a shell or housing as a housing/media combination, and the entire housing/media combination, as a filter member or cartridge, is removed and replaced during servicing.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The second common type of liquid filter arrangement is referred to herein as a bowl/cartridge arrangement. With a bowl/cartridge arrangement, the filter head is again installed on the equipment. The filter media, however, is contained within a filter cartridge in a form removably positioned within a housing or shell. A housing/cartridge combination is again mounted on the filter head for use. However, during servicing, the housing is disconnected from the filter head, the media contained within the housing or shell is replaced, and the same shell or housing, with the replacement media inside, is then remounted on the filter head.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A well-functioning filter arrangement is important in protecting downstream equipment, such as an engine or hydraulic machinery. Improvements in filter arrangements are always desirable.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, a filter cartridge comprises: (a) a treatment media construction having a first end and an opposite second end;

Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, reference numeral <b>20</b> generally indicates a liquid filter assembly according to the present disclosure. The liquid filter assembly <b>20</b> includes a filter head <b>22</b> and a filter cartridge <b>24</b>. The filter head <b>22</b> is typically installed on equipment, in a liquid line, for example a hydraulic line or lubricating fluid (oil) line. During servicing the filter head <b>22</b> would typically remain in place in the equipment.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The filter cartridge <b>24</b>, on the other hand, is removably mounted on the filter head <b>22</b>. Servicing is provided by replacement of the media contained within the filter cartridge <b>24</b>. The filter cartridge <b>24</b> depicted herein is a spin-on type of filter cartridge. Thus, during servicing, the entire filter cartridge <b>24</b>, including both the media and outer housing, is removed and discarded and replaced with an entirely new filter cartridge <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the cross section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a central longitudinal axis <b>26</b> is depicted, around which the filter assembly <b>20</b> is positioned. The terms &#x201c;axial&#x201d;, &#x201c;axially&#x201d; and variants thereof, as used herein, is generally meant to refer to a feature extending in the general direction of the axis <b>26</b>. The terms &#x201c;radial&#x201d;, &#x201c;radially&#x201d;, and variants thereof, are meant to refer to a direction toward or away from the axis <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Still in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the filter head <b>22</b> includes a liquid flow inlet <b>28</b> and a liquid flow outlet <b>30</b>. During operation, liquid to be filtered is directed into the filter head <b>22</b> through the inlet <b>28</b>. Liquid is then directed through the filter cartridge <b>24</b> for filtration. The filtered liquid is then returned to the filter head <b>22</b> to exit through the outlet <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In a typical system, the filter head <b>22</b> comprises a cast metal part, for example, cast aluminum, with various features added thereto.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">While many embodiments are possible, in the one shown, the filter head <b>22</b> includes a flange <b>32</b>, which can have bolt holes <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> for securing the filter at <b>22</b> to the equipment.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Secured to the flange <b>32</b> is an end wall <b>36</b>. The end wall <b>36</b> will typically include an inlet opening <b>38</b> in communication with the inlet <b>28</b>, to allow for the flow of liquid from the filter head <b>22</b> into the cartridge <b>24</b>. End wall <b>36</b> will also have an outlet opening <b>40</b> to allow for the flow of filtered liquid from the cartridge <b>24</b> into the filter head <b>22</b> to allow it to exit through the main outlet <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Extending axially from the end wall <b>36</b> is a circumferential band <b>42</b>. The band <b>42</b> has a surrounding wall <b>44</b> with an exterior surface <b>46</b> and an opposite interior or inner radial surface <b>48</b>. The inner radial surface <b>48</b> include a system to allow for selective attachment and detachment between the filter head <b>22</b> and the filter cartridge <b>24</b>, which is discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The filter cartridge <b>24</b> is shown in perspective view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and cross section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> connected to the filter head <b>22</b>. The filter cartridge <b>24</b> includes a filter housing <b>50</b>. The filter housing <b>50</b> includes an external can or shell <b>52</b> that has a surrounding wall <b>54</b>. The surrounding wall <b>54</b> has an exterior surface <b>56</b> and an opposite interior surface <b>58</b>. There is a closed bottom <b>60</b> and an opposite mouth <b>62</b> that interfaces with the filter head <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The shell <b>52</b> can include a plurality of anti-slip dimples <b>53</b> circumferentially spaced about the shell <b>52</b> adjacent to the mouth <b>62</b>. The dimples <b>53</b> can be helpful for the user to be able to apply a grip on the cartridge <b>24</b>, when attaching or removing the cartridge <b>24</b> and the filter head <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Typically, the outer shell <b>52</b> comprises a metal component. The housing <b>50</b> defines an interior volume <b>64</b>. Within the interior volume <b>64</b> is positioned a filter media construction <b>66</b>. The filter media construction <b>66</b> comprises a filter media <b>68</b> positioned in extension between a second (lower) end cap <b>70</b> and a first (upper) end construction <b>71</b>. The end construction <b>71</b> is adjacent to a first end of the media construction <b>66</b> and can be part of a first end cap <b>72</b> secured to the media construction <b>66</b>. The media <b>68</b> can comprise a variety of materials as selected for the particular operation and conditions to be encountered. Typically, the filter media <b>68</b> would be provided in a pleated form, although alternatives are possible. A variety of types or shapes of media or media pleats can be used. Adhesive beads, for example, can help maintain media integrity and pleat spacing. In some alternative arrangements, the media <b>68</b> can be lined with a plastic or wire mesh screen, if desired.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Filter media construction <b>66</b> can be tubular in shape and configured around, and defines, an open filter interior volume <b>74</b>. Positioned within the opened filter interior volume <b>74</b> is an internal media support <b>76</b>, in this example, comprising a porous liner extending along the media <b>68</b> between the end caps <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> and secured to the end caps <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Although alternatives are possible, in the example shown, the second end cap <b>70</b> is a closed end cap, meaning it has a closed center prohibiting passage therethrough of unfiltered liquid. The tubular filter media construction <b>66</b> has a first end <b>80</b>, which is secured to the first end cap <b>72</b>, and an opposite second end <b>82</b>, which is secured to the second end cap <b>70</b>. The media <b>68</b> is secured to the second end cap <b>70</b> by various methods, including adhering or potting, or by molding in place on the media <b>68</b>. A variety of materials can be used for the end cap <b>70</b>, which can include metal or plastic.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The first end cap <b>72</b>, on the other hand, is typically an open end cap defining a central flow aperture <b>84</b> therethrough. The aperture <b>84</b> is positioned in direct flow communication with the interior <b>74</b> of the media <b>68</b>. Herein, the term &#x201c;direct flow communication&#x201d; is meant to refer to a passageway that allows a flow communication with the interior <b>74</b> in a manner that does not require passage through the media <b>68</b>. That is, liquid within the interior <b>74</b> can flow through the aperture <b>84</b> directly, without passing through the media <b>68</b> at the same time. Of course, the liquid does not reach the interior <b>74</b> unless it has first passed through the media <b>68</b> in the first instance, for an &#x201c;out-to-in&#x201d; flow arrangement as described.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As indicated, the filter cartridge <b>24</b> depicted is configured for out-to-in flow, during filtering. By this, it is meant that unfiltered liquid is directed from the filter head <b>22</b> into an annulus <b>86</b> around the media <b>68</b> and between the interior surface <b>58</b> of the wall <b>54</b>; and then through the media <b>68</b>, through the support <b>76</b> and into the interior <b>74</b>. The filtered liquid is then directed upwardly through central flow aperture <b>84</b> in the first end cap <b>72</b>, back into the filter head <b>22</b> through the outlet opening <b>40</b> and then out through the outlet exit <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">It is noted that many of the principles described herein can be utilized in association with a &#x201c;in-to-out&#x201d; flow arrangement, in which the flow direction for liquid being filtered is in the reverse direction, i.e., through the aperture <b>84</b>, into the interior <b>76</b>, through the media <b>68</b>, into the annulus <b>86</b>, and then back into the filter head <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In general, a seal arrangement is needed between the filter cartridge <b>24</b> and the filter head <b>22</b> in order to prevent liquid flow from bypassing the media <b>68</b> as it is directed through the filter cartridge <b>24</b>. Such a seal arrangement is provided by a seal member <b>88</b> on the cartridge <b>24</b> to form a seal between and against the cartridge <b>24</b> and the filter head <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Attention is directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, in which the first end construction <b>71</b> is illustrated, either by itself or in combination with other features. The first end construction <b>71</b> includes an outer radial wall <b>90</b>. The outer radial wall <b>90</b> extends at least a portion of the length of the filter media construction <b>66</b> from the first end <b>80</b> in a direction toward the second end <b>82</b>. The outer radial wall <b>90</b> covers or overlaps a portion of the media construction <b>66</b>. While many examples are possible, in the one shown, the outer radial wall <b>90</b> overlaps less than 25% and greater than 5% of an overall length of the filter media construction between the first end <b>80</b> and second end <b>82</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the outer radial wall <b>90</b> of the first end construction <b>71</b> is shown enlarged. The outer radial wall <b>90</b> defines a seal member seat <b>92</b>, which holds the seal member <b>88</b>. In the example shown, the seal member seat <b>92</b> has a pair of outward radially extending flanges <b>94</b>, <b>95</b> with a wall section <b>96</b> therebetween. The seal member <b>88</b> is positioned between the flanges <b>94</b>, <b>95</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Still in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, it can be seen how the housing <b>50</b> is attached to the first end construction <b>71</b>. While many different techniques are available, in the example shown, the housing <b>50</b> is attached to the outer radial wall <b>90</b>. In particular, the housing <b>50</b> is non removably fixed or secured to the outer radial wall <b>90</b> by being folded over at least a first of the flanges <b>95</b>. The housing <b>50</b> can cover at least a portion of the wall section <b>96</b> in between the flanges <b>94</b>, <b>95</b>. In some embodiments, the housing <b>50</b> can also be folded over at least a portion of the second of the flanges <b>94</b> and completely cover the wall section <b>96</b> at fold <b>97</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the seal member <b>88</b> is oriented radially outwardly in the seal member seat <b>92</b> and against the housing <b>50</b>. In the example shown, the housing <b>50</b> is sandwiched between and against the seal member <b>88</b> and the wall section <b>96</b> of the outer radial wall <b>90</b> of the first end construction <b>71</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The first end construction <b>71</b> further includes an axial wall <b>100</b>. The axial wall <b>100</b> covers the first end <b>80</b> of the media construction <b>66</b>. In general, the outer radial wall <b>90</b> extends at about a 90&#xb0; angle relative to the axial wall <b>100</b>. The axial wall <b>100</b> defines the central flow aperture <b>84</b>. The central flow aperture <b>84</b> can further accommodate a seal member, such as a grommet seal member <b>102</b> therein for connection with the filter head <b>22</b>, e.g., the portion of the filter head <b>22</b> defining the outlet opening <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The first end construction <b>71</b> includes, in the example embodiment shown, a plurality of circumferentially spaced non-connecting sections <b>107</b>, shown in the example figures at <b>107</b><i>a</i>, <b>107</b><i>b</i>, and <b>107</b><i>c</i>. The non-connecting sections <b>107</b> are, in general, along the outer radial wall <b>90</b> as either complete gaps (no wall structure at all); or smooth sections of the wall <b>90</b>; or sections of the wall <b>90</b> that are non-interfering with the filter head <b>22</b>, when the filter head <b>22</b> is attached to the cartridge <b>24</b>. In preferred implementations, the non-connecting sections <b>107</b> are both equal in circumferential length and equally spaced from each other. In this case, when there are the three non-connecting sections <b>107</b><i>a</i>, <b>107</b><i>b</i>, and <b>107</b><i>c</i>, they are separated from each other by <b>60</b><i>g. </i></p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In accordance with principles of this disclosure, the filter cartridge <b>24</b> includes a system to allow for a low friction installation of the cartridge <b>24</b> to the filter head <b>22</b>, including simply inserting and rotating the cartridge less than a full turn. In this embodiment, the system includes a connection system <b>104</b>. The connection system <b>104</b> will allow for low friction insertion and turning of the cartridge <b>24</b> less than 180&#xb0; for example, about 60&#xb0;.

To service the filter assembly <b>20</b>, the old filter cartridge <b>24</b> is removed from the filter head <b>22</b> and discarded. To remove the old filter cartridge <b>24</b> from the filter head, the cartridge <b>24</b> is rotated relative to the filter head <b>22</b>, preferably by hand and without the use of tools. The cartridge <b>24</b> is rotated in such a way as to unmate the connecting sections <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> from the connecting segments <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>.

The cartridge <b>24</b> is pushed axially toward the filter head <b>22</b> and then rotated less than 90&#xb0;, typically no more than 60&#xb0;. The cartridge <b>24</b> is rotated to engage or mate the connecting sections <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> with the connecting segments <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>. The cartridge <b>24</b> can be rotated until the stop member <b>150</b> prevents further rotation of the cartridge <b>24</b> within the filter head <b>22</b>. As the cartridge <b>24</b> is being rotated within the filter head <b>22</b>, the seal member <b>88</b> is compressed, to form the seal between and against the filter head <b>22</b> and the cartridge <b>24</b>. During the step of rotation, the cartridge <b>24</b> is rotated until the detents <b>160</b>, <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> are received within the detent recesses <b>164</b>, <b>165</b>, <b>166</b>, and feedback in the form of an audible click or a tactile click feeling is detected by the user. This will ensure that the filter cartridge <b>24</b> has been properly installed on the filter head <b>22</b>, and the filter assembly <b>20</b> is again ready for filtration.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The above represents example principles.
