Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A conventional torque wrench was disclosed in the applicant's assigned U.S. Pat. No. 8863624 (or Taiwanese Patent No. M492808), and comprises a hollow main shaft <b>10</b>, a tool member <b>20</b>, an adjustable grip <b>30</b>, a torque-adjustment elastic member <b>40</b>, a clutch device <b>50</b>, and a functional lock <b>60</b>. The hollow main shaft <b>10</b> comprises a first end <b>11</b>, a second end <b>12</b>, a plurality of locating grooves <b>13</b>, and plural torque value numbers <b>14</b>. The tool member <b>20</b> comprises a head piece <b>21</b> and a stem <b>22</b>. The adjustable grip <b>30</b> comprises an adjustment screw member <b>31</b> with a ring groove <b>301</b>. The functional lock <b>60</b> comprises a locking ring <b>61</b>, a compression spring <b>62</b>, a C-clasp <b>63</b>, at least a through hole <b>64</b>, and at least a positioning ball <b>65</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, when the functional lock <b>60</b> is in the locked position, the compression spring <b>62</b> pushes the locking ring <b>61</b> toward the tool member <b>20</b>, whereby the positioning ball <b>65</b> is pushed by the pushing face <b>612</b> and stopped by the locating groove <b>13</b> for limiting the rotation of the adjustable grip <b>30</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, when the functional lock <b>60</b> is in the unlocked position, the compression spring <b>62</b> is compressed due to the movement of the locking ring <b>61</b>, whereby the C-clasp <b>63</b> is coupled with the annular groove <b>614</b> for positioning the locking ring <b>61</b> in the unlocked position. At the meantime, the positioning ball <b>65</b> is no longer pushed by the pushing face <b>612</b> and is aligned with the position of the bevel <b>616</b>, whereby the positioning ball <b>65</b> is allowed to move between the containing groove <b>611</b> and the locating groove <b>13</b>. Therefore, during the switching process of the locking ring <b>61</b>, a percussion sound is produced by the medal C-clasp <b>63</b> coupled with the annular groove <b>614</b>, and another percussion sound is also produced when the pushing face <b>612</b> pushes the positioning ball <b>65</b>.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, such a conventional torque wrench has the following disadvantage. When the functional lock <b>60</b> is in the unlocked position, the adjustable grip <b>30</b> is rotated about its axis to drive the hollow main shaft <b>10</b> and the tool member <b>20</b>, so that the tool member <b>20</b> has a torque slip function relative to the hollow main shaft <b>10</b> when the hollow main shaft <b>10</b> and the tool member <b>20</b> are rotated. The conventional torque wrench does not have a control mechanism to limit operation of the clutch device <b>50</b>, so that the conventional torque wrench only has a torque effect, thereby limiting the versatility thereof</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a torque structure comprising a first body, a second body, a first elastic member, a third body, and a limit unit. The second body is provided with a second receiving chamber, a first pivot portion, two retaining grooves, a first groove, at least one first positioning portion and at least one second positioning portion. The first elastic member is received in the second receiving chamber. The third body is provided with a drive portion, a pivot seat, a second pivot portion, and a first limit portion. The limit unit is assembled with the second body and the third body and rotated between a disengaging position where the third body is unlocked from the second body and has a torque slip function relative to the second body, and a engaging position where the third body is locked by the second body and does not have a torque slip function relative to the second body.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the primary advantage of the present invention, the limit unit is rotated on the second body between a disengaging position where the third body is unlocked from the second body and has a torque slip function relative to the second body and a engaging position where the third body is locked by the second body and does not have a torque slip function relative to the second body. When the limit unit is disposed at the disengaging position, the torque structure is served as a torque wrench structure. When the limit unit is disposed at the engaging position, the third body is restricted by the limit unit, and the resting portion cannot be moved, so that the third body does not have a torque slip effect relative to the second body, and the torque structure is served as a common wrench structure. Thus, the torque structure has two different functions to enhance the versatility thereof</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further benefits and advantages of the present invention will become apparent
