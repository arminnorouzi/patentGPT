The drilling speed-enhancing device <b>100</b> can be applied to a dual-drive drilling tool to generate high-frequency impact for improving rock-breaking efficiency. Specifically, the drilling speed-enhancing device <b>100</b> includes an outer cylinder, a rotary main shaft <b>4</b>, an output main shaft <b>7</b>, and a percussion generator. The outer cylinder <b>1</b> is cylindrical and connected with a housing of a downhole power motor of the dual-drive drilling tool, mainly for connection and force transmission. The rotary main shaft <b>4</b> is arranged in an inner chamber of the outer cylinder <b>1</b>, and connected with a rotating shaft of the downhole power motor of the dual-drive drilling tool to be driven to rotate around its own axis, for transmitting rotational power. The output main shaft <b>7</b> is arranged at a lower end of the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>, and configured to rotate around its own axis when being driven by the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>, for transmitting rotational power to a drilling bit arranged at a lower end of the output main shaft <b>7</b>. The percussion generator is provided between the output main shaft <b>7</b> and the outer cylinder. The percussion generator can actuate the center of gravity (i.e., neutral point) of a combination consisting of the outer cylinder, the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>, and the upper drilling string fixedly connected therewith (collectively referred to as driven assembly) to move upward relative to the output main shaft <b>7</b>, that is, enable the neutral point of the whole drilling string to move upward. And under the action of the WOB, the center of gravity of the driven assembly (that is, the neutral point of the drilling string) moves down to impact on the output main shaft <b>7</b>, so as to form an instantaneously high &#x201c;percussive WOB&#x201d;, like &#x201c;churn drilling&#x201d;, and further provide impact energy for the drilling bit. Therefore, the drilling speed-enhancing device <b>100</b> of the present invention can be applied to the dual-drive drilling tool to generate high-frequency reciprocating percussive WOB on the formation while driving the drilling bit to rotate in a high speed by the dual-drive power. This compound action facilitates to break up the formation rapidly, thus increasing drilling efficiency and reducing drilling cost.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, the percussion generator has an upper cam <b>8</b>, a lower cam <b>9</b>, and a lower cam seat <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>, the upper cam <b>8</b> per se is cylindrical, and arranged around an outer wall of the output main shaft <b>7</b> with a gap. The upper cam <b>8</b> is fixed relative to the outer cylinder in an axial direction and a circumferential direction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b</i></figref>, the lower cam seat <b>10</b> per se is cylindrical, and fixedly arranged around the output main shaft <b>7</b>. For example, the lower cam seat <b>10</b> is screwed on the output main shaft <b>7</b> by a left-handed trapezoidal thread. Moreover, on the threaded connection area between the lower cam seat <b>10</b> and the output main shaft <b>7</b>, the lower cam seat <b>10</b> and the output main shaft <b>7</b> are engaged with each other through step surfaces, so that the output main shaft <b>7</b> can restrict the axial position of the lower cam seat <b>10</b>. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i></figref>, the lower cam <b>9</b> per se is cylindrical, and arranged around an outer wall of the lower cam seat <b>10</b>. The outer wall of the lower cam seat <b>10</b> is provided with engaging teeth <b>27</b>-<b>2</b> radially protruding out. At the same time, the wall of the lower cam <b>9</b> is provided with engaging slots <b>27</b>-<b>1</b>. Upon assembly, each of the engaging teeth <b>27</b>-<b>2</b> extends radially into a corresponding one of the engaging slots <b>27</b>-<b>1</b>, thus forming a snap-fit connection between the lower cam <b>9</b> and the lower cam seat <b>10</b> in the circumferential direction. Therefore, the output main shaft <b>7</b> can drive the lower cam seat <b>10</b> into rotation through the engagement between step surfaces, while the rotation of the lower cam seat <b>10</b> can drive the lower cam <b>9</b> into rotation through the snap-fit connection. For example, a plurality (say, three, four, or five, etc.) of the engaging teeth <b>27</b>-<b>2</b> may be arranged at intervals in the circumferential direction, in order to achieve uniform transmission of torque. In addition, a first step surface <b>91</b> is arranged in an inner chamber of the lower cam <b>9</b> to abut against an upper end face of the lower cam seat <b>10</b>, so that the downward axial movement of the lower cam <b>9</b> can be restricted by the lower cam seat <b>10</b>. At the same time, during the movement of the upper cam <b>8</b> pushed by the lower cam <b>9</b>, the lower cam <b>9</b> presses against the lower cam seat <b>10</b>, so that the axial force received by the lower cam <b>9</b> will be transmitted downward through the lower cam seat <b>10</b> to the output main shaft <b>7</b>, and finally to the drilling bit. The above structure adopts the lower cam <b>9</b> and the lower cam seat <b>10</b> that are separate from each other, so that the structure is simple, the processing is convenient, the installation and replacement are easy, and the use cost is reduced.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The outer cylinder consists of two parts, i.e., an upper joint <b>1</b> and a cylindrical body <b>14</b> disposed at a lower end of the upper joint <b>1</b>. The upper joint <b>1</b> is directly connected with the housing of the downhole power motor of the dual-drive drilling tool. An upper end of the cylindrical body <b>14</b> is arranged around the outer wall of the upper joint <b>1</b>, and connected therewith by means of inclined threaded surfaces. A second step surface <b>25</b> is arranged on an inner wall of the cylindrical body <b>14</b> in a manner of opposite to a lower end face of the upper joint <b>1</b> extending into the inner chamber of the cylindrical body <b>14</b>. The outer wall of the upper cam <b>8</b> at the lower end thereof is provided with a fourth step surface <b>81</b>, so that the upper cam <b>8</b> radially extends to be partially sandwiched between the lower end face of the upper joint <b>1</b> and the second step surface <b>25</b>. Accordingly, the second step surface <b>25</b> and the fourth step surface <b>81</b> together forms an axial locking structure. With the above arrangement, the axial position of the upper cam <b>8</b> can be restricted by the outer cylinder. Moreover, the upper end face of the upper cam <b>8</b> and the lower end face of the upper joint <b>1</b> are engaged with each other through teeth. Specifically, multiple sector-shaped teeth <b>24</b> circumferentially spaced from each other extend from the upper end face of the upper cam <b>8</b>, and multiple sector-shaped slots (not shown) circumferentially spaced from each other are formed in the lower end face of the upper joint <b>1</b>. Each tooth <b>24</b> can be inserted into a corresponding one of the sector-shaped slots to form a snap-fit connection. With the above arrangement, the rotation of the upper cam <b>8</b> can be restricted by the upper joint <b>1</b>. In the above arrangement, the upper cam <b>8</b> makes full use of its axial engagement with the upper joint <b>1</b> and the cylinder body <b>14</b> to provide a compact structure, so that the axial length of the drilling speed-enhancing device <b>100</b> is shortened, and the upper cam <b>8</b> can be restricted in the axial direction and also prevented from dropping-off.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Driven teeth <b>82</b> are arranged on the lower end of the upper cam <b>8</b>, and each have a tooth surface substantially facing downward. Correspondingly, driving teeth <b>92</b> are arranged on the upper end of the lower cam <b>9</b>, and each has a tooth surface substantially facing upward. Upon assembly, the driven teeth <b>82</b> and the driving teeth <b>92</b> are opposite and engaged with each other to form a conjugate set of cam teeth. Each of the driven teeth <b>82</b> and the driving teeth <b>92</b> may be generally configured as a wave-like shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i></figref>. In operation, the lower cam <b>9</b> starts to rotate clockwise when being driven by the output main shaft <b>7</b>. A pushing-up stroke will start when troughs of the driven teeth <b>82</b> face toward peaks of the driving teeth <b>92</b>. Since the upper cam <b>8</b> is axially sandwiched between the upper joint <b>1</b> and the cylinder body <b>14</b> and also circumferentially locked with the upper joint <b>1</b>, the upper cam <b>8</b> can actuate the center of gravity of a combination consisting of the outer cylinder, the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>, and the upper drilling string fixedly connected therewith and located below the neutral point (collectively referred to as driven assembly) to move upward relative to the lower cam <b>9</b>. When the peaks of the driven teeth <b>82</b> face toward the peaks of the driving teeth <b>92</b> while the troughs of the driven teeth <b>82</b> face toward to the troughs of the driving teeth <b>92</b>, the center of gravity of the combination consisting of the upper cam <b>82</b>, the outer cylinder, the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>, and the upper drilling string fixedly connected therewith and located below the neutral point (collectively referred to as driven assembly) reaches its highest point. At this time, the axial distance between the peaks of the upper cam <b>8</b> and the troughs of the lower cam <b>9</b> is D, and that between the upper end face of the output main shaft <b>7</b> and the third step surface <b>41</b> (described in detail later) of the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> is C, wherein D&#x3e;C. After that, the center of gravity of the driven assembly (that is, the neutral point of the drilling string) suddenly moves downward, that is, the driven assembly impacts downward under the action of the WOB. Since D&#x3e;C, the impact acts on the upper end face of the output main shaft <b>7</b>, so that impact energy will be transmitted to the downstream drilling bit through the output main shaft <b>7</b>, thus forming an instantaneously high &#x201c;percussive WOB&#x201d;, like &#x201c;churn drilling&#x201d;, and further providing the impact energy for the drilling bit. In this manner, the drilling bit can impact downward on the formation during rotating-while-drilling. Subsequently, a new stage of engaging-rotating-pushing begins between the teeth of the upper cam <b>8</b> and the lower cam <b>9</b>, and the WOB returns to its normal value. That is, the neutral point of the drilling string returns to its original position, so that a next stage of lifting stroke begins. In this manner, a periodic change of the WOB is repeated in cycle.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a preferred embodiment, each of the wave-like driven teeth <b>82</b> and driving teeth <b>92</b> comprises an upward tooth segment and a downward tooth segment connected thereto. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a</i></figref>, the upward tooth segment of each of the driving teeth <b>92</b> is inclined in the direction opposite to the rotational direction of the lower cam <b>9</b>, while the downward tooth segment of each of the driving teeth <b>92</b> is inclined downward in said direction opposite to the rotational direction of the lower cam <b>9</b>. The inclination of the upward tooth segment is relatively gentle, and for example, can be designed according to the required height of the stroke, and is by no means limited in the present invention. By contrast, the inclination of the downward tooth segment is relatively steep, and for example, can be a vertical surface, so that the upper cam <b>8</b> can move towards the lower cam <b>9</b> with a relatively high speed. The driving teeth <b>92</b> rotates clockwise with a certain rotational speed, which ensures that the downward tooth segment of the driven teeth <b>82</b> would not touch the downward tooth segment of the driving teeth <b>92</b>, thus further ensuring that the movement of the upper cam <b>8</b> towards the lower cam <b>9</b> is a free fall movement. That is, the upper cam <b>8</b> can move upstream relative to the lower cam <b>9</b> at a relatively slow speed, but move downward at a relatively fast speed. In the circumferential direction, a plurality of driven teeth <b>82</b> and a plurality of driving teeth <b>92</b> can be provided as required, and at the area where the downward tooth segment and the upper tooth segment of each driven tooth <b>82</b> are connected and at the area where the lower tooth segment and the upper tooth segment of each driving tooth <b>92</b> are connected, a transition fillet is provided for eliminating stress concentration and also buffering the movement between the upper cam <b>8</b> and the lower cam <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A damping assembly is arranged around the output main shaft <b>7</b>. The lower end face of the lower cam <b>9</b> extends axially over the lower end face of the lower cam seat <b>10</b> to abut against the damping assembly. The lower end face of the damping assembly abuts against a limiting sleeve arranged on the output main shaft <b>7</b>. It should note that the limiting sleeve is mainly used to limit the damping assembly axially. However, in order to optimize the structure, it is not necessary to provide an additional limiting sleeve on the output main shaft; in this case, an inner ring nut of a TC bearing fixedly arranged on the output main shaft <b>7</b> can serve as the limiting sleeve. That is to say, in the axial direction, the damping assembly is located between the lower cam <b>9</b> and the limiting sleeve. After one single impact is completed, the upper cam <b>8</b> will exert an impact force to the lower cam <b>9</b> at the moment when the upper tooth segment of the driven teeth <b>82</b> touches and meshes with the upper tooth segment of the driving teeth <b>92</b>. By arranging the damping assembly, the impact force exerted on the lower cam <b>9</b> is transmitted to the damping assembly. That is, the damping assembly can absorb the energy received by the lower cam <b>9</b>, and slow down the hard impact between the upper cam <b>8</b> and the lower cam <b>9</b>, so as to protect the upper cam <b>8</b> and the lower cam <b>9</b> and prolong the service life of both.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a preferred embodiment, the damping assembly includes two retaining rings <b>11</b> axially spaced from each other, and a disc spring <b>12</b> arranged between said two retaining rings <b>11</b>. An upper retaining ring <b>11</b> is in contact with the lower end face of the lower cam <b>9</b>, while a lower retaining ring <b>11</b> is in contact with the limiting sleeve. For example, the disc spring <b>12</b> is a Mubeu disc spring, in a form of pairing two single pieces together. The disc spring <b>12</b> has a pre-compressed amount initially set as N mm, which corresponds to a pre-tightening force of T kN. That is, when the impact force F received by the lower cam <b>9</b> is in the range of 0-T, the teeth of the upper cam <b>8</b> and the lower cam <b>9</b> will not be damaged.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A third step surface <b>41</b> is arranged on the inner surface of the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>, so that the size of the inner chamber of the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> is increased at the lower end thereof. During installation, the upper end of the output main shaft <b>7</b> extends axially upward into the inner chamber of the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>, so that the upper end face thereof is opposite to the third step surface <b>41</b>. A circumferential snap-fit connection is formed between the output main shaft <b>7</b> and the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>, the portion of the output main shaft <b>7</b> extending into the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> is shaped as a polygonal column, e.g., an octagonal column. Correspondingly, the inner chamber of the lower end of the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> below the third step surface <b>41</b> is configured as having a polygonal cross section. Therefore, the above arrangement realizes a positive connection between the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> and the output main shaft <b>7</b>, so that the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> can drive the output main shaft <b>7</b> in rotation. This arrangement can also ensure that the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> and the output main shaft <b>7</b> can move relative to each other in the axial direction, thereby ensuring that the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> can impact the output main shaft <b>7</b> to provide rock-breaking impact force. It should note that in order to avoid stress concentration, in the octagonal column where the inner wall of the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> is in engagement with the outer wall of the output main shaft <b>7</b>, adjacent sides of the octagonal column are connected with each other with a rounded corner, thus ensuring smooth connection.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Of course, the axial position of the output main shaft <b>7</b> relative to the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> should be further restricted, in order to prevent the output main shaft <b>7</b> from dropping-off during tripping operations. Specifically, a limiting groove <b>22</b> extending axially is arranged on the outer wall of the output main shaft <b>7</b>. For example, multiple pairs (e.g., one pair, two pairs, three pairs or four pairs) of limiting grooves <b>22</b> may be arranged in the circumferential direction, and two limiting grooves <b>22</b> of each pair are distributed relative to each other in order to ensure force balance. Correspondingly, a step hole <b>42</b> passing through the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> is provided on the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>, and has a diameter of the radially outer portion larger than that of the radially inner portion. The limiting key <b>5</b> is arranged in the step hole <b>42</b>. Correspondingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>, the main body of the limiting key <b>5</b> is elongated and extends along the axial direction, so as to improve the shear strength. In the radial direction, the limiting key <b>5</b> is formed as a step. For example, a radially outer portion of the limiting key <b>5</b> is an A-type ordinary flat key, and a radially inner portion thereof is a step key formed by expanding said A-type ordinary flat key outward. Accordingly, the cross-sectional size of the radially outer portion is larger than that of the radially inner portion. Therefore, the limiting key <b>5</b> is arranged in the step hole <b>42</b>, with the radially outer portion having a large cross-sectional size being clamped at the step hole while the radially inner portion extending radially inward into the limiting groove <b>22</b>. A ferrule <b>3</b> is fixed on the outer wall of the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>. The ferrule <b>3</b> can radially restrict the limiting key <b>5</b> to prevent it from falling out from the step hole <b>42</b>. During the axial movement of the output main shaft <b>7</b> relative to the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>, the limiting key <b>5</b> can move axially within the limiting groove <b>22</b> to a limited extent, so as to restrict the further relative movement of the output main shaft <b>7</b>. For example, during tripping operations, the output main shaft <b>7</b> drives the lower cam <b>9</b> or the like to fall down relative to the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> or the like, so that a groove wall surface at the upper end of the limiting groove <b>22</b> is received on the limiting key <b>5</b>. In this manner, the limiting key <b>5</b> can realize anti-drop effect.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>, the inner surface of the ferrule <b>3</b> has two portions of different inner diameters, wherein the portion with a relatively large inner diameter is provided with thread to form a fixed connection with the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>. A step surface connecting said two portions forms a snap-fit connection with the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>. A downward inclined slope of 60 degrees is provided between the step surface connecting said two portions and the inner wall surface of the portion of the ferrule <b>3</b> with a relatively small inner diameter. In this manner, when the ferrule <b>3</b> is mounted, the screwing depth of the thread can be limited, and the ferrule <b>3</b> can be better matched with the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> via the step surface, thus preventing structural interference.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It should note that when the output main shaft <b>7</b> is seated on the limiting key <b>5</b> during tripping operations, the driven teeth <b>82</b> and the driving teeth <b>92</b> will be separated from each other by a certain distance in the axial direction, thus ensuring that the driven teeth <b>82</b> cannot be in contact with the driving teeth <b>92</b> in blank rotation. In this manner, the safety of the teeth can be improved. Moreover, after correct installation, the inner end face of the limiting key <b>5</b> has a certain distance in the radial direction from the bottom wall of the limiting groove <b>22</b> of the output main shaft <b>7</b>, wherein the value of said distance should meet the requirement on the torsion angle of the output main shaft <b>7</b>, thus preventing the limiting key <b>5</b> from being sheared during rotation of the output main shaft <b>7</b>. This arrangement ensures the safety of the limiting key <b>5</b> in use, and increases its service life. Moreover, when the WOB is applied after the drilling tool touches the bottom of the well, the wall surface at the lower end of the limiting groove <b>22</b> will not contact the limiting key <b>5</b> during the upward movement of the output main shaft <b>7</b> relative to the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>. In this manner, the limiting key <b>5</b> is prevented from being impacted, thus improving its safety in use.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A TC bearing assembly is provided between the outer cylinder and the output main shaft <b>7</b>. An inner ring <b>18</b> of the TC bearing assembly is connected with the output main shaft <b>7</b> by an interference fit. A bearing shell <b>15</b> of the TC bearing assembly is located outside the inner ring <b>18</b> of the TC bearing assembly and engaged therewith, and fixedly arranged at the lower end of the outer cylinder. An inner-ring locking nut <b>13</b> of the TC bearing assembly is fixedly arranged around the output main shaft <b>7</b>, and located at an upper end of the inner ring <b>18</b> of the TC bearing assembly. This arrangement ensures a smooth rotation of the output main shaft <b>7</b> relative to the outer cylinder. In a specific embodiment, the bearing shell <b>15</b> of the TC bearing assembly and the cylindrical body <b>14</b> are connected with each other through drill-pipe joint threads arranged on inclined contact surfaces therebetween, so as to realize a fixed connection. An inner side of the inner-ring locking nut <b>13</b> of the TC bearing assembly is provided with a left-handed trapezoidal female thread, which is engaged with the left-handed trapezoidal male thread on the output main shaft <b>7</b>, for tightening the inner ring <b>18</b> of the TC bearing assembly located downstream.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A positioning sleeve <b>19</b> is provided at the lower end of the inner ring <b>18</b> of the TC bearing assembly. For example, the positioning sleeve <b>19</b> may have a conical cross-section. After the positioning sleeve <b>19</b> is arranged around the output main shaft <b>7</b>, the upper end of the positioning sleeve <b>19</b> is in contact with the inner ring <b>18</b> of the TC bearing assembly, while the lower end thereof is in contact with a fifth step surface <b>71</b> formed on the output main shaft <b>7</b>. The positioning sleeve <b>19</b> is used to axially press the inner ring <b>18</b> of the TC bearing assembly.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, a first seal is provided between the outer cylinder and the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>. The first seal can be a Hunger RDI rotary seal ring <b>2</b>. Additionally, a second seal is provided between the inner ring <b>18</b> of the TC bearing assembly and the bearing shell <b>15</b> of the TC bearing assembly. Also, the second seal may be in the form of a double-pass seal, and specifically a GDSA piston seal <b>16</b> and a RODA rotary seal <b>17</b> located therebelow. A sealed chamber is formed in an area defined by a portion of the outer cylinder from the first seal and the second seal, the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>, and the output main shaft <b>7</b>. Lubricating oil is poured into the sealed chamber, in order to provide an oil-sealing environment for the upper cam <b>8</b>, the lower cam <b>9</b>, the disc spring <b>12</b> or the like arranged therein, thus greatly prolonging their service life. A third sealing ring <b>6</b> is further provided between the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> and the output main shaft <b>7</b> to achieve sealing therebetween. The third sealing ring <b>6</b> is located below the limiting groove <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The specific working process of the drilling speed-enhancing device <b>100</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>7</b></figref><i>b </i>is described in detail as follows.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">First, the above-mentioned drilling speed-enhancing device <b>100</b> is arranged on a dual-drive drilling tool, wherein the outer cylinder <b>1</b> is connected with the housing of the downhole power motor of the dual-drive drilling tool, while the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> is connected with the rotating shaft of the downhole power motor of the dual-drive drilling tool. A drilling bit is arranged at the lower end of the output main shaft <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Then, the dual-drive drilling tool provided with the drilling speed-enhancing device <b>100</b> is lowered into the well to be drilled. During this process, the output main shaft <b>7</b>, the lower cam <b>9</b>, the damping assembly, the inner-ring locking nut <b>13</b> and the inner ring <b>18</b> of the TC bearing assembly, the positioning sleeve <b>19</b> and the drilling bit move downward together relative to the outer cylinder, and further downward movement can be prevented since the output main shaft <b>7</b> is seated on the upper end face of the limiting key <b>5</b>. At this time, the teeth of the upper cam <b>8</b> are not in contact with the teeth of the lower cam <b>9</b>, so as to ensure that the teeth will not collide with each other.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">When the drilling bit of the drilling tool touches the bottom of the well, the drilling tool is further lowered to apply the WOB, so that the output main shaft <b>7</b> drives the lower cam <b>9</b> or the like to move axially upward relative to the outer cylinder and the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>, until the lower cam <b>9</b> and the upper cam <b>8</b> are in cooperation. At this time, since the upward tooth segments of the driven teeth <b>82</b> of the upper cam and those of the driving teeth <b>92</b> of the lower cam are engaged with each other, there is a certain axial distance, which less than C, between the upper end face <b>20</b> of the output main shaft <b>7</b> and the third step surface <b>41</b> of the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Then, drilling operation may start. The rotary main shaft <b>4</b> is rotated by the rotating shaft of the downhole power motor, so as to drive the output main shaft <b>7</b> in rotation to supply rotational power to the drilling bit arranged at the lower end of the output main shaft <b>7</b>. At the same time, the rotating output main shaft <b>7</b> drives the lower cam <b>9</b> to rotate together, which axially pushes up the upper cam <b>8</b> to lift the outer cylinder and the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>. After reaching the highest point, the outer cylinder and the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> will, under the action of the WOB, impact downward on the upper end face of the output main shaft <b>7</b>. The axial reciprocating impact acts on the output main shaft <b>7</b>, and is finally transmitted to the drilling bit. As a result, when the drilling bit rotates, reciprocating impact will be generated to improve rock-breaking efficiency, which provides new technical means for efficient drilling in hard and complex formations for ultra-deep oil wells, geothermal wells, and dry-hot rock wells.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the present invention, it should be emphasized that the outer wall of the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> consists of three sections for axially positioning the ferrule <b>3</b>, while the inner wall of the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> consists of two sections, that is, includes the third step surface <b>42</b> so that the inner diameter of the upper section is smaller than that of the lower section. The inner chamber of the upper section is mainly used for conveying drilling fluid, while that of the lower section is mainly used for arranging the output main shaft <b>7</b> therein.

On the outer wall of the output main shaft <b>7</b>, the outer diameter of the output shaft <b>7</b> can be increased gradually from top to bottom through arranging step surfaces, which can engage and connect with different members. Specifically, from top to bottom, the diameter of the first segment is relatively small to ensure that the output main shaft <b>7</b> is guided to be inserted into the rotary main shaft <b>4</b>. The second section can guarantee to form a circumferential snap-fit connection with the rotary main shaft <b>4</b> for ensuring power transmission. The third section is used to arrange the upper cam <b>8</b>, the lower cam <b>9</b> and the lower cam seat <b>10</b> thereon, for achieving coaxial orientation.
