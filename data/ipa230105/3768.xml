The first inverter converts the supplied direct current into an alternating current and outputs the alternating current to a first motor. The second inverter converts the supplied direct current into an alternating current and outputs the alternating current to a second motor.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A current detection device used in such a power conversion device includes a terminal unit containing first to third current sensors therein. The first current sensor measures an output current of the first inverter, and the second current sensor measures an output current of the second inverter. The third current sensor measures an electric current flowing through a reactor of the voltage converter.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In general, a current sensor has a magnetizing core and a magnetic detection element. The magnetizing core has a shape surrounding a bus bar through which an electric current to be measured flows, and forms a path of a magnetic flux generated by the electric current flowing through the bus bar. The magnetic detection element is arranged in a gap (space) provided in the magnetizing core, and detects the magnitude of the magnetic flux passing through the gap to thereby detect the magnitude of the current flowing through the bus bar.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">On the other hand, in recent years, the development of a coreless current sensor abolishing the magnetizing core has been promoted. If the coreless current sensor can be realized, the size of a current detection device equipped with a plurality of current sensors can be significantly reduced. However, if the size of the current detection device is reduced as a result of the coreless structure without having the magnetizing core, the distance between the plurality of bus bars becomes smaller. As a result, new problems such as an increase in thermal interference and an increase in magnetic interference between adjacent bus bars will arise.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present disclosure provides a current detection device that can realize the reduction in size by adopting a coreless current sensor while suppressing increases in thermal interference and magnetic interference.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a current detection device is for a power conversion device including a converter that boosts voltage of an electric power supplied from a DC power supply, a first inverter that converts a direct current boosted by the converter into an alternating current and outputs the alternating current to a first rotary electric machine, and a second inverter that converts a direct current boosted by the converter into an alternating current and outputs the alternating current to a second rotary electric machine. The current detection device includes: a first conductor configured to form a part of a current path between the first inverter and the first rotary electric machine; a second conductor configured to form a part of a current path between the second inverter and the second rotary electric machine; a third conductor configured to form a part of a current path between the DC power supply and the converter; a first element arranged to face the first conductor and configured to detect a magnetic flux generated by an electric current flowing through the first conductor in a coreless manner; a second element arranged to face the second conductor and configured to detect a magnetic flux generated by an electric current flowing through the second conductor in a coreless manner; a third element arranged to face the third conductor and configured to detect a magnetic flux generated by an electric current flowing through the third conductor in a coreless manner. A maximum value of the electric current flowing through the second conductor is smaller than a maximum value of the electric current flowing through the first conductor, and is smaller than a maximum value of the electric current flowing through the third conductor. The second conductor is arranged side by side with the first conductor and the third conductor in a predetermined direction, and is arranged between the first conductor and the third conductor.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The maximum values of the electric currents flowing through the first to third bus bars are different. In a case where the first to third bus bars are arranged side by side in a predetermined direction, if the bus bars having larger maximum current values are arranged next to each other, mutual thermal interference and magnetic interference are likely to increase. In view of this point, in the current detection device described above, the bus bar (second bus bar) having the maximum current value smallest among the first to third bus bars is arranged between the other bus bars (first and third bus bars). Therefore, a distance between the first bus bar and the third bus bar can be increased, and the thermal interference and magnetic interference between the bus bars having larger maximum current values can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As described above, the size reduction of the current detection device can be achieved by adopting the coreless current sensor, and the increases in thermal interference and magnetic interference due to the size reduction can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Disclosed aspects in this specification may adopt different technical solutions from each other in order to achieve their respective objectives.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments will be described with reference to the drawings.

However, these magnetic shields may be formed separately and separated from each other.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0077">Hereinafter, the effects of the sensor unit <b>160</b> as the current detection device having the above-described configuration will be described.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0078">In the present embodiment, since the coreless current sensor without having a magnetizing core is adopted, the size of the sensor unit <b>160</b> can be significantly reduced as compared with the current sensor having the magnetizing core. Nevertheless, it is possible to suppress the increase in thermal interference and magnetic interference caused by the size reduction, as will be described below.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0079">The electric current flowing through the first bus bar <b>61</b><i>b</i>, the second bus bar <b>62</b><i>b</i>, and the third bus bar <b>63</b><i>b </i>have different maximum values. That is, the first maximum current I1 max, the second maximum current I2 max, and the third maximum current I3 max are different. In the case where these bus bars <b>61</b><i>b</i>, <b>62</b><i>b</i>, and <b>63</b><i>b </i>are arranged side by side in the predetermined direction (depth direction ZD), if the bus bars having a larger maximum current are arranged next to each other, thermal interference and magnetic interference therebetween are likely to increase.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0080">For example, if the first bus bar <b>61</b><i>b </i>and the third bus bar <b>63</b><i>b </i>are arranged next to each other contrary to the present embodiment, the temperature of the third bus bar <b>63</b><i>b </i>rises due to the heat generated by the first bus bar <b>61</b><i>b</i>, or the temperature of the third bus bar <b>63</b><i>b </i>is rises due to the heat generated by the third bus bar <b>63</b><i>b</i>. That is, the thermal interference is likely to be large. Further, the magnetic field generated by the current flowing through the first bus bar <b>61</b><i>b </i>interferes with the current flowing through the third bus bar <b>63</b><i>b</i>, or the magnetic field generated by the current flowing through the third bus bar <b>63</b><i>b </i>interferes with the current flowing through the first bus bar <b>61</b><i>b</i>. That is, the magnetic interference is likely to increase.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0081">In view of these circumstances, in the present embodiment, the bus bar in which the maximum value of the electric current is the smallest among the bus bars <b>61</b><i>b</i>, <b>62</b><i>b</i>, and <b>63</b><i>b </i>is arranged between the other bus bars. That is, in the present embodiment, the second maximum current I2 max is smaller than the first maximum current I1 max and the third maximum current I3 max, so that the second bus bar <b>62</b><i>b </i>is arranged between the first bus bar <b>61</b><i>b </i>and the third bus bar <b>63</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, the distance between the first bus bar <b>61</b><i>b </i>and the third bus bar <b>63</b><i>b </i>can be increased, and thermal interference and magnetic interference between the bus bars having the larger maximum current values can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0082">According to the present embodiment, as described above, the sensor unit <b>160</b> can be significantly reduced in size by adopting the coreless current sensor, and yet the increase in thermal interference and magnetic interference due to the size reduction can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0083">Here, the first magnetic shield, the second magnetic shield, and the third magnetic shield, respectively, receive radiant heat from the bus bars <b>61</b><i>b</i>, <b>62</b><i>b</i>, and <b>63</b><i>b</i>, and dissipate the heat to the outside air. Therefore, the atmospheric temperature of the bus bars <b>61</b><i>b</i>, <b>62</b><i>b</i>, and <b>63</b><i>b </i>can be reduced as the area of the shield increases, resulting to the contribution to the temperature reduction of the bus bars <b>61</b><i>b</i>, <b>62</b><i>b</i>, and <b>63</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0089" num="0084">In view of this point, in the present embodiment, the first magnetic shield, the second magnetic shield, and the third magnetic shield are integrally formed and connected as shield plates <b>60</b><i>d </i>and <b>60</b><i>e</i>. Therefore, the area of the shield can be increased, which can contribute to the temperature reduction of the bass bars <b>61</b><i>b</i>, <b>62</b><i>b</i>, and <b>63</b><i>b</i>. In particular, it is assumed that the amount of heat generated by the first bus bar <b>61</b><i>b </i>is larger than that of the other bus bars. By integrally forming the shield as described above, the heat generated from the first bus bar <b>61</b><i>b </i>is conducted from the first magnetic shield to the second magnetic shield and the third magnetic shield. Therefore, it is possible to promote the reduction in the atmospheric temperature of the first bus bar <b>61</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0090" num="0085">Further, in the present embodiment, the first element <b>61</b><i>a</i>, the second element <b>62</b><i>a</i>, and the third element <b>63</b><i>a </i>are arranged side by side on a straight line. Therefore, the body size of the sensor unit <b>160</b> in the width direction YD can be reduced, as compared with the case where the elements <b>61</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>a</i>, and <b>63</b><i>a </i>are alternately arranged in the width direction YD. Specifically, the shield plates <b>60</b><i>d </i>and <b>60</b><i>e </i>can be reduced in size in the width direction YD, and the body <b>164</b> can be reduced in size in the width direction YD.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0086">In the present embodiment, the bus bars <b>61</b><i>b</i>, <b>62</b><i>b </i>and <b>63</b><i>b </i>arranged in the predetermined direction (depth direction ZD) have a rectangular shape in cross-section defined perpendicular to the direction in which the current flows. Further, the bus bars <b>61</b><i>b</i>, <b>62</b><i>b</i>, <b>63</b><i>b </i>are arranged so that the longitudinal direction of the rectangular shape is parallel to the predetermined direction. In addition, the plurality of elements <b>61</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>a</i>, and <b>63</b><i>a </i>are arranged so as to face the longitudinal surfaces Fa of the bus bars <b>61</b><i>b</i>, <b>62</b><i>b</i>, and <b>63</b><i>b</i>, the longitudinal surfaces Fa extending in the longitudinal direction of the rectangular shape of the cross-section.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0087">According to the configuration, the detection accuracy of the current value can be improved, as compared with the case where the elements <b>61</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>a</i>, and <b>63</b><i>a </i>are arranged to face the short-side surfaces of the bus bars <b>61</b><i>b</i>, <b>62</b><i>b</i>, <b>63</b><i>b</i>. Nevertheless, since the sensor unit <b>160</b> has a layout in which the elements are not arranged between the adjacent bus bars <b>61</b><i>b</i>, <b>62</b><i>b </i>and <b>63</b><i>b</i>, the sensor unit <b>160</b> can be reduced in size in the depth direction ZD.
