In some implementations, force detection (e.g., to recognize that a user &#x201c;clicks&#x201d; using a finger or stylus) can be performed based on inductive detection. For example, a spring can facilitate the movement of at least part of a trackpad assembly as a result of the applied force. In some implementations, haptic output is provided by an actuator mounted to a circuit board. In some implementations, grounding of a circuit board in a trackpad assembly is provided.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A trackpad or touchpad are mentioned herein as examples and can be considered synonymous. Either or both of these can feature a surface formed by a substrate (e.g., glass, metal and/or a synthetic material such as a polymer) intended to be touched by the user in order to make one or more inputs into a system. For example, the user can place one or more fingers and/or one or more other objects (e.g., a stylus) on the surface of the substrate to generate such input(s). In some implementations, more complex inputs can be recognized, including, but not limited to, gestures, sequences and/or patterns.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Position detection can be performed using any suitable technology. In some implementations, capacitive sensing is used. For example, the presence of a fingertip and/or a capacitive stylus at or near the surface of the substrate can change the electrical capacitance of that portion of the substrate, and therefore be registered as an input. As such, while examples herein mention the user touching a substrate in order to make input, it may be sufficient to place an object sufficiently close to, without actually touching, the substrate. In some implementations, resistive sensing is used. For example, the presence of an object can alter the resistance of electrodes in or on the substrate, thereby facilitating recognition of the input.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">An input device such as a trackpad can be used solely to allow the user to make input, or it can simultaneously or at other times perform one or more other functions as well. In some implementations, the trackpad can provide haptic output to the user. For example, this can be done by displacing the substrate (e.g., in a vibration-like fashion) in a way that can be tactilely perceived by the user. In some implementations, the trackpad can also feature a display mechanism configured to output visual information to the user, in analogy to how a touchscreen operates. For example, and without limitation, trackpad technology described herein can be implemented as part of a touchscreen such that a display can present information to the user and the trackpad (which can occupy the same area as the display) can register user inputs (e.g., taps, selections and/or dragging of objects).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">This document also describes devices, systems, and techniques for using an aggregation of trackpads to detect an earthquake. In some implementations, the trackpad can detect vibrations in the trackpad using the inductive element and force sensing circuitry of the trackpad. The detected vibrations can be processed and evaluated by a microcontroller to determine if the detected vibrations are the result of an earthquake. When the microcontroller determines that the vibrations are due to an earthquake, the computing device using the trackpad can communicate an earthquake vibration signal to a remote server. The earthquake vibration signal may includes multiple different attributes including raw data from the inductive element, a location of the computing device, and a timestamp of detecting the vibrations. The computing device uses techniques described below to eliminate vibrations caused by something other than an earthquake. The remote server receives the earthquake vibration signal from the computing device as well as from other computing devices. The remote server aggregates the received earthquake vibration signals and processes the aggregated earthquake vibration signals. The remote server may use machine learning techniques to process the aggregated earthquake vibration signals to detect an earthquake in a location. Upon detection of an earthquake based on the machine learning techniques, the remote server can communicate an earthquake alert to the computing devices that sent the earthquake vibration signals, as well as to other computing devices in a broader affected area. In some implementations, the machine learning techniques may eliminate false positives and not generate the earthquake alert when the machine learning techniques determine that aggregated earthquake vibration signals are not attributable to an earthquake.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exploded view of an example of a trackpad architecture <b>100</b>. The exploded view illustrates exemplary components somewhat separated from each other for purposes of clarity, with such components being assembled into a functioning assembly in an operative implementation. The trackpad architecture <b>100</b> can be used in any or all examples described herein. For example, the trackpad architecture <b>100</b> can be implemented in one or more devices exemplified below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. For example, and without limitation, a mobile device, a smartphone, a tablet, a laptop, a personal computer, a wearable device, an appliance, a television, a vehicle, and/or another user electronic device can have the trackpad architecture <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The trackpad architecture <b>100</b> includes a substrate <b>102</b> with a surface <b>102</b>&#x2032; that can be intended to be facing toward a user. For example, the surface <b>102</b>&#x2032; can be accessible to the user, such as by way of the user's finger(s) and/or a stylus or other object. In some implementations, the substrate <b>102</b> can include glass. For example, soda lime glass can be used. The substrate <b>102</b> can be treated in one or more ways. For example, the surface <b>102</b>&#x2032; can be sandblasted. The substrate <b>102</b> can be transparent, partially transparent, partially opaque, or opaque. In some implementations, the surface opposite the surface <b>102</b>&#x2032; can be treated in one or more ways. For example, a material (e.g., ink and/or epoxy) can be applied (e.g., by a printing process, such as by silkscreen printing).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The trackpad architecture <b>100</b> can include a layer <b>104</b>. For example, the layer <b>104</b> can be applied to some or all of the surface that is opposite the surface <b>102</b>&#x2032; of the substrate <b>102</b>. In some implementations, the layer <b>104</b> is at least in part adhesive. Any suitable type of adhesive can be used. For example, the layer <b>104</b> can include a pressure-sensitive adhesive. As another example, the layer <b>104</b> can include a heat-activated film.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The trackpad architecture <b>100</b> can include a circuit board <b>106</b> for detecting a position of an object adjacent the substrate <b>102</b>. In some implementations, the circuit board <b>106</b> includes electrical or electronic components, and connections between them, for sensing the contact or the proximate presence of an object such as the user's finger(s) and/or a stylus, and to generate a corresponding position signal. For example, capacitive and/or resistive sensing can be used for the sensing. Such a position signal can be used for one or more purposes by a system. The position signal can cause one or more actions to be performed, and/or one or more actions to be inhibited, in the system. For example, and without limitation, the position signal can select an object, move an object, generate a sound, and/or switch a device into a different state (e.g., on or off).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some implementations, the circuit board <b>106</b> includes electrical or electronic components, and connections between them, for sensing the force applied by the contact of an object such as the user's finger(s) and/or a stylus with the substrate <b>102</b>, and to generate a corresponding force signal. The force sensing can be based on inductive measurement by way of one or more inductive elements positioned on or within the circuit board <b>106</b>. For example, the change in inductance as a result of displacement of at least the circuit board <b>106</b> relative to another component of the system (e.g., a target plate or a housing of a device implementing the system) may be determined. The force sensing can be done using a force sensing circuit that detects force applied to the substrate <b>102</b> using the inductive element(s). Solely by way of example, inductive force sensing may be advantageous compared to another approach such as capacitive sensing in that inductive sensing may provide a greater signal-to-ratio. Accordingly, inductive force sensing can provide a greater resolution, to name just one example.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The generated force signal(s) can be used for one or more purposes by a system. The force signal can cause one or more actions to be performed, and/or one or more actions to be inhibited, in the system. For example, and without limitation, the force signal can be recognized by the system as a click or tap, and the appropriate action(s) can be taken in response. In some implementations, the circuit board <b>106</b> can include a printed circuit board (PCB) or a PCB assembly (PCBA).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The layer <b>104</b> can contact at least one of the substrate <b>102</b> or the circuit board <b>106</b>. In some implementations, the layer <b>104</b> serves at least in part for assembling the substrate <b>102</b> to the circuit board <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The trackpad architecture <b>100</b> can include a layer <b>108</b>. In some implementations, the layer <b>108</b> is at least in part adhesive. Any suitable type of adhesive can be used. For example, the layer <b>108</b> can include a pressure-sensitive adhesive. As another example, the layer <b>108</b> can include a heat-activated film.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The trackpad architecture <b>100</b> can include a stiffener plate <b>110</b> to provide structural integrity to the circuit board <b>106</b> and/or to the substrate <b>102</b>. For example, the stiffness can counteract any force that is applied as part of a user touching or pressing on the substrate <b>102</b>. As such, in an implementation that includes the stiffener plate <b>110</b>, the circuit board <b>106</b> and/or the substrate <b>102</b> need not be made as stiff as they otherwise might have been. The stiffener plate <b>110</b> can be made of metal. In some implementations, the stiffener plate <b>110</b> includes steel. For example, stainless steel can be used. In some implementations, the stiffener plate <b>110</b> includes aluminum. For example, an aluminum alloy can be used. The stiffener plate <b>110</b> can be stamped from material stock (e.g., a sheet of metal). The stiffener plate <b>110</b> can have one or more openings. In some implementations, an opening <b>112</b> can be provided in the stiffener plate <b>110</b>. For example, the opening <b>112</b> can accommodate a haptic feedback component (e.g., as mounted to the circuit board <b>106</b>).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The layer <b>108</b> can contact at least one of the circuit board <b>106</b> or the stiffener plate <b>110</b>. In some implementations, the layer <b>108</b> serves at least in part for assembling the stiffener plate <b>110</b> to the circuit board <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The trackpad architecture <b>100</b> can include one or more grounding elements. In some implementations, the trackpad architecture <b>100</b> includes grounding elements <b>114</b> that electrically connect the stiffener plate <b>110</b> and the circuit board <b>106</b> to each other. For example, the grounding elements <b>114</b> can be positioned between the stiffener plate <b>110</b> and the circuit board <b>106</b> so as to make electrical contact with the stiffener plate <b>110</b> and the circuit board <b>106</b> (e.g., with a ground contact provided on the circuit board <b>106</b>). In the present illustration, the grounding elements are shown away from the stiffener plate <b>110</b> and the circuit board <b>106</b> for illustrative purposes. The grounding elements <b>114</b> can be made of any suitable electrically conductive material. In some implementations, the grounding elements <b>114</b> include metal.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Grounding elements (e.g., the grounding elements <b>114</b>) can protect the circuit board <b>106</b> and components thereof against electrostatic discharge (ESD). This can prevent damage to integrated circuits of the circuit board <b>106</b> (e.g., components on a PCBA). For example, the grounding element(s) can lead charges from the circuit board <b>106</b> to a housing to facilitate that a high-voltage ESD is dissipated in the remainder of the system (e.g., in the body of a laptop computer or other electronic device). The grounding elements <b>114</b> can have any suitable shape. For example, a grounding element <b>114</b>A is here substantially planar and has an essentially rectangular shape. As such, the trackpad architecture <b>100</b> can include multiple rectangular metal elements that are in contact with the stiffener plate <b>110</b> and the circuit board <b>106</b>. When the stiffener plate <b>110</b> includes an electrically conductive material and is electrically in contact with the housing, the grounding element(s) <b>114</b> can provide an electrically conductive path between the circuit board <b>106</b> and the stiffener plate <b>110</b>, thereby helping to lead charges from the circuit board <b>106</b> to the housing.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The trackpad architecture <b>100</b> can include one or more protective layers covering at least a portion of the circuit board <b>106</b>. In some implementations, a protective layer <b>116</b> includes one or more pieces configured to cover the inductive element(s) on the circuit board <b>106</b>. The protective layer <b>116</b> can have any suitable shape and be made of any suitable material. For example, a protective layer <b>116</b>A is here substantially disk-shaped. For example, the protective layer <b>116</b>A can be made of a non-inductive film such as plastic (e.g., having an adhesive material on one or more sides). The protective layer <b>116</b> can include one or more of the protective layer <b>116</b>A. Here, four of the protective layer <b>116</b>A that are substantially identical to each other are shown.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The trackpad architecture <b>100</b> can include at least one spring. In some implementations, the trackpad architecture <b>100</b> includes one or more springs <b>118</b> configured for placement between the stiffener plate <b>110</b> and a housing (not shown) of the system (e.g., a housing of an electronic device). The spring(s) <b>118</b> can facilitate a change in distance between the stiffener plate <b>110</b> and the housing (not shown) based on a force applied to the substrate <b>102</b>. For example, the change in distance can cause a change in inductance that when sensed can be used to detect the applied force. A spring <b>118</b>A can be made of any material having suitable stiffness to bias the trackpad assembly. In some implementations, the spring <b>118</b>A is made at least in part from metal (e.g., but not limited to, stainless steel). For example, the spring <b>118</b>A can be stamped from metal stock (e.g., so that the spring <b>118</b>A has uniform thickness and/or is essentially planar). The spring <b>118</b> can include one or more of the spring <b>118</b>A. Here, two instances of the spring <b>118</b>A that are substantially identical to each other (e.g., symmetrical) are shown. The spring <b>118</b>A can provide more design flexibilities and/or offer a weight reduction compared to an approach where the trackpad assembly is supported by a plate configured to flex under the applied force. For example, the spring <b>118</b>A can advantageously provide both a suspension system for the trackpad, and serve for integration of the trackpad into the overall system (e.g., a laptop computer or other electronic device).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The trackpad architecture <b>100</b> can include an actuator <b>120</b> configured to provide haptic output (e.g., a perceptible tactile sensation) to the user via the substrate <b>102</b>. In some implementations, the actuator <b>120</b> is coupled to the circuit board <b>106</b>. For example, the actuator <b>120</b> can be mounted to the circuit board <b>106</b> on the surface opposite the surface that faces the substrate <b>102</b>. The opening <b>112</b> can facilitate placement of the actuator <b>120</b> on the circuit board <b>106</b>. In some implementations, the actuator <b>120</b> can include an electromagnetic actuator. For example, a linear resonant actuator can be used.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As such, the trackpad architecture <b>100</b> is an example of an architecture that can be used for a trackpad that includes a substrate (e.g., the substrate <b>102</b>), a stiffener plate (e.g., the stiffener plate <b>110</b>), a circuit board (e.g., the circuit board <b>106</b>) between the substrate and the stiffener plate for detecting a position of an object adjacent the substrate. The circuit board can include an inductive element (not shown). The trackpad can include a spring (e.g., the spring <b>118</b>A) between the stiffener plate and the housing, the spring facilitating a change in distance between the stiffener plate and the housing based on a force applied to the substrate. The trackpad can include force sensing circuitry (not shown) that detects the force using the inductive element.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an exploded view of another example of the trackpad architecture <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Here, the trackpad architecture <b>100</b> is shown from a different perspective than the one discussed above. Also, some components of the trackpad architecture <b>100</b> are assembled together or omitted in the present example. Here, the layer <b>108</b> is positioned adjacent (e.g., abutting) the circuit board <b>106</b>. The stiffener plate <b>110</b> is shown having two of the spring <b>118</b>A positioned at respective ends thereof. The grounding elements <b>114</b> are shown, as is the actuator <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The layer <b>108</b> can include an opening <b>200</b> that defines a space for placement of the actuator <b>120</b> on the circuit board <b>106</b>. For example, the opening <b>112</b> in the stiffener plate <b>110</b> can facilitate the placement of the actuator <b>120</b>. In some implementations, one or more structures at the circuit board <b>106</b> can be used in the mounting of the actuator <b>120</b>. For example, self-clinching nuts <b>202</b> are here shown attached to the circuit board <b>106</b> and can facilitate attachment of the actuator <b>120</b>. The stiffener plate <b>110</b> can include openings and/or cutouts that facilitate force sensing (e.g., by inductive measurement). Here, features <b>204</b> in the stiffener plate <b>110</b> serve to expose inductive elements (e.g., positioned adjacent, and currently covered by, the protective layer <b>116</b>A), for example so that inductance can be measured.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an exploded view of an example of a trackpad architecture <b>300</b> including a target plate <b>302</b>. The trackpad architecture <b>300</b> can be used in any or all examples described herein. For example, the trackpad architecture <b>300</b> can be implemented in one or more devices exemplified below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. In the trackpad architecture <b>300</b>, a trackpad assembly <b>304</b> can include one or more components of the trackpad architecture <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). For example, the trackpad assembly <b>304</b> can include the circuit board <b>106</b>, the stiffener plate <b>110</b>, the spring(s) <b>118</b>A, the protective layer <b>116</b>A, and/or the actuator <b>120</b>. The trackpad assembly <b>304</b> is here shown positioned for assembly to the substrate <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The target plate <b>302</b> can be used in inductive sensing that also involves one or more inductive elements (e.g., that may be covered by the protective layer <b>116</b>A in the present illustration). In some implementations, the inductance of such inductive element(s), and/or a change in such inductance, can be detected or determined. For example, a change in inductance caused by dislocation of the trackpad assembly <b>304</b> and the substrate <b>102</b> as the user presses on the substrate <b>102</b>, can be interpreted as a force on the trackpad and accordingly trigger a force signal in the system. As such, the trackpad architecture <b>100</b> can include an inductive force sensor that can detect inputs such as the user clicking, or pressing, on the substrate <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The target plate <b>302</b> can be made of metal. In some implementations, the target plate <b>302</b> includes steel. For example, stainless steel, aluminum (e.g., an alloy), magnesium alloy, and/or a composite material can be used. The target plate <b>302</b> can be stamped from material stock (e.g., a sheet of metal). The target plate <b>302</b> can be attached to another component (not shown). For example, the target plate <b>302</b> can be secured to a housing of an electronic device (e.g., a laptop or other computer device). As another example, an implementation can omit the target plate <b>302</b>, wherein a portion of the housing (e.g., a metal body that at least partially encloses the system or device, including, but not limited to, a unibody housing) can instead serve the function of being used in inductive force sensing. The target plate <b>302</b> can have one or more openings. Here, an opening <b>302</b>&#x2032; is located in the center of the target plate <b>302</b>. The opening <b>302</b>&#x2032; can reduce the amount of material used in the target plate <b>302</b>, and/or accommodate one or more components (e.g., the actuator <b>120</b>). One or more other openings may be used (e.g., for attachment purposes). The opening(s) (e.g., the opening <b>302</b>&#x2032;) can facilitate accommodation of one or more components on the circuit board <b>106</b>. For example, the actuator <b>120</b> and/or other components (e.g., a connector for power and digital signal to a motherboard) can be accommodated on the circuit board <b>106</b> by way of the opening <b>302</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The substrate <b>102</b> and the trackpad assembly <b>304</b> can be joined to each other in any suitable way. In some implementations, one or more adhesives are used for attachment. For example, the layer <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) can provide adhesive(s) to affix the substrate <b>102</b> and the trackpad assembly <b>304</b> to each other.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The target plate <b>302</b> and the trackpad assembly <b>304</b> can be joined to each other in any suitable way. In some implementations, one or more springs (e.g., the spring <b>118</b>A) are used for attachment. For example, one or more fasteners (e.g., a bolt or screw) can affix the target plate <b>302</b> and the spring <b>118</b>A to each other.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an exploded view of the trackpad assembly <b>304</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. One or more compliant members can be provided as an interface between the spring <b>118</b>A and a remainder of the trackpad assembly <b>304</b>, such as the stiffener plate <b>110</b>. In some implementations, foam <b>400</b> can be provided. For example, a foam <b>400</b>A can be positioned between an area <b>110</b>A of the stiffener plate <b>110</b> and a bias portion <b>402</b> of the spring <b>118</b>A.

The portion <b>602</b> can be configured with an opening <b>616</b> to accommodate some or all of the trackpad <b>606</b>.

It may be advantageous to provide electrical contact (e.g., grounding) between the stiffener plate <b>110</b> and the target plate <b>302</b>. For example, this can allow excess charges at the circuit board (which may be electrically coupled to the stiffener plate; see, e.g., the grounding element <b>114</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Here, the trackpad assembly <b>304</b> includes four (as an example) instances of a grounding element <b>700</b> that electrically connects the stiffener plate <b>110</b> and the target plate <b>302</b> to each other. In some implementations, the grounding element <b>700</b> can increase the protection against ESD for the circuit board and its components. For example, when the target plate <b>302</b> includes an electrically conductive material and is electrically in contact with the housing, the grounding element(s) <b>700</b> can provide an electrically conductive path between the stiffener plate <b>110</b> and the target plate <b>302</b>.

The grounding element <b>700</b> can include a portion <b>704</b> extending to and from the portion <b>702</b>. For example, the portion <b>704</b> can have a predominantly spiral-shaped configuration. The grounding element <b>700</b> can include a portion <b>706</b> configured for coupling to the target plate <b>302</b>. During application of force to the substrate, the distance between the stiffener plate <b>110</b> and the target plate <b>302</b> can vary, and the design of a grounding element such as the grounding element <b>700</b> can facilitate that electrical contact is maintained between the stiffener plate <b>110</b> and the target plate <b>302</b>. The portion <b>704</b> can undergo essentially a 360-degree turn between the portion <b>702</b> and the portion <b>706</b>.

For example, solder pads may be provided that engage in a reflow process in an oven at high temperature, which can fix the self-clinching nut <b>202</b> in place on the circuit board <b>106</b>. The self-clinching nut <b>202</b> can provide an opening <b>802</b> that has inwardly facing threads.

Adhesives can lead to relatively large unit-to-unit variations. Namely, when an adhesive is used, the adhesive is the only way in which vibrations are transferred from the actuator <b>800</b> to the circuit board <b>106</b> (and from there to the substrate, for perception by the user). When the adhesive is being applied, it may be a squishy, somewhat compressible substance, which can cause the thickness or other structural property of the adhesive layer to differ between assembled units. Also, an adhesive layer may be more susceptible to damages from external impact, such as if the electronic device is dropped.

The signal/foil layer can include a conductive material (e.g., copper) to facilitate signals or other electric transmissions in the PCBA. The PCBA can include one or more pre-preg layer. The pre-preg layer can include a polymer material (e.g., epoxy) at which conductive components in the PCBA (e.g., the signal/foil layer) are situated.

Process <b>1600</b> describes example operations for detecting an earthquake. Process <b>1600</b> includes receiving, at a remote server, multiple earthquake vibration signals generated from multiple computing devices through vibrations detected on trackpads of the computing devices (<b>1602</b>). For example, the remote server <b>1430</b> is configured to receive multiple earthquake vibration signals generated from multiple computing devices <b>1402</b>, <b>1422</b><i>a</i>-<b>1422</b><i>x </i>through vibrations detected on the trackpads of the computing devices <b>1402</b>, <b>1422</b><i>a</i>-<b>1422</b><i>x</i>. Specifically, the signal receiving module <b>1442</b> of the application <b>1440</b> may receive the multiple earthquake vibration signals. As discussed above, the earthquake vibration signals include data from an inductive element in the trackpads of the computing devices <b>1402</b>, <b>1422</b><i>a</i>-<b>1422</b><i>x</i>, locations of the computing devices <b>1402</b>, <b>1422</b><i>a</i>-<b>1422</b><i>x</i>, and timestamps of a time the vibrations were detected on the trackpads.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Process <b>1600</b> includes aggregating the earthquake vibration signals and inputting the aggregated earthquake vibration signals into a machine learning module (<b>1604</b>). For example, the signal receiving module <b>1442</b> of the application <b>1440</b> may aggregate the received earthquake vibration signals and input the aggregated earthquake vibration signals into the machine learning module <b>1444</b>. In some implementations, the aggregation is performed based on the location information included in the earthquake vibration signals.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Process <b>1600</b> includes processing, by the machine learning module, the aggregated earthquake vibration signals to detect an earthquake in a location (<b>1606</b>). For example, the machine learning module <b>1444</b> is configured to process the aggregated earthquake vibration signals to detect an earthquake in a location, as discussed in detail above. Process <b>1600</b> includes sending an earthquake alert to the multiple computing devices in response to detecting the earthquake by the machine learning module (<b>1608</b>). For example, the communication module <b>1446</b> is configured to send the earthquake alert to the multiple computing devices <b>1402</b>, <b>1422</b><i>a</i>-<b>1422</b><i>x </i>in response to the machine learning module <b>1444</b> detecting the earthquake. In some implementations, the process <b>1600</b> further includes sending the earthquake alert to other multiple computing devices in response to detecting the earthquake by the machine learning module. In some implementations, the process <b>1600</b> further includes sending a user feedback option to the multiple computing devices to enable a response to the earthquake alert.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In some implementations, the processing by the machine learning module <b>1444</b> includes determining the aggregated earthquake vibration signals are a false positive based on the data from the inductive element in the trackpads not having period vibrations. As a result of determining the aggregated signals amount to a false positive, then an earthquake alert is not sent. In some implementations, the processing by the machine learning module <b>1444</b> includes determining the aggregated earthquake vibration signals are a false positive based on locations of the computing devices defining an area within a threshold area. For example, if the vibrations are very localized in small areas, the vibrations may be caused by something other than an earthquake such as, for example, construction.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The described electronic device, system and methods may provide a reliable earthquake detection without the need of installing one or more dedicated seismometers. A large number of electronic devices may be used so as to provide a large coverage and/or granularity in a simple and easily scalable manner. Further, earthquake alerts may be quickly and efficiently distributed.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Further to the descriptions above, a user may be provided with controls allowing the user to make an election as to both if and when systems, programs, or features described herein may enable collection of user information (e.g., a user's current location, zip code, geolocation, etc.), and if the user is sent content or communications from a server. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be encrypted and/or not associated with a specific user account or other user identifiable information where location information is obtained. Thus, the user may have control over what information is collected about the user, how that information is used, and what information is provided to the user.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In addition to not including any personally identifiable information, the information communicated from the electronic devices to the remote server may use only a current state of the electronic device without using any history of the information. For instance, when an electronic device communicates location information as part of the earthquake vibration signal, only a current location of the electronic device may be included as part of the signal. That is, location history information is not included as part of the earthquake vibration signal as part of privacy protection controls. The current location information included in the earthquake vibration signal is not paired with any user identity information when the earthquake vibration signal is sent to the remote server. The earthquake vibration signal may be encrypted, as a further measure of privacy protection. As noted above, the information included in the earthquake vibration signal is anonymously aggregated at the remote server and used only for the purpose of determining if an earthquake is occurring in a particular location based on the aggregated location information so that an earthquake alert may be sent to people in the affected location. The earthquake alert communicated to the affected area may provide people valuable time, even if seconds, to take protective action from the earthquake. Additional privacy protection controls may include storing the received earthquake vibration signals for a limited period of time (e.g., one hour) and then permanently deleting the information from the remote server.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">As mentioned above, the user may have control over using the earthquake alert feature or not using the earthquake alert feature including options such as not sending an earthquake vibration signal to the remote server. In some implementations, the user may still elect to receive an earthquake alert even if the user elects not to send an earthquake vibration signal from their electronic device.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows an example of a generic computer device <b>1700</b> and a generic mobile computer device <b>1750</b>, which may be used with the techniques described here.
