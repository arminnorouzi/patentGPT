For example, it relates to a process for recycling polystyrene waste comprising dissolving the polystyrene waste in a solvent such as p-cymene then precipitating and washing the polystyrene with a non-solvent.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Polystyrene waste, for example, the packaging from electronic products or furniture, food trays, commercial products and insulation can, for example, have environmental consequences.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, whether post-consumer or post-industrial, the majority of polystyrene waste is buried in landfills. For example, every year in Quebec more than 40,000 tons of polystyrene waste is buried. Further, more than 60,000 tons of new polystyrene is bought and consumed every year in Quebec.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known processes for recycling polystyrene do not produce recycled polystyrene having the same properties as new polystyrene. For example, known methods of polystyrene do not prepare recycled polystyrene having a Melt Flow Index (MFI) which meets technical specifications for using the recycled polystyrene for the same uses as new polystyrene is used for. To compensate this loss of mechanical properties, the recycled polystyrene is blended with new polystyrene in a proportion that rarely can exceed 20%, even for the less stringent applications.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Most industrial polystyrene objects are not composed only of polystyrene; for example, they may contain chemicals added to a polymer to modify some physical, biological and/or chemical property. Examples of additives are: coloring agents, fillers, flame retardants, lubricants and plasticizers.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would thus be desirable to be provided with a recycled polystyrene and a process for recycling polystyrene waste that would at least partially solve one of the problems mentioned or that would be an alternative to the known processes for recycling polystyrene waste.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore according to an aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a recycled polystyrene having a melt flow index of less than about 25 g/10 min measured according to ASTM D1238-13.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a recycled polystyrene having a melt flow index of less than about 25 g/10 min measured according to ASTM D1238-13 standard and an additive content of less than about 1 wt %.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a recycled polystyrene having a melt flow index of less than about 25 g/10 min measured according to ASTM D1238-13 standard and a ash content of less than about 1 wt %, measured according to ASTM D5630-13 standard.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a recycled polystyrene having a melt flow index of less than about 25 g/10 min measured according to ASTM D1238-13 standard and an ash content of less than about 0.5 wt %, measured according to ASTM D5630-13 standard.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a recycled polystyrene having a melt flow index of less than about 25 g/10 min.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a recycled polystyrene having a melt flow index of less than about 25 g/10 min, measured according to ASTM D1238-13 standard.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a process for recycling polystyrene waste, comprising:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">dissolving the polystyrene waste in p-cymene under conditions to obtain a polystyrene/p-cymene mixture;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">adding the polystyrene/p-cymene mixture to a first portion of hydrocarbon polystyrene non-solvent under conditions to obtain precipitated polystyrene and a first portion of hydrocarbon waste solution;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">separating the precipitated polystyrene from the first portion of hydrocarbon waste solution;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">optionally repeating the dissolving, adding and separating;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">washing the precipitated polystyrene with a second portion of hydrocarbon polystyrene non-solvent under conditions to obtain washed polystyrene and a second portion of hydrocarbon waste solution;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">separating the washed polystyrene from the second portion of hydrocarbon waste solution;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">washing the washed polystyrene with a third portion of hydrocarbon polystyrene non-solvent under conditions to obtain twice-washed polystyrene and a third portion of hydrocarbon waste solution;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">separating the twice-washed polystyrene from the third portion of hydrocarbon waste solution;

Accordingly, the processes of the present disclosure may, for example, save on transportation costs if, for example, the polystyrene/p-cymene mixture is obtained at a first location and the process further comprises transporting the polystyrene/p-cymene mixture to a second location wherein subsequent steps in the process are carried out.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The process for recycling polystyrene waste of the present disclosure may, for example allow removal of most additives (for example, chemicals added to a polymer to modify some physical, biological and/or chemical property) and can produce recycled polystyrene having properties very close to that of new polystyrene. The recycled polystyrene prepared from the processes of the present disclosure may, for example, be suitable for use for the same uses as new polystyrene such as for the preparation of new polystyrene articles. For example, the recycled polystyrene prepared from the processes of the present disclosure may, for example, have an MFI within a useful range for such uses.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">It was found that the recycled polystyrenes of the present disclosure and the processes for obtaining same were quite useful. In fact, it was found that such recycled polymers and processes allowed for providing recycled polystyrene having a very low content of additives (fillers and/or lubricants). That also leads to recycled polystyrene having a very low content in ash. For example, when applying these processes to white expanded or extruded polystyrene, the final product is very clear and transparent to light transmission. Such a feature of the polymers and processes of the present disclosure are very interesting since it allows for significantly increasing the life cycle of recycled polystyrene. In fact, use of recycled polystyrene is quite often limited in view of the various additives contained therein and they therefore do not meet the requirements for certain uses or applications that can be made with polystyrene. Some manufacturer will also be reluctant to use recycled polystyrene since it can have a too high content of additives and it may affect or diminish the properties of the polystyrene or products made with such recycled polystyrene. This is clearly not the case with the polymers and processes mentioned in the present disclosure. On the contrary, such very low amounts of additives and/or fillers found in the polymers of the present disclosure allow for using these recycled polystyrenes in many different applications and also to recycle them many many times since merely never reaching high quantities of additives and/or fillers since user of such products is not mandatory to recycle them and to obtain low MFI values.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Thus the polymers and processes of the present disclosure allow for increasing the life cycle of recycled polystyrene (it is possible to recycle it many many times while maintaining the required specifications and properties) and also they have a very low MFI, while avoiding the use of large quantities of additives and/or fillers.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the following drawings, which represent by way of example only, various embodiments of the disclosure:</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a process according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Unless otherwise indicated, the definitions and embodiments described in this and other sections are intended to be applicable to all embodiments and aspects of the present disclosure herein described for which they are suitable as would be understood by a person skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As used in the present disclosure, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural references unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.

Various non-polar additives including hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and the silicone oils used in its manufacture are dissolved in the p-cymene solvent. This step was performed in a closed, vented tank called the dissolution module. An object of the module is to maximize the amount of polystyrene that can be solubilised within a given period of time. For example, a metallic grid inside the dissolution module can push the expanded polystyrene objects into p-cymene which can reduce, for example, dissolution time from hours to minutes.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0179">The third step (washing) had objectives which included: (1) the precipitation of the polystyrene; (2) recovery of the p-cymene in order to reuse it in step 1; and (3) elimination of the different additives that may alter the mechanical properties of the recycled polystyrene.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0180">This step comprised first precipitating the solubilised polystyrene with hexane, heptane or any other hydrocarbon with a suitable boiling point. While heptane was observed to provide the best results in the washing step, other hydrocarbons may also be useful. Hexane and octane were tested in the present studies. Petroleum distillates with a boiling point of from about 100&#xb0; C. to about 120&#xb0; C. may also be useful and may provide, for example, reduced process and/or operating costs.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0181">For example, the solvent may have a boiling point around or slightly above the T<sub>g </sub>for the polystyrene waste. While the T<sub>g </sub>of polystyrene may vary, for example as a function of molecular weight, the T<sub>g </sub>for the polystyrene waste is typically about 98&#xb0; C. It will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that there is typically only a small variation of T<sub>g </sub>with molecular weight or polydispersity for most polystyrenes used in the fabrication of industrial polystyrene objects. Accordingly, the solvent may have a boiling point up to about 110&#xb0; C., for example a boiling point of about 105&#xb0; C. to about 110&#xb0; C. at 1 atm pressure. A suitable hydrocarbon solvent may, for example enable more than 90% of the p-cymene to migrate into it and is a non-solvent for polystyrene.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0182">To carry out the first washing step (i.e. precipitating the polystyrene), the mixture of solubilised polystyrene in p-cymene was slowly poured into a double wall stainless steel tank containing the hydrocarbon at its boiling temperature. In an exemplary experiment hexane at its boiling temperature (69&#xb0; C.) was used for this step. In other exemplary experiments heptane at its boiling temperature (98&#xb0; C.) was used for this step. The entire mixture was moderately stirred through use of a mechanical stirrer. The volume of polystyrene/p-cymene solution added to the hydrocarbon was in a polystyrene/p-cymene solution to hydrocarbon ratio by volume of 1:3. Under these conditions, the polystyrene precipitated in the form of a sticky white paste. The stirring time (from about 5 minutes to about 10 minutes) allowed for a useful amount of diffusion of the p-cymene into the hydrocarbon. Afterward, the solvent mixture supernatant was removed by a simple decantation, after which it was possible to perform a second washing of the precipitated polystyrene.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0183">The second washing was performed in the same tank with heptane. A defined volume of heptane having a boiling temperature of 98&#xb0; C. was introduced into the tank, according to a polystyrene : heptane ratio by volume of 1:1. The whole mixture was boiled at atmospheric pressure under moderate mechanical stirring over about 2 minutes to about 5 minutes. Using a different hydrocarbon in the second wash than in the first wash increased the malleability of the polystyrene which, for example, increased diffusion of the remaining p-cymene solvent out of the precipitated polystyrene and into the hydrocarbon. Thereafter, the supernatant solvent mixture was removed by a simple decantation. According to the calculations of washing efficiency, less than 0.1% p-cymene remained in the precipitated polystyrene at this stage.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0184">A third washing with boiling heptane was used in order to further reduce the presence of p-cymene in the polystyrene. The presence of residual solvent may, for example, affect the melt index, also called melt flow index (MFI). The degree of washing efficiency is inversely proportional to the MFI. The washing conditions used were the same as in the second washing step.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0185">The recovered solvent mixture contained hexane, heptane, p-cymene and/or any other hydrocarbon solvent used as well as non-polar additives extracted from the PS. The proportion of p-cymene and additives was higher in the first solvent mixture than in the second and third solvent mixtures. Fractional distillation was used to separate the different products. The p-cymene was reused for the solubilisation step while hexane and heptane were reused in the washing steps. The recovered additives were considered to be waste for disposal.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0186">The fourth step (drying) comprised drying the polystyrene paste, which contained about 5-37% heptane in a dryer at a temperature of 120&#xb0; C. An objective was to remove substantially all of the remaining solvent without altering the quality of the polymer.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0187">The fifth step (packaging) comprised cutting the dried polystyrene into small pellets suitable for the distribution of the product to customers. A pelletizer as commonly used in the industry was utilized to control the size and the shape of the final product.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0188">In order to limit the PS degradation which is mainly due to oxidation as observed during the drying and extrusion steps, a commercial antioxidant such as Irganox&#x2122; 1076 (octadecyl-3-(3,5-di-tert.butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionate) can be added in a proportion of about 1%, based on the weight of the polystyrene. This compound is acceptable for food applications, has a melting point of 50&#xb0; C. and can be added at various times in the process: i.e. with the p-cymene, in the washing steps and/or at the final extrusion step.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0189">Table 1 shows the results from recycling various types of waste polystyrene using steps of the above-described process.</p><p id="p-0186"

The addition of butadiene in styrene results in the formation of polystyrene-co-butadiene copolymer showing a much better resistance to impact than pure polystyrene. The butadiene units in polystyrene-co-butadiene could be used to create a three-dimensional matrix with the polymer chains. By creating links between the polymeric chains, the molecular weight increases and then the melt flow index must decrease. The poly(styrene-co-butadiene) polymer contains 4% of butadiene.
