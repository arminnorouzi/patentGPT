num="0001">This application is based upon and claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No. 202110734198.6, filed on Jun. 30, 2021, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of electric bed technologies, and in particular to a foldable electric bed frame.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Along with improvement of social economic development and life level, people have higher and higher requirements for functions of beds. In order to lift up a back or legs of a human body so as to increase comfort or help an old person to sit up, an electric bed with two end heights of a bed board adjustable emerges. Generally, an electric bed includes a back board for lifting up a back, a middle board for supporting hips and a leg board for supporting legs. Nowadays, more and more electric beds appear in places such as home, hospital and sanatorium. Along with increasingly-worsening aging of society and faster pace of lives of young persons, time for taking care of old persons becomes less and less. Smart electric beds with humanization designs can provide some assistance to the lives of the old persons. Usually, a foldable structure is employed in the electric beds available on market to facilitate transportation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Because a push rod needs to have a large push force as required by a bed board of an electric bed, a bed frame of the electric bed may be deformed, leading to failure to lift up the bed board. In order to gain a good structural force condition, an angle of inclination of the push rod is usually increased because a larger angle of inclination of the push rod means a smaller push force is desired by the bed board of the electric bed. However, mounting positions of two ends of the existing push rod are basically fixed, and thus a thickness of the bed board of the electric bed has to be made larger in order to increase the mounting angle of inclination of the push rod. Along with increase of the thickness of the bed board, the transportation costs for the package of folded bed board will be increased by folds.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, how to reduce a thickness of a folded bed board in a case of increasing a mounting angle of inclination of a push rod becomes an urgent problem to be solved at present.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention aims to provide a foldable electric bed frame to solve the problem that transportation cost is increased for an increased thickness of a folded bed board resulting from increase of an angle of inclination of a push rod in the prior art.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to achieve the above object, the present invention employs the following basic solution: provided is a foldable electric bed frame, comprising a bottom frame and a push rod. A first board and a second board hinged to each other are disposed on the top of the bottom frame, a second board is fixedly connected to the bottom frame, a side of the bottom frame away from the first board is hinged with a third board, one end of the push rod is hinged at the bottom of the first board, and the other end of the push rod is rotatably connected to a side edge of the second board through a connection device. The connection device includes a height adjusting piece and a height locking piece. A distance from the height adjusting piece to the second board in a working state is larger than a distance from the height adjusting piece to the second board in a folded state, and the height locking piece locks a position of the height adjusting piece in the working state.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The working principle of the solution is described below: when the bed frame is to be transported, the bed frame will be folded between the second board and the third board to reduce a transportation area. The push rod will be located between an upper plane where the first board and the second board are located and a lower plane where the third board is located after the bed frame is folded. But the thickness of the folded bed frame will be increased. In order to reduce the thickness, it is required to set a longitudinal height of an end of the push rod relative to the bottom frame to be adjustable. The bed frame includes three states, i.e. a folded state, an unfolded state and a lifted state. The lifted state and the unfolded state belong to the working state. In the working state, the distance from the height adjusting piece to the second board is made larger to help the bed frame to have a good force-bearing condition. In the folded state, the distance from the height adjusting piece to the second board is made smaller to reduce the thickness of the folded bed board, thus increasing a goods transportation volume.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The solution has the following beneficial effects: the distance from the height adjusting piece to the second board is set to be adjustable, such that the bed frame has a smaller thickness after being folded while obtaining a good force-bearing condition. Further, the bed frame is easy and flexible to use, and no dismounting is required for the push rod at the time of folding, thus saving time and labor force.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, a thickness of a side edge of the second board is larger than that of a middle region, the side edge of the second board is fixedly connected with a fixing piece, and the bottom of the fixing piece has a protrusion abutted against the bottom of the side edge of the second board. The large thickness of the second board facilitates mounting the fixing piece and increasing a bearing capacity of the second board. The protrusions of the bottom of the fixing piece are abutted against the bottom of the side edge of the second board to help prevent the fixing piece from falling off.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, the fixing piece includes a second top plate and second side plates located at both sides of the second top plate and perpendicular to the second top plate. The second top plate is fixedly connected with outer sides of the second side plates, and the protrusion is located on the two second side plates respectively. The top of the fixing piece is hinged with a side edge of the first board, and the bottom of the fixing piece is connected with the height adjusting piece through bolt and nut. The connection of bolt and nut is convenient.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, the height adjusting piece has vertical strip-shaped slide grooves, and the bolt at the bottom of the fixing piece can penetrate through the vertical strip-shaped slide grooves and slide freely in the slide grooves. The strip-shaped slide groove can be easily processed with a smaller amount of material.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, the height locking piece is a limiting block at a side of the height adjusting piece. The other side of the height adjusting piece is hinged with an end of the push rod. In the working state, the limiting block is abutted against an inner side of the side edge of the second board, such that a height and an angle of the height adjusting piece are locked. The height and the angle of the height adjusting piece can be locked using the limiting block by rotating the height adjusting piece. This way, automatic locking function is implemented. Compared with the case that manual adjustment is made by tightening a screw in the prior art, this adjustment manner is more convenient and flexible.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, the limiting block has a sloping surface attached to the side edge of the second board, and the sloping surface can be well attached to a side surface of the second board.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, the height adjusting piece includes a bottom plate and clamping plates located at both sides of the bottom plate and perpendicular to the bottom plate. A middle part of each of the two clamping plates has an upwardly-convex bulge in which the slide groove is disposed, and the limiting block is disposed at a side of the clamping plate. The disposal of the bulge increases a length of the slide groove so as to increase a variable height of the height adjusting piece.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, an anti-collision pad is fixedly connected on the limiting block to improve the durability of the limiting block.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, a plurality of bed legs are detachably connected at the bottom frame and the bottom of the third board. The detachable bed legs increase a use height of the bed frame and may be dismounted for folding of the bed frame, bringing ease of use.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a structural schematic diagram of a foldable electric bed frame in an unfolded state according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a structural schematic diagram of a foldable electric bed frame with a back board lifted according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a structural schematic diagram of a foldable electric bed frame in a folded state according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a partially enlarged view of position A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a structural schematic diagram of a fixing piece and a rotary piece in a foldable electric bed frame according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a structural schematic diagram of a push rod in a foldable electric bed frame according to the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Detailed descriptions will be made below in combination with specific embodiments.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Numerals of the drawings are described below: bottom frame <b>1</b>, back board <b>2</b>, middle board <b>3</b>, push rod <b>4</b>, fixed connection seat <b>5</b>, rotary connection seat <b>6</b>, fixing piece <b>61</b>, second top plate <b>611</b>, second side plate <b>612</b>, rotary piece <b>62</b>, bottom plate <b>621</b>, clamping plate <b>622</b>, bulge <b>6221</b>, slide groove <b>6222</b>, limiting block <b>6223</b>, sloping surface <b>6224</b>, first reinforcing pipe <b>7</b>, middle pipe <b>8</b>, basic pipe <b>9</b>, leg board <b>10</b>, leg guard bar <b>11</b>, second reinforcing pipe <b>12</b>, a bed leg welding sheet <b>13</b>, and bed leg <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, provided is a foldable electric bed frame, comprising a rectangular bottom frame <b>1</b>, the top of the bottom frame <b>1</b> is connected with a first board and a second board that are hinged to each other.
