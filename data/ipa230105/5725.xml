For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 52-119290 discloses an ion detector including an electron multiplier tube for detecting positive ions and an electron multiplier tube for detecting negative ions.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the ion detector described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 52-119290, a signal processing circuit such as an amplifier dedicated to each output of the electron multiplier tube for detecting positive ions and the electron multiplier tube for detecting negative ions is provided. Therefore, the circuit scale may be increased. In this technical field, it is desired to detect ions of both polarities while reducing the circuit scale.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure describes an ion detector capable of detecting ions of both polarities while reducing circuit scale.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An ion detector according to one aspect of the present disclosure includes: a first electron multiplier that detects first ions having a first polarity; a second electron multiplier that detects second ions having a second polarity different from the first polarity; a first anode that captures electrons emitted from the first electron multiplier; a second anode that captures electrons emitted from the second electron multiplier; and a switching circuit that includes a first input terminal electrically connected to the first anode, a second input terminal electrically connected to the second anode, and an output terminal, and selectively connects one of the first input terminal and the second input terminal to the output terminal.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the ion detector, the first anode that captures electrons emitted from the first electron multiplier that detects first ions having the first polarity is electrically connected to the first input terminal of the switching circuit, and the second anode that captures electrons emitted from the second electron multiplier that detects second ions having the second polarity is electrically connected to the second input terminal of the switching circuit. Since the switching circuit selectively connects one of the first input terminal and the second input terminal to the output terminal, a signal related to first ion detection and a signal related to second ion detection are selectively output from the output terminal. Therefore, since one signal processing circuit commonly used for first ion detection and second ion detection can be provided in a subsequent stage of the ion detector, it is not necessary to provide both a dedicated signal processing circuit for first ion detection and a dedicated signal processing circuit for second ion detection. As a result, ions of both polarities can be detected while the circuit scale is reduced.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The ion detector may further include an ion introduction unit provided with a through hole having a central axis extending in a first direction. The first electron multiplier may include a first multiplier extending in the first direction, a first input electrode provided at a first end of the first multiplier in the first direction, and a first output electrode provided at a second end of the first multiplier in the first direction. The second electron multiplier may include a second multiplier extending in the first direction, a second input electrode provided at a first end of the second multiplier in the first direction, and a second output electrode provided at a second end of the second multiplier in the first direction. The first input electrode may receive first ions that have passed through the through hole. The second input electrode may receive second ions that have passed through the through hole. The first electron multiplier and the second electron multiplier may be spaced apart from each other in a second direction intersecting with the first direction. In this case, the first electron multiplier and the second electron multiplier are provided so as to extend in the first direction while being spaced apart from each other in the second direction. Both the first input electrode and the second input electrode face the ion introduction unit in the first direction. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the possibility that the first input electrode receive noise derived from charged particles generated in the second electron multiplier. Similarly, it is possible to reduce the possibility that the second input electrode receives noise derived from charged particles generated in the first electron multiplier. As a result, the detection accuracy of first ions and second ions can be improved.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The first input electrode may include a first body facing the ion introduction unit in the first direction, and a first extension portion extending toward the first output electrode in the first direction. The first extension portion may cover a part of the first multiplier facing the second multiplier. For example, a negative voltage is applied to the first input electrode, and a positive voltage is applied to the second input electrode. The voltage of the first multiplier increases from the first input electrode toward the first output electrode, and the voltage of the second multiplier increases from the second input electrode toward the second output electrode. Therefore, even if the absolute value of the voltage applied to the first input electrode is equal to the absolute value of the voltage applied to the second input electrode, the difference between the absolute value of the voltage of the first multiplier and the absolute value of the voltage of the second multiplier increases toward the output electrode. In the above configuration, since the first extension portion of the first input electrode covers the part of the first multiplier facing the second multiplier, it is possible to improve the symmetry between the positive potential gradient and the negative potential gradient in the region where ions move. Therefore, the detection accuracy of first ions and second ions can be improved.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The first extension portion may have a cylindrical shape. In this case, the end portion including the first end of the first multiplier is surrounded around the axis of the first extension portion by the first extension portion. Compared to a configuration in which a part of the end portion including the first end of the first multiplier is covered by the first extension portion, the symmetry between a positive potential gradient and a negative potential gradient can be improved in a region where ions move. Therefore, the detection accuracy of first ions and second ions can be further improved.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The second input electrode may include a second body facing the ion introduction unit in the first direction, and a second extension portion extending toward the second output electrode in the first direction. The second extension portion may cover a part of the second multiplier facing the first multiplier. Since the second extension portion of the second input electrode covers the part of the second multiplier that faces the first multiplier, it is possible to improve the symmetry between the positive potential gradient and the negative potential gradient in the region where ions move. Therefore, the detection accuracy of first ions and second ions can be improved.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The second extension portion may have a cylindrical shape. In this case, the end portion including the first end of the second multiplier is surrounded around the axis of the second extension portion by the second extension portion. Compared to a configuration in which a part of the end portion including the first end of the second multiplier is covered by the second extension portion, the symmetry between a positive potential gradient and a negative potential gradient can be improved in a region where ions move. Therefore, the detection accuracy of first ions and second ions can be further improved.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A distance between the first electron multiplier and the central axis in the second direction may be equal to a distance between the second electron multiplier and the central axis in the second direction. This makes it possible to simplify the design of the arrangement of the first electron multiplier and the second electron multiplier.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first ions may be positive ions. The second ions may be negative ions. A distance between the first electron multiplier and the central axis in the second direction may be larger than a distance between the second electron multiplier and the central axis in the second direction. As described above, when the symmetry between the positive potential gradient and the negative potential gradient in the region where the ions move is broken, the force that pulls first ions away from the second electron multiplier in the second direction becomes larger than the force that pulls second ions away from the first electron multiplier in the second direction. In other words, first ions move farther away from the central axis than second ions. According to the above configuration, since the first electron multiplier is farther away from the central axis than the second electron multiplier, it is possible to increase the possibility that first ions enter the first input electrode and second ions enter the second input electrode. Therefore, the detection accuracy of first ions and second ions can be improved.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The ion detector may further include a substrate including a main surface facing the ion introduction unit in the first direction. The first anode and the second anode may be provided on the main surface.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The first electron multiplier may be disposed on the main surface such that the first output electrode faces the first anode in the first direction. The second electron multiplier may be disposed on the main surface such that the second output electrode faces the second anode in the first direction. In this case, the first electron multiplier and the second electron multiplier are disposed on one substrate. Therefore, since the distance between the first electron multiplier and the second electron multiplier is constant, the assembly accuracy of the ion detector can be improved.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The switching circuit may be mounted on the substrate. In this case, the components of the ion detector can be mounted on one substrate. Therefore, the number of parts can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The substrate may be provided with a slit penetrating the substrate in the first direction between the first anode and the second anode. When the potential difference between the first anode and the second anode is large, a creeping discharge may occur along the main surface of the substrate between the first anode and the second anode. In the above configuration, since the slit is provided between the first anode and the second anode, the creeping distance between the first anode and the second anode becomes longer. This can reduce the possibility of a creeping discharge occurring between the first anode and the second anode.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The ion detector may further include a support member provided on the main surface and supporting the ion introduction unit. In this case, since the ion introduction unit is supported by the support member, the position of the central axis (through hole) is determined. This makes it possible to improve the assembly accuracy of the ion detector.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The ion detector may further include a first substrate including a first main surface facing the ion introduction unit in the first direction and a second substrate including a second main surface facing the ion introduction unit in the first direction. The first anode may be provided on the first main surface. The second anode may be provided on the second main surface. The first electron multiplier may be disposed on the first main surface such that the first output electrode faces the first anode in the first direction. The second electron multiplier may be disposed on the second main surface such that the second output electrode faces the second anode in the first direction. In this case, since the first anode and the second anode are disposed on different substrates, it is possible to reduce the possibility of a creeping discharge occurring between the first anode and the second anode.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the present disclosure, ions of both polarities can be detected while reducing the circuit scale.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a configuration diagram schematically showing an ion detector according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a mounting example of the ion detector shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plan view of the substrate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram showing equipotential lines at the time of positive ion detection of the ion detector shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram showing equipotential lines at the time of negative ion detection of the ion detector shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram showing equipotential lines at the time of positive ion detection of an ion detector according to another mounting example.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram showing equipotential lines at the time of negative ion detection of an ion detector according to another mounting example.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing yet another mounting example of the ion detector shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing yet another mounting example of the ion detector shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the following, some embodiments of the present disclosure will be described with reference to the drawings.

Positive ions move from the through hole <b>2</b><i>a </i>toward the input electrode <b>32</b>, and negative ions move from the through hole <b>2</b><i>a </i>toward the input electrode <b>42</b>. Therefore, the potential gradient in the space (ion transfer region) between the ion introduction unit <b>2</b> and the input electrodes <b>32</b> and <b>42</b> can affect the ion trajectory.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, when the input electrode <b>32</b> does not include the extension portion <b>32</b><i>b</i>, since the multiplier <b>31</b> is exposed, the voltage (potential) of the multiplier <b>31</b> affects the potential in the internal space S. Similarly, when the input electrode <b>42</b> does not include the extension portion <b>42</b><i>b</i>, since the multiplier <b>41</b> is exposed, the voltage (potential) of the multiplier <b>41</b> affects the potential in the internal space S. Although the absolute value of the voltage applied to the input electrode <b>32</b> is equal to the absolute value of the voltage applied to the input electrode <b>42</b>, the absolute value of the voltage of the multiplier <b>41</b> becomes larger than the absolute value of the voltage of the multiplier <b>31</b>. The difference between them becomes larger as a position approaches the output electrodes <b>33</b> and <b>43</b>. Therefore, since a positive voltage has a greater influence on the potential in the internal space S than a negative voltage, the symmetry between the positive potential gradient and the negative potential gradient is largely broken with respect to the virtual plane. As a result, a positive potential is also generated in the space <b>51</b> in the ion transfer region.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Therefore, at the time of positive ion detection, the repulsive component due to the positive potential is larger than the attracting component due to the negative potential, so that a force that pulls positive ions away from the electron multiplier <b>4</b> in the direction D<b>2</b> is applied to the positive ions. Similarly, at the time of negative ion detection, the attracting component due to the positive potential is larger than the repulsive component due to the negative potential, so that a force that pulls negative ions away from the electron multiplier <b>3</b> in the direction D<b>2</b> is applied to the negative ions. When the distance L<b>1</b> and the distance L<b>2</b> are set based on an ideal state in which the symmetry between the positive potential gradient and the negative potential gradient is high, the distance L<b>1</b> and the distance L<b>2</b> are equal to each other. In this case, in the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the possibility that positive ions reach the input electrode <b>32</b> is reduced, so that the detection accuracy of positive ions may be reduced.

Therefore, the influence of the voltage of the multiplier <b>31</b> on the potential in the internal space S is reduced, and the influence of the voltage applied to the input electrode <b>32</b> on the potential in the internal space S is increased. Similarly, when the input electrode <b>42</b> includes the extension portion <b>42</b><i>b</i>, the end portion including the end face <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the multiplier <b>41</b> is covered by the extension portion <b>42</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, the influence of the voltage of the multiplier <b>41</b> on the potential in the internal space S is reduced, and the influence of the voltage applied to the input electrode <b>42</b> on the potential in the internal space S is increased. As a result, as compared with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the symmetry between the positive potential gradient and the negative potential gradient is improved in the ion transfer region. Therefore, at the time of positive ion detection, the repulsive component and the attracting component can be balanced, and the possibility that positive ions reach the input electrode <b>32</b> is increased, so that the detection accuracy of positive ions can be improved. Similarly, at the time of negative ion detection, the repulsive component and the attracting component can be balanced, and the possibility that negative ions reach the input electrode <b>42</b> is increased, so that the detection accuracy of negative ions can be improved.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Since the extension portion <b>32</b><i>b </i>has a cylindrical shape, the end portion including the end face <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the multiplier <b>31</b> is surrounded around the axis of the extension portion <b>32</b><i>b </i>by the extension portion <b>32</b><i>b</i>.

Therefore, the symmetry between the positive potential gradient and the negative potential gradient is further improved in the ion transfer region compared with the configuration in which a part of the end portion including the end face <b>31</b><i>a </i>is covered by the extension portion <b>32</b><i>b </i>and a part of the end portion including the end face <b>41</b><i>a </i>is covered by the extension portion <b>42</b><i>b</i>.

Therefore, the possibility that the input electrode <b>32</b> receives noise derived from charged particles generated in the electron multiplier <b>4</b> can be reduced.
