representations for purposes of illustration. The Figures are provided for the purpose of illustrating one or more implementations with the explicit understanding that they will not be used to limit the scope or the meaning of the claims.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Following below are more detailed descriptions of various concepts related to, and implementations of, methods, apparatuses, and for treating exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine. The various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of a number of ways, as the described concepts are not limited to any particular manner of implementation. Examples of specific implementations and applications are provided primarily for illustrative purposes.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">I. Overview</heading><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Internal combustion engines (e.g., diesel internal combustion engines, etc.) produce exhaust gas that contains constituents, such as NO<sub>x</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and/or H<sub>2</sub>O. In some applications, an exhaust gas aftertreatment system is utilized to dose the exhaust gas with a reductant so as to reduce NO<sub>x </sub>emissions in the exhaust gas. These exhaust gas aftertreatment systems may include a decomposition chamber within which the reductant is provided and mixed with the exhaust gas.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Exhaust gas aftertreatment systems are defined by a space claim. The space claim is the amount of physical space that an exhaust gas aftertreatment system consumes when installed (e.g., on a vehicle, etc.) and the location (e.g., coordinates relative to a vehicle coordinate system, etc.) of the physical space that is consumed by the exhaust gas aftertreatment system when installed. In some applications, the physical space available for use by an exhaust gas aftertreatment system is limited due to the locations of surrounding components, wiring or piping requirements, or other similar constraints. As such, it is often desirable to minimize the space claim of an exhaust gas aftertreatment system as much as possible so that the exhaust gas aftertreatment system can be utilized in as large a number of applications as possible. The decomposition chamber within which the reductant is provided and mixed with the exhaust gas constitutes a significant portion of the space claim.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Implementations described herein are related to an exhaust gas aftertreatment system which includes a reductant delivery system that includes an inlet body for receiving exhaust gas from upstream components and providing exhaust gas with reductant, an outlet body for providing exhaust gas to downstream components, and two transfer tubes for conveying exhaust gas from the inlet body to the outlet body. The inlet body may include a dividing plate, a diverter, and an inner shell for variously directing and splitting the exhaust gas received from the upstream components and variously enhancing swirl of the exhaust gas and reductant. The transfer tubes may be nested such that one transfer tube extends within the other, thereby causing the exhaust gas flowing between the transfer tubes to heat the inner transfer tube. The reductant delivery system described herein is capable of being used across multiple different applications (e.g., different internal combustion engines, different exhaust gas aftertreatment systems, etc.) and is easily scalable.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The transfer tubes are coupled to the inlet body and outlet body at an angle (e.g., along a tangent of the outlet body, etc.). As a result, the length of the transfer tubes may be increased without substantially increasing the distance between the inlet body and outlet body. As a result, a mixing length of the exhaust gas, and therefore a uniformity index (UI) of the reductant in the exhaust gas can be increased without substantially increasing the space claim of the reductant delivery system.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">II. Example Exhaust Gas Aftertreatment System</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an exhaust gas aftertreatment system <b>100</b> having an example reductant delivery system <b>102</b> for an exhaust gas conduit system <b>104</b>. The exhaust gas aftertreatment system <b>100</b> also includes a particulate filter (e.g., a diesel particulate filter (DPF)) <b>106</b> and a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst member <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The particulate filter <b>106</b> is configured to remove particulate matter, such as soot, from exhaust gas flowing in the exhaust gas conduit system <b>104</b>. The particulate filter <b>106</b> includes an inlet, where the exhaust gas is received, and an outlet, where the exhaust gas exits after having particulate matter substantially filtered from the exhaust gas and/or converting the particulate matter into carbon dioxide. In some implementations, the particulate filter <b>106</b> may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The reductant delivery system <b>102</b> includes a decomposition chamber <b>110</b> (e.g., decomposition reactor, reactor pipe, decomposition tube, reactor tube, etc.). The decomposition chamber <b>110</b> is configured to convert a reductant into ammonia. The reductant may be, for example, urea, diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), Adblue&#xae;, a urea water solution (UWS), an aqueous urea solution (e.g., AUS32, etc.), and other similar fluids. The decomposition chamber <b>110</b> includes an inlet fluidly coupled to (e.g., fluidly configured to communicate with, etc.) the particulate filter <b>106</b> to receive the exhaust gas containing NO<sub>x </sub>emissions and an outlet for the exhaust gas, NO<sub>x </sub>emissions, ammonia, and/or reductant to flow to the SCR catalyst member <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The reductant delivery system <b>102</b> also includes a dosing module <b>112</b> (e.g., doser, etc.) configured to dose the reductant into the decomposition chamber <b>110</b>. The dosing module <b>112</b> may include an insulator interposed between a portion of the dosing module <b>112</b> and the portion of the decomposition chamber <b>110</b> on which the dosing module <b>112</b> is mounted.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The dosing module <b>112</b> is fluidly coupled to a reductant source <b>114</b>. The reductant source <b>114</b> may include multiple reductant sources <b>114</b>. The reductant source <b>114</b> may be, for example, a diesel exhaust fluid tank containing Adblue&#xae;. A reductant pump <b>116</b> (e.g., supply unit, etc.) is used to pressurize the reductant from the reductant source <b>114</b> for delivery to the dosing module <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, the reductant pump <b>116</b> is pressure controlled (e.g., controlled to obtain a target pressure, etc.). The reductant pump <b>116</b> includes a reductant filter <b>118</b>. The reductant filter <b>118</b> filters (e.g., strains, etc.) the reductant prior to the reductant being provided to internal components (e.g., pistons, vanes, etc.) of the reductant pump <b>116</b>. For example, the reductant filter <b>118</b> may inhibit or prevent the transmission of solids (e.g., solidified reductant, contaminants, etc.) to the internal components of the reductant pump <b>116</b>. In this way, the reductant filter <b>118</b> may facilitate prolonged desirable operation of the reductant pump <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the reductant pump <b>116</b> is coupled to (e.g., attached to, fixed to, welded to, integrated with, etc.) a chassis of a vehicle associated with the exhaust gas aftertreatment system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The dosing module <b>112</b> includes at least one injector <b>120</b>. Each injector <b>120</b> is configured to dose the reductant into the exhaust gas (e.g., within the decomposition chamber <b>110</b>, etc.). In some embodiments, the reductant delivery system <b>102</b> also includes an air pump <b>122</b>. In these embodiments, the air pump <b>122</b> draws air from an air source <b>124</b> (e.g., air intake, etc.) and through an air filter <b>126</b> disposed upstream of the air pump <b>122</b>. Additionally, the air pump <b>122</b> provides the air to the dosing module <b>112</b> via a conduit. In these embodiments, the dosing module <b>112</b> is configured to mix the air and the reductant into an air-reductant mixture and to provide the air-reductant mixture into the decomposition chamber <b>110</b>. In other embodiments, the reductant delivery system <b>102</b> does not include the air pump <b>122</b> or the air source <b>124</b>. In such embodiments, the dosing module <b>112</b> is not configured to mix the reductant with air.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The dosing module <b>112</b> and the reductant pump <b>116</b> are also electrically or communicatively coupled to a reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b>. The reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b> is configured to control the dosing module <b>112</b> to dose the reductant into the decomposition chamber <b>110</b>. The reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b> may also be configured to control the reductant pump <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b> includes a processing circuit <b>130</b>. The processing circuit <b>130</b> includes a processor <b>132</b> and a memory <b>134</b>. The processor <b>132</b> may include a microprocessor, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), etc., or combinations thereof. The memory <b>134</b> may include, but is not limited to, electronic, optical, magnetic, or any other storage or transmission device capable of providing a processor, ASIC, FPGA, etc. with program instructions. This memory <b>134</b> may include a memory chip, Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM), flash memory, or any other suitable memory from which the reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b> can read instructions. The instructions may include code from any suitable programming language. The memory <b>134</b> may include various modules that include instructions which are configured to be implemented by the processor <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In various embodiments, the reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b> is configured to communicate with a central controller <b>136</b> (e.g., engine control unit (ECU), engine control module (ECM), etc.) of an internal combustion engine having the exhaust gas aftertreatment system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the central controller <b>136</b> and the reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b> are integrated into a single controller.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, the central controller <b>136</b> is communicable with a display device (e.g., screen, monitor, touch screen, heads up display (HUD), indicator light, etc.). The display device may be configured to change state in response to receiving information from the central controller <b>136</b>. For example, the display device may be configured to change between a static state (e.g., displaying a green light, displaying a &#x201c;SYSTEM OK&#x201d; message, etc.) and an alarm state (e.g., displaying a blinking red light, displaying a &#x201c;SERVICE NEEDED&#x201d; message, etc.) based on a communication from the central controller <b>136</b>. By changing state, the display device may provide an indication to a user (e.g., operator, etc.) of a status (e.g., operation, in need of service, etc.) of the reductant delivery system <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The decomposition chamber <b>110</b> is located upstream of the SCR catalyst member <b>108</b>. As a result, the reductant is injected by the injector <b>120</b> upstream of the SCR catalyst member <b>108</b> such that the SCR catalyst member <b>108</b> receives a mixture of the reductant and exhaust gas. The reductant droplets undergo the processes of evaporation, thermolysis, and hydrolysis to form non-NO<sub>x </sub>emissions (e.g., gaseous ammonia, etc.) within the decomposition chamber <b>110</b>, the SCR catalyst member <b>108</b>, and/or the exhaust gas conduit system <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The SCR catalyst member <b>108</b> is configured to assist in the reduction of NO<sub>x </sub>emissions by accelerating a NO<sub>x </sub>reduction process between the reductant and the NO<sub>x </sub>of the exhaust gas into diatomic nitrogen, water, and/or carbon dioxide. The SCR catalyst member <b>108</b> includes an inlet fluidly coupled to the decomposition chamber <b>110</b> from which exhaust gas and reductant are received and an outlet fluidly coupled to an end of the exhaust gas conduit system <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The reductant delivery system <b>102</b> also includes an upstream temperature sensor <b>138</b> (e.g., thermocouple, etc.).

The upstream temperature sensor <b>138</b> is electrically or communicatively coupled to the reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b> and configured to provide an upstream temperature of the exhaust gas to the reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The reductant delivery system <b>102</b> also includes a pressure sensor <b>140</b> (e.g., pressure differential sensor, capacitive pressure sensor, etc.). The pressure sensor <b>140</b> is configured to determine a pressure of the exhaust gas (e.g., within the decomposition chamber <b>110</b>, within the exhaust gas conduit system <b>104</b>, etc.). The pressure sensor <b>140</b> is electrically or communicatively coupled to the reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b> and configured to provide a pressure of the exhaust gas to the reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The reductant delivery system <b>102</b> also includes a downstream temperature sensor <b>142</b> (e.g., thermocouple, etc.).

In these ways, the reductant delivery system <b>200</b> can be more desirable than other systems which do not include similar mechanisms for enhancing mixing and decomposition of reductant into the exhaust gas and mitigating impingement of reductant (e.g., due to additional cleaning of reductant deposits in these systems, etc.).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0111">A first portion of the exhaust gas flows between the inlet body outer mounting shell inner surface <b>230</b> and the inlet body inner shell <b>226</b> (e.g., between the inlet body outer mounting shell inner surface <b>230</b> and the inlet body inner shell first flange <b>228</b>, between the inlet body outer mounting shell inner surface <b>230</b> and the inlet body inner shell second flange <b>232</b>, etc.) and subsequently along the inlet body outer mounting shell projecting surface <b>276</b>. Prior to flowing along the inlet body outer mounting shell projecting surface <b>276</b>, some of the first portion of the exhaust gas flows against the inlet body outer mounting shell dividing surface <b>274</b> and/or the dividing plate <b>238</b> (e.g., the dividing plate panel <b>254</b>, etc.). The first portion of the exhaust gas then flows between the dividing plate <b>238</b>, the inlet body inner shell <b>226</b>, and the diverter <b>260</b> and into the inner transfer tube curved portion <b>314</b> via the inlet body inner shell outlet <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0112">Prior to flowing into the inner transfer tube curved portion <b>314</b>, an injection assist portion of the first portion of the exhaust gas flows into the shroud assembly <b>290</b> via the shroud inlet <b>296</b> (e.g., between the shroud plate <b>294</b>, the shroud flange <b>292</b>, and the inlet body outer mounting shell projecting surface <b>276</b>, etc.). The injection assist portion flows between the inlet body inner shell first flange <b>228</b>, the inlet body inner shell second flange <b>232</b>, the inlet body outer mounting shell inner surface <b>230</b>, and the inlet body outer transfer shell inner surface <b>236</b> is directed into the shroud inlet <b>296</b> by the shroud guide <b>295</b>. The injection assist portion of the exhaust gas flows around the injection aperture <b>286</b> and is provided with reductant via the injection aperture <b>286</b> (e.g., from the injector <b>120</b> and/or the dosing module <b>112</b>). The exhaust gas then exits the shroud assembly <b>290</b> via the shroud outlet <b>297</b>. The injection assist portion of the exhaust gas aides in propelling the reductant out of the injection aperture <b>286</b> and towards the inner transfer tube curved portion <b>314</b>. Specifically, the shroud assembly <b>290</b> protects (e.g., shields, etc.) the flow of the exhaust gas and reductant towards the inner transfer tube curved portion <b>314</b> from the flow of the exhaust gas towards the inlet body inner shell endcap <b>258</b>, thereby enabling additional reductant to be provided to the inner transfer tube curved portion <b>314</b> (e.g., rather than being propelled against the inlet body inner shell endcap <b>258</b>, etc.).

As a result, the exhaust gas flowing through the at least one diverter end aperture <b>272</b> may be directed towards the inlet body inner shell outlet <b>300</b> (e.g., as opposed to being directed towards the inlet body inner shell wall <b>234</b>, etc.). This exhaust gas may assist in propelling exhaust gas within the inlet body inner shell <b>226</b> toward the inner transfer tube curved portion <b>314</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0115">A second portion of the exhaust gas, different from the exhaust gas that flows along the inlet body outer mounting shell projecting surface <b>276</b>, flows through the dividing plate panel slot <b>256</b>.

The exhaust gas exiting the dividing plate panel slot <b>256</b> is propelled into the inner transfer tube curved portion <b>314</b>. The dividing plate panel slot <b>256</b> functions to reduce a backpressure of the reductant delivery system <b>200</b>, thereby making the reductant delivery system <b>200</b> more desirable.

The exhaust gas flows along the inlet body inner shell <b>226</b>, thereby heating the inlet body inner shell <b>226</b> and mitigating impingement of reductant on the inlet body inner shell <b>226</b>. The exhaust gas flows around the inner transfer tube curved portion <b>314</b> and is propelled into the outer transfer tube curved portion <b>306</b>. This third portion of the exhaust gas may not be provided with reductant and may be relatively hot compared to the exhaust gas flowing within the inner transfer tube curved portion <b>314</b> (e.g., because the exhaust gas flowing within the inner transfer tube curved portion <b>314</b> has been provided with reductant) and the inner transfer tube straight portion <b>312</b> (e.g., because the exhaust gas flowing within the inner transfer tube straight portion <b>312</b> has been provided with reductant).</p><p id="p-0121" num="0117">The exhaust gas flowing within the inner transfer tube curved portion <b>314</b> flows to the inner transfer tube straight portion <b>312</b> and the exhaust gas flowing within the outer transfer tube curved portion <b>306</b> flows to the outer transfer tube straight portion <b>304</b>.

Similarly, the exhaust gas flowing within the outer transfer tube straight portion <b>304</b> heats the inner transfer tube curved portion <b>314</b> and/or the inner transfer tube straight portion <b>312</b>, thereby mitigating impingement of reductant on the inner transfer tube curved portion <b>314</b> and/or the inner transfer tube straight portion <b>312</b>. The inner transfer tube curved portion <b>314</b> prohibits exhaust gas from passing through the inner transfer tube curved portion <b>314</b> to the outer transfer tube curved portion <b>306</b> and/or the outer transfer tube straight portion <b>304</b>.

The exhaust gas flowing within the outlet body shell <b>318</b> may flow along the outlet body shell inner surface <b>324</b> so as to cause the exhaust gas to swirl.
