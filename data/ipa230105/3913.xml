id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A multi-purpose detection circuit for object detection and vehicle position determination is described. For example, the circuit is configurable for detecting foreign metallic objects, living objects, and a vehicle or type of vehicle above an inductive wireless power transmitter. The circuit is also configurable for determining the vehicle's position relative to the inductive wireless power transmitter. An example apparatus includes a measurement circuit including a multiplexer, electrically connected to a plurality of inductive and capacitive sense circuits, for measuring one or more electrical characteristics in each of the inductive and capacitive sense circuits according to a predetermined time multiplexing scheme. The apparatus further includes a control and evaluation circuit for evaluating the measured electrical characteristics and determining at least one of a presence of a metallic object, a living object, a vehicle, or a type of vehicle, and a vehicle position based on changes in the measured electrical characteristics.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img

In particular, the present disclosure is directed to a multi-purpose detection circuit configurable for detecting foreign metallic objects, living objects located near an inductive wireless power transmitter as well as for detecting a vehicle above the wireless power transmitter and for determining a position of the vehicle relative to the inductive wireless power transmitter.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Inductive wireless power transfer (WPT) systems provide one example of wireless transfer of energy. In an inductive WPT system, a primary power device (or wireless power transmitter) transmits power wirelessly to a secondary power device (or wireless power receiver). Each of the wireless power transmitter and wireless power receiver includes an inductive power transfer structure, typically a single or multi-coil arrangement of windings comprising electric current conveying materials (e.g., copper Litz wire). An alternating current passing through the coil e.g., of a primary wireless power transfer structure produces an alternating magnetic field. When a secondary wireless power transfer structure is placed in proximity to the primary wireless power transfer structure, the alternating magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) into the secondary wireless power transfer structure according to Faraday's law, thereby wirelessly transferring power to the wireless power receiver if a resistive load is connected to the wireless power receiver. To improve a power transfer efficiency, some implementations use a wireless power transfer structure that is part of a resonant structure (resonator). The resonant structure may comprise a capacitively loaded inductor forming a resonance substantially at a fundamental operating frequency of the inductive WPT system (e.g., in the range from 80 kHz to 90 kHz).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Inductive wireless power transfer to electrically chargeable vehicles at power levels of several kilowatts in both domestic and public parking zones may require special protective measures for safety of persons and equipment. Such measures may include detection of foreign objects in an inductive power region of the inductive WPT system where electromagnetic field exposure levels exceed certain limits. This may be particularly true for systems where the inductive power region is open and accessible. Such measures may include detection of electrically conducting (metallic) objects and living objects, (e.g., humans, extremities of humans, or animals) that may be present within or near the inductive power region.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In certain applications for inductive wireless charging of electric vehicles, it may be useful to be able to detect foreign objects that may be present in the inductive power region and that could be susceptible to induction heating due to the high magnetic field strength in that region. In an inductive wireless power transfer system for electric vehicle charging operating at a fundamental frequency in the range from 80 kHz to 90 kHz, magnetic flux densities in the inductive power region (e.g., above a primary wireless power transfer structure) can reach relatively high levels (e.g., above 2 mT) to allow for sufficient power transfer (e.g., 3.3 kW, 7 kW, 11 kW, and the like). Therefore, metallic objects or other objects present in the magnetic field can experience undesirable induction heating. For this reason, foreign object detection (FOD) may be implemented to detect metallic objects or other objects that are affected by the magnetic field generated by the primary and/or the secondary wireless power transfer structure of the inductive WPT system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In certain applications for inductive wireless charging of electric vehicles, it may also be useful to be able to detect living objects that may be present within or near an inductive power region where the level of electromagnetic field exposure exceeds certain limits (e.g., as defined by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) recommendation). For this reason, living object detection (LOD) may be implemented to detect living objects (e.g., human extremities, animals), or other objects that may be exposed to the magnetic field generated by the primary and/or the secondary wireless power transfer structure of the inductive WPT system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In further applications for inductive wireless charging of electric vehicles, it may also be useful to be able to detect a vehicle or the type of vehicle that may be present above the wireless power transmitter (e.g., above the primary wireless power transfer structure). For this reason, vehicle detection (VD) may be implemented. In yet another application for inductive wireless charging of electric vehicles, it may also be useful to be able to transmit data (e.g., a vehicle identifier or the like) from the vehicle-based secondary device to the ground-based primary device. For this reason, vehicle detection (VD) may be extended for receiving low rate signaling from the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Efficiency of an inductive WPT system for electric vehicle charging depends at least in part on achieving sufficient alignment between the ground-based primary wireless power transfer structure and the secondary wireless power transfer structure. Therefore, in certain applications for inductive wireless charging of electric vehicles, it may be useful to be able to determine a position of the vehicle relative to the wireless power transmitter for purposes of guidance and alignment. More specifically, it may be useful to be able to determine a position of the vehicle-based wireless power transfer structure (e.g., the secondary wireless power transfer structure) relative to the ground-based wireless power transfer structure (e.g., the primary wireless power transfer structure). For this reason, position determination (PD) may be implemented.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an aspect of hardware complexity reduction and cost saving, it may be useful and desirable to provide FOD, LOD, VD, and PD by a common multi-purpose detection circuit.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one aspect of the disclosure, an apparatus for determining at least one of a presence of a metallic object, living object, vehicle, type of vehicle, and a vehicle position is provided.

appended drawings is intended as a description of example implementations and is not intended to represent the only implementations in which the techniques described herein may be practiced. The term &#x201c;example&#x201d; used throughout this description means &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration,&#x201d; and should not necessarily be construed as preferred or advantageous over other example implementations. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the example implementations. In some instances, some devices are shown in block diagram form. Drawing elements that are common among the following figures may be identified using the same reference numerals.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As mentioned above foreign object detection (FOD) (and particularly metal object detection) may be valuable for a variety of applications. For detection in a predetermined region, a FOD system may include a plurality of inductive sense circuits each including an inductive sense element (e.g., a sense coil) distributed across a predetermined area (e.g., a planar array of sense coils integrated into the ground-based wireless power transfer structure). The predetermined region may be defined by the space where metal objects may be found and where the magnetic flux density exceeds certain limits (e.g., a threshold determined based on what levels of temperature a metal object might be heated up). This is generally a three-dimensional space above the plurality of indictive sense elements. The number of the inductive sense elements may be proportional or related to the minimum size of objects that are desirable to be detected. For a system that is configured to detect small objects (e.g., a paper clip), the number of sense elements may be relatively high (e.g., in the order of 100). An example FOD system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,627,257, titled Systems, Methods, and Apparatus for Detection of Metal Objects in a Predetermined Space, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As mentioned above living object detection (LOD) (e.g., human extremities, animals) may be valuable for a variety of applications. For detection in a predetermined region, a LOD system may include a plurality of capacitive sense circuits each including a capacitive sense element (e.g., a sense electrode) e.g., disposed along the periphery of a ground-based wireless power transfer structure of a WPT system. The predetermined region may be defined by the space accessible for living objects and where living objects may be located and where the exposure magnetic field strength exceeds certain limits (e.g., as recommended by ICNIRP). This is generally a three-dimensional space. The number of the capacitive sense elements may be proportional or related to the minimum size of living objects that are desirable to be detected. For a system that is configured to detect human extremities (e., a hand) and animals (e.g., a cat), the number of sense elements may be relatively low (e.g., in the order of 4). A measurement drive circuitry for applying drive signals to each of the plurality of capacitive sense circuits each including a capacitive sense element and additional elements for conditioning, as well as corresponding measurement circuitry as needed for measuring an electrical characteristic in each of the plurality of capacitive sense circuits and for looking for changes in the electrical characteristics that may correspond to the presence of a living object. An example LOD system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,952,266, titled Object Detection for Wireless Energy Transfer Systems, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As mentioned above vehicle detection (VD) or detection of the type of vehicle above the ground-based wireless power transfer structure of a WPT system may be valuable for a variety of applications. For detection of a vehicle or the type of vehicle, a VD system may include a plurality of inductive sense circuits each including an inductive sense element (e.g., a sense coil) distributed across an area defined by the ground-based wireless power transfer structure (e.g., a planar array of sense coils) and a plurality of capacitive sense circuits each including a capacitive sense element (e.g., a sense electrode) disposed in an area defined by the ground-based wireless power transfer structure. Drive circuitry for applying drive signals to each of the inductive and capacitive sense circuits, each including an inductive and capacitive sense element, respectively and additional elements for conditioning, as well as corresponding measurement circuitry as needed for measuring an electrical characteristic in each of the plurality of capacitive sense circuits and for looking for changes in the electrical characteristics that may correspond to the presence of a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As mentioned above determination of a position (PD) of a vehicle (e.g., the position of the vehicle-based wireless power transfer structure relative to the ground-based wireless power transfer structure of a WPT system) may be valuable for a variety of applications. For determination of a vehicle position, a PD system may include a plurality of inductive sense circuits each including an inductive sense element (e.g., a sense coil) distributed across an area defined by the ground-based wireless power transfer structure (e.g., a planar array of sense coils) and a plurality of capacitive sense circuits each including a capacitive sense element (e.g., a sense electrode) disposed in an area defined by the ground-based wireless power transfer structure.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some implementations, the PD system is configured to support a passive beacon PD technique. Passive beacon PD uses at least one passive beacon transponder that may be integrated into the vehicle-based wireless power transfer structure or that may be mounted elsewhere at the vehicle underbody. When positioned above the inductive and capacitive sense element array of the multi-purpose detection circuit, the passive beacon transponder produces a distinct time-varying change (a modulated response) in the electrical characteristic of at least one of the plurality of inductive sense circuits and capacitive sense circuits. This modulated response may be used for determining a position of the at least one passive beacon transponder relative to the array of sense elements, which is related to the position of the vehicle-based wireless power transfer structure relative to the ground-based wireless power transfer structure. The at least one passive beacon transponder may also be used for determining presence of a vehicle (VD) or the type of vehicle e.g., by means of a modulation that is characteristic for the type of vehicle. Further, the at least one passive beacon transponder may be used to transmit data (e.g., at a low data rate) to the primary device by means of the passive modulation technique.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some implementations, the at least one passive beacon transponder includes an inductive passive beacon transponder configured to mainly interact with the inductive sense circuits. In other implementations, the at least one passive beacon transponder includes a capacitive passive beacon transponder configured to mainly interact with the capacitive sense circuits. In further implementations, the at least one passive beacon transponder is configured to interact with both the inductive and capacitive sense circuits. An example inductive passive beacon PD system is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/052,445, titled Hybrid Foreign Object Detection and Positioning System, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Circuitry for applying drive signals to each of the plurality of inductive and/or capacitive sense circuits each including a sense element and additional elements for conditioning, as well as corresponding measurement, control and evaluation circuitry as needed for measuring an electrical characteristic in each of the plurality of inductive sense circuits and detecting changes in the electrical characteristics that may be indicative of one of the presence of a metal object, a living object, a vehicle, the type of vehicle, and a vehicle position may be complex and costly as the number of sense elements increases. Therefore, in an aspect of hardware complexity reduction and cost saving, it may be useful and desirable to combine the various functions such as FOD, LOD, VD, data signaling, and PD in a single system referred to herein as the multi-purpose detection circuit.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">An electric vehicle is used herein to describe a remote system, an example of which is a vehicle that includes, as part of its locomotion capabilities, electrical power derived from a chargeable energy storage device (e.g., one or more rechargeable electrochemical cells or other type of battery). As non-limiting examples, some electric vehicles may be hybrid electric vehicles that include, besides electric motors, a traditional combustion engine for direct locomotion or to charge the vehicle's battery. Other electric vehicles may draw all locomotion ability from electrical power. An electric vehicle is not limited to an automobile and may include motorcycles, carts, scooters, and the like.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">A foreign object is used herein to describe an object that does not naturally belong to the WPT system. A foreign object may include a metallic object, a non-living dielectric (substantially nonconductive) object, a living object (e.g., an animal, a human extremity), a vehicle, or a combination thereof. It may describe an object that needs to be detected for purposes of safety of equipment or persons, but it may also refer to an object of no harm that is potential to produce a false positive detection in a multi-purpose detection system.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example implementation of a multi-purpose detection circuit <b>100</b> that includes a plurality of inductive sense circuits <b>106</b> and a plurality of capacitive sense circuits <b>108</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> by inductive sense circuits <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b</i>, some dots, and <b>106</b><i>n </i>and by capacitive sense circuits <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b</i>, some dots, and <b>108</b><i>n</i>.

This detection scheme may be also referred to as space-differential detection. In some implementations or operations based on a space-differential detection scheme, presence of an object (e.g., object <b>110</b>) is assumed if at least one difference between a first measurement output associated to at least one first sense circuit (e.g., sense circuit <b>106</b><i>a</i>) and a second measurement output associated to at least one second sense circuit (e.g., sense circuit <b>106</b><i>b</i>) exceeds a threshold. In some implementations or operations of a true space-differential detection scheme, the plurality of measurement outputs used to determine a difference refer to substantially the same time.

Such environmental effects may include movements of the metallic vehicle underbody structure when a vehicle is parked over the wireless power transfer structure. These movements may cause false detections in certain implementations of the multi-purpose detection circuit <b>100</b> that is solely based on a time-differential approach. Therefore, in some aspects, it may be desirable to mitigate such disturbance effects.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Combining the time-differential scheme with a space-differential scheme on top may be an approach to effectively discriminate such disturbance effects. In certain implementations or operations of a space-differential detection scheme, presence of an object is determined by evaluating at least one difference between a measurement output associated to at least one sense circuit (e.g., sense circuit <b>106</b><i>a</i>) and a reference value that is determined based on a plurality of measurement outputs each associated to a different sense circuit of the plurality of sense circuits (e.g., <b>106</b>). This reference value may be e.g., a mean value, a median value (50th percentile), or any other percentile value that is derived from a histogram built upon the plurality of measurement outputs. It may be appreciated that this special detection scheme has the potential to discriminate environmental effects e.g., from a moving vehicle underbody that may produce changes in an electrical characteristic (e.g., an impedance) in a majority (cluster) of sense circuits. This special scheme may be considered as a mechanism that automatically adapts the detection threshold used by the control and evaluation circuit <b>102</b> for determining presence of an object (e.g., object <b>110</b>). More specifically, in some implementations or operations, the control and evaluation circuit <b>102</b> automatically adjusts the reference value as described above. When the vehicle underbody is moving, the reference value may increase as well as the detection threshold. Increasing the detection threshold reduces the false detection rate but also the detection sensitivity (detection probability) to some extent. Therefore, a somewhat lower sensitivity may be accepted for an object entering the predetermined space while the vehicle is moving. As soon as the vehicle underbody comes to rest, the detection threshold is readjusted automatically, and the object detection circuit <b>100</b> may return to its ordinary sensitivity (detection probability) maintaining a specified false detection rate.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example implementation of a wireless power transfer structure <b>200</b> that is a portion of a WPT system including a portion of the multi-purpose detection circuit <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

Further, the results in TABLE 2 show circuits and configurations equivalent in terms of the differential narrowband extrinsic SNR (WPT switching noise). Moreover, the numbers for the differential narrowband intrinsic SNR (sense signal noise) show the parallel resonant configuration of the circuit <b>500</b> slightly inferior to the other circuits and configurations. The high numbers obtained for the differential narrowband intrinsic SNR (thermal noise) show that thermal noise is negligible, even when WPT is inactive. The numbers resulting for the broadband extrinsic SNR (WPT fundamental disturbance) show a substantial difference (&#x3e;60 dB) between the parallel resonant configuration of the circuit <b>500</b> and <b>540</b>. The series resonant configuration of the circuit <b>500</b> and <b>540</b> are almost equivalent and the SNRs are slightly above 6 dB, which may be a minimum requirement in a practical implementation.

Due to an uneven (e.g., slightly cambered) surface and the limited water storage capacity on the surface of the housing <b>328</b>, a water bubble is generally moving with a trend towards an edge of the surface of the housing <b>328</b> where it eventually flows down the ramp of the housing <b>328</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) towards ground as part of a natural draining process. A water object (e.g., a water bubble, object <b>112</b>) moving (flowing) on the surface of the housing <b>328</b> into the proximity of a sense coil <b>502</b> may first cause an output of the time-differential detector in the angle range <b>610</b>. However, when leaving the proximity of a sense coil <b>502</b>, it may cause a complex output in the angle range <b>602</b> (due to the angle error) potentially triggering a false positive detection of a metal object (e.g., metal object <b>110</b><i>a</i>).</p><p id="p-0649" num="0326">Because the magnitude of the complex output &#x394;Z/&#x394;t of the time-differential detector increases with the speed of movement (first time derivative) of the water object, the probability of a false positive detection of a metal object (e.g., metal object <b>110</b><i>a</i>) increases with the speed of the water flow.</p><p id="p-0650" num="0327">In another aspect, experiments with drain water flows on the surface of a wireless power transfer structure have shown that the impedance &#x394;Z<sub><u style="single">r</u> </sub>as reflected by the water object depends on its shape but also on its ion concentration (e.g., salinity). More specifically, these experiments with water of any non-zero ion concentration (excluding pure distilled water) have shown the angle arg{&#x394;Z<sub><u style="single">r</u></sub>} changing with the shape of the water object.

The high impedance magnitude |Z<sub>11,0</sub>| as generally presented by the parallel resonant configuration of the circuit <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> can be substantially decreased without loss in fractional change by configuring the sense circuit <b>701</b> with an inductance ratio n<sub>L</sub>&#x3e;1 (e.g., n<sub>L</sub>=2). Conversely, the low impedance magnitude |Z<sub>11,0</sub>| as generally presented by the series resonant configuration of the circuit <b>740</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>E</figref> can be increased at the expense of a moderate loss in fractional change by configuring the sense circuit <b>741</b> with a capacitance ratio n<sub>C</sub>&#x3e;1 (e.g., n<sub>C</sub>=2.5). Further, the results in TABLE 4 show the circuits and configurations equivalent in terms of the differential narrowband extrinsic SNR (&#x394;SNR<sub>ex</sub>) e.g., with respect to WPT switching noise. Moreover, the numbers for the differential narrowband intrinsic SNR with respect to thermal (resistance) noise show the circuits and configurations equivalent. They also indicate that thermal noise may have a negligible impact on the overall noise, even when WPT is inactive. The numbers resulting for the broadband extrinsic SNR with respect to the WPT fundamental disturbance voltage (V<sub>sW</sub>) show a substantial difference (&#x3e;60 dB) between the series resonant configuration of the circuit <b>700</b> and <b>740</b>. The parallel resonant configuration of the circuit <b>700</b> and <b>740</b> are almost equivalent and the broadband extrinsic SNRs of the circuits and configurations are above 6 dB, which may be a minimum requirement in a practical implementation. TABLE 4 further shows a negligible angle error |&#x3b5;| for the series resonant configuration of the circuit <b>700</b> and the parallel resonant configuration of the circuit <b>740</b> and an angle error of about 2&#xb0; for each of the other configurations.

The capacitance C<sub>ob</sub>-C<sub>M </sub>together with conductance G<sub>ob </sub>represents an abstract model of the object (e.g., object <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, or vehicle <b>330</b>) indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> by a dashed box.

Likewise, the capacitance C<sub>ob </sub>refers to the equivalent capacitance of the object in presence of the sense electrode <b>702</b> shortened to ground at its signal terminal <b>703</b> (primary-side short circuit). The mutual capacitance C<sub>M </sub>stands for the capacitive coupling between the sense electrode <b>702</b> and the object. Both capacitances C<sub>ob </sub>and C<sub>M </sub>may relate to the object's size, geometry, position, and orientation relative to the sense electrode <b>702</b> and ground, but also to electrical properties of the materials the object is composed of. It may be appreciated that the equivalent circuit model also applies to any other capacitive sense element such as e.g., <b>732</b>, <b>762</b>, and <b>772</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>F to <b>7</b>I</figref>.</p><p id="p-1166" num="0567">It is assumed that any real heterogenous object (e.g., object <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, or <b>114</b>) composed of different materials may be substituted by an artificial homogenous object consisting of an equivalent material having a complex relative permittivity defined as:</p><p id="p-1167" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3b5;<sub>r</sub>=&#x3b5;&#x2032;<sub>r</sub><i>&#x2212;j &#x3b5;&#x2033;</i><sub>r </sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(335)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-1168" num="0000">where &#x3b5;&#x2032;<sub>r </sub>refers to the relative real permittivity and &#x3b5;&#x2033;<sub>r </sub>to the relative imaginary permittivity related to the electrical losses of the material.

The polarizability a generally depends on the size, geometry, position, and orientation of the object relative to the sense electrode <b>702</b> and the ground. For objects made of an ordinary dielectric material, the polarizability must be in a range 1&#x2264;a&#x3c;&#x221e;. The coefficient &#x3c7;=&#x3b5;<sub>r</sub>&#x2212;1 is known as the electric susceptibility of the dielectric material.

This polarization field counteracts the applied field in the object's material until an equilibrium state is reached. This mechanism is also known as depolarization. Depolarization is commonly quantified by the depolarization factor in analogy to the magnetic depolarization in ferromagnetic bodies. The depolarization factor may be defined as the reciprocal 1/a of the polarization factor. For small a (e.g., 1&#x2264;a&#x3c;&#x3c;|&#x3b5;<sub>r</sub>|), the internal electric field (in the material) may be substantially reduced (e.g., virtually canceled out) by the polarization field. In contrast, a dielectric object with high a (e.g., a&#x3e;&#x3e;|&#x3b5;<sub>r</sub>|) experiences little depolarization, resulting in an internal field substantially equal to the applied field.</p><p id="p-1179" num="0570">Polarizability of a thin dielectric sheet may be close to one (a&#x2192;1) with respect to an electric field perpendicular to the sheet. For an oblate dielectric sphere subjected to a uniform electric field parallel to its short (minor) axis, the polarizability can be found in the range 1&#x3c;a&#x3c;3. The polarizability a is higher in any other axis and is thus anisotropic. The polarizability of a dielectric sphere is isotropic and a=3. For a dielectric ellipsoid, polarizability is again anisotropic and highest in its major axis (a&#x3e;3). Therefore, the major axis is sometimes also referred to as the &#x201c;easy&#x201d; axis. For an infinitely thin dielectric needle, the polarizability a with respect to its major axis approaches infinity (a&#x2192;&#x221e;). If the needle is rotated by an angle &#x3c6; relative to the applied field, its polarizability a<sub>&#x3c6; </sub>may be lower (e.g., a<sub>&#x3c6;</sub>=a cos &#x3c6;) but still very high.</p><p id="p-1180" num="0571">While the polarization field neutralizes a portion of the internal field, it contributes to the external field. It may be appreciated that an increase of the external field also causes an increase of the capacitance and thus an increase of the susceptance (imaginary admittance) as measured at terminal <b>703</b> when the object is introduced. Since electric losses can only be generated in the material by the internal field, even an object with a substantial loss angle (e.g., &#x3b4;=45&#xb0;) may generate comparatively low losses if there is substantial depolarization. In other words, depolarization may prevent generating losses resulting in a reflected admittance (susceptance) that is substantially imaginary (e.g., with arg{&#x394;Y<sub>r</sub>} in the angle range <b>802</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>). However, if depolarization is weak, the losses may become more prominent, reflecting an admittance whose angle arg{&#x394;Y<sub>r</sub>} tends to the complementary loss angle 90&#xb0;&#x2212;&#x3b4; (e.g., in the angle range <b>804</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-1181" num="0572">Returning to Equation (339), the function f(&#x3b5;<sub>r</sub>) may be considered as an effective complex relative permittivity of the object denoted as:</p><p id="p-1182" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3b5;<sub>r,eff</sub><i>=f</i>(&#x3b5;<sub>r</sub>) &#x2003;&#x2003;(340)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-1183" num="0573">For certain dielectric bodies (e.g., a sphere) producing a uniform internal field when a uniform field is applied, the effective relative permittivity &#x3b5;<sub>r,eff </sub>corresponds to the ratio of the applied field strength to the internal field strength.

For the sphere, this ratio is known to be &#x3b5;<sub>r,eff</sub>=(&#x3b5;<sub>r</sub>+2)/3.

Exposing an object (e.g., object <b>112</b>) to a substantially uniform field requires the object to be small compared to its distance to the sense electrode <b>702</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, this implies a low mutual capacitance C<sub>M </sub>(e.g., substantially lower than the object's equivalent capacitance C<sub>ob</sub>) and consequently a low coupling factor k<sub>C </sub>(a weakly coupled regime). In contrast, a comparatively large object closely proximate to the sense electrode <b>702</b> may be subjected to a substantially non-uniform field. Such a scenario may be characterized by a relatively high mutual capacitance C<sub>M </sub>(e.g., higher than the object's equivalent capacitance C<sub>ob</sub>) and consequently a coupling factor near or even close to one (k<sub>C</sub>&#x2192;1) (a strongly coupled regime). Given that &#x3b1;&#x3c;1, it may be appreciated that only a high factor a (e.g., a&#x2192;&#x221e;) can satisfy Equation (347) for k<sub>C</sub>&#x2192;1 and it may be concluded that an object (e.g., object <b>112</b>) exposed to an electric field in a strongly coupled regime experiences enforced polarization regardless of its shape. Enforced polarization may be illustrated by the example of a cube-shaped dielectric body (e.g., object <b>112</b>) filling the air space between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor whose first and second plate may be considered as the sense electrode <b>702</b> and the ground, respectively.

This reduction in |&#x3b5;<sub>r,eff</sub>| may be explained as follows with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>: A water droplet falling onto the plastic housing <b>328</b> alters its shape from an originally more spheroidal shape (e.g., drop shape) to a strongly oblate shape when it impacts on the housing <b>328</b> and gets flattened. Moreover, during free fall, it moves from a weakly coupled regime into a more strongly coupled regime assuming an impact position directly above a capacitive sense element (e.g., capacitive sense element <b>109</b><i>a</i>). The flattening at impact may cause a substantial increase of its polarizability with respect to a major axis (e.g., from a&#x2248;3 to a&#x3e;&#x3e;3) and consequently, the angle arg{&#x394;Y<sub>r</sub>} to shift from about 90&#xb0; (e.g., in angle range <b>802</b>) towards a lower value (e.g., in the angle range <b>804</b>) as shown by the theory above. This is particularly true at positions where the incident electric field has a substantial component in the major axis of the flattened water object e.g., when the droplet hits a point near the upper edge of a sense electrode (e.g., sense electrode <b>109</b><i>a</i>) or is gliding down the ramp of housing <b>328</b> and reaches the lower edge of the sense electrode. It may be appreciated that the electric field in these edge zones is oblique relative to the surface (ramp) of housing <b>328</b> thus has a component in an axis of increased polarizability.</p><p id="p-1218" num="0586">Specific lab experiments were carried out to further investigate this phenomenon using a test set up with water contained in a plastic hose disposed proximate to a capacitive sense element (e.g., capacitive sense element <b>109</b><i>a</i>). The plastic hose was connected to a water reservoir allowing the water level in the hose to be accurately adjusted. More specifically, in a first experiment, the reflected admittance &#x394;Y<sub>r </sub>was measured for a change of water level by 60 mm in a first plastic hose with a diameter of 2 mm. In a second experiment, it was measured for a change of water level by 15 mm in a second plastic hose having a diameter of 4 mm. In both experiments, changing the water level by 60 mm and 15 mm, respectively, may be considered equivalent to adding a cylindrically shaped sample of water (e.g., object <b>112</b>) with a volume of 188.5 mm<sup>3 </sup>to the water already existing in the hose, however with a different shape (form factor). Being equal in volume, the shape of the two water samples may be quantified by their volume-to-surface area ratio in Millimeter units. The volume-to-surface area ratio of the 2&#xd7;60 mm water sample used in the first experiments amounts to 0.49 mm vs. 0.88 mm in the second experiment. For comparison, a spherical water droplet of 4 mm diameter provides a volume-to-surface area of 0.66 mm. Further, to investigate the impact of the water's conductivity &#x3c3;, the first and second experiments were performed with commercially off-the-shelf distilled water, tap water with about 0.03% of calcium and magnesium ions, and with water of different salinity using a NaCl solution. Starting with distilled water, the NaCl concentration was successively increased (doubled) in a series of measurements.</p><p id="p-1219" num="0587"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref> displays the normalized reflected admittances &#x394;Y<sub>r</sub>/|&#x394;Y<sub>r,&#x221e;</sub>| as determined for the different NaCl concentrations in the complex plane <b>820</b> also showing the contour lines of constant &#x3b5;<sub>r,eff</sub>&#x2032; and constant &#x3b5;<sub>r,eff</sub>&#x2033; with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>. The limit reflected admittance &#x394;Y<sub>r,&#x221e; </sub>was determined by extrapolating the series of measured data points (&#x394;Y<sub>r</sub>) towards a fictitious water sample with an infinite conductivity &#x3c3;. Further, it illustrates objects <b>112</b> referring here to the cylindrically shaped water samples that are added to the existing water column in the first and second experiment as described above. It is noted that the reflected admittance &#x394;Y<sub>r </sub>as determined in the first and second experiment refers to the admittance change as produced by increasing the water level in the hose by 60 mm and 15 mm, respectively. It is also noted that a different admittance change may result if the water samples (object <b>112</b>) are introduced in absence of the hose (e.g., in a thin plastic capsule with 2&#xd7;60 mm fill volume).

The data points displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref> suggest that the effective relative permittivity &#x3b5;<sub>r,eff</sub>&#x2032; of water with a low NaCl concentration (e.g., &#x3c;0.1%) substantially reduces as the volume-to-surface area ratio decreases (e.g., below 1 mm), but steadily increases as the NaCl concentration increases.</p><p id="p-1220" num="0588">To illustrate the variation of the angle arg{&#x394;Y<sub>r</sub>} over the range of tested ion concentrations in the 2&#xd7;60 mm water sample, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref> displays the unity reflected admittance &#x394;Y<sub>r</sub>/|&#x394;Y<sub>r</sub>| (the reflected admittance normalized to its magnitude |&#x394;Y<sub>r</sub>|) in a complex plane <b>840</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref> shows the angle of the reflected admittance &#x394;Y<sub>r </sub>extremely sensitive on the ion concentration.

Further, tests performed with water collected from a vehicle's underbody provide evidence that rain or melt water on the road splashing to the vehicle's underbody already contains enough dissolved minerals to produce an angle substantially different from 90&#xb0; (e.g., &#x3c;60&#xb0;).</p><p id="p-1221" num="0589">Likewise, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>F</figref> displays the unity reflected admittance &#x394;Y<sub>r</sub>/|&#x394;Y<sub>r</sub>| in the complex plane <b>840</b> for the 4&#xd7;15 mm water sample showing an angle variation ratio of 86.5&#xb0;/57.8&#xb0;&#x2248;1.5 versus 78.7&#xb0;/28.6&#xb0;&#x2248;2.75 as obtained from the first experiment with the 2&#xd7;60 mm water sample.

If the impedance at the transformer's <b>1102</b> primary port is small enough, the total capacitive load produced by the plurality of parallel capacitances at the common input/output node may be non-critical given the voltage source output of the driver amplifier circuit <b>902</b>.</p><p id="p-1380" num="0728">As in the circuit <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the parallel resistors <b>1014</b> and <b>1015</b> are used to limit the open-switch voltage (e.g., at WPT frequency) across the input multiplexer circuit <b>910</b> switch (e.g., switch <b>911</b><i>a</i>) when WPT is active as previously discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Decreasing the resistance (e.g., R<sub>par1</sub>) of the parallel resistor (e.g., parallel resistor <b>1014</b>) will reduce the open-switch voltage.

On the other hand and as opposed to the circuit <b>1000</b>, there is only one switch (e.g., switch <b>911</b><i>a</i>) affecting temperature stability. Further, since the resistors (e.g., parallel resistor <b>1014</b>) are in parallel to the respective measurement port (e.g., measurement port <b>936</b>), the impedance as measured by the measurement circuit <b>104</b> may differ from the impedance |Z<sub>11</sub>| as presented e.g., at the measurement port <b>936</b>.
