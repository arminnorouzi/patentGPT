like</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Liver diseases are a kind of worldwide diseases, and China is a large country of liver diseases. At present, in our country, there are a number of patients suffering from liver injuries and liver inflammations caused by various reasons, predominantly from viral hepatitis. Statistically, direct economic losses per year caused by chronic hepatitis (including liver cirrhosis and liver cancer caused by late chronic hepatitis) in our country reach 900 billion Renminbi. In recent years, the incidences of drug-induced liver diseases, alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, and autoimmune liver diseases also exhibit a tendency of increasing year by year. Seeking for safe and effective drugs for preventing and treating liver diseases is always a research hot spot for various research institutes and pharmaceutical companies all over the world.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Bicyclol is a kind of Category 1 of Chemical Drugs for treating hepatitis in China with Chinese independent intellectual property rights which is firstly developed by Institute of Materia Medica Chinese Academy of Medical Science (MMA), and in clinic, they have the advantages of good effects in liver protection and enzyme degradation, certain activities against hepatitis virus, convenient administrations without any significant adverse reactions, and wide pharmacological activities. Research achievements relating to the Bicyclol successively win a plurality of awards, including &#x201c;9th Five-year National Science and Technology Key Task Achievement Award (2002), Top Ten News in Chinese Pharmaceuticals Industry in 2002, First Prize of Beijing Scientific and Technological Progress (2005), Second Prize of National Scientific and Technological Progress (2007), and the like, and Bicyclol has been protected with compound invention patent rights in sixteen countries/regions, e.g., the United states, European Union, Japan, Korea and the like, and in the Taiwan region, and sold to countries like Ukraine. Since the day Bicyclol was announced to be on the market in the news conference held in Great Hall of the People in 2001.11, it has achieved huge social and economic benefits for our country.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, Bicyclol is inferior in the biological water solubility so that it is not highly bioavailable. Researchers in Institute of Materia <i>Medica </i>Chinese Academy of Medical Science optimize the structure of Bicyclol, and find that the bicyclic morophine and salts thereof have good pharmacological activities and pharmacokinetic properties (Wu Song, Sun Hua, et al., Bicyclol Derivative and Preparations and Applications Thereof, 201610922563.5). On the basis of the previous findings, the researchers resolute the racemate of bicyclic morpholine, and find that the left-handed bicyclic morpholine and salts thereof have better pharmacological activities and pharmacokinetic properties in the aspects of anti-inflammation and liver protection than the racemate, and the dextro morpholine and salts thereof.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The technical problem solved by the invention is to provide a left-handed bicyclic morpholine and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a preparation method therefor, and use thereof in the preparation of medicaments for preventing and/or treating liver diseases and the like.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to solve the technical problem of the invention, the invention provides the following technical solutions:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first aspect of the technical solution according to the invention is to provide a left-handed bicyclic morpholine with a structure as shown by Compound 5, and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof having a structure represented by formula (I):</p><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="111.42mm" wi="64.26mm" file="US20230002343A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">Therein, a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt can be prepared from inorganic acids and organic acids.
