Such chips are formed with ball-shaped bumps of solder affixed to their input/output (I/O) bonding pads. During packaging, the chip is &#x201c;flipped&#x201d; onto its active circuit surface so that the solder balls form electrical connections directly between the chip and conductive pads on a packaging substrate. Semiconductor chips of this type are commonly called &#x201c;flip chips.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a conventional method for packaging a semiconductor flip chip, a chip and a packaging substrate are electrically connected and mechanically bonded in a solder joining operation. The chip is aligned with and placed onto a placement site on the packaging substrate such that the chip's solder balls are aligned with electrical pads or pre-solder on the substrate. The substrate is typically composed of an organic material or laminate. A reflow process is typically applied causing the solder balls to alloy and form electrical connections between the chip and the packaging substrate. The package is then cooled to harden the connection.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Semiconductor packages are typically subject to temperature cycling during normal operation. In order to improve the thermal performance and reliability of the packages, stiffeners are often used. A stiffener may be placed around the chip on the substrate where it is bonded with an adhesive. The stiffener is typically a flat piece of high modulus metal, having substantially the same dimensions as the package substrate with a window in its center to clear the die. Typically, the stiffener is composed of nickel-plated copper. The purpose of the stiffener is to constrain the substrate in order to prevent its warpage which may be caused by thermal cycling during operation of an electronic device in which the package is installed. However, even with the use of the stiffener, the package may still suffer from warpage to some degree.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">During the cool down from the solder joining temperature, the package is highly stressed due to the different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) of the substrate and chip materials. Shrinkage of the substrate is much more than that of the chip. The high stress experienced by these bonded materials during cooling may cause them to warp or crack and cause the package structure to bow. This problem is exacerbated in the case of a relatively large chip attached to a relatively small substrate. In this case, the bow of the package may exceed the co-planarity specification for packaged flip chips.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there is a need in this industry to provide an improved flip chip package and an improved packaging method that control package warpage within acceptable limits, thereby enhancing package reliability, particularly for large chip sizes.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is one object of the invention to provide an improved semiconductor chip package with improved package warpage control and reduced cost.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One aspect of the invention provides a semiconductor chip package including a substrate having a top surface and a bottom surface, and a semiconductor device mounted on the top surface of the substrate.

The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of embodiments of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">It will be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d;, &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it can be directly on, connected or coupled to the other element or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Packaging of an integrated circuit (IC) chip can involve attaching the IC chip to a substrate (a packaging substrate) which, among other things, provides mechanical support and electrical connections between the chip and other electronic components of a device. Substrate types include, for example, cored substrates, including thin core, thick core (laminate BT (bismaleimide-triazine resin) or FR-4 type fibrous board material), and laminate core, as well as coreless substrates. Cored package substrates, for example, can be built up layer by layer around a central core, with layers of conductive material (usually copper) separated by layers of insulating dielectric, with interlayer connections being formed with through holes or microvias (vias).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Thermal design and material selection continues to be a concern for electronic packages, particularly for flip chip ball grid array packages (FCBGA). Larger chip/die sizes exhibit greater package warpage due to the difference in thermal expansion coefficients between silicon and laminate materials. As a result, large chip packages are more difficult to solder mount and may produce larger variations in the bond line thickness between the chip/die and external heat sinks. The package warpage may lead to the delamination in the low dielectric constant (low-k) interconnect layer(s) in the chip and may cause solder bump cracks.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The solder bump cracks may lead to device failure or degrade the long term operating reliability of the semiconductor device. Typically, the gap between a semiconductor chip and a substrate is undefilled to avoid these issues. The underfill material between the semiconductor chip and the substrate is used to increase the reliability of the package by reducing stresses on solder bumps. Typically, the underfill material is dispensed by using a so-called underfilling process that may include a capillary underfill dispensing operation.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The present disclosure pertains to a semiconductor chip package such as a flip chip ball grid array (FCBGA) package with a multi-layer laminate epoxy sheet that functions as a mold cap for package warpage control. In some embodiments, the multi-layer laminate epoxy sheet is disposed on a substrate to alleviate the package warpage. The size and shape of the laminate epoxy sheet can be customized according to the design requirements to fit the required area. It is advantageous to use the present invention because the laminate process is not complicated and is cost-effective, compared to conventional transfer molding or compression molding that requires particular equipment. In addition, a typical underfilling process may be skipped.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic top view showing an exemplary semiconductor chip package in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic, cross-sectional view taken along line I-I&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.
