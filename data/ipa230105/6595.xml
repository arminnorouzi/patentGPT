However, the battery used in the vehicle tends to be designed to have a voltage of 800V or higher in order to improve electrical efficiency, mileage, etc. The high-speed charging equipment supplies the charging voltage of 400V to the vehicle, but the vehicle battery has a voltage standard of 800V or higher. Therefore, a boost converter for boosting a voltage supplied from the external charging equipment is required in order to charge the battery.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the boost converter with large capacity for boosting the voltage of 400V into the voltage of 800V or higher is heavy and bulky, and a cost thereof is expensive, so it is difficult to provide the boost converter in the vehicle and the boost converter may cause the price of the vehicle to rise.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, as a new charging technology that can receive a voltage of charging equipment that provides the charging voltage with a relatively low voltage established with an existing infrastructure and boost the low voltage to a high voltage without an additional device and additional cost increase, and then can provide the voltage to the battery, the technical field of the present disclosure proposes a new technology for charging the battery by converting the external charging power provided at a neutral point of a motor using an inverter and then providing the power to the battery.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The technology, which provides the charging power to the battery using the neutral point of the motor proposed in the related art, controls switching elements of the inverter for driving the motor and boosts the external charging voltage supplied at the neutral point of the motor so as to supply the charging power to the battery, whereby charging of the battery of 800V is possible by using the charging equipment of 400V.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As described above, the charging system supplying the charging power to the battery using the neutral point of the motor generates a desired size of the charging voltage by switching the switching elements in the inverter. Noise generated in a process of high-speed switching of the switching elements causes disrupts communication between the vehicle and the charging equipment (mainly, power line communication (PLC)), causing problems such as interruption of charging.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The foregoing is intended merely to aid in the understanding of the background of the present disclosure, and is not intended to mean that the present disclosure falls within the purview of the related art that is already known to those skilled in the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, the present disclosure has been made keeping in mind the above problem occurring in the related art, and the present disclosure is intended

that is the energy storage device for storing electric power for driving the motor <b>20</b>, and an inverter <b>30</b> converting the D.C. power stored in the battery <b>40</b> into three-phase A.C.

The inverter <b>30</b> has three legs connected to opposite ends of the battery <b>40</b> while the three legs are in parallel to each other. Each of the legs L<b>1</b> to L<b>3</b> has two switching elements (two of S<b>1</b> to S<b>6</b>) that are connected to each other in series. Driving power is supplied from a connection node of the switching elements to the motor <b>20</b>. As described above, an energy flow for driving the motor <b>20</b> flows in a direction from the battery <b>40</b> toward the motor <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the connection structure of the inverter <b>30</b> for driving the motor <b>20</b> as described above, when the energy flow flows in the direction from a neutral point of the motor <b>20</b> toward the battery <b>40</b>, one of the three-phase coils in the motor <b>20</b> and two of the switching elements S<b>1</b> to S<b>6</b> in one leg in the inverter <b>30</b> connected to the one coil may constitute a single boost circuit.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As an example, the uppermost coil in the motor <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and two switching elements S<b>1</b> and S<b>4</b> included in the leftmost leg of the inverter <b>30</b> may provide the single boost circuit when the energy flow in the direction from the neutral point N of the motor toward the battery is generated.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the motor <b>20</b> is a three-phase motor having three phases, with the three-phase motor and a three-phase inverter, a circuit in which total three boost circuits are connected to portions between the neutral point N of the motor <b>20</b> and the battery <b>40</b> in parallel to each other may be configured.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In various embodiments of the present disclosure, the external charging power supplied from an external charging equipment <b>10</b> (i.e., electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE)) to the neutral point N of the motor <b>20</b> is supplied via each of the legs respectively corresponding to each phase of the inverter <b>30</b>. The charging power is boosted by controlling the switching elements of each of the legs and then is supplied to the battery <b>40</b>, thereby achieving charging of the battery <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the various embodiments of the present disclosure, a motor-side connection terminal of the inverter <b>30</b> is provided as an input terminal of the inverter <b>30</b>, and a battery-side connection terminal of the inverter <b>30</b> may serve as an output terminal of the inverter <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the charging system using a motor driving system is a charging system using a motor driving system, the charging system including the battery <b>40</b>, the inverter <b>30</b> receiving the D.C. power stored in the battery <b>40</b> during driving of the motor and converting the D.C. power into three-phase A.C. power and outputting the A.C. power to the motor <b>20</b>, the motor <b>20</b> generating a rotation force using the three-phase A.C. power output from the inverter <b>30</b>. The charging system may include an inverter driving part <b>100</b>, the inverter driving part <b>100</b> being configured to, when the motor <b>20</b> is driven, control the inverter <b>30</b> to generate phase voltage and phase current of the motor <b>20</b> by switching the switching elements in the inverter <b>30</b>, and when the battery <b>40</b> is charged, control the inverter <b>30</b> to determine duty of the switching elements in the inverter <b>30</b> to boost the level of the charging voltage supplied to the neutral point of the motor <b>20</b> and output the charging voltage to the battery <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram showing an example of an inverter driving part of the charging system using a motor driving system according to the embodiment of the present disclosure in detail.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the inverter driving part <b>100</b> of the charging system using a motor driving system may include a controller <b>110</b> receiving vehicle driving condition information from a host controller, etc. and generating a system operation mode signal based on the vehicle driving condition information and a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal for controlling switching of the switching elements S<b>1</b> to S<b>6</b> in the inverter <b>30</b>, a first gate driving circuit <b>120</b> and a second gate driving circuit <b>130</b> transmitting or blocking the PWM signal on the basis of the mode signal output from the controller <b>110</b>, and a gate resistor R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b> connected to a portion between an output terminal of each the first gate driving circuit <b>120</b> and the second gate driving circuit <b>130</b> and a gate terminal of the switching elements S<b>1</b> to S<b>6</b> of the inverter <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The switching elements constituting the inverter <b>30</b> may be realized with an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), a field effect transistor (FET), or the like. Recently, the FET implemented with a SiC with high switching speed and small losses is widely used as the switching element.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As described above, when the switching of the switching elements becomes rapid, a large conductive noise is generated. Due to higher switching speed, higher current variability or higher voltage variability, a parasitic inductance and a parasitic capacitance constituting the vehicle battery charging system react to cause more noise.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The noise has an adverse effect on the PLC performed between the vehicle battery charging system and the external charging equipment, resulting an error on communication. Therefore, there may be problem in that the charging is interrupted.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In order to solve the problem of charging interruption due to the noise, a method of reducing the switching speed may be considered. However, the slower the switching speed, the greater the switching losses of the switching elements, and therefore, fuel efficiency during motor driving deteriorates and mileage may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to the various embodiments of the present disclosure, in order to solve trade-off in response to increasing and decreasing of the switching speeds of the switching elements, in the battery charging and the motor driving, the switching elements are operated by determining the switching speeds of the switching elements differently from each other.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the controller <b>110</b> of the inverter driving part <b>100</b> receives the vehicle driving condition information including information whether a vehicle is in the charging state or the motor driving state, from the host controller. The controller <b>110</b> outputs the mode signal corresponding to the vehicle driving condition information and outputs a PWM signal that determines a gate switching state of the inverter <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first gate driving circuit <b>120</b> and the second gate driving circuit <b>130</b> of the inverter driving part <b>100</b> respectively output a gate driving signal corresponding to the PWM signal input on the basis of the mode signal to the output terminals thereof. The first gate driving circuit <b>120</b> and the second gate driving circuit <b>130</b> transmit the gate driving signal to the switching elements S<b>1</b> to S<b>6</b> through one of the gate resistors R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> connected to the output terminals of the first gate driving circuit <b>120</b> and the second gate driving circuit <b>130</b>, so that the switching elements S<b>1</b> to S<b>6</b> may be switched into ON/OFF.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The first gate driving circuit <b>120</b> may have the output terminal (INV PWM OUT) outputting a gate driving signal used in the motor driving mode. The second gate driving circuit <b>130</b> may have the output terminal (charging PWM OUT) outputting a gate driving signal used in the charging mode.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The switching speeds of the switching elements formed of the SiC may be determined by a gate voltage and a gate resistance. The switching speeds of the SiC switching elements may be determined by a gate current for charging the capacitance between a gate and a source of the switching elements. The gate current maybe determined as a value obtained by dividing the gate voltage by the gate resistance. Therefore, the lower the gate resistance, the greater the gate current, so the switching becomes rapid. In addition, the higher the gate resistance, the smaller the gate current, so the switching becomes slow. As magnitude of the gate resistance is adjusted, the switching speed may be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The resistor R<b>1</b> connected to the output terminal of the first gate driving circuit <b>120</b> outputting the gate driving signal in the motor driving mode realizes a high switching speed by setting a resistance value thereof, so that the efficiency of the motor driving may increase to optimize the fuel efficiency. The resistor R<b>2</b> connected to the output terminal of the second gate driving circuit <b>130</b> outputting the gate driving signal in the charging mode lowers the switching speed by setting the resistance value thereof larger, so that the noise occurrence may be minimized.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram showing an embodiment of a first gate driving circuit and a second gate driving circuit in the inverter driving part shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> in detail.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a first gate driving circuit <b>120</b><i>a </i>may include a switch <b>121</b><i>a </i>and a transformer <b>122</b>.
