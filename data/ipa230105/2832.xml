Currently, anticancer cellular immunotherapies have been actively developed and clinically studied in more than 10 types of cancer, such as brain tumor, malignant melanoma, gastric cancer, urothelial carcinoma, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, and ovarian cancer, and the development of biomarkers to predict a therapeutic response to an immune therapy is desperately needed to prevent waste of medical expenditure and to use cancer immunotherapy in the correct way.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although glioma has the highest incidence among primary malignant brain tumors, the survival period is only about a year even when standard treatment including all of surgery, anti-cancer therapy, and radiation therapy is given to the patient.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, many studies have been conducted on somatic mutations for predicting the prognosis of gliomas, such as IDH1, ATRX, EGFR, and CIC mutations. A previous study showed the possibility that an immune therapy may effectively induce the effect of a longer survival period. Although presence or absence of such mutations may be used as a simple indicator for a prognostic prediction, there are many shortcomings for the same to be used as a prognostic predictor for potential therapeutic targets and therapeutic responses.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it is important to select a biomarker gene that can predict potential therapeutic targets and therapeutic responses in connection with an immune therapy, and a method of precisely evaluating factors related to clinical response, prognosis, and prognostic prediction of a treatment as the cancer progresses is greatly needed, and various enterprises, pharmaceutical companies, and large hospitals are striving to overcome the limitations.

A total of 20 glioma patients were selected, among them, the experimental group was 12 glioma patients who have received NK cell therapy, and the control group was 8 glioma patients who have received a standard treatment. In the experimental group, 5 were responders, and 7 were non-responders to NK therapy. From the patients, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples of 5 &#x3bc;l (100 ng to 300 ng) of RNA before the treatment were obtained to proceed a gene analysis. The patient samples used in the study have all passed the approval review of the Institutional Review Board (IRB File No. 2012-12-172-077).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Specifically, the 5 &#x3bc;l of extracted RNA was prepared as samples by using a NanoString nCounter Analysis System (NanoString Technologies, Inc.), and the expression was measured.

In addition, when a response to an immunotherapy was predicted in patients who had received a standard treatment without an immunotherapy, patients who were expected to respond to an immunotherapy were found to exist regardless of the prognosis after a treatment. These results mean that an immunotherapy rather than a standard treatment may be more useful for patients belonging to a patient group showing early deaths or an average prognosis, and by using the selected gene biomarkers of the present disclosure, the usefulness may be easily judged.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.

The method of <claim-ref idref="CLM-00009">claim 9</claim-ref>, wherein the predicting of the therapeutic response is judging that the patient has a higher therapeutic response to an immune therapy when the measured expression level of mRNA or protein of the gene is increased as compared to that of a patient in a control group.</claim-text></claim><claim id="CLM-00012" num="00012"><claim-text><b>12</b>. The method of <claim-ref idref="CLM-00010">claim 10</claim-ref>, wherein the determining of whether or not to give the immune therapy to the patient, when the patient's therapeutic response is expected to be high, it is determined that an immune therapy is to be given to the patient.</claim-text></claim><claim id="CLM-00013" num="00013"><claim-text><b>13</b>. The method of <claim-ref idref="CLM-00009">claim 9</claim-ref>, wherein the patient is a patient with a tumor.</claim-text></claim><claim id="CLM-00014" num="00014"><claim-text><b>14</b>. The method of <claim-ref idref="CLM-00013">claim 13</claim-ref>, wherein the tumor is a brain tumor.</claim-text></claim><claim id="CLM-00015" num="00015"><claim-text><b>15</b>. The method of <claim-ref idref="CLM-00009">claim 9</claim-ref>, wherein the patient has received or is receiving standard treatment.</claim-text></claim><claim id="CLM-00016" num="00016"><claim-text><b>16</b>. The method of <claim-ref idref="CLM-00009">claim 9</claim-ref>, wherein the measurement of the mRNA expression level is performed by at least one technique selected from the group consisting of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), competitive RT-PCR, realtime RT-PCR, RNaseprotection assay (RPA), northern blotting, and DNA chip.</claim-text></claim><claim id="CLM-00017" num="00017"><claim-text><b>17</b>. The method of <claim-ref idref="CLM-00009">claim 9</claim-ref>, wherein the measurement of the protein expression level is performed by one or more techniques selected from the group consisting of western blot, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), radioimmunodiffusion, Ouchterlony immunodiffusion, rocket immunoelectrophoresis, immunohistochemical staining, immunoprecipitation assay, complement fixation assay, fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS), and protein chip.</claim-text></claim></claims></us-patent-application>
