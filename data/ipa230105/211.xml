The method includes overbraiding strands of material onto a last and then cutting out a bottom portion of the overbraided structure to form the upper. Cutting out the bottom portion provides a sufficiently large opening through which the last can be removed, as typically the top openings of the article (for example, openings at the cuff and lacing region) may be too small to remove the last. Additionally, cutting out the bottom portion provides increased access to the interior of the upper. This increased access makes finishing the article easier. By leaving a bottom peripheral portion on the bottom side of the upper (and surrounding the bottom opening), the upper can be attached directly to a midsole without the need for a board, plate, or other attachment provision. Moreover, the attachment can be continuous, so that the attachment region between the upper and the midsole forms a complete loop with no gaps. This helps reduce the tendency of the upper to separate from the midsole at any locations where the upper and midsole might be unbonded. The embodiments can also include insole components or midsole components that are shaped to fit within the bottom opening of braided upper so that the footbed surface within the braided upper has a relatively smooth shape with no discontinuities.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying figures that form a part hereof wherein like numerals designate like parts throughout, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, embodiments that may be practiced.

In a first step <b>102</b>, a last may be sent through a braiding machine to form a braided upper. Specifically, the last may be overbraided, so that after passing through the braiding machine, the last is enclosed within the braided upper. Next, in step <b>104</b>, a bottom opening may be cut, or otherwise removed, from a bottom side of the braided upper. At the same time as the bottom opening is cut into the braided upper, a peripheral edge of the bottom opening may be fused so that the strands of the braided upper do not fray or otherwise separate along the peripheral edge. Optionally, loose strands at the peripheral edge of the bottom opening could be fused after (and separately from) a step of cutting the strands.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In step <b>106</b>, the last may be removed from the braided upper by pulling the last through the bottom opening. After the last has been removed, the interior cavity of the braided upper may be accessible through the bottom opening. In some cases, stitches, adhesives, reinforcing components, and/or other materials could be applied to the interior of the cavity at this point.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Finally, in step <b>108</b>, a bottom peripheral portion of the braided upper could be bonded, or otherwise secured, to a midsole.

Although depicted without a support structure or spools, it should be recognized that braiding machine <b>210</b> as well as other braiding machines depicted in this detailed description may include spools.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The spools pass by one another along a track such that a plurality of strands <b>212</b> intertwine and twist with one another. This twisting and intermeshing of plurality of strands <b>212</b> forms a braided structure. Although depicted as a radial braiding machine, it should be recognized that an axial braiding machine or other type of braiding machine may be utilized. Further, the braiding machine may also be configured to perform jacquard and non-jacquard motions. An example of a braiding machine is described in Richardson, U.S. Pat. No. 5,257,571, granted Nov. 2, 1993, entitled &#x201c;Maypole Braider Having a Three Under and Three Over Braiding Path,&#x201d; the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Additionally, another example of a braiding machine is described in Dow et al., U.S. Pat.

An object or structure that is overbraided includes a braided structure that extends around an outer surface of the structure. An object need not be completely covered by a braided structure to be considered overbraided. Rather, an object that is overbraided includes a seamless braided structure that extends around a portion of the object. As an object is overbraided, strands are deposited along an outer surface of the object.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic view of an automated cutting system <b>300</b>. In this example, automated cutting system <b>300</b> comprises a hot-knife <b>302</b> that is controlled by a multi-axis robot <b>310</b>. Hot-knife <b>302</b> is a tool with a heated blade <b>304</b>. The three-dimensional position and orientation of hot-knife <b>302</b> can be controlled automatically by multi-axis robot <b>310</b>. Multi-axis robot <b>310</b> could be programmed with a predetermined sequence of motions or positions, to facilitate cutting a predetermined pattern from a bottom (or lower) side of braided upper <b>230</b>. Alternatively, multi-axis robot <b>310</b> could incorporate one or more sensors (such as a camera) to sense braided upper <b>230</b> in order to cut out a predetermined pattern. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, braided upper <b>230</b> (and the enclosed last <b>200</b>) could be supported and held in place using any known apparatus. In an alternative embodiment, the position of the hot-knife could be fixed and the braided upper could be moved using, for example, a multi-axis robot.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Hot-knife <b>302</b> may be capable of cutting through one or more layers of the overbraided structure that comprise braided upper <b>230</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Hot-knife <b>302</b> may be associated with a bottom side <b>400</b> (or lower side) of braided upper <b>230</b>, so that a bottom portion of braided upper <b>230</b> can be removed. Here, bottom side <b>400</b> corresponds to the sole side of braided upper <b>230</b>. As hot-knife <b>302</b> comes into contact with braided upper <b>230</b>, the strands comprising the overbraided structure of braided upper <b>230</b> are cut. The cutting may be achieved by a combination of heat and pressure, as blade <b>304</b> may be both sharp and extremely hot. Moreover, the heat generated by hot-knife <b>302</b> may act to melt the strands <b>402</b> of braided upper <b>230</b> as they are cut, depending on the type of material comprising strands <b>402</b>. As strands <b>402</b> cool they may form a fused edge <b>404</b>, as seen in the enlarged view within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. This fused edge ensures that the strands of braided upper <b>230</b> will not fray or come apart along the bottom side <b>400</b> of braided upper <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The fusing of strands along the edge of the bottom opening may be facilitated by using thermoplastic materials and/or other hot-melt adhesives. For example, the braided structure could be covered in a thermoplastic layer (such as thermoplastic polyurethane) before or after the braided structure is formed. In another example, the braided strands may be coated with, or made entirely from, a thermoplastic material, such as TPU. As heat is applied by the hot-knife, the thermoplastic material may melt and help form a fused edge that locks the free ends (which have been cut) of the braided structure into place along the bottom opening. Alternatively, other suitable hot-melt materials could be used.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, after the cutting is completed, braided upper <b>230</b> includes a bottom opening <b>502</b> along bottom side <b>400</b>. Bottom opening <b>502</b> may extend through a forefoot portion <b>560</b>, a midfoot portion <b>562</b> and a heel portion <b>564</b> of braided upper <b>230</b>. However, bottom opening <b>502</b> does not extend all the way to a lower sidewall edge <b>552</b> of braided upper <b>230</b>. Instead, bottom side <b>400</b> still includes a bottom peripheral portion <b>510</b> that is disposed on bottom side <b>400</b>, and which bounds bottom opening <b>502</b>. Last <b>200</b> may be exposed through bottom opening <b>502</b>. Specifically, a sole surface <b>201</b> of last <b>200</b> may be exposed through bottom opening <b>502</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The size of a bottom peripheral portion could vary. In some cases, the size could be selected according to the method used for assembling the braided upper with a midsole, lasting board, plate, or other structure. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, bottom peripheral portion <b>510</b> may have a width <b>550</b>. Width <b>550</b> is defined as a distance between a lower-sidewall edge <b>552</b> of braided upper <b>230</b> and bottom opening edge <b>554</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The relative size of width <b>550</b> can be compared with, for example, a maximum overall width of braided upper <b>230</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, maximum overall width <b>570</b> occurs in a forefoot portion <b>560</b> of braided upper <b>230</b>. Here, the overall width may be taken along a direction extending from a lateral side to a medial side of braided upper <b>230</b>. The ratio of width <b>550</b> to overall width <b>570</b> could have a value approximately in the range between 3% and 30%. In one embodiment, the ratio may have a value approximately in the range between 10% to 20%. The particular value of this ratio may be selected to ensure that 1) a bottom opening is large enough for the last to be removed, and 2) sufficient material is available along the bottom or lower side to attach the braided upper to a sole structure or other component.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> depict schematic views of alternative ways of cutting out a bottom opening in a braided upper. In a first example, depicted in the schematic cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a cutting plate <b>600</b> may be pressed against a lower side of a braided upper <b>630</b>. Cutting plate <b>600</b> may include cutting portion <b>602</b> that extends up from a base portion <b>604</b> of cutting plate <b>600</b>. Cutting portion <b>602</b> may be configured to punch through braided material as cutting plate <b>600</b> is pressed against a lower side <b>632</b> of braided upper <b>630</b>.

Moreover, heat from the cutting plate could also be used to fuse broken strands to form a fused edge along the periphery of the bottom opening.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic view of another embodiment for cutting a bottom opening in a braided upper.

Cutting portion <b>722</b> may be received within a slot <b>702</b> of a plate <b>700</b>. Although depicted in cross-section, it may be appreciated that in some cases, cutting portion <b>722</b> may extend in a 2-D path around the bottom side of last <b>720</b> so that cutting portion <b>722</b> completely separates an interior bottom portion <b>734</b> of braided upper <b>730</b> from bottom peripheral portion <b>736</b> of braided upper <b>730</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Cutting portion <b>722</b> may be configured to punch through braided material as plate <b>700</b> is pressed against a lower side <b>732</b> of braided upper <b>730</b>.

Last <b>200</b> can be removed manually from braided upper <b>230</b>. Alternatively, a machine could be used to automatically remove last <b>200</b> from braided upper <b>230</b>. To facilitate grasping a last (using hands or a machine) the last could further incorporate small grasping features, or recesses to receive a removal tool. Such grasping features and/or recesses may be made sufficiently small so as not to interfere with the overbraiding process and/or deform the resulting braided upper.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Bottom opening <b>502</b> may have a smaller cross-sectional area than the cross-sectional area of a sole surface <b>201</b> of last <b>200</b>. Thus, it may be necessary to deform bottom peripheral portion <b>510</b> to facilitate the removal of last <b>200</b> through bottom opening <b>502</b>. Therefore, braided upper <b>230</b> may be made flexible enough to facilitate this deformation of bottom peripheral portion <b>510</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As clearly seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, once last <b>200</b> has been removed, bottom opening <b>502</b> provides access to the internal (or interior) cavity <b>800</b> of braider upper <b>230</b>. The &#x201c;internal cavity&#x201d; refers to the space enclosed within the upper and that is occupied by a wearer's foot when the article of footwear is worn. At this point, optional steps to finish the interior of braided upper <b>230</b> could be performed. For example, stitches could be applied to the interior surface <b>802</b> of interior cavity <b>800</b>. Other components, such as reinforcing components could also be added. For example, an interior heel counter could be inserted into interior cavity <b>800</b> and fixed into place at the heel.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A top opening can be cut out of a braided upper before or after a last is removed. A top opening may comprise a foot-receiving opening. The top opening could include both an opening at the cuff of the upper as well as an opening formed along a lacing region (that is, along an eyestay) of the upper. A top opening could be formed by cutting out material similar to the manner that material is cut out to form the bottom opening. For example, a hot-knife could be used to cut out material and simultaneously from a fused edge along the cuff and fastening area of the upper. However, in cases where the lacing area and cuff may be finished by applying additional layers, the top opening could simply be cut without the need to form a fused edge.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Because the overbraided structure is tightly formed around the last, the top opening may be insufficiently large for the last to be removed through the top opening. As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts a schematic (phantom) view of braided upper <b>230</b>. Top opening <b>238</b> is depicted along with bottom opening <b>502</b>. While top opening <b>238</b> may be widest along the cuff (in the heel region), top opening <b>238</b> may narrow significantly in the lacing region (in the midfoot region) and may be absent in much of the forefoot region adjacent the toes. That is, top opening <b>238</b> may have a substantially smaller cross-sectional area than bottom opening <b>502</b>. Thus, the presence of bottom opening makes it significantly easier to remove a last from the interior cavity of a braided upper than attempting to do so through a top opening.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>10</b></figref> depict steps of attaching braided upper <b>230</b> to a midsole component <b>900</b> to form an article of footwear <b>1000</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, an adhesive <b>920</b> could be applied to bottom peripheral portion <b>510</b> of braided upper <b>230</b>. Then, braided upper <b>230</b> could be aligned with midsole component <b>900</b>. Depending on the type of adhesive used, a layer of adhesive <b>922</b> could also be applied to midsole component <b>900</b>. Next, the two pieces could be placed against one another. Heat and/or pressure could also be used to facilitate bonding.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Exemplary adhesives that could be used to bond an upper and midsole include, but are not limited to: contact adhesives, drying adhesives, polymer dispersion adhesives, pressure sensitive adhesives, and hot-melt adhesives. Exemplary contact adhesives include natural rubber and polychloroprene (Neoprene), as these adhesives have high shear resistance. Of course, any suitable adhesive known in the art could be selected. Moreover, the specific adhesive used may be selected according to the specific materials comprising the upper and midsole.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, bottom peripheral portion <b>510</b> also includes a fused edge <b>511</b>. This fused edge <b>511</b> ensures that the braided structure of braided upper <b>230</b> doesn't come undone when braided upper <b>230</b> is bonded with midsole component <b>900</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">This exemplary process produces an article of footwear <b>1000</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Article of footwear <b>1000</b>, or simply article <b>1000</b>, is comprised of a braided upper <b>230</b> and a midsole component <b>900</b>. Optionally, article <b>1000</b> may also include an outsole <b>932</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">For purposes of general reference, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, article of footwear <b>1000</b> may be divided into three regions: forefoot region <b>1010</b>, midfoot region <b>1012</b>, and heel region <b>1014</b>. Forefoot region <b>1010</b> may be generally associated with the toes and joints connecting the metatarsals with the phalanges. Midfoot region <b>1012</b> may be generally associated with the arch of a foot, including the instep. Likewise, heel region <b>1014</b> or &#x201c;hindfoot&#x201d; may be generally associated with the heel of a foot, including the calcaneus bone.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">It will be understood that the forefoot region, the midfoot region, and the heel region are only intended for purposes of description and are not intended to demarcate precise regions of an article of footwear. For example, in some cases, one or more of the regions may overlap. Likewise, the medial side and the lateral side are intended to represent generally two sides, rather than precisely demarcating an article of footwear into two halves. In addition, the forefoot region, the midfoot region, and the heel region, as well as the medial side and the lateral side, may also be applied to individual components of an article of footwear, including a sole structure, an upper, a lacing system, and/or any other component associated with the article.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the exemplary embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, braided upper <b>230</b> comprises a full length upper that extends continuously through all of forefoot region <b>1010</b>, midfoot region <b>1012</b> and heel region <b>1014</b>. Specifically, braided upper <b>230</b> comprises a continuously braided structure extending through each of these regions.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this exemplary embodiment, braided upper <b>230</b> is bonded directly to midsole component <b>900</b> without the need for an intermediate lasting board, plate, or other component to facilitate attaching the upper and sole structure. Moreover, the two components are connected by a substantially continuous bonding region <b>1050</b>. Furthermore, the substantially continuous bonding region forms a closed loop. This configuration ensures that there are no gaps along the boundaries of braided upper <b>230</b> and midsole component <b>900</b> where these two components are not fixedly attached. This helps reduce the tendency for the midsole to delaminate, while also reducing the tendency for particulate matter (or fluid) to enter the interior cavity through gaps between the upper and midsole.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Though not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, an article could further include an insole. An insole may take the form of a sockliner adjacent the wearer's foot to provide a comfortable contact surface for the wearer's foot. It will be understood that an insole may be optional.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, article <b>1000</b> could include various fastening provisions. Examples include, but are not limited to, laces, cables, straps, buttons, zippers as well as any other provisions known in the art for fastening articles. For a lacing system, the fastening region may comprise a plurality of eyelets. In other embodiments, a fastening region may comprise one or more tabs, loops, hooks, b-rings, hollows, or any other suitable fasteners.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">It may be appreciated that variations of the method described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>10</b></figref> are possible. As an example, the method could incorporate steps to make it easier to remove a last from a braided upper, especially if the braided upper is relatively rigid and/or non-stretchable. To this end, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref> illustrate schematic views of another embodiment that incorporates a step of cutting the braided upper prior to removing the last. Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, while a last <b>1100</b> is still disposed inside of braided upper <b>1130</b>, cuts or incisions could be made along a bottom peripheral portion <b>1140</b> of braided upper <b>1130</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, cuts <b>1142</b> are made in bottom peripheral portion <b>1140</b> using a hot-knife <b>1150</b>. The cuts <b>1142</b> may be spaced apart at regular or irregular intervals. The presence of cuts <b>1142</b> separates bottom peripheral portion <b>1140</b> into a plurality of peripheral tab portions <b>1144</b>. Moreover, these peripheral tab portions <b>1144</b> can flex outwardly (that is, away from an interior cavity of braided upper <b>1130</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. With peripheral tab portions <b>1144</b> flexed outwardly, last <b>1100</b> may be more easily removed through a widened bottom opening <b>1132</b> of braided upper <b>1130</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Although the exemplary embodiment depicts the use of a hot-knife to form tab-like portions in a bottom peripheral portion of a braided upper, cuts could be made using other methods as well. For example, cuts could be made using a laser cutting machine. Alternatively, a last and/or cutting plate (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>) could incorporate blades that make cuts or notches in the bottom peripheral portion.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, a braided upper with a bottom opening is mounted to a sole component with a relatively flat upper surface. If the thickness of the braided upper is not sufficiently thin, there may be a discontinuity in the footbed due to the presence of the bottom peripheral portion along the outer edges of the footbed. To address this issue, some embodiments of a braided article could include structures that fit into the bottom opening and thereby create a relatively smooth footbed surface throughout the entire interior of the upper. As used herein, the term &#x201c;footbed surface&#x201d; refers to the entire surface within an upper that is in contact with a sole of the foot during use.

As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, a width <b>1340</b> of bottom projecting portion <b>1330</b> is substantially similar to the width of bottom opening <b>1310</b> so that bottom projecting portion <b>1330</b> fits within bottom opening <b>1310</b>. Furthermore, the thickness of bottom projecting portion <b>1330</b> (measured relative to the downward surface <b>1334</b> of base portion <b>1332</b>) is substantially similar to the thickness of bottom peripheral portion <b>1312</b>.

That is, base portion <b>1332</b> extends outwardly so a peripheral base portion <b>1350</b> covers bottom peripheral portion <b>1312</b>. This configuration provides a relatively smooth footbed surface <b>1360</b> along the upper side of insole component <b>1304</b>. By contrast, if the insole component had a substantially constant thickness throughout braided upper <b>1302</b>, part of the insole component might deform down into bottom opening <b>1310</b> when a foot is placed inside braided upper <b>1302</b>, creating a discontinuity in the footbed surface.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, a lower surface <b>1370</b> of insole component <b>1304</b> is substantially flush with the lower surface <b>1372</b> of bottom peripheral portion <b>1312</b>.

Specifically, alternative methods may rely on only the opening at the top of an upper (that is, the foot-receiving opening) for inserting parts. Because of the size and location of this foot-receiving opening, both the insertion and placement of interior components may be difficult. By contrast, the exemplary method allows components to be inserted through bottom opening, which is substantially larger than the opening at the top of the upper that typically receives a foot. This makes it easier to insert components that are substantially wider than the opening at the top of the upper. It also makes it easier to place parts within the interior, since the bottom opening extends along the entire length of the braided upper.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, a braided upper <b>1902</b> includes a forefoot region <b>1910</b>, a midfoot region <b>1912</b>, and a heel region <b>1914</b>. Moreover, braided upper <b>1902</b> includes a bottom opening <b>1920</b> that extends through each of forefoot region <b>1910</b>, midfoot region <b>1912</b>, and heel region <b>1914</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, the method of assembling a braided article can include a step of inserting interior components through bottom opening <b>1920</b>. For example, a toe reinforcing component <b>1930</b> can be inserted through bottom opening <b>1920</b> at forefoot region <b>1910</b>. This allows the toe reinforcing component <b>1930</b> to be easily placed within toe box portion <b>1940</b> of braided upper <b>1902</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>-<b>20</b></figref>. Likewise, a heel reinforcing component <b>1932</b> (such as a heel cup or heel counter) can be easily placed within heel portion <b>1942</b> of braided upper <b>1902</b>, as also seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>-<b>20</b></figref>. In some cases, these reinforcing components could be further attached to the interior side of braided upper <b>1902</b> using adhesives, stitching, and/or other kinds of fasteners. If stitching or other adhesives are used to attach a reinforcing component along an interior of the upper, the present method may make this process easier and more accurate, as the tools for applying stitching or other fasteners can be readily placed through the bottom opening of the braided upper.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">With these components in place, a midsole component <b>2002</b> can be assembled with braided upper <b>1902</b> to form article of footwear <b>2000</b>, as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>. For purposes of illustration, midsole component <b>2002</b> is shown generically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>. However, midsole component may incorporate a raised upper portion (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>-<b>16</b></figref>) or a peripheral slot (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>18</b></figref>) to provide a smooth footbed surface. Alternatively, article <b>2000</b> could further include an insole component with a bottom projecting portion (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>14</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">It may be appreciated that the method described herein can also facilitate incorporating other kinds of internal footwear components beyond a toe reinforcing component and/or a heel reinforcing component. Some uppers may require the use of reinforcing panels at various portions along the upper. For example, some uppers may require the use of a component to reinforce the eyestay region of the upper from within the inside of the upper, as opposed to reinforcing the eyestay by attaching a reinforcing component to the external side of the upper. As another example, the present method may make it easier to add additional embroidered layers and/or knit layers to the interior of the braided upper by accessing the interior of the upper through the bottom opening. Furthermore, internal straps, bands, or other fasteners or tensioning elements could be more easily inserted and attached to interior portions of a braided upper using these same methods.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The exemplary methods produce an article of footwear in which user's foot may come into direct contact with a footbed surface of a sole component, even when there is no insole component used. As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> shows a schematic view of an article of footwear <b>2100</b> with a braided upper <b>2102</b> that has been constructed using the exemplary processes described above. Article <b>2100</b> also includes a midsole component <b>2104</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, a user's foot <b>2110</b> comes into direct contact with an upper surface <b>2120</b> of midsole component <b>2104</b>, which is disposed through a bottom opening <b>2130</b> of braided upper <b>2102</b>. This configuration may improve both cushioning and support compared to other configurations where a relatively rigid material acts to separate the footbed surface from the midsole component. Such a relatively rigid material could be a layer of an upper that closed along the bottom, and/or an adhesive layer. The presence of these layers in some cases may increase the rigidity of the structures between the footbed surface and the outermost surface of the midsole, thereby reducing cushioning and support. By eliminating the need for such structural layers, the present system can improve support and cushioning in an article of footwear.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">As described above, a braided upper may be comprised of a plurality of strands. These strands may be formed of different materials. The properties that a particular strand will impart to an area of a braided structure depend on the materials that form the various filaments and fibers within the strands. For example, the filaments may be formed of cotton. Cotton may provide a soft hand, natural aesthetics as well as biodegradability. Other embodiments may include elastane or stretch polyester. In still further embodiments, nylon may be incorporated. Nylon is a durable, abrasion-resistant material with relatively high strength that may be incorporated into areas of an article of footwear that are more likely to be exposed to high stress or scraping than other areas. Polyester may be incorporated due to its hydrophobic nature. For example, a waterproof or water-resistant article may incorporate polyester. Additionally, various materials may be utilized for sweat removal or wicking. The materials chosen may also include properties that permit the material to melt or bond to various components. For example, the materials may include thermoplastic or thermoset materials as well as other heat-activated materials. Additionally, other materials may be utilized for various material properties. In addition to material, other aspects of the strand may be altered to affect the properties of the braided structure. For example, a strand may include monofilament or multifilament thread. The strand may also include separate filaments that are formed of different materials, such as bicomponent strands.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As used herein, the term &#x201c;article&#x201d; refers broadly to articles of footwear, articles of apparel (e.g., clothing), as well as accessories and/or equipment.
