In the context of this present disclosure, a bolt is understood, in a simplified manner, to mean a slide or bolt carrier which receives at least one bolt head, also often referred to as a bolt support. The bolt catch is primarily used, when the last cartridge has fired, to catch the bolt in a defined position while advancing and to hold it open. In this case, the bolt catch is usually triggered via a tactile projection or bolt catch finger by means of a defined edge, bulge or the like on the follower of the magazine, if said finger protrudes at least in part from the top of the magazine after the last cartridge has been fired.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, it may also be necessary for the shooter to manually hinder the advancement of the bolt. This can be the case, for example, during the disassembly process or if it is necessary to manually interrupt the automatic firing process.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the context of this application, reference is often simply made to a bolt, with the bolt in the selected drawings and the description primarily describing the arrangement and characteristics of a bolt carrier together with a bolt head received therein, as can be used compatibly with AR-style firearms, i.e. M4/M16/AR15 rifles. The loading and closing processes for rifles of this kind are well known to a person skilled in the art, and therefore the process is only briefly discussed here.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The bolt carrier is moved forward by the closing spring, commonly referred to as the buffer spring, in a known manner when the bolt is closed, the rotatable bolt head being locked by means of locking lugs in the barrel extension or directly in the barrel, while the reverse process takes place automatically after a shot has been fired by tensioning the closing spring, or takes place during manual loading by actuating the charging handle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">After the last shot has been fired, the bolt is automatically caught by the interaction of the magazine follower and the spring-loaded bolt catch. Following a magazine change, the actuating element of the bolt catch, which is usually arranged on the left-hand side of the receiver, can be manually operated by the shooter, whereby the bolt carrier is released again and the closing process can be completed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In recent years, a large number of bolt catches that can be actuated on both sides of a receiver have been developed in order to ensure the possibility of simple operation for right-handed and left-handed shooters alike. Reference should be made here to U.S. Ser. No. 10/197,353 B2, U.S. Pat. No. 9,958,223 B1, U.S. Pat. No. 8,261,652 B2, and U.S. Pat. No. 9,810,493 B2 (each incorporated by reference for all purposes), which all have substantially the same basic shape and mode of operation of the &#x201c;left-hand&#x201d; actuating element.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In U.S. Ser. No. 10/197,353 B2, the right-hand actuation of the bolt catch is carried out by a right-hand actuating element which translates the movement to the left-hand actuating element by means of a lever and a cam. In order to receive the right-hand actuating element, a cavity, guide and mount for the upper receiver that are provided specifically for this purpose are required, which means that it is not usually possible to retrofit this bolt catch into existing AR-style firearms.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A similar approach is pursued in U.S. Pat. No. 8,261,652 B2, wherein the right-handed actuation is deflected via a fork-shaped recess for a protrusion of the left-hand lever. This design substantially requires a receiver provided in advance in order to be able to receive the bolt catch in corresponding cavities.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another approach is explained in U.S. Pat. No. 9,958,223 B1, which shows a bolt catch lever that can be operated on both sides. The lever on the left-hand side from the point of view of the shooter has a cavity in its center element, which cavity is designed to have a protrusion of the right-hand lever in order to cooperate in the manner of a toggle lever. Two biasing means and two separate lever axes are required, which makes it difficult to retrofit an existing AR-style firearms or requires a lower receiver designed for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Lastly, U.S. Pat. No. 9,810,493 B2 discloses a bolt catch lever which is suitable for ambidextrous operation and in which the two actuating levers are integrally formed, so that the entire bolt catch lever is in one piece. The right-hand and left-hand actuation can be carried out about a common tilt axis. The use of a bolt catch lever of this kind requires a slight modification to the receiver.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A number of multi-part bolt catch arrangements are therefore known to a person skilled in the art, all of which require more or less difficult adaptation of the lower receiver of an AR-style firearm in order to enable ambidextrous operation. In particular, it is often difficult to retrofit existing AR-style firearms with an ambidextrous bolt catch. A person skilled in the art also knows at least one one-piece bolt catch which can be operated on both sides of the receiver and which also requires a minor modification to the lower receiver in order to retrofit an existing weapon for ambidextrous operation of the bolt catch.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In certain cases, however, it may be necessary to provide a bolt catch on both sides, such as for weapon exercises, training, etc., and to subsequently adapt said bolt catch to the needs of the shooter. In this specific case, this can also mean that the shooter might wish to refrain from operating the bolt catch on the right-hand side after using an ambidextrous bolt catch for exercise purposes. With the known bolt catches, conversion is extremely time-consuming and in some cases, due to the arrangement of the bolt catch levers, not even possible without an appropriate tool. This means that it may not even be possible to adapt the bolt catch lever in the field of application. Moreover, in the case of receivers of AR-style firearms that are specially designed for bolt catches that can be operated on both sides, an opening remains at least on one side of the receiver when a conventional bolt catch that can be operated on one side is used. However, such openings are generally undesirable because they allow foreign bodies such as sand, dust and water to penetrate.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">What is needed therefore is a bolt catch which is easy to manufacture and operate, which allows ambidextrous operation and which, if necessary, can be dismantled back to a one-sided bolt catch. It would be particularly advantageous if such a bolt catch can be implemented in existing AR-style receivers with as little effort as possible. It would also be preferred if the bolt catch made it more difficult for undesired foreign bodies to penetrate into the receiver.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present disclosure relates to a bolt catch that can be adapted for ambidextrous use for firearms, in particular for AR-style firearms, i.e. M4/M16/AR15 rifles. The present disclosure also relates to a receiver for receiving the bolt catch, as well as means for reducing the penetration of foreign bodies into the receiver and for simplifying operability.

The recess is substantially complementary in shape to a connection section of the second bolt catch lever.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A first bolt catch lever designed in this way offers the advantage of temporarily attaching a second, optional bolt catch lever, which can be easily inserted into the recess of the first bolt catch lever. As a result of the recess, the second bolt catch lever can be partially received by the first bolt catch lever in such a way that, viewed in the barrel direction, the connection section to be inserted does not protrude beyond the original dimensions of the center element of the first bolt catch lever. This makes it possible to easily insert the first bolt catch lever according to the present disclosure into an existing receiver of an AR-style firearm. If the second bolt catch lever is intended to be installed, only one opening in the bolt catch receptacle of an existing receiver is required on the &#x201c;right-hand&#x201d; receiver wall, as viewed from the viewpoint of the shooter. A bolt catch receptacle of this kind, which is continuous in the transverse direction, is relatively simple to produce by machining, for example by milling or broaching, or in extreme cases even by means of a file. Ideally, a receiver designed according to the present disclosure is provided, as described later.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In other cases, it may be desirable to only use a bolt catch lever which can be operated on the right-hand side and has a modified geometry, such as an extended operating element and/or a different shape. In this case too, the solution according to the present disclosure enables the left-hand, first bolt catch lever to be left in the lower receiver and a correspondingly shaped, second bolt catch lever to be exchanged relatively easily.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A bolt catch lever is usually arranged on the lower receiver so as to be pivotable between a rest position, in which a catch of the bolt catch is arranged outside the movement path of the bolt in the lower receiver, and a working position, in which the bolt catch blocks the bolt in its movement path.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">With the present concept, it has proven to be advantageous if the recess of the first bolt catch lever is designed in such a way as to, in the rest position and the working position, at least partially cover the connection section of the second bolt catch lever with the lower receiver. In this way, the risk of an unintentional release of the second bolt catch lever from the recess can be effectively reduced in a relatively simple manner.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The recess of the first bolt catch lever is arranged in the center element, preferably on the rear face, i.e., counter to the barrel direction. The recess can preferably be substantially groove-shaped and extends laterally and/or underneath such that, in the assembly position, the connection section of the second bolt catch lever can be received but, in the rest position and/or the working position, the second bolt catch lever can project from the receiver on the right-hand side.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A bolt catch lever usually has a lower lever arm which, when the bolt catch is activated, either manually or as a result of an empty magazine for example, is used as a stop on the lower receiver. According to the present disclosure, however, it is particularly advantageous if the lower and/or upper receiver and the first bolt catch lever are optimized for the use of the two-part bolt catch device according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this case, the lower lever arm of the first bolt catch lever and/or the mount or the stop on the lower receiver can be designed in such a way that the first bolt catch lever can be pivoted into a third position for the installation or removal of the second bolt catch lever when the upper receiver is opened or removed. This third position is called the assembly/disassembly position. In this case, it is advantageous if the recess is correspondingly arranged on the center element in order to, in the disassembly position, release the connection section of the second bolt catch lever for the installation or removal of the second bolt catch lever.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to the present disclosure, the installation/removal of the second bolt catch lever can thus be carried out in a very simple and tool-free manner. The second bolt catch lever is simply pushed into the first bolt catch lever substantially from &#x201c;behind.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In particular cases, it can be advantageous if the recess in the center element of the first bolt catch lever, which recess is used to receive the second bolt catch lever, defines an additional bearing recess which widens the first recess (or exemption) at least in the barrel direction. In this way, an additional contact surface for the connection section or the second bolt catch lever can be formed on the first bolt catch lever, whereby any transverse forces, e.g., when rotating or tilting the second bolt catch lever, can be absorbed in the first bolt catch lever even more effectively. This can significantly reduce the risk of the second bolt catch lever jamming within the bolt catch receptacle. It is correspondingly advantageous to provide, on the connection section of the second bolt catch lever, a bearing portion which is substantially complementary in shape to the bearing recess.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further possible embodiments of the bolt catch according to the present disclosure offer corresponding possibilities for attaching the second, optional bolt catch lever so as to be optimally positioned for the shooter and/or the possibility for mounting said lever with as little loss as possible.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Some further aspects according to the present disclosure deal with possible adaptations of the upper and/or lower receiver, as well as the use of an optional plug to minimize the bolt catch against the undesired penetration of foreign bodies, in particular sand, dirt and dust, into the receiver. These aspects relate, inter alia, to a receiver for receiving the bolt catch, a grip part, receiver or shaft comprising a cavity for temporarily storing the unrequired second bolt catch lever and/or a plug. In summary, these aspects should be understood as a means for reducing the penetration of foreign bodies, but can also be used as a means for limiting the deflection of the first bolt catch lever in the cases described.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Throughout the description and the claims, &#x201c;in front of&#x201d; or &#x201c;forward&#x201d; is used as the direction toward the muzzle of the barrel, &#x201c;back(ward)&#x201d; is used as the direction toward the shaft, &#x201c;down(ward)&#x201d; is used as the direction for the bolt toward the magazine, and &#x201c;up(ward)&#x201d; is used as the direction away from the magazine.

Furthermore, a magazine release aperture <b>141</b> is shown in the lower receiver <b>11</b>, in which aperture a magazine release <b>14</b> can be installed in a known manner. Above the magazine release aperture <b>141</b>, the bolt catch receptacle <b>151</b> for the bolt catch <b>15</b> can be seen, as well as protrusions which are formed so as to protrude laterally on the lower receiver <b>11</b> and are intended for receiving the pivot pin <b>17</b>. Said pin <b>17</b> is inserted into the protrusions in the barrel direction <b>51</b> along the pivot axis <b>21</b> in order to fix the bolt catch <b>15</b> so as to be deflectable to a certain extent.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, it can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> that the first bolt catch lever <b>2</b> has a recess <b>24</b> in order to receive, if required, a second bolt catch lever <b>3</b> by pushing or inserting it therein.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the installed state, the first bolt catch lever <b>2</b> projects at least partially from the receiver <b>1</b> leftward in the transverse direction <b>52</b>, as can be clearly seen in all of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>5</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also shows a useful measure according to the present disclosure for protecting against unintentional actuation and/or becoming stuck on the first bolt catch lever <b>2</b>, or its upper and/or lower lever arm <b>22</b> or <b>27</b>, in the form of a bolt catch curb <b>152</b>. This curb <b>152</b> is designed to protrude with respect to the upper receiver <b>12</b> and, in the installed state, thus forms a type of lateral delimitation of the upper lever arm <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a preferred variant, this bolt catch curb <b>152</b> is designed to protrude at the same height with respect to the upper receiver <b>12</b> as the upper lever arm <b>22</b> in the rest state (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>). In other words, these two elements <b>152</b> and <b>22</b> are preferably substantially at the same level with respect to the upper receiver <b>12</b>, it naturally also being possible for the bolt catch curb <b>152</b> to be slightly lower.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a further particularly preferred variant, the bolt catch curb <b>152</b> substantially has an &#x201c;H&#x201d; shape. This means that the curb <b>152</b> can be designed to protect the upper lever arm <b>22</b> not only at the bottom in the vertical direction <b>53</b> but also at the top, whereby a shaded region is created. This region can be used, for example, to attach a number, such as a registration code, a weapon serial number or even a logo, and is largely protected against mechanical abrasion by the curb <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The operating principle of the bolt catch <b>15</b> is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which shows a section through the weapon central plane with a bolt carrier <b>4</b>. While advancing, the bolt carrier <b>4</b> is blocked in a known manner on the bolt head <b>41</b> by the bolt catch <b>15</b> or its catch <b>28</b>. A gas key <b>42</b> can also be seen on the bolt carrier <b>4</b>, which gas key <b>42</b> is only shown for the sake of orientation.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Upon closer inspection of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, as well as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, it becomes clear that the bolt catch <b>15</b> according to the present disclosure requires only one pivot axis <b>21</b> in a known manner and is held in its rest position <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>) by means of a biasing means <b>18</b>. If the lower lever arm <b>27</b> on the first bolt catch lever <b>2</b> is now manually actuated or if the second lever arm <b>31</b> is manually deflected upward, or if the previously described deflection of the bolt catch finger <b>29</b> on the catch <b>28</b> is carried out by the follower of a magazine after the last cartridge, the first bolt catch lever <b>2</b> is tilted about the pivot axis <b>21</b> against the pretensioning force of the biasing means <b>18</b> into the active position or working position <b>35</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>). For the sake of simplicity, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>5</b>B</figref> do not show the upper receiver <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Upon closer inspection of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>5</b>B</figref>, it can be seen that, when pivoting or tilting into the working position <b>35</b>, the lower lever arm <b>27</b> does not strike the lower receiver <b>11</b> in the embodiments shown. This can be made possible either by a correspondingly designed lower lever arm <b>27</b> or by a correspondingly optimized lower receiver <b>11</b>. When the upper receiver <b>12</b> is open, or when the upper receiver <b>12</b> is removed, it is possible for the first bolt catch lever <b>2</b>, or the entire bolt catch <b>15</b>, to tilt into an assembly or disassembly position <b>36</b>; see in this respect <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>. The disassembly position <b>36</b> is thus reached when the first bolt catch lever <b>2</b> is deflected to such an extent that the second bolt catch lever <b>3</b> can be removed from the recess <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As is clearly visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> and is easily conceivable when viewed together with, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, the assembled bolt catch <b>15</b> can only assume the working position <b>35</b> during operation, since the second bolt catch lever <b>3</b> on the upper receiver <b>12</b> is limited to an overdeflection into the disassembly position <b>36</b>. Furthermore, it can be clearly seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> that the second bolt catch lever <b>3</b> protrudes obliquely from the center element <b>23</b> and its second lever arm <b>31</b> protrudes from the receiver <b>1</b>. In this embodiment, the recess <b>24</b> and the corresponding connection section <b>32</b> are arranged in such a way that, in the working position <b>35</b>, the respective tops are therefore aligned with the top of the bolt catch receptacle <b>151</b>, which can reduce the risk of the second bolt catch lever <b>3</b> falling out unintentionally.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the disassembly position <b>36</b> first shown by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, the respective bottoms of the recess <b>24</b> and the corresponding connection section <b>32</b> are aligned with the upper edge of the bolt catch receptacle <b>151</b>, which makes removal possible. The configuration of the fit or the play of the bolt catch <b>15</b> within the bolt catch receptacle <b>151</b> can be optimized by a person skilled in the art with little effort on the basis of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">There are a wide variety of possibilities for the design of the bolt catch <b>15</b> according to the present disclosure, some of which are mentioned here by way of example. As is clearly visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>7</b></figref> and, the first and second bolt catch levers <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are matched to one another in such a way that a form-fitting connection is possible. The center element <b>23</b> of the first bolt catch lever <b>2</b> in this case has a recess (or also exemption) <b>24</b>, which is preferably designed to be at least partially open at the rear. For a person skilled in the art, it is apparent from the present description that the recess <b>24</b>, and/or any bearing recesses <b>25</b>, etc., can also be formed at the front in the barrel direction <b>51</b>. For the sake of brevity, a detailed description is not given for these analogous cases. This recess <b>24</b> can be, for example, in the form of a groove, which does not necessarily have to be parallel but can also extend obliquely, as shown, or in a different shape. The second bolt catch lever <b>3</b> provided for insertion into the center element <b>23</b> has a connection section <b>32</b> which is correspondingly complementary in shape, in order to form a form-fitting connection, at least in the region of the recess <b>24</b>, after insertion into the first bolt catch lever <b>2</b>. This connection is thus relatively easily detachable, and as a result it is possible to easily dismantle the bolt catch <b>15</b> from ambidextrous to single-sided operation.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As can be clearly seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> together, it is possible to form at least one bearing protrusion <b>33</b> so as to protrude on the connection section <b>32</b>, which bearing protrusion <b>33</b> interacts with an additional bearing recess <b>25</b> defined by the recess <b>24</b> on the center element <b>23</b>. The connection section <b>32</b> is designed, mutatis mutandis, in the same way as the previously described design of the recess <b>24</b>. In this way, rotation of the second bolt catch lever <b>3</b> about the vertical direction <b>53</b> or normally to the barrel direction <b>51</b> can be reduced to a minimum and the risk of the bolt catch <b>15</b> jamming in the bolt catch receptacle <b>151</b> can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">From the oblique view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, it is also possible to clearly see the direction of insertion and the complementary shape of the recess <b>24</b> and the connection section <b>32</b>. It can also be seen that the second lever arm <b>31</b> can be angled and/or bent relative to the connection section <b>32</b>, whereby the positional stability and the space requirement of the bolt catch <b>15</b> in the receiver <b>1</b> can be optimized. In addition, this measure can accordingly make the handling of the actuating element projecting on the right-hand side easier.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> each show embodiments of a first bolt catch lever <b>2</b> in a view from behind (upper drawings) and in corresponding oblique views (lower drawings). It can be clearly seen that the first bolt catch lever <b>2</b>, as is common in the prior art, has a larger upper lever arm <b>22</b> and a somewhat smaller lower lever arm <b>27</b>. The common pivot axis <b>21</b> is usually designed as a through-bore and can receive a pivot pin <b>17</b> or a spring pin or the like. A catch <b>28</b> is formed on the center element <b>23</b> toward the front, i.e., in the assembly position in the barrel direction <b>51</b>, which catch blocks the movement of the bolt carrier <b>4</b> toward the front when the first bolt catch lever <b>2</b> tilts upwards (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). A bolt catch finger <b>29</b> is formed on the catch <b>28</b> and cooperates in a known manner with the feeder of the magazine.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A further preferred embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A</figref> and (B, according to which the recess <b>24</b> has a bearing recess <b>25</b> which is used to contact the bearing protrusion <b>33</b> of the second bolt catch lever <b>3</b>. As can be seen from the figures, it is advantageous if the recess <b>24</b> has a widened portion in at least one spatial direction in order to receive the connection section <b>32</b> that is complementary in shape or its bearing protrusion <b>33</b>. The choice and design freedom of the shape, such as a clover or crossed shape and the like, of the corresponding elements is the responsibility of a person skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In certain cases it can be advantageous if the recess <b>24</b> has a bearing hole <b>26</b> in one or more places, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b></figref>. This bearing hole <b>26</b> is preferably an extension of at least part of a bearing recess <b>25</b> and, if necessary, allows pressure to be exerted on the connection section <b>32</b>, which makes the disassembly process easier. In addition, the stepwise design of the recess <b>24</b> and/or the bearing recess <b>25</b> can be used for additional contact surfaces between the corresponding elements, whereby the torsional rigidity can be increased further.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> is a view from below of an isolated upper receiver <b>12</b> shown by way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> shows a cross section, along the line IX-IX&#x2032; similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, on an exemplary firearm, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref> is an isolated oblique view of the upper receiver <b>12</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As explained at the outset, a further object of the present disclosure is to reduce the risk of penetration of foreign bodies into the receiver <b>1</b> as much as possible while still allowing relatively simple operability. This object can be achieved in several ways, which can be used individually or in combination. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A to <b>9</b>C</figref>, it is possible to use an upper receiver <b>12</b> which has a cover protrusion <b>16</b> on its inside in the region of the bolt catch receptacle <b>151</b>. This cover protrusion <b>16</b> is designed to protrude into the interior of the upper receiver <b>12</b> to such an extent that it does not hinder the movement of the bolt carrier <b>4</b> or the first bolt catch lever <b>2</b>. Furthermore, contact with the cartridges of a loaded magazine should also be avoided. This situation can be seen very clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, which, in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, shows that the bolt catch <b>15</b> can pivot freely to the left into the active position <b>35</b>, but the cover protrusion <b>16</b>, when the bolt catch <b>15</b> is in the rest position <b>34</b>, significantly minimizes the gap between the upper receiver <b>12</b> and the center element <b>23</b> or catch <b>28</b> of the first bolt catch lever <b>2</b>. In so doing, the penetration of foreign matter can be efficiently reduced. Furthermore, this cover protrusion <b>16</b> can be used as an additional measure to limit the tilting of the bolt catch <b>15</b> in the working position <b>35</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In order to further contribute to achieving the aforementioned objects, it is possible to adapt a lower receiver <b>11</b> of an existing firearm for the use of a bolt catch <b>15</b> according to the present disclosure. In such a case, the bolt catch receptacle <b>151</b> only needs to be widened to the right in the transverse direction <b>52</b> by an opening. It is easy to conceive that, when only the first bolt catch lever <b>2</b> is used, this opening remains and thus foreign bodies can penetrate.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one particular embodiment, a plug <b>153</b> is provided which is used to temporarily close the right-hand opening in the bolt catch receptacle <b>151</b>. As can easily be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, it is therefore possible to close the bolt catch receptacle <b>151</b> on the right-hand side if only the first bolt catch lever <b>2</b> is used.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The bolt catch receptacle <b>151</b> is particularly preferably shaped on the right-hand side in the end region to accommodate the plug <b>153</b> and to minimize the risk of falling out unintentionally. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, this can be achieved, for example, by means of fixation recesses <b>154</b>, into which the plug <b>153</b> can be &#x201c;inserted&#x201d; or &#x201c;introduced.&#x201d; In the example shown, the plug <b>153</b> is designed such that it can be inserted from above into the lower receiver <b>11</b> or into the corresponding fixation recesses <b>154</b>. Once the weapon has been assembled with the plug <b>153</b>, improved sealing of the receiver <b>1</b> is possible, even though a bolt catch <b>15</b> that can be operated on one side is used.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">A plug <b>153</b> of this kind can be made of metal or preferably of an elastically deformable polymer, which is particularly beneficial for sealing.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Due to the relatively small dimensions of the second bolt catch lever <b>3</b> and/or the plug <b>153</b>, said components can be &#x201c;temporarily stored&#x201d; in a cavity provided for this purpose in the receiver <b>1</b> or a shaft or grip part (not shown). The cavity of the receiver <b>1</b> can also have the same shape as the, e.g., lateral opening region of the bolt catch receptacle <b>151</b> comprising fixation recesses <b>154</b>, for example in order to receive the plug <b>153</b>. It is also possible for the cavity to have a similar shape to the recess <b>24</b> of the first bolt catch lever <b>2</b> in order to temporarily receive the second bolt catch lever <b>3</b>. In this way, it is possible to convert from an ambidextrous to one-sided bolt catch <b>15</b>, or vice versa, relatively quickly, since the required components always remain with the shooter or the firearm. In addition, such a holder is used to significantly reduce rattling caused by loose parts.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">It is clear to a person skilled in the art that the embodiments shown were selected as schematic and/or exemplary representations and it is easily possible for a person skilled in the art to transfer the relationships according to the present disclosure to embodiments that have not been explicitly shown, and therefore these implicitly disclosed embodiments can be implicitly understood both in the description of the figures and in the claims.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>List of Reference nos.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="84pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="84pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1</entry><entry>Receiver</entry><entry>27</entry><entry>Lower lever arm</entry></row><row><entry>11</entry><entry>Lower receiver</entry><entry>28</entry><entry>Catch</entry></row><row><entry>12</entry><entry>Upper receiver</entry><entry>29</entry><entry>Bolt catch finger</entry></row><row><entry>13</entry><entry>Magazine well</entry></row><row><entry>14</entry><entry>Magazine release</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>Second bolt catch lever</entry></row><row><entry>141</entry><entry>Magazine release aperture</entry><entry>31</entry><entry>Secong lever arm</entry></row><row><entry>15</entry><entry>Bolt catch</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>Connection section</entry></row><row><entry>151</entry><entry>Bolt catch receptacle</entry><entry>33</entry><entry>Bearing protrusion</entry></row><row><entry>152</entry><entry>Bolt catch curb</entry><entry>34</entry><entry>Rest position</entry></row><row><entry>153</entry><entry>Plug</entry><entry>35</entry><entry>Active or Working position</entry></row><row><entry>154</entry><entry>Fixation recess(es)</entry><entry>36</entry><entry>Dis-/assembly position</entry></row><row><entry>16</entry><entry>Cover protrusion</entry></row><row><entry>17</entry><entry>Pivot pin</entry></row><row><entry>18</entry><entry>Biasing means</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>First bolt catch lever</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>Bolt carrier</entry></row><row><entry>21</entry><entry>Pivot axis</entry><entry>41</entry><entry>Bolt head</entry></row><row><entry>22</entry><entry>Upper lever arm</entry><entry>42</entry><entry>Gas key</entry></row><row><entry>23</entry><entry>Center element</entry></row><row><entry>24</entry><entry>Exemption/recess</entry><entry>51</entry><entry>Barrel direction</entry></row><row><entry>25</entry><entry>Bearing recess(es)</entry><entry>52</entry><entry>Transverse direction</entry></row><row><entry>26</entry><entry>Bearing hole</entry><entry>53</entry><entry>Vertical direction</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
