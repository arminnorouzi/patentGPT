More particularly, it relates to assessment of the placement of motion trackers on a subject like e.g. a person so that accurate motion tracking sequence of the subject, e.g. person or body members thereof can be provided.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many motion tracking systems have motion trackers, also referred to herein as trackers or inertial measurement units (IMUs), that are arranged on the target whose motion is to be tracked. The trackers include inertial sensors that measure e.g. orientations, angular velocities, accelerations, forces, etc., which may then be used to derive the motion of the tracked target.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One of the problems of motion tracking systems relying on motion trackers is that the motion tracking sequence provided is influenced by the positioning of the trackers. The computing device in charge of providing the motion tracking sequence considers that each particular tracker is arranged on a certain position on the tracked target, and the measurements from the respective inertial sensors represent how said certain position has moved over time. Non-correspondence between the position considered by the computing device and the actual position of the tracker, namely, wrongly positioned trackers, results in the provision of a motion tracking sequence that is not accurate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Inaccurate motion tracking sequences are particularly problematic when the person conducts a physical rehabilitation procedure using a motion tracking system. The person does not require the supervision of a doctor or therapist thanks to the motion tracking system, which digitally and automatically supervises the rehabilitation procedure. In rehabilitation procedures, the person has to exercise by moving body members in a certain way to recover the mobility of an injured part of the body or reduce the pain that the person suffers, for example by performing stretching movements. With these procedures, the user can recover from a hip injury, a shoulder injury, a neck injury, etc. more rapidly. When the movements are incorrectly supervised, the person that rehabilitates runs the risk of getting injured even if she/he knows which movements she/he must perform because the person does not know whether all the movements and repetitions thereof are correctly reproduced.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The process of knowing which motion tracker is placed in each member is usually performed by a step of calibration. The person is asked to perform certain movements that will allow the computing device to infer in which part of the body each motion tracker is placed. However, this process is still vulnerable to possible user mistakes while performing the movements, for instance, moving the wrong member (the left instead of the right). This kind of mistake impacts the execution of the exercises since the computing device will be assuming that the motion trackers are in the wrong positions. By way of example, movements of the right or left leg will be considered as each other when the person moves the wrong side while performing calibration of the motion tracking system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there is a need for an automatic assessment involving determination of on which body member each motion tracker is placed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A first aspect of the disclosure relates to a method for determining how a plurality of trackers is positioned on a plurality of body members of a person, a motion tracking system comprising the plurality of trackers, and a computing device, each tracker of the plurality of trackers being adapted to be arranged on a body of the person and comprising at least one inertial sensor and a plurality of antennas, the computing device comprising at least one antenna, the method comprising:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">wirelessly receiving, by each tracker of the plurality of trackers from the computing device, one or more first data packets through each antenna of the plurality of antennas of the respective tracker at least while the tracker is positioned on the body of the person;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">digitally determining, by each tracker of the plurality of trackers, a first direction in which the computing device is relative to the respective tracker by computing an angle of arrival of the one or more first data packets based on the reception thereof through each antenna of the respective plurality of antennas;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">wirelessly receiving, by the computing device from each tracker of the plurality of trackers, one or more second data packets comprising data indicative of or relative to the respective first direction;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">digitally determining, by the computing device, based on the received data from each tracker of the plurality of trackers, a second direction in which each tracker of the plurality of trackers is relative to one or more other trackers of the plurality of trackers; and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">digitally determining, by the computing device, on which body member is each tracker of the plurality of trackers positioned on the person at least based on both the second directions and the plurality of body members requiring to have a tracker positioned thereon, thereby providing a correspondence between the plurality of trackers and the plurality of body members.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The computing device relies on the reception of the first directions from the trackers to assess how the different trackers are positioned on the person. In this sense, the trackers establish the first directions by way of the multiple antennas thereof.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each antenna receives the electromagnetic waves corresponding to the first data packets transmitted by the computing device and each tracker processes the waves respectively received so as to compute the angle of arrival accordingly. The computation of the angles of arrival is, for example, based on phase differences between the receptions of all the antennas of the plurality of antennas as known in the art, and/or differences in time of arrival of the receptions of all the antennas of the plurality of antennas as known in the art.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The first data packets may be any transmitted by the computing device, for example: advertisement packets, hand-shaking packets, data packets whereby the computing device requests angle of arrival computation and transmission of first directions by the trackers, etc.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The computed first directions, which may be e.g. the raw angles of arrival, processed angles of arrival (e.g. inverse angles), linear or polar or spherical coordinates or a subset thereof (i.e. one of the coordinates not defined), etc., are transmitted by the trackers to the computing device for processing by the latter. The processing by the computing device provides data indicative of where roughly each tracker is relative to the other trackers. Such data can be in the form of quadrants, angles, coordinates, etc. With this data, the computing device derives on which body member each tracker is owing to the information of which body members shall have a tracker positioned thereon. This means that the computing device has data indicating the body members that shall have a tracker, which will vary depending on the exercise to be performed by the user (in the context of the present disclosure the terms user and person are used interchangeably) and/or the body members whose motion is to be tracked, and data indicating how each body member is positioned relative to the other body members (with e.g. quadrants, angles, coordinates, etc.); the latter data may also be set for a given posture, preferably a straight posture. By way of example, the computing device has data indicating that the two shanks and the two thighs shall have a tracker arranged thereon, and data indicating that both each thigh is above each respective shank and that the right thigh and shank are to the right of the left thigh and shank.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">With the two sets of data and the second directions, the computing device provides the correspondence to be used in the motion tracking procedure so that the computing device registers or reproduces the measurements of the trackers on the corresponding virtual body members.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The correspondence is defined by the computing device so as to minimize differences between the second directions and the body members relative to other body members. In this sense, the computing device may rely on differences between the position of one tracker and the position(s) of other tracker(s), and the differences between the positions of one body member and the position(s) of other body member(s). When the differences in the position of trackers is provided, for example, as angles or components thereof (e.g. horizontal, vertical and/or transversal components), these are compared with analogous values of body members to find the correspondence that minimizes a sum of differences between tracker positions and body member positions. In order to simplify the computations that have to be performed by the computing device, ranges in the position of one body member relative to other body members may be provided (e.g. the head of a person has an angular variation in the horizontal component of 0&#xb0; to 10&#xb0; in absolute value relative to the chest because they are substantially contained within a plane parallel to the coronal plane, whilst an angular variation in the horizontal component is, in absolute value, between 80&#xb0; to 100&#xb0; because it is above).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A second aspect of the present disclosure relates to a method for determining how a plurality of trackers is positioned on a plurality of body members of a person, a motion tracking system comprising the plurality of trackers, and a computing device, each tracker of the plurality of trackers being adapted to be arranged on a body of the person and comprising at least one inertial sensor and a plurality of antennas, the computing device comprising at least one antenna, the method comprising:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">wirelessly receiving, by the computing device from each antenna of the plurality of antennas, one or more first data packets of each tracker of the plurality of trackers at least while the respective tracker is positioned on the body of the person;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">digitally determining, by the computing device, a first direction in which the computing device is relative to the respective tracker by computing an angle of departure of the one or more first data packets based on the reception thereof through each antenna of the respective plurality of antennas of the respective tracker, the computing device comprising data indicative of a distance that each pair of antennas of the plurality of antennas is apart for each respective tracker;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">digitally determining, by the computing device, based on the first directions, a second direction in which each tracker of the plurality of trackers is relative to one or more other trackers of the plurality of trackers; and</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">digitally determining, by the computing device, on which body member is each tracker of the plurality of trackers positioned on the person at least based on both the second directions and the plurality of body members requiring to have a tracker positioned thereon, thereby providing a correspondence between the plurality of trackers and the plurality of body members.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The computing device relies on the reception of the first data packets from several or all the antennas of each tracker to assess how the different trackers are positioned on the person.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The computing device receives the electromagnetic waves corresponding to the first data packets transmitted by different antennas of the trackers and processes them so as to compute the angle of departure accordingly. The computation of the angles of departure is, for example, based on phase differences between the receptions of same packets transmitted by different antennas as known in the art, and/or differences in time of arrival of the receptions of same packets transmitted by different antennas as known in the art.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The first data packets may be any transmitted by the trackers, for example: advertisement packets, hand-shaking packets, data packets with measurements of the at least one inertial sensor of each respective tracker, etc. The second data packets may be any transmitted by the trackers, for example: advertisement packets, hand-shaking packets, data packets with measurements of the at least one inertial sensor of each respective tracker, etc.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The processing of the first directions provides data indicative of where roughly each tracker is relative to the other trackers. Such data can be in the form of quadrants, angles, coordinates, etc. Like in the first aspect of the disclosure, with the two sets of data and the second directions, the computing device provides the correspondence to be used in the motion tracking procedure so that the computing device registers or reproduces the measurements of the trackers on the corresponding virtual body members.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A third aspect of the present disclosure relates to a method for determining how a plurality of trackers is positioned on a plurality of body members of a person, a motion tracking system comprising the plurality of trackers, and a computing device, each tracker of the plurality of trackers being adapted to be arranged on a body of the person and comprising at least one inertial sensor and at least one antenna, the computing device comprising a plurality of antennas, the method comprising:</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">wirelessly receiving, by the computing device from each tracker of the plurality of trackers, one or more first data packets through each antenna of the plurality of antennas at least while the respective tracker is positioned on the body of the person;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">digitally determining, by the computing device, a first direction in which the computing device is relative to each tracker of the plurality of trackers by computing an angle of arrival of the one or more first data packets based on the reception thereof through each antenna of the plurality of antennas;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">digitally determining, by the computing device, based on the first directions, a second direction in which each tracker of the plurality of trackers is relative to one or more other trackers of the plurality of trackers; and</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">digitally determining, by the computing device, on which body member is each tracker of the plurality of trackers positioned on the person at least based on both the second directions and the plurality of body members requiring to have a tracker positioned thereon, thereby providing a correspondence between the plurality of trackers and the plurality of body members.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The computing device relies on the reception of the first data packets through each antenna thereof to assess how the different trackers are positioned on the person.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The computing device receives the electromagnetic waves corresponding to the first data packets transmitted by each tracker and processes them so as to compute the angle of arrival thereof accordingly. The computation of the angles of arrival is, for example, based on phase differences between the receptions of same packets transmitted by different antennas as known in the art, and/or differences in time of arrival of the receptions of same packets transmitted by different antennas as known in the art.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The first data packets may be any transmitted by the trackers, for example: advertisement packets, hand-shaking packets, data packets with measurements of the at least one inertial sensor of each respective tracker, etc.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The processing of the first directions provides data indicative of where roughly each tracker is relative to the other trackers. Such data can be in the form of quadrants, angles, coordinates, etc. Like in the first and second aspects of the disclosure, with the two sets of data and the second directions, the computing device provides the correspondence to be used in the motion tracking procedure so that the computing device registers or reproduces the measurements of the trackers on the corresponding virtual body members.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments of each of the first, second and third aspects, in the step of digitally determining on which body member is each tracker positioned the digital determination is based on both the second directions and a predetermined correspondence between the plurality of trackers and the plurality of body members, and said step further comprises at least one of:</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">digitally modifying the predetermined correspondence when the computing device digitally determines that the body member that at least one tracker of the plurality of trackers is on does not correspond to a respective tracker position in the predetermined correspondence, and the predetermined configuration of tracker positions is digitally modified such that the correspondence between the plurality of trackers and the body members corresponds with the second directions; and</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">commanding provision of one or more user perceptible signals indicative of at least one of: incorrect positioning of at least one tracker of the plurality of trackers, and guidance on how to reposition at least one incorrectly positioned tracker.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The process for assessing the position of the motion trackers can follow a calibration process whereby the person positions the motion trackers according to the predetermined correspondence (e.g. tracker number one goes to the right upper arm, tracker number two goes the chest, etc.) that the computing device may command to provide to the person by way of user perceptible signals.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In such scenarios, people nevertheless inadvertently swap motion trackers and position them without fulfilling the predetermined correspondence. The process for assessing the position of the motion trackers detects the incorrect positioning (i.e. a positioning of motion trackers that does not fulfill the predetermined correspondence) and either digitally modifies it or informs the person for repositioning the motion trackers.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments of each of the first, second and third aspects, the step of digitally determining on which body member is each tracker positioned comprises commanding the provision of the one or more user perceptible signals, and the method further comprises repeating the steps leading to the digital digitally determination of on which body member is each tracker of the plurality of trackers positioned on the person in order to assess whether the person has repositioned the one or more trackers according to the predetermined configuration of tracker positions.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">When following the calibration process it is determined that motion trackers do not fulfill the predetermined correspondence and the person is informed about that situation to prompt the person to reposition the motion trackers, the process for assessing the positions of the motion trackers is repeated, thereby reassessing the positions in case the person has once again misplaced some trackers.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments of each of the first, second and third aspects, the plurality of antennas (of the trackers or the computing device) comprises at least three antennas arranged such that there is no imaginary line that can be drawn containing all of the at least three antennas. In this sense, in some embodiments, at least one of the plurality of antennas is arranged staggered relative to other antennas of the plurality of antennas along a first axis of the device (tracker or computing device), and at least one of the plurality of antennas is arranged staggered relative to other antennas of the plurality of antennas along a second axis of the device (tracker or computing device).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The antennas arranged in such a way that they are not aligned (i.e. no imaginary line contains them all) may produce greater differences between the captured electromagnetic waves and, thus, received data packets. This, in turn, results in better precision in establishing both the angles of arrival and departure, and the first directions, and especially when, in some embodiments, the first and second directions each at least include two perpendicular components thereby being at least indicative of two-dimensional directions. This means that each angle of arrival or departure that is computed comprises first and second angles relative to two perpendicular components. Hence, the second directions at least include horizontal and vertical components.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The staggered arrangement makes the plurality of antennas to at least form a two-dimensional array that enhances the computing of the angle of arrival and departure in at least two different axes.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments of each of the first, second and third aspects, during the step of wirelessly receiving the data packets based on which the first directions are digitally determined the person is positioned such that a normal vector of a coronal plane of the person forms an angle with a line intersecting both the computing device and a belly button of the person whose absolute value is less than or equal to 45&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The second directions determined by the computing device are more accurate when said absolute value of the angle is between 0&#xb0; and 45&#xb0;. For angles above 45&#xb0;, the components and/or the first directions themselves are less different from others because part of trackers may be on the projection of other trackers (relative to the computing device). The accuracy in determining on which body member is each tracker of the plurality of trackers positioned on the person becomes lower when the absolute value of the angle exceeds 45&#xb0;, and particularly the closer the angle gets to 90&#xb0;, mostly due to the joints of the person being contained in the coronal plane or in a plane parallel thereto.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments of each of the first, second and third aspects, during the step of wirelessly receiving the data packets based on which the first directions are digitally determined the person is in a straight posture.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Owing to both the orientations and the separation of the body members, the straight posture typically results in a greater accuracy in determining on which body member is each tracker of the plurality of trackers positioned on the person.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments of each of the first, second and third aspects, the method further comprises digitally estimating, by the computing device, a distance that the computing device is apart from each tracker of the plurality of trackers based on the data packets wirelessly received from each tracker of the plurality of trackers; and each second direction at least includes three perpendicular components thereby being indicative of a three-dimensional direction.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">With the distances to the trackers, and together with the angle of arrival or departure, the computing device is capable of deriving a 3D direction for each tracker. With 3D directions the computing device is also capable of determining the position of trackers on body members when two trackers are, relative to the computing device, partially or completely superposed, namely one is partially or completely in the projection of the other. In this way, by way of example, the computing device may establish which motion tracker is on the back of the person and which motion tracker is on the chest of the person. By way of another example, the computing device may establish which motion tracker is on the left upper arm of the person and which motion tracker is on the right upper arm of the person while the person is standing with an angle between a normal vector of the coronal plane and a line intersecting both the computing device and the belly button of the person having an absolute value above 45&#xb0; or even sideways, i.e. the person is not facing the computing device but is rather facing in a direction perpendicular to a direction of the line, namely 90&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments of each of the first, second and third aspects, the step of digitally determining on which body member is each tracker of the plurality of trackers positioned on the person further comprises determining a position of each tracker on a surface of the respective body member on which the tracker is.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The computing device may compute the 3D positions of the different trackers, thereby making possible to determine where on the surface of the body members each tracker is.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The knowledge of the position on the body member is also important for a more accurate motion tracking procedure because the movements and accelerations of the motion trackers are not the same when positioned e.g. closer to one joint than another, on the side of the body member than on the front, etc.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">So, the computing device in some embodiments improves the motion tracking procedure by digitally assigning the positions of the trackers to those determined, in which case the registering and/or reproduction of the measurements of the trackers will be more accurate, and in some other embodiments requests the person to reposition one or some of the trackers if the positions thereof is considered to be inadequate.

For the sake of clarity only, one tracker <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>n </i>has been represented although a motion tracking system according to the present disclosure comprises a multiplicity of trackers <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>n. </i></p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In this example, the computing device <b>10</b> of a motion tracking system comprises at least one antenna <b>14</b> (in this example one antenna whereas, in some embodiments, it is two antennas, three antennas or even more antennas), and the trackers <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>n </i>of the system each comprises a plurality of antennas <b>28</b><i>a</i>-<b>28</b><i>c </i>(in this example three antennas whereas, in some embodiments, it is two antennas, four antennas or even more antennas) that, moreover, is arranged so as to form a two-dimensional array. This, in turn, allows more accurate computation of angle of arrival in the vertical direction (i.e. the Z axis direction).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The computing device <b>10</b> transmits data packets by way of electromagnetic waves <b>19</b> (shown as arcs for the sake of simplicity only, it will be noted that the radiation by the antennas is typically omnidirectional) radiated through at least one antenna <b>14</b>. The electromagnetic waves <b>19</b> are captured by each of the antennas <b>28</b><i>a</i>-<b>28</b><i>c </i>of each tracker <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>n, </i>and each tracker <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>n </i>computes, based on the waves <b>19</b> that the antennas <b>28</b><i>a</i>-<b>28</b><i>c </i>it respectively comprises have captured, an angle of arrival <b>30</b>. As it can be appreciated from the represented waves <b>19</b>, a same wave arrives at each antenna <b>28</b><i>a</i>-<b>28</b><i>c </i>with a different phase and time delay, which once processed together with the phase and/or time delay of the same wave as received by the different antennas <b>28</b><i>a</i>-<b>28</b><i>c </i>provides the angle of arrival <b>30</b>. For the computation of the angles of arrival <b>30</b>, each tracker has data indicative of how the antennas are arranged in the tracker so as to process the differences in phase and/or time delay, which can include the relative positions of each antenna to the others, the position of the antennas on a printed circuit board of the tracker, the distances between the antennas, etc. Also, in some embodiments, data indicative of the orientation of the trackers is used in addition to the arrangement of the antennas for the computation of the angles of arrival <b>30</b>, which makes possible to compute the angles more accurately; said data is preferably the measurements of one or more sensor device(s) of the tracker, e.g. measurements of the gyroscope and/or measurements of the accelerometer.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">As shown in the two different views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> that each is a 2D representation, the angle of arrival <b>30</b> is typically decomposed in two angles or values <b>30</b>X, <b>30</b>Z, one for a horizontal component <b>30</b>X, in this case the horizontal component is with respect to an XY plane, and one for a vertical component <b>30</b>Z, in this case the vertical component is with respect to an XZ plane. The angle of arrival <b>30</b> and the components thereof can be computed with respect to any axis predefined in the trackers, in this example the axis <b>33</b> (represented with a dashed line for illustrative purposes only) is parallel to the X axis.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">With the angle of arrival <b>30</b>X, <b>30</b>Z computed, each tracker <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>n </i>computes a first direction <b>32</b> (shown with a dashed line for illustrative purposes only) indicative of where the computing device <b>10</b> or the at least one antenna <b>14</b> thereof is relative to the respective tracker <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>n. </i>In this example, the direction <b>32</b> is defined with respect to a middle point of a front face or edge of the illustrated tracker, but other point could be used instead, for example a corner, a center of the tracker, etc.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The trackers <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>n </i>preferably compute angles of arrival <b>30</b> during a calibration time window, for instance at the beginning of the motion tracking session.

In this sense, mean angles of arrival may be computed for each of the two components, namely the horizontal and vertical components of the angles of arrival. The averaging for the mean angles of arrival is carried out for packets received during the calibration time, and can be of as many packets as received during said calibration time or in a time window within the calibration time, in which case it is preferably a sliding time window that slides within the calibration time; the duration of the time window may have predetermined minimum and maximum times as well and be defined in time (e.g. 1 second, 2 seconds, etc.) or as a percentage of the calibration time (e.g. 10% of the calibration time, 15%, etc.).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In embodiments like the one illustrated, the angle of arrival <b>30</b> is computed by each tracker <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>n </i>and is subsequently transmitted to the computing device <b>10</b>, either as the angle of arrival <b>30</b>, as the first direction <b>32</b>, or an analogous value or parameter.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In other embodiments, the computing device <b>10</b> comprises a plurality of antennas and upon reception of electromagnetic waves radiated by each tracker (which may comprise one antenna or a plurality of antennas), the device <b>10</b> processes the phase and/or time delay thereof in the same manner described and computes the angle of arrival <b>30</b> and the first directions <b>32</b> for each tracker <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>n. </i>For the computation, the computing device <b>10</b> has data indicative of how the antennas are arranged therein (e.g. relative positions of antennas, positions on a printed circuit board of the computing device, the distances between the antennas, etc.) so as to process the differences in phase and/or time delay. Also, in some embodiments, the computing device uses data indicative of the orientation of the trackers (in addition to the arrangement of the antennas) for the computation of the angles of arrival <b>30</b>, which makes possible to compute the angles more accurately; said data is preferably the measurements of one or more sensor device(s) of the tracker, which are transmitted in packets to the computing device <b>10</b> (for instance, said packets are used by the computing device <b>10</b> to compute the angles of arrival <b>30</b>).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Further, in addition to the angles of arrival <b>30</b> and the first directions <b>32</b>, distances between the computing device <b>10</b> and each tracker <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>n </i>can also be computed for enhanced position assessment of the trackers. The trackers <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>n </i>can include the RSSI in the data packets where the first direction is sent to the computing device <b>10</b>, or the computing device <b>10</b> may estimate the distance by processing the differences in RSSI or level of power between the wireless communications with each tracker <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>n, </i>so an RSSI or level of power in the communications with a first tracker that is lower than an RSSI or level of power in the communications with a second tracker represents a greater distance for the first tracker.
