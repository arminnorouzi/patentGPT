The same reference numbers in different drawings identify the same or similar elements.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Providers of wireless communication services operate radio access networks (RANs) that include base stations. The base stations enable wireless communication devices (e.g., smart phones, etc.), referred to as user equipment (UE) devices, to connect to networks and obtain services via the provider's core network, such as a Fourth Generation (4G) core network and/or a Fifth Generation (5G) core network. For example, a UE device may connect to a third-party application server via a browser application or another type of application installed on the UE device. The application server may, for example, stream video or audio to the UE device, may provide real-time gaming, host a web site, provide a peer-to-peer messaging service, and/or perform another type of service for UE devices.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The application server may need information relating to a data flow, associated with the UE device, through the core network. As an example, the application server may use particular parameters to determine whether a data traffic flow should be routed to a central application server or to a local server implemented in a Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) network. As another example, the application server may assign different priorities to different types of data traffic flows based on particular parameters. However, the application server may not be able to access information relating to the data flow through the core network, because the application server may be located outside the core network and not have access to information relating to data flows in the core network.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Implementations described herein relate to systems and methods for exposing custom per flow descriptor attributes. A gateway device may set up a connection for a UE device from a base station to a packet data network. The gateway device may correspond to a 4G gateway device, such as a Packet Data Network Gateway (PGW), a 5G gateway device, such as a User Plane Function (UPF), and/or another type of gateway device. In response to setting up a connection for the UE device, the gateway device may send a per flow descriptor (PFD) message to an exposure function device that is configured to communicate with a server device outside the core network. For example, the exposure function device may be configured to expose services or capabilities to application servers outside the core network. The exposure function device may correspond to a 4G exposure function device, such as a Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF), a 5G exposure function device, such as a Network Exposure Function (NEF), and/or another type of network exposure device. In some implementations, a core network may include a network exposure device configured to function as both a 4G SCEF and a 5G NEF.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Thus, the gateway device may establish the data traffic flow for the UE device and determine PFD attributes for the data traffic flow, including a source Internet Protocol (IP) address, a destination IP address, and a protocol associated with the data flow. Furthermore, the gateway device may determine additional PFD attributes for the data traffic flow.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The additional PFD attributes may include, for example, a 5-tuple hash of the source IP address, a source IP address port, the destination IP address, a destination IP address port, and the protocol associated with the data flow. Furthermore, the additional PFD attributes may include one or more of an application signature for an application associated with the data traffic flow, a network slice parameter value associated with the data traffic flow, a security parameter value associated with the data traffic flow, a multicast parameter value associated with the data traffic flow, a multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) parameter value associated with the data traffic flow, a gateway protocol parameter value associated with the data traffic flow, a segment routing parameter value, a gaming protocol parameter value associated with the data traffic flow, and/or another type of parameter value associated with the data traffic flow.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The gateway device may send the PFD attributes, and the additional PFD attributes, to a network exposure device (e.g., a SCEF or NEF device) in the core network. The network exposure device may provide the PFD attributes associated with the data flow to an application server associated with the data flow. The application server may respond with an instruction to perform an action on the data flow and the network exposure device may forward the instruction to the gateway device. The gateway device may receive the instruction and perform the action on the data traffic flow.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As an example, the action may include assigning a priority value to the data traffic flow and scheduling data traffic associated with the data traffic flow based on the assigned priority value. As another example, the action may include filtering the data traffic flow based on a filtering criterion received from the network exposure device. As yet another example, the action may include routing the data traffic flow to a destination based on a destination address received from the network exposure device. For example, the gateway device may route the data traffic flow to a data center, route the data traffic flow to a MEC network, route the data traffic flow to a destination via a Layer <b>2</b> connection, perform a local breakout (LBO) on the data traffic flow, and/or route the data traffic flow to a different type of destination.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram of an exemplary environment <b>100</b> in which the systems and/or methods, described herein, may be implemented.
