For example, a network operator may impose a limitation/control on a resource (e.g., bandwidth) with respect to a given communication device (or, analogously, a given communication session) in order to ensure that the resource is available for use by other communication devices.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some communication devices may connect to network services via one or more types of radio access technologies (RATs). However, many of the controls that are utilized in a provisioning of a service are present at a network-level, as opposed to at a RAT-level. As a result, resources may be allocated inefficiently (e.g., sub-optimally) due to a potential lack of visibility regarding a RAT that may be utilized.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, which are not necessarily drawn to scale, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment of a communications network in accordance with various aspects described herein.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of a system functioning within the communication network of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in accordance with various aspects described herein.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a method in accordance with various aspects described herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of a virtualized communication network in accordance with various aspects described herein.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example, non-limiting embodiment of a computing environment in accordance with various aspects described herein.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example, non-limiting embodiment of a mobile network platform in accordance with various aspects described herein.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example, non-limiting embodiment of a communication device in accordance with various aspects described herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The subject disclosure describes, among other things, illustrative embodiments for provisioning resources associated with one or more communication systems and/or one or more services based on various parameters and/or conditions.

The system may include a server <b>202</b><i>a</i>, one or more network elements (e.g., network element <b>206</b><i>a</i>), one or more communication devices (illustratively, a user equipment [UE] <b>210</b><i>a</i>), and a tower or base station [BS] <b>222</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The server <b>202</b><i>a</i>, which may be referred to herein as a secure entitlement server [SES], may provide authentication or authorization functionality with respect to, e.g., the UE <b>210</b><i>a</i>. For example, one or more credentials associated with the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>(or a user thereof) may be validated/verified by the server <b>202</b><i>a </i>before the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>obtains access to a given service or set of services. In some embodiments, aspects of accounting (e.g., billing, accounts-receivable etc.), service level agreements (SLAs), and the like, may be facilitated by the server <b>202</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Assuming that the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>is authorized to access a service (as potentially validated by the server <b>202</b><i>a</i>), aspects of the service may be facilitated by the network element <b>206</b><i>a</i>. For example, the network element <b>206</b><i>a </i>may establish/define and/or enforce one or more policies that are associated with the service. To take an illustrative example, in relation to a streaming video service that may be requested by the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>(such as when the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>launches or invokes an application associated with the streaming video service), a policy established or enforced by the network element <b>206</b><i>a </i>may include a maximum frame rate (e.g., a maximum number of frames per unit time).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Continuing the above example, it may further be assumed that the BS <b>222</b><i>a </i>can provide a first type of RAT connection (e.g., an LTE connection) and a second type of RAT connection (e.g., a 5G NR connection) in relation to the streaming video service. If the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>initially connects to the BS <b>222</b><i>a </i>via the first type of RAT connection, a first portion of a video that is transmitted/delivered by the BS <b>222</b><i>a </i>to the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>may adhere to a first maximum frame rate associated with the first type of RAT connection. This may be true even if the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>is connected to the BS <b>222</b><i>a </i>via a second connection of the second type of RAT (either simultaneously with the first, initial connection or subsequent to the first connection), because the network element <b>206</b><i>a </i>might not be aware that the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>is connected to the BS <b>222</b><i>a </i>via the second connection. Once the network element <b>206</b><i>a </i>becomes aware of the second connection, a second portion (and potentially subsequent portions) of the video that is transmitted/delivered by the BS <b>222</b><i>a </i>to the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>may adhere to a second maximum frame rate associated with the second type of RAT connection.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As the foregoing example demonstrates, the first portion of the video that is provided to the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>(and hence, available for playback or presentation at the UE <b>210</b><i>a</i>) may have a different maximum frame rate or quality relative to the second portion of the video that is provided to the UE <b>210</b><i>a</i>. For example, the first portion of the video may have a lower frame rate or a lower quality relative to the second portion of the video. This may be true even though the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>was able to access the streaming video service via the second type of RAT connection at the time that the first portion of the video was provided to the UE <b>210</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In order to address the foregoing, aspects of this disclosure may be predictive in nature. To demonstrate, and continuing the above example, aspects of the disclosure may identify the potential for the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>to utilize a resource or service in advance of an actual utilization of the resource or service. To demonstrate further, and as described in further detail below, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a method <b>200</b><i>b </i>in accordance with various aspects described herein.

As part of block <b>208</b><i>b</i>, the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>may obtain (e.g., receive) the policies (or the representation thereof).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The policies (or the representation thereof) obtained by the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>as part of block <b>208</b><i>b </i>may direct the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>to take one or more actions in block <b>212</b><i>b</i>. For example, the policies (or the representation thereof) may direct the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>to take one or more measurements on a periodic basis, or as part of a periodic schedule, to determine what cellular radio frequencies (as provided by, e.g., the BS <b>222</b><i>a</i>) the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>is in the presence of. In this regard, and as part of block <b>212</b><i>b</i>, the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>may take the measurements.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In block <b>216</b><i>b</i>, the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>may determine if the actions of block <b>212</b><i>b </i>adhere/conform to one or more conditions or results. For example, if the measurements of block <b>212</b><i>b </i>indicate that the cellular radio frequencies are present within a given range of frequencies associated with the second RAT type (e.g., 5G NR) referred to above, the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>may determine in block <b>216</b><i>b </i>that the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>is able to connect to the streaming video service (or another service) via the second connection/second RAT type.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In block <b>220</b><i>b</i>, the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>may provide (e.g., transmit) one or more indications of the determinations of block <b>216</b><i>b</i>. For example, as part of block <b>220</b><i>b </i>the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>may inform the server <b>202</b><i>a </i>that the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>is in the presence of carriers of the second RAT type.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In block <b>224</b><i>b</i>, the server <b>202</b><i>a </i>may provide the network element <b>206</b><i>a </i>with a notification of the indications obtained in block <b>220</b><i>b </i>(as potentially subject to one or more filtering algorithms that may be executed by the server <b>202</b><i>a</i>). In response to obtaining the notification, the network element <b>206</b><i>a </i>may change the configuration associated with the streaming video service that can be provisioned to the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>to be associated with the second RAT type.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In block <b>228</b><i>b</i>, the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>may request access to the streaming video service. For example, the request of block <b>228</b><i>b </i>may be based on an invocation of an application associated with the streaming video service at the UE <b>210</b><i>a</i>. In response to the request, as part of block <b>228</b><i>b </i>a first, initial portion of a video may be provided to the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>in accordance with the configuration of block <b>224</b><i>b</i>&#x2014;e.g., the first portion of the video may be provided to the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>in accordance with the second RAT type (and thus, in accordance with any parameters associated with the second RAT type).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As the foregoing example demonstrates, the first, initial portion of the video provided to the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>in block <b>228</b><i>b </i>may conform to the second RAT type. This may be contrasted with the example described earlier, wherein the first portion of the video was provided to the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>in accordance with the first maximum frame rate associated with the first type of RAT connection. As above, assuming that the second RAT is of a higher maximum frame rate or a higher quality, a user's quality of experience (QoE) may be enhanced as a result of the predictive aspects (e.g., the measurements and determinations of blocks <b>212</b><i>b </i>and <b>216</b><i>b</i>) associated with the method <b>200</b><i>b</i>. For example, and due to the use of such predictive aspects, the first portion of the video might not be subject to a lower frame rate or lower quality in conjunction with the method <b>200</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">While the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>was described above (in relation to block <b>216</b><i>b</i>) as performing the determination of whether the cellular radio frequencies (of block <b>212</b><i>b</i>) conformed or adhered to the second RAT type, in some embodiments the server <b>202</b><i>a </i>(or another device) may perform/provide such a determination. For example, in some embodiments the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>may provide (e.g., transmit) the values of the measurements of block <b>212</b><i>b </i>to the server <b>202</b><i>a </i>as part of block <b>216</b><i>b</i>, and the server <b>202</b><i>a </i>may determine whether the measurements are indicative of the UE <b>210</b><i>a </i>being in the presence of cellular radio frequencies conforming to the second RAT type. More generally, intelligence, logic and/or functionality may be allocated or distributed amongst the server <b>202</b><i>a</i>, the network element <b>206</b><i>a</i>, and the UE <b>210</b><i>a</i>, in any combination.

For example, in some embodiments a parameter of a policy may include or pertain to one or more of: quality of service (QoS), quality of experience (QoE), one or more conditions (e.g., signal conditions [e.g., received signal strength], interference, noise), power management (e.g., battery life management), a device capability (e.g., an audio output volume level, a display capability, etc.), an identification of one or more communication sessions, an identification of one or more users, an identification of one or more activities (e.g., a social media activity), an identification of a consumption, a recording, and/or a presentation of one or more media items, location (e.g., geographical or physical location), a passage of time (potentially in accordance with data associated with a schedule or calendar application), etc. In some embodiments, a service may include or pertain to one or more of: text, images, audio, video, financial information/data, social media information/data or platforms, etc.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Aspects of this disclosure may include a communication device (e.g., a user equipment) informing/advising a network device (e.g., a router, a switch, a server, a base station, etc.) of conditions that may impact/influence a provisioning of one or more services to the communication device. The communication device may advise the network device of such conditions prior to requesting and/or using the service(s). Based on an analysis of the conditions, the network device may configure the communication device, another device, a resource, etc., to facilitate the service(s) in an enhanced (e.g., an optimum) manner.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Aspects of this disclosure may enable a service to be customized or tailored for a communication device. For example, a communication service may be configured in accordance with a type of RAT that a communication device may utilize. In some embodiments, a service may be provisioned with respect to a communication device in accordance with one or more RATs. In some embodiments, a communication device may (simultaneously) obtain access to multiple services, potentially in conjunction with a utilization of one or more RATs.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Aspects of this disclosure may facilitate an efficient use of resources in a communication system or network. For example, a policy may direct a communication device to take one or more actions (or, analogously, to avoid taking one or more actions). Based on information or data that obtained or derived from taking such actions, decisions/determinations may be generated regarding a utilization or allocation of resources. In some embodiments, a device may obtain access to a resource for a given period of time in order to enhance, e.g., a quality of user experience. Once the period of time has elapsed, the device might no longer have access to the resource (absent a change in conditions or circumstances). In this regard, aspects of this disclosure may selectively throttle or limit access to a given resource or set of resources.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a block diagram <b>300</b> is shown illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of a virtualized communication network in accordance with various aspects described herein. In particular a virtualized communication network is presented that can be used to implement some or all of the subsystems and functions of system <b>100</b>, the subsystems and functions of system <b>200</b>, and method <b>230</b> presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C, and <b>3</b></figref>. For example, virtualized communication network <b>300</b> can facilitate in whole or in part establishing a policy associated with a communication service, transmitting the policy to a first user equipment, obtaining, from the first user equipment and based on the transmitting of the policy to the first user equipment, a first indication that the first user equipment is able to access the communication service via a first radio access technology, responsive to the obtaining of the first indication, configuring the communication service for the first user equipment in accordance with the first radio access technology, resulting in a configured communication service, receiving a first request from the first user equipment for the communication service, and responsive to the receiving of the first request, providing the configured communication service to the first user equipment. Virtualized communication network <b>300</b> can facilitate in whole or in part receiving a policy, a representation of the policy, or a combination thereof, wherein the policy is associated with a communication service, performing a first action in accordance with policy, determining, based on the performing of the first action, that a processing system can access the communication service via a first radio access technology, resulting in a first determination, transmitting a first indication of the first determination, and accessing the communication service via the first radio access technology based on the transmitting of the first indication. Virtualized communication network <b>300</b> can facilitate in whole or in part obtaining an indication that a communication device can access a communication service via a first radio access technology, configuring, responsive to the obtaining of the indication, the communication service in accordance with the first radio access technology, resulting in a configured communication service, receiving a request for the communication service from the communication device, and providing the configured communication service to the communication device responsive to the receiving of the request.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In particular, a cloud networking architecture is shown that leverages cloud technologies and supports rapid innovation and scalability via a transport layer <b>350</b>, a virtualized network function cloud <b>325</b> and/or one or more cloud computing environments <b>375</b>. In various embodiments, this cloud networking architecture is an open architecture that leverages application programming interfaces (APIs); reduces complexity from services and operations; supports more nimble business models; and rapidly and seamlessly scales to meet evolving customer requirements including traffic growth, diversity of traffic types, and diversity of performance and reliability expectations.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In contrast to traditional network elements&#x2014;which are typically integrated to perform a single function, the virtualized communication network employs virtual network elements (VNEs) <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, etc. that perform some or all of the functions of network elements <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>, etc. For example, the network architecture can provide a substrate of networking capability, often called Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI) or simply infrastructure that is capable of being directed with software and Software Defined Networking (SDN) protocols to perform a broad variety of network functions and services. This infrastructure can include several types of substrates. The most typical type of substrate being servers that support Network Function Virtualization (NFV), followed by packet forwarding capabilities based on generic computing resources, with specialized network technologies brought to bear when general purpose processors or general purpose integrated circuit devices offered by merchants (referred to herein as merchant silicon) are not appropriate. In this case, communication services can be implemented as cloud-centric workloads.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As an example, a traditional network element <b>150</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), such as an edge router can be implemented via a VNE <b>330</b> composed of NFV software modules, merchant silicon, and associated controllers. The software can be written so that increasing workload consumes incremental resources from a common resource pool, and moreover so that it's elastic: so the resources are only consumed when needed. In a similar fashion, other network elements such as other routers, switches, edge caches, and middle-boxes are instantiated from the common resource pool. Such sharing of infrastructure across a broad set of uses makes planning and growing infrastructure easier to manage.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In an embodiment, the transport layer <b>350</b> includes fiber, cable, wired and/or wireless transport elements, network elements and interfaces to provide broadband access <b>110</b>, wireless access <b>120</b>, voice access <b>130</b>, media access <b>140</b> and/or access to content sources <b>175</b> for distribution of content to any or all of the access technologies. In particular, in some cases a network element needs to be positioned at a specific place, and this allows for less sharing of common infrastructure. Other times, the network elements have specific physical layer adapters that cannot be abstracted or virtualized, and might require special DSP code and analog front-ends (AFEs) that do not lend themselves to implementation as VNEs <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> or <b>334</b>. These network elements can be included in transport layer <b>350</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The virtualized network function cloud <b>325</b> interfaces with the transport layer <b>350</b> to provide the VNEs <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, etc. to provide specific NFVs. In particular, the virtualized network function cloud <b>325</b> leverages cloud operations, applications, and architectures to support networking workloads. The virtualized network elements <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> and <b>334</b> can employ network function software that provides either a one-for-one mapping of traditional network element function or alternately some combination of network functions designed for cloud computing. For example, VNEs <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> and <b>334</b> can include route reflectors, domain name system (DNS) servers, and dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) servers, system architecture evolution (SAE) and/or mobility management entity (MME) gateways, broadband network gateways, IP edge routers for IP-VPN, Ethernet and other services, load balancers, distributers and other network elements. Because these elements don't typically need to forward large amounts of traffic, their workload can be distributed across a number of servers&#x2014;each of which adds a portion of the capability, and overall which creates an elastic function with higher availability than its former monolithic version. These virtual network elements <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, etc. can be instantiated and managed using an orchestration approach similar to those used in cloud compute services.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The cloud computing environments <b>375</b> can interface with the virtualized network function cloud <b>325</b> via APIs that expose functional capabilities of the VNEs <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, etc. to provide the flexible and expanded capabilities to the virtualized network function cloud <b>325</b>. In particular, network workloads may have applications distributed across the virtualized network function cloud <b>325</b> and cloud computing environment <b>375</b> and in the commercial cloud, or might simply orchestrate workloads supported entirely in NFV infrastructure from these third party locations.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, there is illustrated a block diagram of a computing environment in accordance with various aspects described herein.

The embodiments (e.g., in connection with automatically identifying acquired cell sites that provide a maximum value/benefit after addition to an existing communication network) can employ various AI-based schemes for carrying out various embodiments thereof. Moreover, the classifier can be employed to determine a ranking or priority of each cell site of the acquired network. A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector, x=(x1, x2, x3, x4, . . . , xn), to a confidence that the input belongs to a class, that is, f(x)=confidence (class). Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to determine or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. A support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs, which the hypersurface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches comprise, e.g., na&#xef;ve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">As will be readily appreciated, one or more of the embodiments can employ classifiers that are explicitly trained (e.g., via a generic training data) as well as implicitly trained (e.g., via observing UE behavior, operator preferences, historical information, receiving extrinsic information). For example, SVMs can be configured via a learning or training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module. Thus, the classifier(s) can be used to automatically learn and perform a number of functions, including but not limited to determining according to predetermined criteria which of the acquired cell sites will benefit a maximum number of subscribers and/or which of the acquired cell sites will add minimum value to the existing communication network coverage, etc.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">As used in some contexts in this application, in some embodiments, the terms &#x201c;component,&#x201d; &#x201c;system&#x201d; and the like are intended to refer to, or comprise, a computer-related entity or an entity related to an operational apparatus with one or more specific functionalities, wherein the entity can be either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution.
