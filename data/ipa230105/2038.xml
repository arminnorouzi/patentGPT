Specifically, in a situation after ballistic damage, a damaged drive shaft has to maintain structural and functional integrity sufficient to complete the flight mission including safe landing. Although conventional design methods have generally been considered satisfactory for their intended purpose, there is still a need in the art for improved drive shafts that can better withstand ballistic damage and, especially, post-ballistic behavior. Therefore, the disclosure is focused on an efficient design of a drive shaft, capable of providing desired structural integrity even in case of the ballistic damage.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A drive shaft including an outer shaft having a first diameter, an inner shaft concentric with the outer shaft having a second diameter, and a gap between an outer surface of the inner shaft and an inner surface of the outer shaft.

For purposes of explanation and illustration, and not limitation, a partial view of an exemplary embodiment of a drive shaft in accordance with the disclosure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and is designated generally by reference character <b>100</b>. Other embodiments of the drive shaft, and methods of making such shafts in accordance with the disclosure, or aspects thereof, are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, as will be described. The shafts, and methods of making such shafts described herein can be used for improving shaft reliability after ballistic damage.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a helicopter is shown having a composite drive shaft <b>100</b> made of plural shaft elements or parts connecting a main rotor and a rear rotor. The drive shaft <b>100</b>, shown in detail at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, is especially susceptible to ballistics from various sides and angles and can be damaged during missions. Maintaining structural and functional integrity sufficient to complete the flight mission including safe landing of the aircraft is of the upmost importance, as the aircraft cannot be operated once the structural integrity of the shaft is diminished.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a cross-section of the drive shaft <b>100</b> is shown. The drive shaft <b>100</b> includes an inner shaft <b>102</b> having a first diameter (d1) and an outer shaft <b>104</b> concentric with the inner shaft <b>102</b> and having a second diameter (d2). A gap <b>106</b> is defined between the outside peripheral surface of the inner shaft <b>102</b> and the inner peripheral surface of the outer shaft <b>104</b>. The inner shaft <b>102</b> and the outer shaft <b>104</b> can be each formed of a fiber-reinforced polymer-matrix composite material or a metal or a metallic alloy or a combination thereof. Materials of the inner and outer shafts <b>102</b>/<b>104</b> can be the same or different from each other.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The gap <b>106</b> is dimensionally designed to be larger than an expected projectile cross-sectional size that the helicopter could encounter on its mission, providing increased ballistic tolerance for the aircraft as compared to prior art drive shafts with one tubular body. After an expected mission statement or project statement is developed for the aircraft, where the statement includes possible ballistic incidences, an expected ballistic cross-sectional size, based on caliber, is defined. The gap <b>106</b>, is designed to be at least equal to the expected ballistic cross-sectional size, but taking safety factors into account the true gap is larger than the expected ballistic cross-sectional size. If the mission plan includes the potential to encounter more than one ballistic caliber, the expected ballistic cross-sectional size is defined based on the largest expected value of an expected ballistic cross-sectional size.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The drive shaft <b>100</b> also includes an optional plurality of circumferential connectors <b>130</b> that are located between and contacting the inner shaft <b>102</b> and the outer shaft <b>104</b>. The connectors <b>130</b> are configured as circumferential beams. The beams can have different cross-sectional shapes, including, for example, I-shape, L-shape, U-shape, double L-shape, among others. An example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment in form of a I-shape beam. The connector beam can have different portions, including, for example, a first portion extending axially <b>130</b><i>a </i>along the surface of the inner shaft <b>102</b>, and a second portion extending axially <b>130</b><i>b </i>along the surface of the outer shaft <b>104</b> and a central web portion <b>131</b> extending radially between portions <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b</i>.

Alternatively, one end portion of the drive shaft could have a first type of connection and the other end portion of the drive shaft could have a second type of connection, and these connections could be selected from any one of the connections described and illustrated herein without departing from the spirt or scope of the subject application.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the inner shaft <b>102</b> directly connected to a sleeve <b>110</b> by fasteners <b>109</b>.
