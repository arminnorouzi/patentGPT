Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure of the present patent application relates to leak detection, and particularly to a system and method for wireless water leak detection which allows for manual prevention of external action, such as an external alarm and/or valve shut-off, if a leak sensor can be reached by maintenance personnel, for example, within a pre-set time threshold.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Although wireless leak detection systems are relatively common, such systems typically suffer from a lack of on-site human intervention. In a typical wireless leak detection system, a leak sensor, upon detection of a leak, automatically and instantaneously transmits a wireless signal, initiating a global alarm and/or shut-off of a valve. Although this automated process instantly takes action to prevent leak-related damage, there are numerous occasions when such an alarm and/or valve shut-off is not warranted. For example, due to the automated nature of typical wireless leak detection systems, accidentally splashed water or cleaning of a floor can cause the alarm to be transmitted and/or cause the valve to be automatically closed, thus wasting the time and energy of responding personnel. Thus, a system and method for wireless water leak detection solving the aforementioned problems is desired.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The system and method for wireless water leak detection provides for manual prevention of external action, such as an external alarm and/or valve shut-off, if a leak sensor can be reached by maintenance personnel, for example, within a pre-set time threshold. Upon detection of a leak by a leak sensor, a local alarm, such as an audible alarm or the like, is initiated. Additionally, at the time of detection, a first time is recorded.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A first alarm signal is transmitted from the leak sensor to a base station. The first alarm signal includes data representative of the recorded first time. If manual input is not received by the leak sensor within a pre-set time threshold measured from the first time, then the base station transmits a second alarm signal to at least one external device. The base station may further wirelessly transmit a shut-off signal to a valve controller for closing an associated valve. It should be understood that a wide variety of different configurations are possible, including the usage of multiple leak sensors, multiple groupings of leak sensors, multiple corresponding valve controllers, and multiple base stations.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an alternative embodiment, a group of leak sensors may be defined, such that a threshold number of leak sensors in the group may be selected for generating a shut-off signal for at least one valve associated with the group. As an example, in a group of 15 leak sensors, the user may select a minimum threshold of five. Thus, in order for at least one valve associated with the group to be shut off automatically, five leak sensors of the group would all have to detect a leak. It should be understood that the threshold may be set to one, thus requiring only a single leak sensor to detect the leak in order to automatically shut off the at least one valve. Similarly, a threshold value equal to the total number of leak sensors in the group may be selected, requiring all leak sensors in the group to detect the leak before the at least one valve is shut off automatically.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In use, after the user sets the threshold number of leak sensors in the group of leak sensors, and upon detection of a leak by a number of leak sensors of the group (where the number may equal one or more), a determination is made whether or not the number of the leak sensors making the detection is equal to or greater than the threshold number of the leak sensors in the group. If the number of detecting leak sensors is equal to or greater than the threshold number of the leak sensors in the group of leak sensors, then at least one valve associated with the group of leak sensors is shut off. The determination may be made control logic operating within any suitable component of the system, including but not limited to, a controller associated with at least one valve controller, similar to the valve controller described above, internal controllers associated with each leak sensor, communicating with one another, within a controller associated with a communication hub linking the leak sensors, or within a controller associated with the base station. Similarly, the control signal to actuate the valve controller to shut off the at least one valve may be generated within the valve controller itself, or may be wirelessly transmitted thereto from the hub, the base station or one or more of the leak sensors.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It should be understood that the above embodiment may operate as a stand-alone system for automatically shutting off at least one valve dependent upon a preset number of leak sensors detecting a leak, or it may be incorporated into the previous embodiment; i.e., upon detection of a leak by at least one leak sensor of the group, a local alarm, such as an audible alarm or the like, is initiated. Additionally, at the time of detection, a first time is recorded.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A first alarm signal is transmitted from the at least one leak sensor to the base station. The first alarm signal includes data representative of the recorded first time. If manual input is not received by the at least one leak sensor within a pre-set time threshold measured from the first time, then the base station transmits a second alarm signal to the at least one external device, and if the number of leak sensors of the group is equal to or greater than the threshold number of the leak sensors in the group, then a shut-off signal is wirelessly transmitted from the base station to the valve controller.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other features of the present subject matter will become readily apparent upon further review of the following specification.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> diagrammatically illustrates a system for wireless water leak detection.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating components of a leak sensor of the system for wireless water leak detection.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating components of a base station of the system for wireless water leak detection.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow chart depicting steps of a method for wireless water leak detection.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> diagrammatically illustrates an alternative embodiment of the system for wireless water leak detection.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> diagrammatically illustrates a further alternative embodiment of the system for wireless water leak detection.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the attached drawings.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The system and method for wireless water leak detection provides for manual prevention of external action, such as an external alarm and/or valve shut-off, if a leak sensor <b>12</b> can be reached by maintenance personnel (or any other suitable respondent) within a pre-set time threshold. In general, it is understood that the embodiments described herein are for exemplary purposes and are not meant to be limiting to the claimed subject matter. Various non-limiting embodiments may contain all of the components described herein, or may contain more or fewer components without deviating from the scope of the disclosed subject matter. In a non-limiting example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the system for wireless water leak detection <b>10</b> includes, in addition to leak sensor <b>12</b>, a valve controller <b>14</b> and a base station <b>16</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, leak sensor <b>12</b> includes a controller <b>22</b>, a liquid detector <b>24</b>, a wireless transceiver <b>26</b>, a timer <b>28</b>, memory <b>30</b>, a manual interface <b>32</b>, and a local alarm <b>42</b>. It should be understood that controller <b>22</b> may be any suitable type of processor, programmable logic controller, control circuitry or the like. Further, it should be understood that timer <b>28</b> and/or memory <b>30</b> may be integrated into controller <b>22</b> or may be in communication therewith by any suitable type of bus, as is well known in the art. Additionally, although only a single leak sensor <b>12</b>, a single associated valve controller <b>14</b>, and a single base station <b>16</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it should be understood that this is for purposes of simplification and illustration only. As will be explained in greater detail below with respect to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, alternative arrangements involving multiple leak sensors and/or multiple sub-groups of leak sensors, are also contemplated. Further, it should be understood that multiple base stations may be provided with different groupings of leak sensors and/or differing valve controllers being in communication with differing ones of the multiple base stations.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It should be further understood that liquid detector <b>24</b> may be any suitable type of detector for detection of a leak, as is well known in the art. Upon detection of a leak by liquid detector <b>24</b>, local alarm <b>42</b> is initiated. Local alarm <b>42</b> may be an audible alarm delivered by a speaker or the like, as is well known in the art, or may be any other suitable type of local alarm for indicating to those in the vicinity of leak detector <b>12</b> that a leak has been detected. At the time of detection, a first time is recorded in memory <b>30</b>. It should be understood that memory <b>30</b> may be any suitable type of computer readable and programmable memory, and, in a particular non-limiting embodiment, is a non-transitory, computer readable storage medium.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in step <b>100</b>, leak sensor <b>12</b> is initially in a sensing mode. In this mode, no action is being taken other than liquid detector <b>24</b> being in an operational state to detect liquid. When the leak is detected at step <b>102</b>, local alarm <b>42</b> is initiated, such as through generation of an audible &#x201c;squawk&#x201d; or the like (step <b>104</b>), and timer <b>28</b> initiates a counter (step <b>106</b>), beginning from the first time recorded in memory <b>30</b>. It should be understood that controller <b>22</b> operates to initiate and control each of these steps.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Controller <b>22</b> then generates a first alarm signal to be transmitted by wireless transceiver <b>26</b> (step <b>108</b>). The first alarm signal is represented by signal S<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. It should be understood that wireless transceiver <b>26</b> may be any suitable type of transceiver for transmitting and receiving wireless signals. The first alarm signal includes data representative of the recorded first time. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, base station <b>16</b> includes a processor <b>34</b>, associated memory <b>38</b>, a wireless transceiver <b>36</b> and a telecommunication interface <b>40</b>. It should be understood that processor <b>34</b> may be any suitable type of processor, controller, control circuitry or the like. Similarly, it should be understood that memory <b>38</b> may be any suitable type of computer readable and programmable memory, and is preferably a non-transitory, computer readable storage medium. The first alarm signal is received by wireless transceiver <b>36</b> of base station <b>16</b>. It should be understood that wireless transceiver <b>36</b> may be any suitable type of transceiver for transmitting and receiving wireless signals.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As indicated by step <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, base station <b>16</b>, upon receipt of the first alarm signal, transmits an acknowledgement signal back to leak sensor <b>12</b>. If leak sensor <b>12</b> does not receive the acknowledgement signal within a pre-determined amount of time, leak sensor <b>12</b> re-transmits the first alarm signal. A desired number of return loops can be programmed such that leak sensor <b>12</b> does not transmit the first alarm signal enough times to cause strain or congestion on the local wireless network. For example, leak sensor <b>12</b> may be programmed to transmit the first alarm signal five times (assuming that no acknowledgment signal is received) and then cease for a pre-determined interval. As a non-limiting example, after five unacknowledged transmissions, leak sensor <b>12</b> can be programmed to go into a sleep mode for five minutes and then transmit the first alarm signal again.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The local alarm <b>42</b> is provided in leak sensor <b>12</b> so that maintenance personnel, or any other suitable type of respondent in the vicinity of leak sensor <b>12</b>, can take action if a leak is detected. In order to prevent any further action, such as sending an alarm to personnel who are off-site, for example, the local respondent can enter manual input to leak sensor <b>12</b> via a manual interface <b>32</b>, which may be a button, for example, mounted on the housing of leak sensor <b>12</b>. As indicated in step <b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, this manual input must be received within a pre-set time threshold, with the time being measured, from the recorded first time, by timer <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">If the manual input is entered within the pre-set threshold, then leak sensor <b>12</b> returns to its sensing mode (step <b>100</b>) and the local alarm <b>42</b> is deactivated. However, if the manual input is not received by the leak sensor <b>12</b> within a pre-set time threshold, then the base station <b>16</b> transmits a second alarm signal to at least one external device. The base station <b>16</b> may further wirelessly transmit a shut-off signal S<b>2</b> to a valve controller <b>14</b> for closing an associated valve to shut off flow through the pipes associated with the leak (step <b>114</b>).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, base station <b>16</b> is shown in communication with a cloud server <b>18</b> for transmitting the second alarm signal to a user device <b>20</b>. It should be understood that telecommunication interface <b>40</b> of base station <b>16</b> may be any suitable type of interface for communicating with any suitable type of local area or wide area network. It should be further understood that user device <b>20</b> represents one or more of any suitable type of device which is external to the building or location in which system <b>10</b> is installed. User device <b>20</b> may be, for example, a laptop computer, a smartphone or the like, allowing the second alarm signal to reach off-site personnel.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it should be understood that single leak sensor <b>12</b> is shown for purposes of illustration only. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, groupings of multiple leak sensors (LSs) may be provided. For example, a first group of leak sensors <b>212</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>b</i>, <b>212</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>d </i>may be provided on one floor of a building, and a second group of leak sensors <b>312</b><i>a</i>, <b>312</b><i>b</i>, <b>312</b><i>c</i>, <b>312</b><i>d </i>may be provided on another floor of the building. Here, each group of leak sensors is shown communicating wirelessly with a corresponding communication hub <b>222</b>, <b>322</b>, respectively. Each of hubs <b>222</b>, <b>322</b> may be associated with the particular floor of the building for each of the respective groups of leak sensors. Hubs <b>222</b>, <b>322</b> act as communication intermediaries for transmitting the wireless signals between the first and second groups of leak sensors and base station <b>16</b>. Further, as discussed above, the usage of multiple base stations is also contemplated. In such a situation, the multiple stations may communicate with corresponding ones of the hubs (either in one-to-one correspondence, or with groups of hubs communicating with a selected base station), or the multiple hubs may be replaced with, or integrated with, base stations.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition to the basic operation described above, additional times may be recorded in order to generate an overall incident log with accurate time reporting. For example, a second time may be recorded which is indicative of a time when the leak is no longer detected by liquid detector <b>24</b> of leak sensor <b>12</b>. A third time may be recorded which is indicative of a time when the manual input has been received via manual interface <b>32</b> of leak sensor <b>12</b>. As a further example, a fourth time may be recorded which is indicative of a time when the initial sensing mode of the leak sensor (step <b>100</b>) is reinitiated. It should be understood that the second time and the third time may occur in any order.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each of the second, third and fourth times, as described above, may be transmitted from leak sensor to base station <b>16</b>. Thus, each of the recorded times is stored both in memory <b>30</b> of leak sensor <b>12</b>, and also in memory <b>38</b> of base station <b>16</b>. Thus, although base station <b>16</b> typically prepares and records the overall event log, leak sensor <b>12</b> also maintains an event log in the event of transmission failure. Further, system <b>10</b> can be programmed to transmit additional signals indicative of any of these conditions. For example, upon recordation of the second time, a signal may be transmitted to user device <b>20</b> to indicate that the sensed leak has been cleared; i.e., it is no longer present. It should be further understood that users may access the event log, as well as perform programming of system <b>10</b>, through the connection of base station <b>16</b> with cloud server <b>18</b>; i.e., users may input and retrieve data from base station <b>16</b> through user device(s) <b>20</b>, either on-site or off-site.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It should be understood that the pre-set time threshold may be any desired programmable duration. The pre-set time threshold may also be set to zero, thus automatically and immediately initiating transmission of the second alarm signal to user device <b>20</b> and sending a shut-off signal S<b>3</b> to valve controller <b>14</b>. Additionally, it should be understood that once the manual input has been received by leak sensor <b>12</b> (step <b>112</b>), leak sensor <b>12</b> does not immediately need to return to the sensing mode of step <b>100</b>; i.e., a pre-set &#x201c;lockout&#x201d; time may be programmed, allowing the user to program a time interval between manual silencing of local alarm <b>42</b> and returning to the sensing mode of step <b>100</b>. During this period, leak sensor is &#x201c;locked out&#x201d; and does not sense the presence of liquids. This programmable interval may be used in situations when the sensed area is wet but not due to a leak, such as during cleaning, for example.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It should be further understood that leak sensor <b>12</b> may be used in combination with any other desired components and features associated with wireless sensor networks. For example, leak sensor <b>12</b> may include a locator device, allowing a local user to easily find leak sensor <b>12</b> by initiation of a locating signal. Further, leak sensor <b>12</b> may be mounted in a desired area by insertion into a base or holster, allowing for simultaneous mounting and powering/charging of leak sensor <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition to the basic operation of system <b>10</b> described above, it should be understood that system <b>10</b> may be programmed to perform a wide variety of different operations. As an example, valve controller <b>14</b>, either on its own or under the control of base station <b>16</b>, may be programmed for scheduled valve cycling operations (to prevent &#x201c;freezing&#x201d; or sticking of the valve, for example). Valve controller <b>14</b> may be self-programmable, manually operable and/or controlled by base station <b>16</b> and/or leak sensor <b>12</b>. As a further example, leak sensor <b>12</b> may be programmed to operate in a test mode, allowing the operation of timer <b>28</b> to be tested, but without initiation of an external alarm and/or a valve shut-off. Further, since system <b>10</b> operates as a wireless sensor network, system <b>10</b> may be operated in a data gathering mode, allowing for network communication testing.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As described above, a group of leak sensors may be used. In the alternative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a group of leak sensors <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b</i>, <b>412</b><i>c</i>, <b>412</b><i>d</i>, <b>412</b><i>e </i>is defined such that a threshold number of the leak sensors in the group may be selected for generating a shut-off signal for at least one valve associated with the group. It should be understood that the five leak sensors <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b</i>, <b>412</b><i>c</i>, <b>412</b><i>d</i>, <b>412</b><i>e </i>defining the group in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> are show for purposes of illustration and simplification only. As a practical, though non-limiting example, a group of 15 leak sensors may be used. In this non-limiting example, the user may select a minimum threshold of five. Thus, in order for at least one valve associated with the group to be shut off automatically, five of the leak sensors of the group will all have to detect a leak. It should be understood that the threshold may be set to one, thus requiring only a single leak sensor to detect the leak in order to automatically shut off the at least one valve. Similarly, a threshold value equal to the total number of leak sensors in the group may be selected, requiring all leak sensors in the group to detect the leak before the at least one valve is shut off automatically.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In use, after the user sets the threshold number of leak sensors in the group of leak sensors, and upon detection of a leak by a number of leak sensors of the group (where the number may equal one or more), a determination is made whether or not the number of the leak sensors making the detection is equal to or greater than the threshold number of the leak sensors in the group. If the number of detecting leak sensors is equal to or greater than the threshold number of the leak sensors in the group of leak sensors, then at least one valve associated with the group of leak sensors is shut off.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The determination may be made control logic operating within any suitable component of the system, including but not limited to, a controller associated with at least one valve controller <b>14</b>, similar to the valve controller described above, internal controllers associated with each leak sensor <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b</i>, <b>412</b><i>c</i>, <b>412</b><i>d</i>, <b>412</b><i>e</i>, communicating with one another, within a controller associated with a communication hub <b>422</b> linking the leak sensors <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b</i>, <b>412</b><i>c</i>, <b>412</b><i>d</i>, <b>412</b><i>e</i>, or within a controller associated with the base station <b>16</b>. Similarly, the control signal to actuate the valve controller <b>14</b> to shut off the at least one valve associated therewith may be generated within the valve controller <b>14</b> itself, or may be wirelessly transmitted thereto from the hub <b>422</b>, the base station <b>16</b> or one or more of the leak sensors <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b</i>, <b>412</b><i>c</i>, <b>412</b><i>d</i>, <b>412</b><i>e. </i></p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be understood that the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, as described above, may operate as a stand-alone system for automatically shutting off at least one valve dependent upon a preset number of leak sensors detecting a leak, or it may be incorporated into the previous embodiment; i.e., upon detection of a leak by at least one leak sensor of the group, a local alarm, such as an audible alarm or the like, is initiated. Additionally, at the time of detection, a first time is recorded.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A first alarm signal is transmitted from the at least one leak sensor to the base station <b>16</b> (either directly from the leak sensor(s) <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b</i>, <b>412</b><i>c</i>, <b>412</b><i>d</i>, <b>412</b><i>e </i>or through hub <b>422</b>). The first alarm signal includes data representative of the recorded first time. If manual input is not received by the at least one leak sensor within a pre-set time threshold measured from the first time, then the base station <b>16</b> transmits a second alarm signal to the at least one external device <b>20</b>, and if the number of leak sensors of the group is equal to or greater than the threshold number of the leak sensors in the group, then a shut-off signal is wirelessly transmitted from the base station <b>16</b> to the valve controller <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">It is to be understood that the system and method for wireless water leak detection is not limited to the specific embodiments described above, but encompasses any and all embodiments within the scope of the generic language of the following claims enabled by the embodiments described herein, or otherwise shown in the drawings or described above in terms sufficient to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the claimed subject matter.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
