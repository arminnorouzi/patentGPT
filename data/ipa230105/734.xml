To that end, an anti-aging treatment must act on the maintenance, stimulation and more effective regulation of the production of substances that constitute the skin, more intense cell renewal, recovery of natural moisturization combined with a stronger prevention against the main aggression mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0047">Existing products take care of only a few specific points,

In this case, heating of the aqueous phase was started in the main container to the temperature of about 75 and about 80 &#xb0; C. and, with stirring, the oily phase was added under stirring for about 10 minutes. Thereafter the cooling phase was started by adding an aqueous phase with a polymer neutralizing agent.
