aspects of example embodiments of the invention. It is to be understood that the drawings are diagrammatic and schematic representations of such example embodiments, and are not limiting of the present invention, nor are they necessarily drawn to scale.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The present disclosure generally relates to optoelectronic modules. In particular, some embodiments relate to optoelectronic modules configured to receive and engage with a plurality of fiber optic cables each having its own connector. Although various embodiments are described in the context of optoelectronic modules used in the field of optical networking, the embodiments disclosed herein may be employed in other fields or operating environments where the functionality disclosed herein may be useful. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should not be construed to be limited to the example implementations and operating environments disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, there is illustrated an example embodiment of an optoelectronic module <b>100</b>. As illustrated, optoelectronic module <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>102</b> that extends along a longitudinal axis L of optoelectronic module <b>100</b> between a first end <b>104</b> and a second end <b>106</b> of optoelectronic module <b>100</b>. Housing <b>102</b> includes a first portion <b>108</b> and a second portion <b>110</b> which are configured to engage with one another in order to house a number of components of optoelectronic module <b>100</b>. First end <b>104</b> of optoelectronic module <b>100</b> is configured to interface with a fiber optic cable <b>1300</b> including one or more optical fibers. Similarly, in the illustrated configuration, fiber optic cable <b>1300</b> is releasably connected to first end <b>104</b> and extends in line with longitudinal axis L. In the illustrated form where fiber optic cable <b>1300</b> is releasably connected to optoelectronic module <b>100</b>, optoelectronic module <b>100</b> may function as a stand-alone module. However, optoelectronic module <b>100</b> may be permanently attached to fiber optic cable <b>1300</b>, and thus optoelectronic module <b>100</b> represents one end of an &#x201c;active cable&#x201d; which may include another optoelectronic module permanently attached to the other end of fiber optic cable <b>1300</b>. In some embodiments, fiber optic cable <b>1300</b> is a multichannel fiber-optic communication cable that includes two fibers, one of which is employed to transfer data signals in one direction, and the other of which is employed to transfer data signals in the opposite direction.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">While only a single fiber optic cable <b>1300</b> is releasably connected with optoelectronic module <b>100</b> in the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, up to four separate fiber optic cables <b>1300</b> may be releasably connected with optoelectronic module <b>100</b>. Embodiments of optoelectronic module <b>100</b> where it may be releasably connected to more than four, or less than four, separate fiber optic cables <b>1300</b> are contemplated. Optoelectronic module <b>100</b> may also be used with less than the total maximum possible number of fiber optic cables <b>1300</b> connected therewith. For example, optoelectronic module <b>100</b> could be used with one, two or three fiber optic cables <b>1300</b> connected thereto.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further details of fiber optic cable <b>1300</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>. More specifically, fiber optic cable <b>1300</b> includes a connector <b>1302</b> configured to be at least partially positioned in first end <b>104</b> of housing <b>102</b> of optoelectronic module <b>100</b>. Connector <b>1302</b> extends between a first end <b>1304</b> and a second end <b>1306</b> and includes a pair of oppositely positioned tabs <b>1308</b> and <b>1310</b> which, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, are offset from one another. Tabs <b>1308</b> and <b>1310</b> are configured to be received in corresponding slots on housing <b>102</b> in order to guide engagement of connector <b>1302</b> with optoelectronic module <b>100</b>, further details of which will be provided below. Connector <b>1302</b> also includes a pair of oppositely positioned receptacles <b>1312</b> and <b>1314</b> positioned between tabs <b>1308</b> and <b>1310</b> and second end <b>1306</b>. Receptacles <b>1312</b> and <b>1314</b> are configured to receive a portion of optoelectronic module <b>100</b> in order to releasably connect fiber optic cable <b>1300</b> with optoelectronic module <b>100</b>. Further details of this arrangement will also be discussed below. Connector <b>1302</b> further includes a pair of ferrules <b>1316</b>, <b>1318</b> which extend beyond second end <b>1306</b> and are configured to be received in a corresponding receptacle of optoelectronic module <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Optoelectronic module <b>100</b> may be configured for optical signal transmission and reception at a variety of per-second data rates including, but not limited to, 150 gigabits per second (Gb/s) or higher. In addition, although the example optoelectronic module <b>100</b> is configured to be substantially compliant with the CXP multisource agreement (MSA), optoelectronic module <b>100</b> can instead be configured to assume a variety of different form factors that are substantially compliant with various transceiver or transponder MSAs including, but not limited to, C form-factor pluggable (CFP), small form factor (SFF), small form-factor pluggable (SFP), 10 Gigabit small form factor pluggable (XFP), XPAK, X2, XENPAK, or quad small form-factor pluggable (QSFP).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Optoelectronic module <b>100</b> may be designed to be plugged into a larger electronic system such as a PCB of a host device or the like. For example, optoelectronic module <b>100</b> may include a latching mechanism with a handle that may be operated to fasten or release optoelectronic module <b>100</b> with respect to other components. In some configurations, the latching mechanism may include a slider operably connected to a cam and configured to cause the cam to rotate about an axis of rotation to displace an end of a latch to disengage the latch from a host receptacle. Once mounted to a host PCB, optoelectronic module <b>100</b> may be configured to communicate data between the host device and a network, for example.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an exploded view of optoelectronic module <b>100</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in addition to housing <b>102</b> which includes first portion <b>108</b> and second portion <b>110</b>, optoelectronic module <b>100</b> also includes a PCB <b>112</b>, a TOSA <b>114</b>, a ROSA <b>116</b>, and a plurality of receptacles <b>118</b> (only a few of which have been identified to preserve clarity) forming an array of receptacles having a first row <b>120</b> of receptacles <b>118</b> positioned over a second row <b>122</b> of receptacles <b>118</b>. In the illustrated form, receptacles <b>118</b> of first row <b>120</b> are optically coupled with ROSA <b>116</b> via optical fibers <b>124</b>, and receptacles <b>118</b> of row <b>122</b> are optically coupled with TOSA <b>114</b> via optical fibers <b>126</b>. Alternative forms for optically coupling TOSA <b>114</b> and ROSA <b>116</b> with receptacles <b>118</b> are also possible. TOSA <b>114</b> may include an array of transmitters and ROSA <b>116</b> may include an array of receivers. In this example, where each receptacle <b>118</b> includes an optical fiber and there are eight (8) receptacles <b>118</b>, TOSA <b>114</b> includes an array with four (4) transmitters, and ROSA <b>116</b> includes an array with four (4) receivers.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Optoelectronic module <b>100</b> may convert electrical signals to optical signals representing the electrical signals and vice versa. For example, data in the form of optical signals may be communicated from a network along fiber optic cable <b>1300</b> to optoelectronic module <b>100</b>. ROSA <b>116</b> of optoelectronic module <b>100</b> may convert the optical signals to electrical signals representative of the optical signals. The electrical signals may then be communicated to the host device. Likewise, the host device may communicate electrical signals to optoelectronic module <b>100</b>. TOSA <b>114</b> of optoelectronic module <b>100</b> may convert the electrical signals to optical signals representative of the electrical signals. The optical signals may be communicated along fiber optic cable <b>1300</b> into the network to, e.g., another optoelectronic module <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">TOSA <b>114</b> or ROSA <b>116</b> may be electrically coupled to PCB <b>112</b> with an electrical connector such as a flex circuit or other suitable electrical connector.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">PCB <b>124</b> may include an edge connector <b>127</b> that is configured to be coupled with other components, such as a host device. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> for example, edge connector <b>127</b> is positioned between first portion <b>108</b> and second portion <b>110</b> of housing <b>102</b> to provide access to edge connector <b>127</b> by the host device. Second end <b>106</b> of optoelectronic module <b>100</b> may be sized and shaped to interface with the host receptacle. In one form for example, optoelectronic module <b>100</b> may be positioned at least partially inside of the host receptacle and a latching mechanism, if present, may fasten or release optoelectronic module <b>100</b> with respect to the host receptacle.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, PCB <b>112</b> includes an end portion <b>128</b> positioned opposite of edge connector <b>127</b>. End portion <b>128</b> includes an opening <b>130</b> which separates portions <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> of PCB <b>112</b>. In the illustrated from, opening <b>130</b> has a substantially U-shaped configuration, although it may be alternatively shaped and configured in other forms.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Optoelectronic module <b>100</b> also includes retaining members <b>136</b>, <b>138</b>, a receptacle retaining member <b>141</b>, fasteners <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, and <b>146</b>, a receiving member <b>140</b> (including a plate <b>270</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref> for example), and a biasing member <b>150</b>. Further details of these and other components of optoelectronic module <b>100</b>, as well as the interaction and relationship between the components of optoelectronic module <b>100</b> will be provided in connection with the illustrations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>18</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, second portion <b>110</b> of housing <b>102</b> is shown in top and end views, respectively. Amongst other features shown, second portion <b>110</b> includes a sidewall <b>152</b> positioned opposite of a sidewall <b>154</b>. Generally speaking, sidewalls <b>152</b> and <b>154</b> extend between and terminate at opposite ends <b>153</b> and <b>155</b> of second portion <b>110</b> such that, when coupled with first portion <b>108</b> of housing <b>102</b>, first end <b>104</b> and second end <b>106</b> of housing <b>102</b> are at least partially open. Second portion <b>110</b> further includes aperture <b>156</b> structured to receive fastener <b>146</b>. A pair of bosses <b>158</b> and <b>160</b> extend from second portion <b>110</b> toward first portion <b>108</b>. Boss <b>158</b> includes an aperture <b>162</b> configured to receive fastener <b>144</b>, and boss <b>160</b> includes an aperture <b>164</b> configured to receive fastener <b>142</b>.
