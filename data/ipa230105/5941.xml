To provide improved performance and/or lower price of a semiconductor device while increasing data storage capacity of the semiconductor device, it may be advantageous to increase an integration density of the semiconductor device. An integration density of a two-dimensional (2D) or planar semiconductor device may be mainly determined by an area that a unit memory cell occupies. Therefore, the integration density of the 2D or planar semiconductor device may be affected by a technique of forming fine patterns. However, since higher-priced apparatuses may be required to former fine patterns, the integration density of 2D semiconductor devices continues to increase, but may be still limited. Thus, three-dimensional (3D) semiconductor memory devices have been developed to overcome the above limitations. 3D semiconductor memory devices may include memory cells three-dimensionally arranged.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of the inventive concepts may provide a three-dimensional (3D) semiconductor memory device with improved electrical characteristics and/or reliability, and a method of manufacturing a 3D semiconductor memory device, which is capable of reducing difficulty and/or costs of manufacturing processes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the inventive concepts may also provide an electronic system including the 3D semiconductor memory device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an aspect, a 3D semiconductor memory device may include: a substrate; a stack structure comprising interlayer dielectric layers and gate electrodes which are alternately and repeatedly stacked on the substrate; vertical channel structures penetrating the stack structure; a separation structure spaced apart from the vertical channel structures and filling a trench crossing the stack structure, the separation structure comprising a spacer covering an inner sidewall of the trench, and a first conductive contact filling an inner space of the trench surrounded by the spacer; an insulating layer covering the substrate and the stack structure; contact plugs penetrating the insulating layer so as to be connected to the gate electrodes of the stack structure; and a second conductive contact spaced apart from the stack structure and penetrating the insulating layer so as to be connected to a peripheral circuit transistor.
