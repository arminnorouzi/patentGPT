id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Since a tunable laser is used in a wide range of applications such as carrier wave light sources for optical communication, gas sensing, and machining, its required characteristics also vary, but wideness of a wavelength range that can be covered by one light source is important. Here, the meaning of the wideness of a wavelength range in gas sensing using a tunable laser will be described.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In gas sensing using a tunable laser, utilizing the fact that a gas serving as a target has a light absorption spectrum specific to the gas, the presence or absence (a concentration), a temperature, and a pressure of the gas can be measured from a spectrum of reflected or transmitted light.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">That is, by continuously performing wavelength sweeping of laser light emitted from a tunable laser, a state of a gas is detected from a light absorption intensity in the vicinity of a specific wavelength and a spectral width of an absorption curve.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">By acquiring a plurality of absorption lines at once with one wavelength sweep, more information can be obtained from a target, and thus the wideness of a wavelength range that can be covered by a tunable laser directly leads to higher functionality of a sensing device thereof.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although a method of mounting a plurality of tunable lasers having different wavelength bands on a sensing device is also conceivable, considering the costs of optical components for combining light rays emitted from different tunable lasers on the same optical path and the complexity of a control circuit for controlling a plurality of different tunable lasers, there is preferably only one laser that performs the wavelength sweep.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, in NPL 1 below, a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser that has an oscillation wavelength of a 2 &#x3bc;m band using an InP-based semiconductor for CO<sub>2 </sub>gas sensing is reported.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a structure of the DBR laser in NPL 1, a bulk (generally indicating a layer thickness of several hundred nm or more) InGaAs (indium gallium arsenide) compound semiconductor material that is lattice-matched with InP (indium phosphide) is used in a DBR region and a phase adjustment (PH) region (collectively called a tuning region), and by injecting a current into the tuning region, a refractive index of the bulk InGaAs is changed to variably control the oscillation wavelength of the DBR laser.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, in the structure in NPL 1, a structure called a strained InGaAs/InGaAs multiple quantum well (strained MQW), in which a compound semiconductor having a multilayer structure constituting a multiple quantum well (MQW), for example, InGaAs material is distorted by periodically applying compression or elongation strain in an in-plane direction of layers in a thickness direction of the multilayer structure at a thickness equal to or less than a critical film thickness of the material, is used as an optically active semiconductor material (ACT) for laser oscillation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A strained MQW is a method of realizing a structure that can be macroscopically regarded as a lattice matching system by periodically applying strain in opposite directions to each layer in a multilayer structure constituting an MQW at a film thickness equal to or less than a critical thickness, and in NPL 1, a tunable laser of a 2 &#x3bc;m band within which it is usually difficult to make InP-based semiconductors emit light (InP-based semiconductors generally have a longest light emission wavelength of about 1.65 &#x3bc;m) is realized.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Non Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">[NPL 1] Y.

It can be said that two main physical phenomena occur in a case in which a refractive index is changed by carrier injection into a semiconductor.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first is a so-called carrier plasma effect in which a group of injected free carriers (plasma) is vibrated by an optical electric field, which conversely acts on an electric field, and as a result, a permittivity and a refractive index are changed, and a change in the refractive index is proportional to a free carrier density in a material.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The second is a phenomenon called a band filling effect, which is explained in relation to light absorption derived from a band gap of a semiconductor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">That is, it is an effect obtained by a light absorption spectrum being shifted to a higher energy side due to a conduction band being filled with electrons, or a valence band being filled with holes at an electron energy level in a semiconductor due to free carriers. This means that due to the Kramers-Kronig relationship, a refractive index spectrum of a material changes as an absorption spectrum changes.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In general, a larger band filling effect is obtained when the photon energy of light having an oscillation wavelength (about 0.62 eV in the case of a 2 &#x3bc;m band) is closer to the band gap energy of a semiconductor that causes a change in the refractive index due to current injection (in the case of InGaAs in a system lattice matching with InP described above, approximately 0.73 eV). That is, in a 2 &#x3bc;m DBR laser, the bandgap energy in a tuning region is preferably close to 0.62 eV within a range in which light absorption can be reduced to a low level.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, in the sphere of Ga, As, and P-based mixed crystals, which are regarded as familiar materials from an engineering perspective, among compound semiconductors lattice-matched to InP, those having a smaller bandgap energy than InGaAs are not known.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">This means that it is difficult to improve the tuning efficiency in the range of materials that are lattice-matched to InP.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention is proposed to solve these problems. That is, it is an object of the present invention to provide a tunable laser having a higher tuning efficiency than a conventional one in a semiconductor laser having a long wavelength in consideration of a normal compound semiconductor, for example, an InP semiconductor, such as a 2 &#x3bc;m band TLD (a tunable laser).</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As described above, an optically active material having a long light emission wavelength (small bandgap energy) is obtained due to a strained MQW structure. In order to overcome the above problems, the present invention uses a material having a reduced bandgap energy in a tuning region of a tunable laser.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">An example of an

This is because an optical path length of a resonator can be adjusted by changing an amount of excitation current in an optically active region input to the ACT, but in that case, since the light output is also changed, one with the phase adjuster PH has better controllability as a tunable light source.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition, the semiconductor material of the phase adjuster PH is also a strained InGaAs/InGaAs multiple quantum well with a photoluminescence peak wavelength of 1.965 &#x3bc;m, which is the same as the semiconductor material of the DBR region described above.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows two graphs comparatively showing a relationship between an amount of current to the DBR region and an amount of shifting of a DBR reflection peak in two cases of a strained InGaAs/InGaAs multiple quantum well (a dotted line) with a photoluminescence peak wavelength of 1.965 &#x3bc;m and a strain-free InGaAs (bulk InGaAs, a solid line).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The same calculation model as in NPL 1 is used for a method for calculating an amount of change in a refractive index with respect to an amount of current injection required for an amount of wavelength shift.

Here, the calculation was made using the amount of wavelength shift in the DBR region (proportional to the amount of change in the refractive index) as an example, but since an amount of phase adjustment of a phase adjustment region PH is also proportional to the amount of change in the refractive index, an effect of improving the amount of phase adjustment is the same as that of the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows, as Example 2 of the present invention, a configuration in which an electro-absorption type light intensity modulator EAM that modulates an intensity of output laser light is integrated in the tunable laser of Example 1.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In Example 1, the amount of detuning of the InGaAs/InGaAs strained quantum well in the tuning region was set to 50 nm in order to achieve the band filling effect.

A length of the waveguide structure (EAM) to which the reverse electric field is applied is 100 &#x3bc;m. Since a size of the DBR type tunable light source is generally less than 1000 &#x3bc;m, it can be said that this EAM is sufficiently small in size when considering integration in the tunable light source.

However, as described in Example 1, when the amount of current to the ACT portion is changed, the resonator length as a resonator will change, and this causes fluctuations in the oscillation wavelength in the tunable light source, and thus it is not suitable for sensing that uses the oscillation wavelength.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, it is also possible to modulate the light output by integrating an optical semiconductor amplifier SOA that amplifies the light output with the output of the semiconductor laser and changing the amount of current to the SOA.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">However, since this method dynamically modulates the amount of current to the SOA, heat generated from the SOA portion also fluctuates periodically.
