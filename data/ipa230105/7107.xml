instant disclosure generally relate to an electronic device including an antenna.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electronic devices have gradually become smaller and slimmer, while the functions thereof have gradually increased. As electronic devices become smaller and slimmer, metal material (e.g., conductive part) of the electronic devices may be used for the purpose of reinforcing rigidity and/or used to implement a predetermined function (e.g., serving as an antenna). Since the use of such a metal material increases production cost and may cause constraints in design, a frame member made of a material different from the metal material may be applied to the electronic device along with the metal material.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An electronic device may include a housing structure for providing a space for accommodating electronic components. The housing structure may include a first plate, a second plate facing away from the first plate, and a side member disposed to surround a space between the first plate and the second plate. The side member may include a support member extending at least partially into the internal space of the electronic device. At least a portion of the side member may be made of a metallic material (which may be referred to as a conductive part, a conductive member, or a conductive material) to reinforce the rigidity of the electronic device and/or used to implement a predetermined function (e.g., serving as an antenna), and the remaining portion may be made of a polymer material (which may be referred to as a non-conductive part, a non-conductive member, or a non-conductive material), and the remaining portion may be combined with the metal material.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The electronic device may include a frame member made of a different material that forms at least a portion of the exterior (e.g., the side surface) of the electronic device by being coupled to at least a portion of the side member. The frame member may be formed of a ferroelectric ceramic material. The electronic device may include at least one antenna for transmitting or receiving wireless signals using at least a portion of the metal material disposed on the side member. Meanwhile, since it may be difficult to bond the ceramic frame member to the metallic portion of the antenna and/or the side member, the frame member may be bonded to the side member through injection molding that molds a polymer material and another injection-molded material. In this case, the antenna may be disposed between the polymer material and the frame member via the injection-molded material while being at least partially supported by the polymer material.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, when the antenna located between the side member and the frame member is disposed adjacent to a conductive structure (e.g., display) disposed in the internal space of the electronic device, its radiation performance may be degraded.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an embodiment, an electronic device may include a side member including a conductive part and a first non-conductive part, a frame member disposed on at least a portion of the side member to be at least partially visible from an exterior of the electronic device, a second non-conductive part disposed between the frame member and the first non-conductive part, at least one conductive member disposed between the second non-conductive part and the first non-conductive part, at least one conductive structure disposed near the at least one conductive member in an internal space of the electronic device, and a wireless communication circuit disposed in the internal space and configured to transmit or receive a wireless signal in at least one predetermined frequency band via the at least one conductive member, wherein the at least one conductive member includes at least one stepped portion so that at least a portion of the at least one conductive member may be disposed in a direction away from the at least one conductive structure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an embodiment of the disclosure, it is possible to provide an electronic device having an antenna arrangement structure configured to reduce the degradation of radiation performance.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to certain embodiments, it is possible to provide an electronic device having an antenna arrangement structure that is capable of helping to reinforce rigidity while suppressing the degradation of radiation performance of the antenna.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the problems to be solved in the disclosure are not limited to the above-mentioned problems, and may be variously expanded without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The electronic device according to certain embodiments of the disclosure includes an antenna arrangement structure that provides sufficient separation distance from a conductive structure disposed in the internal space of

According to an embodiment, the electronic device <b>101</b> may communicate with the electronic device <b>104</b> via the server <b>108</b>. According to an embodiment, the electronic device <b>101</b> may include a processor <b>120</b>, memory <b>130</b>, an input module <b>150</b>, a sound output module <b>155</b>, a display module <b>160</b>, an audio module <b>170</b>, a sensor module <b>176</b>, an interface <b>177</b>, a connecting terminal <b>178</b>, a haptic module <b>179</b>, a camera module <b>180</b>, a power management module <b>188</b>, a battery <b>189</b>, a communication module <b>190</b>, a subscriber identification module (SIM) <b>196</b>, or an antenna module <b>197</b>. In various embodiments, at least one of the components (e.g., the connecting terminal <b>178</b>) may be omitted from the electronic device <b>101</b>, or one or more other components may be added in the electronic device <b>101</b>. In various embodiments, some of the components (e.g., the sensor module <b>176</b>, the camera module <b>180</b>, or the antenna module <b>197</b>) may be implemented as a single component (e.g., the display module <b>160</b>).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The processor <b>120</b> may execute, for example, software (e.g., a program <b>140</b>) to control at least one other component (e.g., a hardware or software component) of the electronic device <b>101</b> coupled with the processor <b>120</b>, and may perform various data processing or computation.
