Two test steps, i.e. wafer inspection and function test (FT), are required to be carried out respectively in these two links. When various function indexes of a chip are tested in these two steps, it is required to connect the chip into a test circuit. Therefore, a fixing system or device for the chip is needed, so that pins of the chip can be in stable contact with the test circuit and, in particular, it can be ensured that the chip can be in good contact with needles of the test circuit in a vertical direction. Since overall package dimensions of various types of chips are different, if a fixing device is customized for each overall package dimension of chips, costs will be greatly increased. Therefore, a fixing device which can customize adjusted dimensions is needed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the large-scale popularization of BGA (Ball Grid Array Package), BGA-based chips have been widely adopted. Solder balls are used in BGA chips instead of pins. Because the solder balls will expand during a high-temperature test, if a fixing device for chips is unable to adaptively adjust a fixing position according to an expansion stress of the solder balls, the solder balls will be forcibly pressed to deform, and as a result, other tests will be affected. A technical solution in a prior art is still unable to solve the technical problem on how to fix a chip when solder balls are deformed in a high-temperature test.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present application can accurately position and fix a to-be-tested chip in a horizontal direction and a vertical direction respectively, be applied to chips with different sizes and thicknesses and at least prevent solder balls on the chip from being damaged.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to some embodiments, a first aspect of the present application provides a fixing device for chip test, which includes: a carrier with a fixing chamber for fixing a to-be-tested chip formed inside, a plurality of adjustors being disposed on sidewalls of the fixing chamber and configured to be extended or retracted to adjust a position of the to-be-tested chip in two orthogonal directions within a horizontal plane; and a top cover configured to cooperate with the carrier to fix the to-be-tested chip in a vertical direction, wherein at least one adjustable pressing cover is disposed at a lower end of the top cover, so as to autonomously adjust a pressing force applied to the to-be-tested chip by the pressing cover in the vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to some embodiments, a second aspect of the present application provides a chip tester adopting the fixing device for chip test according to the first aspect, including: a test board, a test circuit including needles being disposed on the test board; and the fixing device for chip test fixing a to-be-tested chip on an upper surface of the test circuit, so that solder balls of the to-be-tested chip are in contact with the needles.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to some embodiments, a third aspect of the present application provides a fixing method for chip test adopting the fixing device for chip test according to the first aspect, including the following steps: (Step S<b>1</b>) adjusting each adjustor <b>3</b> to a maximum scale position; (Step S<b>2</b>) determining adjusting travels of the adjustors <b>3</b> in an X direction and a Y direction according to a size of a to-be-tested chip and scale information; (Step S<b>3</b>) putting the to-be-tested chip into the fixing chamber <b>2</b> of the carrier <b>1</b>; (Step S<b>4</b>) adjusting the adjustors <b>3</b> to predetermined positions according to the determined adjusting travels to fix the to-be-tested chip in a horizontal direction; (Step S<b>5</b>) placing the top cover <b>4</b> onto the carrier <b>1</b>, so that the pressing cover <b>5</b> presses the to-be-tested chip to fix the to-be-tested chip in a vertical direction.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to more clearly illustrate the technical solutions in embodiments of the present application or a prior art, the accompanying drawings required to be used in the description of the embodiments will be briefly introduced below.

It should be understood that these descriptions are merely exemplary rather than intended to limit the scope of the present application.

These drawings are not drawn to scale. For the sake of clarity, some details are amplified, and some details may be omitted. The shapes of various regions and layers and the relative size and position relationships between them shown in the drawings are merely exemplary, and may have errors to some extent in practice due to manufacturing tolerances or technical limitations, and those skilled in the art can additionally design regions/layers with different shapes, sizes and relative positions.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Apparently, the embodiments described are part of the embodiments of the present application rather than all the embodiments. All other embodiments which are obtained by those of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments in the present application without creative efforts shall fall within the protection scope of the present application. The present application will be described in more detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In every accompanying drawing, the identical elements are represented by the similar reference numerals. For clarity, each portion in the accompanying drawings is not drawn to scale.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The purpose of a fixing device for chip test is to fix a position of a chip from three spatial dimensions to fix the chip in a test circuit and, by setting and adjusting fixed dimensions in the three spatial dimensions, support chips with various overall package dimensions. One the one hand, the fixing device for chip test according to an embodiment of the present application can fix chips with different packages and different numbers of solder balls or with an equal number of solder balls but different overall package dimensions in a horizontal fixing direction by means of a carrier for devices with different dimensional specifications, avoiding resource waste and a complex test process, which is favorable for the reduction of cost. On the other hand, in a vertical fixing direction, a pressing cover for fixing the carrier according to the embodiment of the present application has an autonomously adjustable space. During a high-temperature test, solder balls will expand or soften, and the pressing cover capable of autonomously adjusting a pressing force can prevent the solder balls from being in excessive contact with needles to deform, so that other tests will not be affected and it can be ensured that the solder balls will not be injured. Moreover, when chips with different thicknesses are tested based on the fixing device for chip test according to the embodiment of the present application, not only can adjustment be performed by increasing or decreasing a spacer number of the pressing cover, but also operation is simple and test cost is low. In addition, the fixing device for chip test and a chip tester according to the embodiments of the present application avoid the use of an overhead crossbeam structure in dimensional adjustment. Therefore, a pressing function of the pressing cover on a chip will not be severely affected, and thereby, the problem of contact between solder balls and the needles of the test circuit during a test can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a fixing device for chip test according to an embodiment of the present application.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the fixing device for chip test according to the embodiment of the present application mainly includes a carrier <b>1</b> for fixing a chip in a horizontal direction and a top cover <b>4</b> for fixing the chip in a vertical direction. The to-be-tested chip is accurately and reliably fixed in the horizontal and vertical directions through the cooperation between the carrier <b>1</b> and the top cover <b>4</b>, ensuring that a plurality of solder balls on the to-be-tested chip can be in accurate contact with a plurality of needles of a test circuit, without damaging the to-be-tested chip.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A fixing chamber <b>2</b> for accommodating and fixing the chip is formed in the carrier <b>1</b> according to the embodiment of the present application, and a plurality of adjustors <b>3</b> are disposed on sidewalls of the fixing chamber <b>2</b> and configured to be extended or retracted to adjust a position of the chip in two orthogonal directions in the horizontal plane. The adjustors <b>3</b> are distributed in the two orthogonal directions (the X and Y directions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in the horizontal direction, and are arranged to be extended or retracted for adjustment along the X and Y directions respectively, thus positioning and fixing the to-be-tested chip in the horizontal direction. Since the adjustors <b>3</b> can be extended or retracted for adjustment along the X and Y directions, chips with different overall package dimensions can be fixed in the fixing chamber <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The top cover <b>4</b> according to the embodiment of the present application is configured to cooperate with the carrier <b>1</b> to fix the chip in the vertical direction (the Z direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). At least one adjustable pressing cover <b>5</b> is disposed at the lower end of the top cover <b>4</b>, and is configured to autonomously adjust a pressing force applied to the chip by the pressing cover <b>5</b> in the vertical direction. The pressing cover <b>5</b> is detachably fixed to the top cover <b>4</b> at a position corresponding to the chip. Optionally, the pressing cover <b>5</b> is arranged as an adjustable pressing cover, so that the pressing force applied to the chip by the pressing cover can be autonomously adjusted in the vertical direction in order to adapt to chips with different thicknesses and prevent the solder balls on the chip from being injured. On the one hand, the adjustable pressing cover <b>5</b> can fix chips with different thicknesses, and on the other hand, when a stress of the solder balls of the chip changes, the adjustable pressing cover can be adjusted along the vertical direction to avoid the problem that the solder balls are pressed to deform.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an alternative embodiment, the plurality of adjustors <b>3</b> are respectively formed on four sidewalls of the fixing chamber <b>2</b> and symmetrically distributed in the two orthogonal directions within a horizontal plane. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the adjustors <b>3</b> are disposed on the carrier <b>1</b> at symmetrical positions along the X and Y directions. Thus, when the adjustors <b>3</b> fix the to-be-tested chip, the to-be-tested chip can be uniformly stressed, avoiding the deflection of the stress of the to-be-tested chip, so that the position of the to-be-tested chip will not be skewed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, two adjustors <b>3</b> are respectively disposed in the X and Y directions. It should be noted that the purpose of fixing can be achieved by disposing one adjustor <b>3</b> in each direction and that stable positioning can be achieved by disposing more than two adjustors <b>3</b> in the X and Y directions. However, since dimensions of the to-be-tested chip in the X and Y directions are several times those of the adjustors <b>3</b>, at this point, the positioning strategy adopting a plurality of adjustors <b>3</b> can enhance the stability of the to-be-tested chip fixed by the adjustors <b>3</b>. The disposition of the adjustors <b>3</b> in the two orthogonal directions of the fixing chamber <b>2</b> has already achieved the technical effect of fixing the to-be-tested chip within the horizontal plane. In order to enable the to-be-tested chip to be uniformly stressed, the adjustors <b>3</b> are disposed in X-axis and Y-axis directions and opposite directions, and the plurality of adjustors <b>3</b> are respectively formed on the four side walls of the fixing chamber <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic enlarged diagram of the adjustor in the fixing device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in order to benefit the change of travels of the adjustors <b>3</b>, each adjustor <b>3</b> includes an adjusting plate <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> and an adjusting knob <b>8</b>, with the adjusting knob <b>8</b> disposed outside the carrier <b>1</b>, and each adjusting plate <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> is extended or retracted for adjustment by means of the adjusting knob <b>8</b> connected thereto. Optionally, the adjusting knob <b>8</b> is of a threaded structure. In the process of rotation, travels of the adjusting knobs <b>8</b> are changed in the X and Y directions, so that the travels of the adjustors <b>3</b> are changed.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an alternative embodiment, the adjustor <b>3</b> is made of a plastic polymer. Exemplarily, a diameter of the adjustor <b>3</b> is 3 mm to 5 mm, and a side thickness of the to-be-tested chip is generally about 1 mm to 3 mm, so the adjustors <b>3</b> can effectively clamp the to-be-tested chip.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, a brim of the fixing chamber <b>2</b> on the carrier <b>1</b> is provided with length scales. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the brim of the fixing chamber <b>2</b> is provided with graduations. Directions of the length scales are the same as the distribution directions of the adjustors <b>3</b>, i.e., the X-axis and Y-axis directions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A zero point of the X-axis and Y-axis directions is center coordinates of the fixing chamber <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Firstly, the graduations can visually indicate actual dimensions of the fixing chamber <b>2</b>, so that maximum overall chip package dimensions which can be supported by the fixing device can be clearly marked out. More importantly, a quantitative reference is provided for the adjustment of the travels of the adjustor <b>3</b>. For chips with equal overall package dimensions, the travels of the adjustors <b>3</b> are equal. It should be noted that the adjustors <b>3</b> fix the to-be-tested chip in two dimensions of the horizontal plane, so fixing directions may be orthogonal. The fixing chamber <b>2</b> and the adjustors <b>3</b> ensure that pins or solder balls of the to-be-tested chip are aligned with contact points of the test circuit in the horizontal plane.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Exemplarily, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the directions of the X axis and the Y axis are two orthogonal directions of the carrier <b>1</b> in the horizontal plane. Dimensions of the fixing chamber <b>2</b> are upper limits of dimensions of to-be-tested chips. That is, only when dimensions of a to-be-tested chip are less than those of the fixing chamber <b>2</b> can the to-be-tested chip be placed in the fixing chamber <b>2</b>. Maximum travels of the adjustors <b>3</b> in the fixing chamber <b>2</b> define lower limits of dimensions of to-be-tested chips. That is, only when the lower limits of dimensions of a to-be-tested chip are greater than the dimensions of the fixing chamber <b>2</b> minus the maximum travels of the adjustors <b>3</b> can the to-be-tested chip be fixed in the fixing chamber <b>2</b>. Therefore, the maximum travels of the fixing chamber <b>2</b> and the adjustors <b>3</b> depend on overall package dimensions of a chip required to be supported by the fixing device for chip test. For example, the overall package dimensions of the chip are (7-10)*(9-12) mm. If the fixing chamber <b>2</b> has a maximum dimension of, for example, 12 mm in the X direction and a maximum dimension of, for example, 14 mm in the Y direction, the two types of chips mentioned above can be fixed.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Exemplarily, when the upper limits and lower limits of the dimensions of the to-be-tested chip are within a range supported by the fixing device, the fixing device can be adjusted in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction to fix the to-be-tested chip.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">During adjustment in the horizontal direction, adjusting travels of the adjustors <b>3</b> in the X and Y directions are first determined according to the overall package dimensions of the to-be-tested chip. Exemplarily, if the overall package dimensions of the chip are a*b, the maximum dimension of the fixing chamber <b>2</b> in the X direction is A and the maximum dimension of the fixing chamber <b>2</b> in the Y direction is B, then an overall adjusting travel of the adjustors <b>3</b> in the X direction is A-a and an overall adjusting travel of the adjustors <b>3</b> in the Y direction is B-b, Afterwards, the adjustors <b>3</b> are adjusted in the X and Y directions with reference to the length scales on the brim of the fixing chamber <b>2</b>, so that the travels of the adjustors <b>3</b> respectively reach A-a and B-b.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It should be noted that the fixing chamber <b>2</b> has a symmetrical structure in the X and Y directions, so does the shape of the to-be-tested chip in the X and Y directions. In an alternative embodiment, the adjustors <b>3</b> are distributed on the four sidewalls of the fixing chamber <b>2</b>, and are symmetrically distributed in the orthogonal directions in the horizontal plane. In a specific embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an equal number of adjustors <b>3</b> are disposed in every direction. Exemplarily, a distance between the adjusting plates of each two adjustors <b>3</b> in the X direction is, for example, 6 mm to 7 mm, and a distance between the adjusting plates of each two adjustors <b>3</b> in the Y direction is, for example, 7 mm to 8 mm. The adjustors <b>3</b> are symmetrically distributed in the orthogonal directions in the horizontal plane. In order to achieve the purpose that a center of the to-be-tested chip coincides with a center of the fixing chamber <b>2</b>, the adjusting travels of the adjustors <b>3</b> in the X and Y directions and the X and Y opposite directions are set to be equal, that is, the adjusting travels of the adjustors <b>3</b> in the X direction toward the fixing chamber <b>2</b> are equal. Exemplarily, the travels of the adjustors <b>3</b> in the X direction is (A&#x2212;a)/2, and the travels of the adjustors <b>3</b> in the Y direction is (B&#x2212;b)/2. According to a symmetrical adjustment mode of such adjustors <b>3</b>, the center of the chip coincides with the origin (the center of the fixing chamber <b>2</b>) of the length scales.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">During adjustment in the vertical direction, the top cover <b>4</b> is fixedly connected to the carrier <b>1</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the pressing cover <b>5</b> is connected to the top cover <b>4</b> through screws. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the pressing cover <b>5</b> and the top cover <b>4</b> are fixedly connected in the vertical direction through screws. After the fixed connection, the pressing cover <b>5</b> generates a pre-tightening force on the to-be-tested chip through a spacer <b>6</b>, so that the solder balls of the to-be-tested chip are in stable contact with the test circuit. Since the pressing cover <b>5</b> is an adjustable pressing cover, the pre-tightening force generated on the spacer <b>6</b> can change with an expansion stress of the solder balls. Optionally, when a plurality of pressing covers <b>5</b> are connected to the top cover <b>4</b>, the plurality of pressing covers <b>5</b> have equal dimensions, so the spacers <b>6</b> under the plurality of pressing covers <b>5</b> are within a same horizontal plane. Therefore, every pressing cover <b>5</b> applies an equal pressure to the to-be-tested chip.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">It should be noted that since the adjustors <b>3</b> are distributed in the two orthogonal directions in the horizontal direction and can be extended or retracted for adjustment along the orthogonal directions, the technical problem on how to fix the to-be-tested chip in the horizontal plane is solved; and since the adjustors <b>3</b> have the function of telescopic adjustment, chips with different overall package dimensions can be two-dimensionally fixed within the horizontal plane. The fixing of the to-be-tested chip in the vertical direction is implemented by arranging the pressing cover <b>5</b>. Since the pressing cover <b>5</b> is an adjustable pressing cover, when the solder balls of the to-be-tested chip expand, the pressing cover <b>5</b> will be adjusted in the vertical direction, without increasing or decreasing the spacer number of the pressing cover to adapt to chips with different thicknesses, thus preventing the technical problem of deformation of the solder balls caused by excessive contact between the solder balls and the needles and omitting a complex test process. In addition, because the carrier <b>1</b> has no crossbeam structure, the pressing function of the pressing cover <b>5</b> on the chip will not be affected.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is another schematic diagram of structures of the top cover and the pressing cover in the fixing device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in an alternative embodiment of the present application, each pressing cover <b>5</b> is provided with one or more movable spacers <b>6</b>, and the position of the pressed chip in the vertical direction and the pressing force are adjusted by adjusting the number of the movable spacers <b>6</b>. Therefore, chips with different thicknesses can be fixed by increasing or decreasing the number of the movable spacers <b>6</b>. In addition, in some embodiments, the movable spacer <b>6</b> is formed as an elastic body, and the movable spacer <b>6</b> is compressed into different sizes when to-be-tested chips with different dimensions are fixed. The movable spacer <b>6</b> is compressed into different sizes according to the expansion stress of the solder balls of the to-be-tested chip.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of the pressing cover in the fixing device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an alternative embodiment, one or more spacers <b>6</b> are detachably connected to each pressing cover <b>5</b>. The spacer <b>6</b> is between the pressing cover <b>5</b> and the to-be-tested chip, preventing stress from being concentrated on the to-be-tested chip by the pressing cover <b>5</b>, so that the to-be-tested chip is uniformly stressed.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In another alternative embodiment of the present application, each pressing cover <b>5</b> is arranged as an elastic pressing cover, so that the pressing force applied to chips by the pressing cover <b>5</b> can be elastically adjusted autonomously. Optionally, for example, each pressing cover <b>5</b> is connected to the corresponding spacer <b>6</b> through a plurality of elastic bodies <b>7</b>. Thus, when the pressing force is applied to chips in the vertical direction by the pressing cover <b>5</b>, the elastic bodies <b>7</b> can be flexibly stretched or compressed according to the chips with different thicknesses and solder balls with different thermal expansion degrees on the chips, and thereby the pressing force applied to the chips can be autonomously adjusted. In the embodiments of the present application, the elastic body <b>7</b> is, for example, a spring, elastic rubber, silica gel or other materials. Exemplarily, an initial length of the elastic body <b>7</b> is L. After the to-be-tested chip is fixed, a pressure is generated between the elastic body <b>7</b> and the to-be-tested chip, and the length of the elastic body <b>7</b> is compressed to L<sub>1</sub>. When the solder balls of the to-be-tested chip generate an expansion stress due to high temperature, the length of the elastic body <b>7</b> is compressed to L<sub>2</sub>, wherein L&#x3e;L<sub>1</sub>&#x3e;L<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an alternative embodiment, each pressing cover <b>5</b> is provided with a plurality of retaining grooves in the vertical direction, and each spacer <b>6</b> is provided with a plurality of pins <b>9</b> at positions corresponding to the retaining grooves, with each pin <b>9</b> inserted into the corresponding retaining groove on the pressing cover <b>5</b>. Since the pins <b>9</b> on the spacer <b>6</b> are inserted into the retaining grooves on the pressing cover <b>5</b>, when the elastic bodies <b>7</b> are stretched or compressed for adjustment in the vertical direction, the pins <b>9</b> limit the motion of the spacer in the horizontal direction. That is, the spacer <b>6</b> only moves in the vertical direction and cannot be skewed in the horizontal direction, and consequently, the spacer <b>6</b> will not be skewed due to a difference in elastic coefficients of the elastic bodies <b>7</b> or a non-uniform expansion stress of the solder balls. The pressing force of the pressing cover <b>5</b> can be vertically applied to the chip without deflection.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an alternative embodiment, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, four corners of the pressing cover <b>5</b> are respectively provided with a retaining groove, and four corners of each spacer <b>6</b> are respectively provided with a pin <b>9</b> correspondingly. It should be noted that the pins at the four corners are in a symmetrical and parallel state, which better helps to counteract a torque in the horizontal direction, thus better preventing the skew of the spacer <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the elastic bodies <b>7</b> are disposed between the pressing cover <b>5</b> and the spacer <b>6</b>, and the pressing cover <b>5</b> is configured to fix the to-be-tested chip in the vertical direction, ensuring that the pins or solder balls of the to-be-tested chip are in good contact with the contact points of the test circuit in the vertical direction. The melting point of solder is 183&#xb0; C., but an ambient temperature required by the high-temperature chip test even reaches 150&#xb0; C. In this environment, solder balls of a BGA chip will produce an expansion stress. If the pressing cover <b>5</b> cannot adjust the fixed position in the vertical direction as the expansion stress is produced, then the to-be-tested chip will be forcibly squeezed to cause the deformation of the solder balls, thus affecting other tests of the chip. Therefore, according to the present embodiment, since the spacer <b>6</b> and the elastic bodies <b>7</b> are disposed under the pressing cover <b>5</b>, the spacer <b>6</b> is in direct contact with the to-be-tested chip, so that a uniform pressure is applied to the to-be-tested chip, while the elastic bodies <b>7</b> can be automatically stretched or compressed for adjustment according to the expansion stress of the solder balls of the chip, that is, the elastic bodies <b>7</b> are compressed when the solder balls expand or stretched when the solder balls do not expand, thus preventing the solder balls from being squeezed to deform.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is another schematic diagram of the carrier of the fixing device for chip test according to the embodiment of the present application.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an alternative embodiment, the adjustors <b>3</b> are elastic parts.
