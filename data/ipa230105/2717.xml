Dec. 2019, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference it its entirety for all purposes.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method of changing culture medium of a suspension culture, the suspension culture comprising cells suspended in the culture medium.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and other adherent cells are traditionally cultivated and expanded in static cell culture vessels (&#x201c;2D culture&#x201d;). Due to their adherent properties, this form of cultivation allows an easy medium change: used medium is removed, while the adherent cells remain on the surface of the cell culture vessel. However, 2D culture is only scalable and automated to a limited extent, which results in a high manual and cost-intensive workload, for example to produce the large number of cells for clinical therapies and commercial therapeutic cell products under GMP conditions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">With regard to commercial bioprocess development, the cultivation in suspension culture in stirred bioreactors is an attractive alternative to traditional 2D culture. E.g., the cultivation of iPSC in suspension in the form of iPSC aggregates (&#x201c;3D culture&#x201d;) has been described several times in the literature (Olmer et al. 2012; Kwok et al. 2018; Amit et al. 2010). The 3D suspension culture offers the possibility to develop an efficient, reproducible and scalable bioprocess in which culture parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature can be controlled.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In contrast to traditional 2D cultivation, changing media in suspension cultures remains a challenge because the cells/cell aggregates have to be separated from the medium and retained while the used medium is removed. In bioprocessing this can be solved in the classical way by perfusion. Another possibility already described is to interrupt the stirring and sedimentation of the cells/cell aggregates, followed by the removal of the medium and the addition of fresh medium (see e.g. Kwok et al. 2018). However, prolonged interruption of stirring may lead to the formation of larger aggregates (aggregate fusion). This leads to the formation of larger, inhomogeneous aggregates, which in turn leads to differences in mass transfer and signal gradients as well as to spontaneous differentiation and decrease of pluripotency in the cell aggregates (Lipsitz et al. 2018, see also Example 1).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">US2016/0215257 discloses methods for expansion and passaging of cell aggregates comprising stem cells and/or differentiated cells and comprising the use of closed systems in stirred tank bioreactors. WO 2013/109520 discloses a perfusion bioreactor system including a cell aggregate trap. US 2017/0191022 discloses the use of an acoustic filter for retaining cells.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there is still a need for methods of changing culture medium of a suspension culture, in particular in which the entire process can be performed without removing the cells or aggregates from the system and without exposing the cells to the stress that is associated with sedimentation and/or centrifugation for extended periods of time. The present invention aims to address this need.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This need is solved by the subject-matter as defined in the claims.

Manual medium exchange usually involves the transfer of at least a portion of the suspension culture out of the bioreactor and include, e.g., centrifugation of the cells. This mechanical stimulation can have negative effects on cell viability or functions such as unwanted differentiation of stem cells (Lipsitz et al. 2018, see also Example 1). The method of medium exchange of the invention avoids the transfer of cells out of the bioreactor as well as stressful mechanical stimulations. Thereby, the number of manual interactions is limited and the risk of contamination is limited.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0040">One possibility of automated medium exchange of a suspension culture in a bioreactor (&#x201c;vessel settling&#x201d;) is stopping of the stirring and allowing the cells to settle at the bottom of the bioreactor. The supernatant can then be aspirated and be replaced with fresh medium. This however also leads to mechanical stimulation of the cells, which can lead to irregular growth and loss of pluripotency (see e.g. Example 1, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref>). This problem is overcome by the method of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0041">The problems outlined above are solved by the method of the present invention (&#x201c;tip settling&#x201d;). In a bioreactor, cells in suspension culture are preferably stirred. This is especially important for normally adherent cells that may form cell aggregates in suspension culture. In the state of the art, the stirring is stopped and the cells or cell aggregates are allowed to sediment. After sedimentation, the supernatant is exchanged and the stirring is started again (see e.g. Kwok et al. 2018). The sedimentation however has a negative impact on the cells (Lipsitz et al. 2018, Example 1, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref>). In the method of the present invention, the stirring of the bioreactor is thus preferably not stopped but runs continuously and the stopping of stirring preferably is avoided. However, the method of the invention can also be carried out in a bioreactor, in which the culture medium is not stirred.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0042">Despite surprisingly yielding regularly formed/shaped cell aggregates (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and a dramatically higher rate of iPSCs positive for pluripotency markers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) in comparison to the vessel settling method, the method of the present invention (&#x201c;tip settling&#x201d;) also leads to an increased growth rate of iPSCs as shown in Example 1 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In sum, the method of the present invention is an improved method of changing culture medium of a suspension culture.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0043">In an exemplary embodiment of method of the invention (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or Example 1), a fraction of the cell culture medium is transferred in a container, e.g. a pipette tip. After transfer, the cells are allowed to settle at the bottom of the container by gravitation at the at least one opening in the bottom of the container. Thereby, the cells concentrate at the bottom of the fraction of the culture medium, i.e. a supernatant that preferably is essentially free of cells is formed. After sedimentation, the cells are dispensed back into the culture medium of the bioreactor, e.g. by ejecting the cells while the supernatant remains in the container. The supernatant can be discarded. To maintain a constant volume of culture medium in the bioreactor, the discarded supernatant may be replaced by an equal amount of fresh culture medium. Importantly, only a (relatively minor) part of the cells is taken from the suspension culture while the remaining cells are continuously stirred. Thus, only a small number of cells are in the container, which can reduce the time needed for medium exchange and therefore also reduce the time a cell is sedimented during medium exchange. Most importantly, it is not necessary to remove the cells from the bioreactor.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0044">Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method of changing culture medium of a suspension culture, the suspension culture comprising cells suspended in the culture medium, the method comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0045">(i) transferring a fraction of the suspension culture into a container, wherein the container comprises at least one opening at the bottom;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0046">(ii) allowing the cells comprised in the fraction of the suspension to settle at the at least one opening at the bottom of the container by gravitation, thereby forming a supernatant;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0047">(iii) dispensing the cells settled at the bottom of the container (back) into the suspension culture;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0048">(iv) discarding the supernatant.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0042" num="0049">When carrying out the method of the invention, the cells comprised in the fraction of the suspension can be seen as being held static in step (ii).

To test both strategies in parallel, the vessel settling strategy was performed in culture station 1 and the tip settling strategy was performed in culture station 2. The maximum capacity of the ambr15 system was mimicked as followed: Repeated intervals of activated stirring (860 seconds; simulating medium exchange of a vessel of the opposite culture station) and deactivated stirring (881 seconds; simulating exchange of vessels in the same culture station) were included during vessel setting. The durations were empirically determined previously. A pause of 2.5 h was included between each interval of tip settling medium exchange.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Results</heading><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Morphology</heading><p id="p-0090" num="0132">The morphology of iPSC aggregates was comparable before initiating medium exchange (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). After medium exchange the aggregates of the vessel settling strategy had diffuse or tubular shape and were large. This observation indicates fusion of aggregates. In contrast, aggregates of tip settling strategy were round and small.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Cell Number and Expansion Rates</heading><p id="p-0091" num="0133">The cell number after 4 days of suspension culture increased 3.61-fold using the vessel settling strategy. The tip settling strategy resulted in a mean increase of 21.81-fold during the same time period (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><heading id="h-0018" level="2">Pluripotency</heading><p id="p-0092" num="0134">The expression of pluripotency-related genes (OCT4, TRA-1-60, NANOG) was high after four days of suspension culture using the tip settling strategy (90% OCT4/TRA-1-60 double positive cells, 91% OCT4/NANOG double positive cells, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). The expression was considerably lower in cells cultured with the vessel settling strategy (11% OCT4/TRA-1-60 double positive cells, 9% OCT4/NANOG double positive cells, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>).</p><heading id="h-0019" level="2">Analysis</heading><p id="p-0093" num="0135">The tip settling strategy is more suitable for medium exchange of cell culture, in particular of iPSCs, in bioreactors such as the ambr15 system at maximum capacity compared to the vessel settling strategy. Considering the poor expression of pluripotency-related markers, the vessel settling strategy may even be completely unfit for medium exchange, in particular in the ambr15 at maximum capacity of 24 vessels. The reason for this likely is the fusion of aggregates during time periods without agitation resulting in spontaneous differentiation.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">REFERENCES</heading><p id="p-0094" num="0000"><ul id="ul0021" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0021-0001" num="0136">Amit, Michal; Chebath, Judith; Margulets, Victoria; Laevsky, Ilana; Miropolsky, Yael; Shariki, Kohava et al.
