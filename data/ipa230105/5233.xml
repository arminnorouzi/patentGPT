application relates to a scanning system and method for controlling an aiming light source.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Existing image readers are divided into two exposure modes: global exposure and rolling shutter exposure. Global exposure usually refers to the simultaneous exposure of all pixels, while rolling shutter exposure refers to sequential exposure of pixel arrays. The global exposure method avoids the jelly effect and produces clear images even for high-speed moving objects. Rolling shutter exposure cannot produce clear images for moving objects due to the time difference of pixel exposure, which will cause a jelly effect. Usually CCD (Charge Coupled Device) and some CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) are global exposure, and some CMOS are rolling shutter exposure. Compared with the CCD and CMOS of global exposure, the CMOS of rolling shutter exposure has a price advantage, its noise is less, and the image is clearer, so it is widely used.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the field of optical image reading, it is usually necessary to use a aiming light source to project an aiming pattern to indicate the reading range of the image reader. However, since the brightness of the aiming pattern is higher than that of the surrounding environment, the image is often partially overexposed, which affects the reading efficiency. The global exposure image reader, because the exposure of all pixels is synchronized, can use blanking technology to stagger the opening time of the aiming light source and the exposure time of all pixels, so that the aiming pattern will not appear in the captured image and avoid partial overexposure; rolling shutter exposure due to the sequential exposure of pixels, the exposure time of the pixels is not synchronized, and the same blanking technology as the global exposure cannot be used.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the above problems, the present application provides a new scanning system and method for controlling the aiming light source, and adopts new methods and technical means to solve these problems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the problems faced by the background art, the purpose of the present application is to provide a scanning system and method for controlling the aiming light source to avoid the overexposure of the image caused by the aiming pattern projected by the aiming light source.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To achieve the above object, the present application adopts the following. technical means:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A scanning system for controlling an aiming light source, comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">an image sensor, which sequentially exposes the pixel array through a rolling shutter to acquire an image of a target, the pixel array includes effective pixels and non-imaging pixels, the effective pixels are pixels that are actually used for image decoding, and the non-imaging pixels are pixels that are not actually used for image decoding;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">an aiming light source for projecting an aiming, pattern to aim at the target;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">a control unit for controlling the image sensor and the aiming light source, so that the aiming light source is turned off during an exposure time of the effective pixel, and the aiming light source is turned on during at least part of the exposure time of the non-imaging pixels.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0012">Optionally, the image sensor sequentially performs exposure with pixel rows as a unit, and the pixel row in which the effective pixel exists is defined as an effective pixel row, and the aiming light source is turned off during the exposure time of the effective pixel row.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">Optionally, the pixel row whose entire row is the non-imaging pixel is defined as a non-imaging pixel row, and the aiming light source is turned on during at least part of the exposure time of the non-imaging pixel row.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0014">Optionally, the exposure time of the non-imaging pixel row partially coincides with the exposure time of the effective pixel row, and the aiming light source is turned on during the exposure time during which the non-imaging pixel rows are individually exposed, and is an turned off when the two exposure times coincide.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0015">Optionally, the effective pixels are pixels that actually participate in light-sensing, and the non-imaging pixels are pixels that do not actually participate in light-sensing.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0016">Optionally, the image formed by the effective pixels is used to extract characters for decoding, and image formed by the non-imaging pixels is removed during image preprocessing.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0017">Optionally, the aiming pattern comprises an aiming frame for framing the target, and the image formed by the aiming frame on the pixel array roughly frames all the effective pixels.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">Optionally, comprising an illumination source for providing illumination light, the control unit controls the illumination source to be turned on during the exposure time of the effective pixels of the image sensor and to be turned off during the exposure time of the non-image pixels.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">The present application provides a method for controlling an aiming light source, comprising the following steps:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">S<b>1</b>.

The scanning system can be used for various scanning engines, scanning guns, ring scanners, handheld terminals <b>1</b> (PDA), stationary scanners, image recognition robots, and the like. The following takes the handheld terminal <b>1</b> as an example to introduce the structure, function and control method of the scanning system of the present application in detail.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the scanning system according to the embodiment of the present application is applied to the handheld terminal <b>1</b>, and the handheld terminal <b>1</b> mainly includes a camera <b>3</b>, an aiming light source <b>7</b> and a control unit <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0074">The camera <b>3</b> includes a lens for capturing image(s) of the target and an image sensor <b>4</b> for photoelectric conversion of the image(s) of the target and the camera's field of view (FOV) has been known in advance. The image sensor <b>4</b> sequentially exposes the pixel array through the rolling shutter to capture the image(s) of the target in cooperation with the lens, and converts the image(s) of the target into electrical signals. Rolling shutter usually refers to sequential exposure in pixel row as a unit, but there are also sequential exposures in multi-pixel rows as units or exposure in pixel sub-areas, etc. The rolling shutter of the present application preferably uses a row-by-row exposure way. With supplementary reference to the image sensor <b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the pixel array (the figure is for illustration only and does not show the actual size and number of pixels) includes effective pixels <b>5</b> and non-imaging pixels <b>6</b>. The effective pixels <b>5</b> are pixels actually used for image decoding, and the non-imaging pixels <b>6</b> are pixels that are not actually used for image decoding. The effective pixel <b>5</b> and the non-imaging pixel <b>6</b> will be further explained later with reference to the two embodiments in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0075">The aiming light source <b>7</b> is used to project the aiming pattern <b>8</b> to guide the user to aim at the target. The aiming light source <b>7</b> can usually use a laser with a diffractive optical element (DOE) or an LED with a lens to generate the aiming pattern <b>8</b>, so that the aiming pattern <b>8</b> has a clear shape or outline, and the brightness of the aiming pattern <b>8</b> is also significantly higher than the ambient brightness. The aiming pattern <b>8</b> includes a light spot <b>9</b> in the center (usually a cross shape, but also a straight line or a circle, etc.) and an aiming frame <b>10</b> at the edge. Some of the aiming patterns <b>8</b> do not have the aiming frame <b>10</b> and only have the light spot <b>9</b>. Within the depth of field of the camera, the light spot <b>9</b> is set to be located in the center of the camera's field of view, so that the relative position to the camera's field of view is fixed. This is because, although the camera's field of view changes proportionally with the change of the distance, the size of the light spot <b>9</b> also changes with the change of the distance in approximately the same proportion. Therefore, the position occupied by the light spot <b>9</b> in the camera's field of view remains substantially unchanged. Therefore, the image <b>11</b> formed by the light spot <b>9</b> on the pixel array of the image sensor <b>4</b> via the lens keeps the relative position fixed. Usually, the image <b>11</b> of the light spot <b>9</b> falls on several pixel rows in the center of the pixel array, which can also be known in advance.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0076">Turning back to the image sensor <b>4</b> in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the imaging range <b>15</b> of the lens is shown by the circular dotted line, which covers a part of the pixel array, and these pixels actually used for photosensitive imaging are the effective pixel <b>5</b>. Pixels outside the imaging range <b>15</b> of the lens are not actually used for light-sensing, so photoelectric conversion cannot be performed to generate images, and they are not used for image decoding. These pixels are the non-imaging pixels <b>6</b>, and the non-imaging pixels <b>6</b> can be used to calculate the dark current generated in the pixels, so that the dark current in the effective pixels <b>5</b> can be removed by an algorithm. In this way, the magnitude of the current generated by the effective pixel <b>5</b> through photoelectric conversion is obtained, so as to achieve the effect of noise reduction. When the pixel array is sequentially exposed in pixel row as a unit, a pixel row whose entire row is the non-imaging pixel <b>6</b> is defined as a non-imaging pixel row <b>60</b>, and the pixel row where the effective pixel <b>5</b> exists is defined as effective pixel row <b>50</b>. Therefore, the non-imaging pixel row <b>60</b> is actually a pixel row that does not participate in light-sensing, and the effective pixel row <b>50</b> is a pixel row that at least some or all of the pixels actually participate in the light-sensing. The image <b>11</b> of the light spot <b>9</b> is located in the center of the forming range of the lens, and is also located in the center of the pixel array, and maintains a fixed relative position relative to the pixel array. The aiming frame <b>10</b> is slightly larger than the camera's field of view and will not be captured by the camera <b>3</b>, so the image will not be overexposed.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0077">In the image sensor <b>4</b> in another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the imaging range <b>15</b> of the lens is shown by the circular dotted line, which basically covers the entire pixel array, so that the entire pixel array can receive light. The aiming pattern <b>8</b> projected by the aiming light source <b>7</b> also includes a light spot <b>9</b> (usually a cross shape, but also a line shape or a circle, etc.) and an aiming frame <b>10</b>. The light spot <b>9</b> and the aiming frame <b>10</b> are both located in the field of view of the camera <b>3</b>. Different from the previous embodiment, the aiming frame <b>10</b> is captured by the lens. The position of the image <b>11</b> of the aiming frame <b>10</b> on the pixel array can be known in advance. Pre-set the image <b>11</b> formed by the aiming frame <b>10</b> on the pixel array to roughly select all the effective pixels <b>5</b>. Define other pixels on the pixel array as non-imaging pixels <b>6</b>. The image <b>11</b> of the aiming frame <b>10</b> is actually located on the non-imaging pixel <b>6</b>, so even if the aiming frame <b>10</b> is located in the camera's field of view, the image will not be overexposed. The image signals captured by the pixel array are first subjected to image preprocessing, and the image signals captured by the non-imaging pixels <b>6</b> are cut off without image decoding; the image signals captured by the effective pixels <b>5</b> will be used for character extraction and for image decoding.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0078">In some embodiments (not shown, the same below), the imaging range of the lens is not necessarily circular, and the imaging range <b>15</b> of some special-shaped lenses may also be oval or even square.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0079">The control unit <b>12</b> is used to control the image sensor <b>4</b> and the aiming light source <b>7</b>. Specifically, according to a preset program stored in the memory, the exposure process of the pixel array of the image sensor <b>4</b> is controlled, and the turned on and off states of the aiming light source <b>7</b> are controlled during the exposure process.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0080">The control unit <b>12</b> controls the frame rate of the camera <b>3</b> according to the preset program stored in the memory, and controls the exposure time of the pixel row of the image sensor <b>4</b> through automatic exposure, so as to adjust the exposure time of the pixel row when the next frame of image is captured according to the quality of the previous frame of image.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0081">The control unit <b>12</b> can control the timing of the aiming light source <b>7</b> and the image sensor <b>4</b> through various solutions. The purpose of various solutions is to eliminate or reduce the partial overexposure of the target pattern caused by the aiming pattern <b>8</b> (mainly the light spot <b>9</b>).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0082">Solution 1: Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, since the image <b>11</b> of the light spot <b>9</b> is located on the effective pixel row <b>50</b>, when the on time of the aiming light source <b>7</b> is synchronized with the exposure time of the effective pixel row <b>50</b>, it will cause partial overexposure of the image. Referring to the timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, firstly, the aiming light source <b>7</b> is turned on to aim at the target, and then the image of the target is captured by the camera <b>3</b>. The image sensor <b>4</b> of the camera <b>3</b> sequentially exposes the pixel array through a rolling shutter. First exposed are several of the non-imaging pixel rows <b>60</b> located at the edges of the pixel array. The individual exposure time of the non-imaging pixel row <b>60</b> will continue for a preset time t, after which the effective pixel row <b>50</b> will begin to be exposed. After the non-imaging pixel row <b>60</b> is continuously exposed for a preset time t, the aiming light source <b>7</b> is turned off, and then the effective pixel row <b>50</b> is sequentially exposed. At this time, the effective pixel row <b>50</b> and the non-imaging pixel row <b>60</b> are exposed at the same time, and the exposure time of the two coincides. Since the aiming light source <b>7</b> is turned off at this time, the image will not be overexposed. After all the effective pixel rows <b>50</b> in a frame are exposed, the aiming light source <b>7</b> is turned on to project the aiming pattern <b>8</b>, and the remaining non-imaging pixel rows <b>60</b> are sequentially exposed. At this time, the image sensor <b>4</b> may have started the exposure acquisition of the next frame of image, and the next frame of image is still in the initial exposure time of the non-imaging pixel rows <b>60</b> without starting the exposure time of the effective pixel rows <b>50</b>. Turning on the aiming light source <b>7</b> during this period will not cause the image to be overexposed. Usually, the control unit <b>12</b> controls the exposure time of the pixel row of the image sensor <b>4</b> through automatic exposure, so as to adjust the exposure time of the pixel row when the next frame of image is captured according to the quality of the previous frame of image. The frame rate of the image sensor <b>4</b> is preset, and the starting time interval of sequential exposure between pixel rows is also preset. After the control unit <b>12</b> sets the exposure time of the next frame of image, the turn-on time of the aiming light source <b>7</b> can be set according to the exposure time of the non-imaging pixel row <b>60</b> and the effective pixel row <b>50</b>. In this way, the aiming light source <b>7</b> is always turned off during the exposure time of the effective pixel <b>5</b>, and turned on during at least part of the exposure time of the non-imaging pixel <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0083">Of course, the control unit <b>12</b> may not control the image sensor <b>4</b> through automatic exposure, but set a fixed exposure time, so that the exposure time of the pixel row remains a fixed length. The pixel array periodically sequentially exposes the non-imaging pixel row <b>60</b> and the effective pixel row <b>50</b>. The aiming light source <b>7</b> is also set to periodically project the aiming pattern <b>8</b>, the aiming light source <b>7</b> is turned on during the individual exposure time of the non-imaging pixel row <b>60</b>, and the aiming light source <b>7</b> is turned off during the exposure time of the effective pixel row <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0084">Solution 2: Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, since the image <b>11</b> of the light spot <b>9</b> is located on the effective pixel row <b>50</b>, when the on time of the aiming light source <b>7</b> is synchronized with the exposure time of the effective pixel row <b>50</b>, it will cause partial overexposure of the image. It is noted here that the position of the image <b>11</b> of the light spot <b>9</b> on the pixel array is basically fixed, as long as the exposure time of several pixel rows where the image <b>11</b> of the light spot <b>9</b> is located, the aiming light source <b>7</b> is turned off, the light spot <b>9</b> will not cause overexposure of the image, and several pixel rows corresponding to the image <b>11</b> of the light spot <b>9</b> can be known in advance. Referring to the timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the aiming light source <b>7</b> is first turned on, and then the pixel array is sequentially exposed. When the pixel row corresponding to the image <b>11</b> of the light spot <b>9</b> starts to be exposed, the aiming light source <b>7</b> is turned off. When the exposure of the pixel row corresponding to the image <b>11</b> of the light spot <b>9</b> is completed, the aiming light source <b>7</b> is turned on again. Since the pixel row corresponding to the image <b>11</b> of the light spot <b>9</b> accounts for a small proportion of the total pixel array, the solution 2 achieves the control of the turned on and turned off time of the aiming light source <b>7</b> through precise control in space (the pixel row corresponding to the image <b>11</b> of the light spot <b>9</b> and other pixel rows). Compared with the Solution 1, in the Solution 2, the aiming light source <b>7</b> is turned on for a longer time, and the aiming pattern <b>8</b> can be clearer. Of course, the aiming light source <b>7</b> may also be turned off during the exposure time of the pixel row corresponding to the image <b>11</b> of the light spot <b>9</b>. and the aiming light source <b>7</b> may be turned on during a certain period of other times but not all the time.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0085">Solution 3: Referring to the timing diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, in a plurality of the frame images continuously captured by the camera <b>3</b>, the aiming light source <b>7</b> is only turned on in some frames, so that the aiming pattern <b>8</b> will not be captured in other multi-frame images. The camera <b>3</b> only transmits the image captured when the aiming light source <b>7</b> is turned off to the control unit <b>12</b>, and the control unit <b>12</b> only decodes the image captured by the camera <b>3</b> when the aiming light source <b>7</b> is turned off, which improves decoding efficiency. Of course, the camera <b>3</b> can also transmit all the captured images to the control unit <b>12</b>, but the control unit <b>12</b> only decodes the images captured by the camera <b>3</b> when the aiming light source <b>7</b> is turned off. Solution 3 is not only applicable to rolling shutters, but also to global shutters. However, compared with Solutions 1 and 2, Solution 3 sacrifices decoding speed because only part of the image is decoded.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0086">Solution 4: Referring to the timing diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, when the control unit <b>12</b> adjusts the exposure time of the image pixel array through automatic exposure, so that the exposure time of the pixel row is very long, the exposure times of the effective pixel rows <b>50</b> of the first two frames of images as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> are connected together, and there is no separate exposure time of the non-imaging pixel rows <b>60</b> in the middle, which makes it impossible to use the solutions 1 and 2, and only the solution 3 can be used. However, the exposure time of the third frame image is relatively short, and the second frame image and the third frame image directly have a separate exposure time of the non-imaging pixel row <b>60</b>, and the aiming light source <b>7</b> can be turned on to project the aiming pattern <b>8</b>, so that the solution 1 or 2 could be used. Adopting solution 3 is defined as the first mode, adopting solution 1 or 2 is defined as the second mode. When the control unit <b>12</b> determines that the exposure time of the pixel row is greater than a threshold value, the control unit <b>12</b> activates the first mode, and when the exposure time of the pixel row is lower than the threshold value, the control unit <b>12</b> activates the second mode. The threshold can be pre-calculated or set to an appropriate value after multiple tests.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0087">Usually, an illumination source <b>13</b> is also included to provide illumination light to illuminate the target. The control unit <b>12</b> controls the illumination source <b>13</b> to be turned on during the exposure time of the effective pixels <b>5</b> of the image sensor <b>4</b> and turned off during the individual exposure time of the non-imaging pixels <b>6</b>, so as to reduce the power consumption of the illumination source <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0088">In this embodiment, the camera <b>3</b>, the aiming light source <b>7</b> and the illumination source <b>13</b> are integrated together to form a scanning head <b>2</b>. The control unit <b>12</b> on the main board of the handheld terminal <b>1</b> controls the scanning head <b>2</b> to collect the image of the targets. In some embodiments (not shown, the same below), the camera <b>3</b>, the aiming light source <b>7</b>, the illumination source <b>13</b>, the control unit <b>12</b> and other elements are integrated together to form the scan engine. The image of the target can be collected by the scanning engine through the integrated control switch, and the aforementioned ring scanner adopts a similar structure. In some embodiments, the decoding chip can be additionally set exclusively for decoding the image of the target, instead of being decoded by the control unit <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0089">The scanning system and method for controlling the aiming light source of the present application have the following beneficial effects:</p><p id="p-0082" num="0090">The image sensor <b>4</b> sequentially exposes the pixel array through the rolling shutter to capture the image of the target. The pixel array includes effective pixels <b>5</b> and non-imaging pixels <b>6</b>, the effective pixels <b>5</b> are pixels that are actually used for image decoding, and the non-imaging pixels <b>6</b> are pixels that are not actually used for image decoding. The control unit <b>12</b> controls the image sensor <b>4</b> and the aiming light source <b>7</b> so that the aiming light source <b>7</b> is turned off during the exposure time of the effective pixel <b>5</b>, while the aiming light source <b>7</b> is turned on during at least part of the exposure time of the non-imaging pixel <b>6</b>. The turn-on time of the aiming light source <b>7</b> is staggered from the exposure time of the effective pixels <b>5</b>, so as to avoid partial overexposure of the images captured by the exposure of the effective pixels.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0091">The image sensor <b>4</b> sequentially exposes a pixel array through a rolling shutter to convert the image of the target into an electrical signal. The control unit <b>12</b> controls the camera <b>3</b> and the aiming light source <b>7</b> so that the aiming light source <b>7</b> is turned off during the exposure time of the pixel corresponding to the image <b>11</b> of the light spot <b>9</b> on the pixel array.
