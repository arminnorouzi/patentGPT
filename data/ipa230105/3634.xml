PTS generally adopts a pump-probe dual-laser configuration, in which a pump laser beam is generated to excite sample molecules and a probe laser beam is generated to simultaneously pass through a heated region with the pump laser beam to induce a phase shift. The concentration of absorptive molecules can then be measured by optical interferometry, since the phase modulation is proportional to the concentration of absorptive molecules.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For gas analysis, the laser spectroscopy may incorporate optical gas sensors using a gas cell where the laser beams are transmitted through the gas analyte in a single pass or multiple passes to ensure efficient light-gas interactions. Most traditional spectroscopic systems were designed for free-space gas cells including a multi-pass cell such as a Herriot cell or a White cell, or an optical cavity such as a Fabry-Perot cavity with bulky optical elements. Alternatively, the laser spectroscopy may include an optical waveguide in which the light propagation and gas analysis are performed in order to reduce the sensor dimensions and the system complexity, as well as to enhance the light-gas interaction.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Compared with the free-space systems, optical waveguides with a small mode field diameter enhance laser intensity and facilitate thermal conduction, improving the sensitivity of photothermal detection. Several photothermal gas sensor designs based on optical waveguides have previously been investigated, achieving sensitivities higher than the sensitives of the conventional free space sensors in term of normalized noise equivalent absorption coefficient. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 9,846,118B2 discloses designs of a gas sensor in which a hollow core photonic bandgap fiber was filled with target gas and simultaneously coupled with a probe light source and a pump light source. The PTS based on the hollow core fiber achieved a high sensitivity and a large dynamic range for gas detection.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the existing PTS systems generally employ a demodulation scheme based on active homodyne detection technique in which the interferometer is required to be stabilized at the quadrature point in order to obtain a linear phase response and a maximum sensitivity, making operations of the interferometer complex and difficult. Moreover, since a servo-control loop is used to monitor the drift of the quadrature point by directly adjusting the probe wavelength or the optical path length via phase modulators, the measurements are sensitive to environmental disturbance. The use of actuators may additionally introduce mechanical and electrical noises to the PTS system. When the environmental disturbance drives the interferometer out of its dynamic range, the servo-control loop has to be reset.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There continues to be a need in the art for improved designs and techniques for a system to measure characteristics of gas specimens with high sensitivities and ease of use without requirement of a servo-control loop system.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the subject invention pertain to a pump-probe photothermal spectroscopic system having passive phase detection and an optical waveguide.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an embodiment of the subject invention, a system for gas measurements based on photothermal spectroscopy (PTS) can comprise a pump laser source generating a pump laser beam propagating through a target gas specimen, a wavelength of the pump laser beam being tuned around the absorption characteristics of the target gas specimen to be measured; the pump laser source being simultaneously wavelength and/or amplitude modulated at a frequency, f (in kHz); an optical coupler coupling the pump laser source with an optical waveguide; an optical waveguide configured to transmit the pump laser beams through gas medium containing the target gas specimen to be measured; a laser driver configured to control temperature and injection current of the pump laser source; a signal generator connected to the laser driver and configured to provide modulation to the pump laser source; a probe laser source generating a probe laser beam connected to the optical coupler and coupled to the optical waveguide; an optical filter connected to an output of the optical waveguide and configured to filter out the pump laser beam and to transmit the probe laser beam. The probe laser beam and the pump laser beam simultaneously propagate through the optical waveguide. The optical waveguide can be an inner-coating hollow core fiber, a hollow-core anti-resonant fiber, or a slot waveguide, disposed in the target gas specimen. Furthermore, the probe laser beam is phase modulated due to the photothermal effect, and the harmonic components of the photothermal phase signal have a linear relationship with a gas concentration of the target gas specimen.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Based on the pump-probe PTS system, embodiments of two systems for the passive phase detection of the probe laser beam propagating through the gas specimen inside the waveguide are provided.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first photothermal passive phase detection system based on heterodyne interferometry includes, a local oscillator generating a local oscillator light with a frequency shift, &#x3a9; (in MHz), with respect to the probe laser frequency; a combiner connected to the local oscillator and an output of the optical filter and configured to align the local oscillator light with the probe laser beam output from the optical filter; a photodetector connected to the combiner and configured to generate beat notes when the probe laser beam and local oscillator light are simultaneously received by the photodetector; and a demodulation module connected to the photodetector and configured to detect and measure a photothermal signal based on the beat notes received from the photodetector for gas measurements. The local oscillator provides a fixed frequency shift (&#x3a9;) with respect to the frequency of the probe laser beam.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The demodulation module for extracting the harmonic components of the photothermal phase signal can comprise a splitter, a first mixer, a first reference source, a first low pass filter, a second mixer, a second reference source, a second low pass filter, a divider, a digital arctangent module, a third mixer, a third reference source, and a third low pass filter. The demodulation method can comprise providing, by a reference source, reference signals; generating, by a photodetector, beat note signals; demodulating, by a digital lock-in phase detector, phases of the beat note signals; and demodulating, by a digital lock-in amplitude detector, harmonic signals of PTS from the demodulated phases of the beat note signals for gas measurement. The method additionally comprises splitting the beat note signals into first and second beat note signals, mixing the first and second beat note signals with an in-phase reference signal and a quadrature reference signal, respectively, and transmitting the first and second beat note signals that are mixed with corresponding reference signals through first and second low pass filters, respectively. The phases of beat note signals are determined by a digital arc tangent method. The demodulated phase signal of the beat note is mixed with a reference at a frequency equal to a multiple of f, such as f, 2f, or 3f, and transmitting through a low pass filter.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The second photothermal passive phase detection method based on core-cladding-mode interference can comprise generating, by coupling the probe light into the cladding region and core region of the waveguide, a core mode and a cladding mode simultaneously; generating by a photodetector, the mode interference signals; and demodulating, by a digital lock-in amplifier, the harmonic signals from the mode interference output.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

At this step, when the pump laser beam at a certain wavelength passes through the gas medium containing the target gas specimen, a portion of the laser power is absorbed when the laser wavelength is in resonance with a specific absorption line of the target gas specimen. When the wavelength and/or intensity of the pump laser beam is modulated at a frequency of f (in kHz), a periodic heating process occurs and subsequently changes the refractive index of the gas medium. The refractive index variation leads to the phase modulation of the probe laser beam that travels along the same path of the pump laser beam in the optical waveguide.
