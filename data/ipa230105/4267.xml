An executor of this method may be a terminal device. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, this method may include the following steps.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">At step S<b>101</b>, a current page is displayed on a display interface of an application, and page identifiers of at least two first pages of the application are displayed in a predetermined region of the display interface. Further, the current page is any one of the at least two first pages.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">An APP developer may preset the number of the first pages of the APP based on an actual demand and preset a source and pushing mechanism of a content to be displayed in each of the first pages. If a user requires to view different first pages in the at least two first pages included in the APP, switching between the at least two first pages may be performed by means of a sliding operation. The current page is any first page being viewed by the user by means of the display interface in the APP. When the user needs to view other first pages in the APP, switching from the current page to other first pages may be performed by means of one or more sliding operations.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each of the page identifiers is configured to indicate the source and the pushing mechanism of the content displayed on the first page corresponding to the page identifier, and may be a specific icon, a characters, or the like. Each of the page identifiers is displayed in the predetermined region of the display interface, and this predetermined region may be predetermined by the developer. For example, generally, the predetermined region may be a navigation bar arranged in a top region of the display interface, and each of the page identifiers is displayed at a predetermined position corresponding to this navigation bar. The user may distinguish the at least two first pages in the APP according to each of the page identifiers and the position where each of the page identifiers is located, and determine the specific type of the first page displayed on the display interface.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, in a certain short video APP, two first pages, including a recommended page and a following page, may be provided. Specifically, in the recommended page, a latest short video is recommended to the user according to a preset rule, and in the following page, a latest short video published by a short video author followed by the user is recommended to the user. In order to view the contents of the two first pages, respectively, the user may perform switching between the recommended page and the following page by means of a sliding operation. Meanwhile, the page identifier of the recommended page and the page identifier of the following page are correspondingly displayed in the navigation bar of the display interface. When the recommended page is displayed on the display interface, the user can determine that the first page displayed on the display interface is the recommended page by viewing the page identifiers in the navigation bar. When the following page is displayed on the display interface, the user can also determine that the first page displayed on the display interface is the following page by means of the page identifiers in the navigation bar.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">At step S<b>102</b>, a sliding operation for the current page is obtained.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">When the user uses a terminal device (such as a mobile phone, a tablet personal computer, or the like) to view contents by means of the display interface of the APP, the terminal device can receive the sliding operation for the current page by means of the display interface and determine an instruction corresponding to the received sliding operation, so as to make a response to this sliding operation based on the instruction.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">At step S<b>103</b>, if the sliding operation is a first sliding switching operation, the current page on the display interface is switched to a next page, and a position of each page identifier in the predetermined region is adjusted. Further, the next page is the first page, other than the current page, between the at least two first pages.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Specifically, when the user views the current page, if the sliding operation, received by the terminal device from the user is the first sliding switching operation, it is determined that the user sends an instruction for switching from the current page to display the next page, and a switching action for switching from the current page to the next page is performed, so that the next page is displayed on the display interface. Meanwhile, in order to ensure that the user can determine, based on the page identifier in the navigation bar and the position of the page identifier, the specific type of the first page displayed on the display interface after the current page is switched to the next page on the display interface, the position of each page identifier in the predetermined region after such a switching is adjusted while switching the first pages. It should be noted that after the current page is switched to the next page, i.e., after the next page is displayed on the display interface, the user may also switch the page to a next page of the next page (namely other first pages in the APP) by means of the first sliding switching operation.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Based on the above-mentioned example, when the user uses this short video APP, the current page being viewed is the recommended page, if the first sliding switching operation sent by the user is received by the display interface, the recommended page is switched to the following page, and meanwhile, the positions of the page identifiers of the recommended page and the following page in the navigation bar are exchanged with each other. Further, when the user is viewing the following page, the following page may also be switched to the recommended page by means of the first sliding switching operation.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to the solution provided by the present disclosure, any one of the first pages of the APP is switched from the displayed current page to another first page to be displayed by means of the first sliding switching operation sent by the user, such that the sliding operations corresponding to switching actions for switching from each first page to other first pages in the APP are all the same. Thus, a smoother sliding operation can be provided when the user performs the page switching. Meanwhile, the position of the page identifier of each first page in the predetermined region of the display interface is synchronously adjusted during the page switching, such that the user can rapidly recognize the first page displayed on the display interface after the page switching.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, this method may also include switching the current page to a second page corresponding to the current page when the sliding operation is a second sliding switching operation.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The second page may be understood as a page different from the first page in type, and there is a correlation between the second page corresponding to the current page and the content being displayed on this current page. That is, the corresponding second page may be determined by the content being displayed on the current page. In some cases, the user also needs to switch the page to the second page to view contents.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Based on the above-mentioned example, in this short video APP, the second page may be a personal page of a certain short video author. The personal page includes all short videos published by this short video author. That is, the correlation between the short video being displayed on the recommended page or the following page and the corresponding personal page is that the author of the short video being displayed on the recommended page or the following page is the same as the author of the short video included in the personal page. When the user views a short video published by a certain short video author on the recommended page or the following page, if the user wishes to further view other short videos published by this short video author, a switching to the personal page of this short video author is performed to view these videos.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Specifically, when the user views the current page, if the sliding operation received by the terminal device from the user is the second sliding switching operation, i.e., it is determined that the a switching instruction for switching from the current page to the corresponding second page is sent by the user, and a switching action for switching from the current page to the corresponding second page is performed to display the corresponding second page on the display interface. It should be noted that after the switching to the second page corresponding to a certain first page is performed, the user can return the current page to this first page by means of a return operation.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Based on the above-mentioned example, when the user uses this short video APP and the current page being viewed is the recommended page, if the second sliding switching operation sent by the user is received by the display interface, the recommended page is switched to the personal page of the short video author whose short video is being viewed by user. The following page may also be switched to the corresponding second page through sending the second sliding switching operation by the user.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The present embodiment has the beneficial effects that the corresponding sliding operation for switching from the current page to the second page in each first page of the APP is further unified, such that the sliding operation is smoother when the page switching is performed by the user.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiment of the present disclosure, the method also includes, subsequent to obtaining the sliding operation for the current page, if a sliding direction of the sliding operation is a first transverse direction, and a corresponding sliding distance is not less than a predetermined distance, the sliding operation is determined as the first sliding switching operation. If the sliding direction of the sliding operation is a second transverse direction, and a corresponding sliding distance is not less than a predetermined distance, the sliding operation is determined as the second sliding switching operation. Further, the first transverse direction is opposite to the second transverse direction.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, in responding to receiving the sliding operation of the user by the terminal device, an effectiveness of the sliding operation is determined based on the sliding distance corresponding to the sliding operation. That is, if the sliding distance corresponding to the sliding operation is greater than the predetermined distance, it is determined that an effective instruction is sent by the user. Further, a specific type of the sliding operation, i.e., a specific content of an instruction corresponding to the siding operation, is determined based on the sliding direction corresponding to the sliding operation. When the sliding direction corresponding to the sliding operation is the first transverse direction, the sliding operation is determined as the first sliding switching operation, i.e., the corresponding instruction is determined as an instruction for switching from the current page to the next page. In addition, when the sliding direction corresponding to the sliding operation is the second transverse direction, the sliding operation is determined as the second sliding switching operation, i.e., the corresponding instruction is determined as an instruction for switching from the current first page to the corresponding second page. Further, the first transverse direction is opposite to the second transverse direction. In addition, since the sliding directions corresponding to the two types of sliding operations are opposite to each other, the sliding operation is simpler and easier for the use when performing the page switching by using the APP.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an actual application, the sliding direction corresponding to the first transverse direction may be set to be rightward, and the sliding direction corresponding to the second transverse direction may be set to be leftward.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c </i></figref>that are schematic diagrams illustrating a page switching of a certain short video APP, the recommended page and the following page are the first pages in the present disclosure, and the personal page is the second page in the present disclosure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>, the current page is the recommended page. In the left figure, the user performs a rightward sliding operation on the recommended page <b>201</b> (that is, the first sliding switching operation is sent) to be switched to the following page <b>202</b> in the right figure. That is, the switching between the recommended page and the following page as two first pages is implemented by the rightward sliding operation. Meanwhile, in the navigation bar <b>204</b> of the display interface, a position of a page identifier &#x201c;recommended&#x201d; in a recommendation bar and a page identifier &#x201c;following&#x201d; in the following page are exchanged with each other, such that the first page displayed on the display interface is the following page after the switching is determined by the user based on the page identifiers and the positions of the page identifiers in the navigation bar <b>204</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>, the current page is the following page. In the left figure, the user performs a leftward sliding operation on the following page <b>202</b> (that is, the second sliding switching operation is sent) to be switched to the personal page <b>203</b> in the right figure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c</i></figref>, the current page is the recommended page. In the left figure, the user performs a leftward sliding operation on the recommended page <b>201</b> to be switched to the personal page <b>203</b> in the right figure.

It can be seen from the above-mentioned example, the switching among the first pages can be implemented by performing the rightward sliding operation on the first pages by the user, and the switching from the first page to the second pages can be implemented by performing the leftward sliding on the first page by the user. That is, the sliding operations, corresponding to the switching among the first pages, performed on the recommended page and the following page by the user are the same, and the sliding operations, corresponding to the switching from the first page to the second page, performed on the recommended page and the following page by the user are also the same, such that the sliding operation is smoother when the user performs the page switching, thereby providing better user experience.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the at least two first pages are arranged in a predetermined order, and switching the current page on the display interface to the next page includes: switching the current page to a first page immediately following and adjacent to the current page in the predetermined order, when the current page is not a first page arranged as an end; and switching the current page to a first page arranged as a top, when the current page is the first page arranged as the end.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Arranging the first pages of the APP in the predetermined order aims at determining a next page to be switched from the current page when the first pages are switched.

In other words, when the user continuously and repeatedly switches the first pages by means of the first sliding switching operation, the first pages are circularly switched in order.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a certain APP includes three first pages including a page 1 (illustrated by reference numeral <b>301</b> in the figure), a page 2 (illustrated by the reference numeral <b>302</b> in the figure), and a page 3 (illustrated by the reference numeral <b>303</b> in the figure). The page 1, the page 2, and the page 3 are arranged in sequence. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates one circular switching process from left to right.

In that way, after the switching among the first pages is completed, the user can determine that the first page displayed on the display interface is the first page corresponding to the page identifier at the tail of the transverse queue in the navigation bar.

The three page identifiers in the navigation bar <b>304</b> are illustrated. The postilions of the three page identifiers in the navigation bar <b>304</b> are also switched synchronously while the switching among the first pages are performed by means of the first sliding switching operation three times by the user. Specifically, when the first sliding switching operation is sent by the user for the first time, the page 1 as shown in the first figure is switched to the page 2 as shown in the second figure, the page identifier of the page 1 in the navigation bar <b>304</b> is switched from the tail of the transverse queue to be displayed at the head of the transverse queue, and the page identifier of the page 2 is switched to be displayed at the tail of the transverse queue, which indicating that the first page displayed on the display interface after switching is the page 2. When the first sliding switching operation is sent by the user for the second time, the page 2 shown in the second figure is switched to the page 3 shown in the third figure, and the page identifier of the page 2 in the navigation bar <b>304</b> is switched to be displayed at the head of the transverse queue, and the page identifier of the page 3 is switched to be displayed at the tail of the transverse queue, which indicates that the first page displayed on the display interface after switching is the page 3.
