Particular embodiments relate to automated apparatus and integrated software in logical communication and distributed over different geospatial areas and operative to track availability of, and commitments to provide, assets of at least two different classes.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is a generally known practice for assets to be committed to fulfill obligations of current owners to investors or other entities who may have rights to receive the assets. It is a constant challenge to ascertain the availability of assets to fulfill obligations entered into on a dynamic basis. Obligations may be based upon, for example, investment considerations may also include investment characteristics, such as: liquidity, transparency, price, growth potential, income potential, regulatory considerations, tax considerations, accounting considerations, and so on, is also well known. While investor needs differ, many share a goal of maximizing a return for a given level of risk.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Liquidity of an investment instrument is also an important factor to many investors, particularly as liquidity relates to the evaluation of risk. Evaluation of risk is often tied to the availability of assets backing up such risk. Investments that can be more readily converted to cash, or other desirable instruments, quickly and without discount are perceived to be less risky than similar less-liquid instruments.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Transparency of availability of assets tied to an investment instrument is another important factor to many investors as it relates to the evaluation of risk. Investments can be understood more easily based upon an Issuer being open about a business associated with a particular investment and assets associated with the investment. An investment with open details related to the associated business may be perceived to be less risky than similar less transparent instruments. As a result, investors seeking strategies to manage risk and return usually prefer instruments that are more easily understood as compared to instruments that are not. Issuers may therefore seek to attract investor capital by providing Financial Instruments that deliver an appealing. package of risk and return.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Providing liquidity and transparency through exchange listing and public reporting enhances an issuance but may be impractical for reasons including the burdens and costs of public registration, offering and exchange listing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">While many large companies have the financial strength to register publicly and list their securities, many other companies including smaller Issuers and special purpose companies, special purpose vehicles and investment vehicles do not. In addition, some larger companies, operating companies and investment entities; that may or may not publicly register and list their securities; may still have limited liquidity and be less attractive to investors either because their investment instruments are not interesting to investors or well understood in the marketplace.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The importance of liquidity and transparency has traditionally been particularly apparent during times of financial crises; such as when securities of otherwise attractive private structured financings including mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities, traded at dramatic. discounts to their net asset value because of a lack of liquidity and poor transparency, which magnified a perceived risk of such instruments during a time of market stress. Many investors in such securities were required to sell, and realized significant losses attributable in part to an inability to access trapped value, which in turn is often tied to availability of underlying assets.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is worth noting that even otherwise liquid and transparent investment instruments may trade at significant discounts to a net asset value of underlying assets. One example of instruments trading at significant discounts includes a closed-end fund marketplace where fully transparent closed-end funds, which are listed on major exchanges, often trade at a discount to net asset value.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other prior art approaches and products exist as well; however, there remains a need in the marketplace for improved liquidity and transparency through the ability to redeem multiple classes of investment instruments. The preceding description is not to be construed as an admission that any of the description is prior art relative to the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the present invention, methods and apparatus are presented to manage assets in support of a Compound Redeemable instrument System that allows for redeeming two or more Compound Redeemable Instruments of different classes in exchange for one or more Exchangeable Assets of a specified class or classes where such Exchangeable Assets may include a specified class or classes of Ordinary Redeemable Instruments. The apparatus generally includes a processor in logical communication with a storage device and executable software stored on the storage device. The processor and software are functional to manifest the asset management concepts referenced herein. According to the present invention, assets are managed to fulfill obligations related to the creation of two or more Compound Redeemable Instruments of different classes including tracking the deposit of Exchangeable Assets of a specified class or classes into a holding vehicle.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A Compound Redemption Processor may also be used to track the obtaining to dispensing of Assets based upon obligations related to the creation of Compound Redeemable Instruments and track the direct issuance for cash and the conversion of instruments winch are not Compound Redeemable instruments into Compound Redeemable Instruments.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Obligations for Assets may be related to Compound Redeemable Instruments issued by a Compound Redeemable Instrument Issuer or obligations from a secondary market transaction. In some embodiments, Compound Redeemable Instruments may be publicly listed, and assets tracked according to public listing. Compound Redeemable Instruments have value based on their terms as individual instruments and by virtue of their ability to be redeemed using the Compound Redemption Processor for Exchangeable Assets in a process referred to herein as Compound Redemption.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Obligations for Assets from may result from Compound Redeemable Instruments issued directly by a Compound Redeemable Instrument Issuer and backed by specific Asset obligations. The Compound Redeemable instruments may be structured as any class of Financial instrument including equity, obligation, hybrid, ordinary redeemable or otherwise. Compound Redeemable instruments may also comprise certificates, receipts, titles or rights to an account which do not constitute an interest in the Issuers balance sheet. Such significant structuring flexibility enables the present invention to create custom risk and return profiles with improved access to various tax, regulatory and accounting treatments. These factors may be important. to investors and represent an advantage compared to other financial products.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Apparatus included in a Compound Redemption Processor used to track assets may incorporate computer hardware, such as for example, a computer server connected to a distributed network for transmitting and receiving data and stored protocol of processing logic to properly specify a minimum number of Compound Redeemable instruments redeeming in exchange for Exchangeable Assets in an instance of Compound Redemption.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, a Compound Redemption Processor is capable of managing individual and multiple instances of Compound Redemption simultaneously or in sequence. A Compound Redemption Processor may organize and track instruments in a database as controlled by the processing logic of the computer system, to insure proper administration of the Compound Redeemable Instruments during their term. The proper implementation and management of the Compound Redemption Processor may affect pricing efficiency and marketability of Compound Redeemable Instruments.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">One part of some embodiments of a Compound Redemption Processor is a data processing system that conveys information about Exchangeable Assets, including valuation information, to the marketplace making such information available in essentially real time, or at least without any significant artificial delays built in.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The data processing system and method for executing trades provides that redeeming, creating, trading, managing and reporting of Compound Redeemable Instruments becomes seamless, automatic and efficient. A linked database in accordance with a stored protocol permits commercial transactions of Compound Redeemable Instruments enabling the distribution and trading of Compound Redeemable Instruments.

In some embodiments, issuance and redemption of the Compound Redeemable instruments takes place on an ongoing basis.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Generally, a Compound Redeemable Instrument is a Financial Instrument that is jointly redeemable with other Issuer instruments belonging to different classes. Instruments of the Issuer may be otherwise difficult to efficiently exchange for value. According to the present invention, specified Compound Redeemable instruments are redeemable for specified assets according to an instance of Compound Redemption. The relative value of the instruments of different classes in an instance of Compound Redemption is determined by market demand and the aggregate value of such instruments is efficiently determined by the value of the specified assets for which they can be exchanged. Multiple types of instruments may be issued as, or transformed into, a Compound Redeemable Instrument.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The use of Compound Redeemable Instruments allows for the creation of one or both of new and improved Financial Instruments which are redeemable in instances of Compound Redemption for Exchangeable Assets.

The derivative may have, for example, a payout linked to equity, housing or even the commodity. Should the market value of the derivative and the equity vary from the commodity, arbitrage opportunities would exist to bring a relative price of the equity and the derivative into balance. In another example, the outstanding shares and bonds of a company can be transformed into Compound Redeemable Instruments jointly redeemable for the finished goods inventory of the Issuer enabling the marketplace to value the &#x2018;Issuers&#x2019; securities on the basis of its marked-up products. In still other embodiments, disparate Compound Redeemable Instruments can be jointly redeemed for one or more Ordinary Redeemable Instruments, such as one or more ETP shares issued by the Issuer of the Compound Redeemable instruments or an affiliated or unaffiliated Issuer.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The present invention provides a Compound Redemption Processor apparatus capable of performing method steps for one or more of managing Assets associated with Compound Obligations, tracking ownership of Assets; and tracking Compound Redemption Obligations.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Compound Redemption Processor may also be capable of creating, distributing, managing, and maintaining a plurality of Compound Redeemable Instruments of a plurality of classes, instruments of one class redeemable together with instruments of one or more other classes in accordance with pre-determined criteria in exchange for specified Exchangeable Assets of one or more classes on an ongoing basis, and also executing trade, transformation, issuance and redemption of such Compound Redeemable Instruments. Compound Redeemable Instruments provide the ability to own and trade a single financial instrument having a unique and attractive matrix of properties allowing enhanced investment opportunities.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">A Compound Redemption Processor includes processors in logical communication with executable code which upon execution causes the processor to be functional to one or more of: create, distribute, manage, maintain, redeem, and extinguish the Compound Redeemable Instruments. A data processor according to the present invention makes possible a fundamentally new kind of instrument by defining and managing the absolute and relative numbers and classes of instruments and assets comprising instances of Compound Redemption, and also facilitating trade, creation and redemption of such Compound Redeemable Instruments thereby facilitating pricing arbitrage and efficient market pricing.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some respects, Compound Redeemable Obligations are based upon a status of Compound Redeemable instruments and CRIs ability to be redeemed in instances of Compound Redemption. Compound Redeemable Instruments therefore have the advantage of being both familiar to investors and superior in their liquidity and transparency based upon properly managed obligations for Assets. The Compound Redeemable Instruments are familiar in terms of the kinds of structures that investors become involved with from a tax and regulatory perspective and offer the same feeling of financial soundness plus the benefits of Compound Redemption. The Compound Redemption Processor is designed to reinforce and confirm these impressions among investors by facilitating the basic functions necessary for the Compound Redeemable Instrument's comparability and advantages compared with other assets.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Apparatus and executable code utilized to create or process CRIs may take into account multiple factual considerations in order to optimize the success of a CRI offering and redemption. Considerations may include, for example, one or more of: a ratio of CRIs redeeming to the number issued; a ratio of assets exchanging as Exchangeable Assets:, a ratio of CRIs to Exchangeable Assets; administration of changes to one or both of the CRIs and the Exchangeable Assets; cash and/or physical settlements; and expense and income attributions.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">According to the present invention, the above functions and other aspects are realized in a CRI System including apparatus and executable software. A CRI Data Processor is linked to a database for managing the process of CR. Investors become holders of CRIs having exchange value by virtue of their ability to be redeemed for EAs. The parameters governing CR instances are periodically adjusted in accord with changes, if any, in the relative and absolute numbers of CRIs redeeming and changes, if any, in the relative and absolute numbers of EAs exchanging. These changes may reflect Issuer-related income, expenses or corporate actions or asset related income, expenses or modifications whether or not the assets are actually owned by the Issuer.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In various embodiments, a CRI database includes digital data descriptive of at least one account, instrument and asset information, and stores parameters that govern an instance on a periodic basis as controlled by processing logic inherent in the executable software. At set intervals the system addresses the proportion of instruments redeeming by changing or not changing the coefficients of the Instrument Unit and the absolute number of instruments redeeming by changing or not changing the multiplier for the Instrument Set. Also at set intervals, the system addresses the proportion of assets exchanging by changing or not changing the coefficients of the Asset Unit and the absolute number as assets redeeming by changing or not changing the multiplier for the Asset Set. The system provides for the creation of Compound Redeemable Instruments by enabling newly created and issued instruments and outstanding instruments for Compound Redemption using the Compound Redemption Processor.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Overview</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a diagram illustrates prior art scenario involving assets grouped in classes, an Issuer and instruments comprising multiple classes.

As such, Instruments <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> are Compound Redeemable Instruments if they can be redeemed in this fashion and Assets <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> are Exchangeable Assets if they are exchangeable in this fashion.

Such interests can include any sort of instrument other than Compound Redeemable instruments including for example equity, debt, contracts, swap agreements, warrants and derivatives which are not redeemable, or which are individually redeemable such as the shares of an open-end mutual fund or certain unit investment trusts.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In other embodiments of the invention, Compound Redeemable Instruments <b>221</b> may include instruments of more than one Issuer <b>210</b>. For example, in some alternative embodiments, Trust A may issue 1000 equity units to investors and a single contract to Trust B using the proceeds to acquire 1000 bonds. Trust B issues 1000 equity units to investors representing interests in the contract acquired from trust A. Trust A and Trust B use Compound Redemption to redeem one Trust A equity unit and one Trust B equity unit (note that these equity units are of disparate classes being equity units of different Issuers) for one bond received by Trust A and a reduction in the notional amount of the contract between Trust A and Trust B (in this example by 1/1000<sup>th</sup>). Similarly, Trust A and Trust B may create equity units and increase the notional of the contract between Trust A and Trust B.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In furtherance of this embodiment, Trust A does not issue a formal contract to Trust B which issues contracts to investors. Trust A and Trust B use Compound Redemption to redeem one Trust A equity unit and one Trust B contract for one bond owned or not owned by Trust A, Similarly, Trust A and Trust B create one Trust A equity unit and one Trust B contract for one bond deposited into Trust A.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In some specific examples., Compound Redeemable Instruments <b>221</b> provide similar economics of Exchange Traded Notes or ETNs with additional flexibility. ETNs generally are obligations of an Issuer that are listed and traded on a securities exchange such as the NYSE and provide investors access to the return of a market index. The return associated with an ETN at maturity or upon redemption is derived from the performance of a benchmark, typically a market index, which may be adjusted for fees and other costs. An investor fee is usually associated with ETNs. The investor fee may be calculated in different ways, but will generally be calculated on a cumulative basis each day based on a yearly fee and the performance of the underlying index.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">ETNs closely track index performance because their payout and redemption value is specified in terms of the benchmark and varies primarily because of fees and costs, but may also vary because of a change in the credit worthiness of the Issuer. This is different as compared to ETFs which hold assets and track one or more indices, assets or other benchmark indicators. FTEs do not have the same type of credit risk associated with ETNs, but may experience other risks including tracking error associated with the management of assets as well as fees and costs.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Two or more CRIs enable investors to track a benchmark with added flexibility compared to a conventional ETN to efficiently achieve more efficient variations of risk and return associated with a benchmark. For example, one ETN which is a CRI can provide the performance of an index, adjusted for fees and other costs, up to and including a cap level and another ETN which is a CRI can provide the performance of an index, adjusted for fees and other costs, above the cap level. The cap level and above cap level ETNs use Compound Redemption to access the Exchangeable Asset which is a cash amount providing the performance of the adjusted index similar to a conventional ETN. However, by investing in relatively more of one ETN or the other, other variations of risk and return can be achieved. Individually, these ETNs resemble conventional structured products which are not redeemable; however, because they are CRIs these structured products are jointly redeemable for cash providing and enhanced liquidity feature compared to conventional structured products.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">For illustrative purposes, and by way of non-limiting example, an Issuer in the above example may be an exchange such, as for example, a futures exchange issuing two classes of contracts with economics similar to the cap level ETN and above cap level ETN where instruments from both classes are jointly redeemable in exchange for the cash value of an index using Compound Redemption.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In another specific example, Class A equity units and Class B equity units are Compound Redeemable Instruments <b>221</b> of an Exchange Traded Fund or ETF Issuer <b>210</b> which holds cash collateral as Exchangeable Assets <b>211</b>. The Class A equity units provide capped long exposure to a reference, such as the Consumer Price Index or Gross Domestic Product, and the Class B equity units are a residual interest effectively providing short capped exposure to the same reference.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In other examples, Exchange Traded Fund shares or ETF shares may be Exchangeable Assets <b>211</b> exchanging for Compound Redeemable Instruments <b>221</b> in one or more instances of Compound Redemption <b>200</b>. ETF shares are generally equity interests in an Issuer that are listed and traded on a securities exchange such as the NYSE and provide investors fully collateralized access to the return of the Issuer's underlying assets which may include securities, commodities, cash and other assets. ETE shares are conventionally redeemable such that a single ETF Share is redeemable for the net asset value of the assets held by the Issuer.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">CRIs of an Issuer where ETF shares comprise Exchangeable Assets enable investors to obtain more efficient variations of risk and return compared to a conventional ETF share. For example, a CRI DIV based on the dividends of stocks comprising an ETF portfolio and a CRI PRICE based on the price return of the same stocks enable investors to customize their exposure to dividends or price return compared to the ETF share. It should be noted that the Issuer of the CRIs and the Issuer of the ETF shares can be the same entity, affiliated Issuers or unaffiliated Issuers.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In one example where the Issuer of the CRIs is the same as the Issuer of the ETF shares, an ETF issues disparate CRI units jointly redeeming for ETF shares. In another example where the Issuers are related, a bank sponsors an ETF issuing ETF shares and an affiliate of the bank sponsors a depositary arrangement issuing certificates of disparate classes jointly redeemable for the ETF shares. In yet another example where the issuers are unrelated, an trust issues CRIs which are contracts and equity units jointly redeemable for ETF shares of an unaffiliated ETF Issuer.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In another embodiment of the invention, issuer <b>210</b> issues Instruments <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> which are not redeemable when issued, but subsequently become Compound Redeemable Instruments <b>221</b>. This might be the case where an Issuer has a class of outstanding equity and a class of outstanding debt that the issuer causes to become Compound Redeemable Instruments <b>221</b> subsequent to the issuance redeeming. in exchange for one or more classes of asset that it owns or will acquire.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In another embodiment of the invention, Issuer <b>210</b> issues Instruments <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> which are not Exchangeable Assets when issued, but subsequently become Exchangeable Assets <b>211</b>.

In this case, the existing, company which is not a CRI Issuer becomes a CRI issuer.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">In some embodiments, an issuer is identified in part based on the Issuer's ability to benefit from Compound Redeemable Instruments. Benefits may include one or more of: generation of fees, improved liquidity of CRI issuances and increased market interest in the Issuer's offerings.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">If a determination is to create a new Issuer, step <b>602</b> includes investment-banking activity aimed at structuring and new Compound Redeemable Instruments. This process contemplates considerations of market demand, legal, tax, regulatory and other issues affecting the proper structuring of the Issuer, including the issuance of Financial instruments.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">At <b>603</b>, Issuer <b>210</b> specifies Compound Redeemable Instruments. In one example, an Issuer is a new special purpose vehicle and the instruments specified are a single class of equity and a single class of debt each to be issued as Compound Redeemable Instruments <b>221</b>. In another example, an Issuer is an existing corporation with one class of equity and one class of convertible bonds outstanding that the Issuer specifies to be Compound Redeemable instruments <b>221</b>. Step <b>603</b> also includes specifying Instrument Units <b>202</b>, Instrument Sets <b>201</b>, Exchangeable Assets <b>211</b>, Asset Units <b>205</b> and Asset Sets <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">The legal and economic form of Compound Redeemable Instruments including collateralization with Exchangeable Assets or other collateral, may be determined in order to be attractive to the marketplace. Compound Redeemable Instruments may be structured, for example, as debt instruments, equity instruments, contractual obligations, hybrids and others, Accordingly, collateral, if any, may be related to one or more instruments or may be separate and apart from any collateral associated with an individual CRI.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">At <b>604</b>, a determination may be made to require the deposit of Exchangeable Assets or other collateral to back the Issuer's obligation to redeem Compound Redeemable Instruments. This step may involve analyzing investment characteristics of assets including whether the assets are hard assets or financial assets and may also include factors such as liquidity, transferability, maturity, coupons, dividends, settlement, payment dates, ratings and market capitalization and estimates as to timing and amount of payments produced under a variety of scenarios.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">If the determination is yes, said assets are received and managed by the Issuer or its agent in step <b>605</b>. In the case of newly issued Compound Redeemable Instruments, the Issuer may receive assets, or the cash equivalent amount used to acquire assets in this step. In the case of existing instruments which may not initially be Compound Redeemable Instruments but are converted into Compound Redeemable Instruments, the Issuer may use existing funding to acquire said assets. The management of the assets is effected by the Issuer or a representative of the Issuer and may include active management, passive management or no management at all. If the determination in step <b>604</b> is not to deposit assets, then the issuer's obligation to redeem Instrument Sets may be based on the Issuer's ability to fulfill its redemption obligation, a third party guarantee or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">At <b>606</b>, the Compound Redeemable Instruments <b>221</b> are implemented in the marketplace. In the case of newly issued Compound Redeemable instruments, the instruments are distributed into the marketplace by offering or otherwise. In the case of existing instruments that are not Compound Redeemable Instruments, but that are convened into Compound Redeemable Instruments, these instruments become Compound Redeemable Instruments <b>221</b> in this step.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">At <b>607</b>, the Issuer supports trading, tracking and reporting of Compound Redeemable Instruments <b>221</b>. This includes the use of electronic computing and networking technologies enabling automated means to perform computation and data processing to support the trading of Compound Redeemable Instruments and reporting of financial documents, financial analysis, market-based valuations, computerized redemption and creation support, and support for various markets including options, futures and lending products and markets tied to Compound Redeemable Instruments.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">At <b>608</b>, the Issuer administers terms of instruments. Terms may include making payments due under the terms of Compound Redeemable Instruments <b>221</b>. The payments may include interest payments, dividend payments, swap payments, payments in settlement of options or contracts or any other distributions required under the terms of the Compound Redeemable Instruments.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">At <b>609</b>, the issuer makes adjustments, if any, to the Instrument Set and Asset Set, Adjustments may be based on changes to the underlying Compound Redeemable Instruments <b>221</b> for corporate events including splits, payments in kind, liquidating dividends, net settlement of contracts or any other events that impact the make-up of Instrument Units. They may also be based on changes to the underlying Exchangeable Assets. For financial assets this might include corporate events including, for example: splits, payments in kind, liquidating dividends, net settlement of contracts or other events that impact the make-up of Asset Units.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">In the case of hard assets, it might include adjustments for spoilage, carrying costs, insurance, damages or others that impact the make-up of Asset Units. Also in step <b>609</b>, the Issuer adjusts or does not adjust the multipliers u <b>206</b> and v <b>203</b> indicating the number of Asset Units <b>205</b> in the Asset Set redeeming per number of Instrument Units <b>202</b> in the Instrument Set. For example, the Issuer may change these on a regular basis to reflect its income or expenses for administrative or other reasons, including those associated with holding Exchangeable Assets or other assets. Alternatively, some or all of the multipliers u and v, the instrument Unit and the Asset Unit may be fixed such that no periodic or other adjustments or determinations are necessary. Alternatively, some or all of the multipliers a and v, the Instrument Unit and the Asset Unit may be fixed such that no periodic or other adjustments or determinations are permitted. Alternatively, some or all of the multipliers u and v, the instrument Unit and the Asset Unit may be fixed such that no periodic or other adjustments or determinations or are permitted other than in specified situations.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">At <b>610</b>, the issuer redeems Compound. Redeemable Instruments <b>221</b> in exchange for Exchangeable Assets <b>211</b> based on the Redemption Ratio number of Asset Units <b>205</b> comprising Exchangeable Assets <b>211</b> or the cash equivalent thereof or both for Instrument Units <b>202</b> comprising Compound Redeemable Instruments <b>221</b> or the cash equivalent thereof or both. The day-to-day operation of the system including various aspects of step <b>609</b> is illustrated in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref></p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">At <b>611</b>, the Issuer distributes Exchangeable Assets <b>211</b> or the cash equivalent thereof or both to the Holder <b>220</b> of the Compound Redeemable Instruments redeeming.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">At <b>612</b>, the determination is made to continue the operations of the Issuer <b>210</b>. If the determination is made to not continue operations, remaining Compound Redeemable Instruments are paid in step <b>615</b> and the Issuer's use of Compound Redeemable instruments is terminated. If the determination is made to continue operations, then determination may be made in step <b>613</b> to expand operations or to not expand operations. If the determination is made to expand operations, then the process is re-started at step <b>603</b>. In, the event that the determination is made to not expand operations then any remaining Compound Redeemable Instruments and associated assets, if any, are managed for the benefit of any remaining Holders until the expiration, if applicable, of said Compound. Redeemable Instruments. If the determination is made to not expand operations, then management of remaining instruments continues in <b>614</b>.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">In some embodiments, in order to keep the Compound Redeemable Instruments as competitive instruments in the marketplace, an Issuer of Compound Redeemable Instruments may, from time to time, reset the terms of the Compound Redeemable Instruments through corporate actions or otherwise, For example, this may be done periodically or in response to economic factors that undesirably alter the attractiveness of the Compound Redeemable Instruments as an investment. This resetting may be done for example to reduce the price of a Compound Redeemable Instrument that is a share of stock through a stock split. Such an event will have ramifications for the determinants of Compound Redemption requiring adjustments within the system. For example, one or more of the coefficients of the Instrument Unit, Asset Unit or Redemption Ratio might require adjustment as a result.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">Various embodiments may also include mechanisms for adjusting the holdings of Exchangeable Assets by the Issuer to a level that insures its ability to make good on Compound Redemptions as they occur. For example, the minimum ratio of Asset Sets to Instrument Sets may be 100% in, the case of an Issuer that is a special purpose vehicle intended to have no credit risk. Alternatively, an operating business Issuer with a strong credit rating and ready access to financing might deem a ratio of Asset Sets to Instrument Sets on hand of 10% to be sufficient. Accordingly, in either case, some embodiments may include an automatic asset purchase plan implemented as an automated part of the system to insure that the proper level is maintained.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">In still other embodiments, the function of establishing the Compound Redeemable instruments and the Redemption Instances may be accomplished and managed by the Compound Redemption Processor in accordance with those methods outlined in example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The operation of this system mandates a communications mechanism between the various entities identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.

Orders are received at <b>705</b> from investors or brokers via access devices such as workports, telephone, telefax, internet or other access devices <b>805</b> or network link <b>970</b>. Orders may consist of market orders (to buy or sell a specific number of a specific Compound Redeemable Instrument at the current market price), limit orders (to buy a specific number of Compound Redeemable Instruments at or below a certain price or to sell a specific number of Compound Redeemable Instruments at or above a certain price) or other kinds of orders.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">Data descriptive of buy and sell orders is stored at <b>710</b> in a pending order list for each Compound Redeemable instrument in what is essentially equivalent to a book window in the trading system, in some embodiments, the buy and sell orders are arranged in the book window with the highest bid at the top of one column and the highest offer at the top of another column, with prices listed in descending value.

As illustrated, the system begins at <b>750</b>. In a subroutine beginning at <b>751</b>, pending order lists corresponding to each Compound Redeemable instrument are individually accessed and searched. At <b>752</b>, if a buy order for a Compound Redeemable Instrument is matched with an identical, sell order for a Compound Redeemable instrument, those instruments are traded at <b>753</b> without the creation or redemption of any additional Compound Redeemable Instruments. Orders can be removed from the pending order list at <b>754</b> and processing returns to <b>752</b> to search for additional matching orders. When no additional matches are present in the pending order list for the current Compound Redeemable Instrument, the &#x201c;no&#x201d; path from <b>752</b> is followed and processing loops <b>755</b> to the next Compound Redeemable Instrument in the system.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">When all matching orders in the system have been processed, logic extends to <b>755</b>, whereupon the buy orders in the pending order lists for all Compound Redeemable Instruments in the system are together searched to determine whether to form an Instrument Set. An instrument Set comprises the Compound Redeemable Instruments in a Redemption Instance <b>200</b>. The sum of the buy orders in the Instrument Set is compared to the acquisition value of the Exchangeable Assets in the Asset Set at <b>757</b>. If the sum of the buy orders in the instrument Set exceeds the acquisition value of the Exchangeable Assets in the Asset Set, <b>757</b> branches to a processing routine, beginning at <b>758</b>, for creating new Compound Redeemable Instruments then deletes these buy orders from the pending order list at <b>758</b>.<b>5</b>, before returning to loop <b>756</b> to search for additional Instrument Sets.

In each case, the critical controlling data must be stored in the properly configured database.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">The first of these three functions is important, as success in offering requires identifying the appropriate risk categories and structural design for the Redemption Instance. Demand for Compound Redeemable Instruments and associated Exchangeable Assets may be changing all the time.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">For example, in some embodiments, investor demand for Compound Redeem able instruments linked to large capitalization exchange-listed equities may suddenly change to demand linked to small capitalization exchange-listed equities because of changes in market sentiment. In another example, investor demand for Compound Redeemable Instruments with a high ratio of Asset Sets owned by the Issuer compared to Instrument Sets outstanding may be particularly important to investors in times of credit sensitivity, whereas in times of stable markets, an Issuer's credit alone may be sufficient to back potential redemptions of Compound Redeemable Instruments. The system can be designed to allow the creation of new Compound Redeemable Instruments as automatically as possible by a trained representative of the system proprietor operating the Compound Redemption Processor or even possibly by broker clients themselves. If the cost of creating new Compound Redeemable Instruments is kept relatively low, then many more such Compound Redeemable instruments should ultimately be created.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">In sonic embodiments, the first function can be accomplished in accordance with an exemplary logic flow chart such as the one depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Logic conceptually begins at a &#x201c;start&#x201d; position <b>1000</b> and continues to <b>1005</b> wherein an indicative Redemption instance under consideration, Instance (I), is entered by the system user.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">Instance(I) may include relevant indicative terms of each of the two or more Compound Redeemable Instruments of different classes under consideration including their legal structures whether they be debt, equity, contract or otherwise, their maturity if applicable, their payoff structure, collateral backing, underlying reference indices or other return determinants. It may also include identification of the contemplated Exchangeable Assets for Redemption Instances and specify an indicative number and ratio of Compound Redeemable Instruments comprising the Instrument Set redeeming in exchange for the indicative number and ratio of Exchangeable Assets comprising the Asset Set. The contemplated Exchangeable Assets so identified may include Exchangeable Assets not yet in existence, such as for example ETP shares of an ETP contemplated by the proposed Issuer of the Compound Redeemable Instruments or contemplated by an issuer that may be affiliated with or not affiliated with the issuer of the Compound Redeemable Instruments.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">The processes involved with CRI issuance and redemption may directly access multiple aspects of the Issuer's Financial Structure, unlike previously known devices, such as Primes and Scores, and Super Fund, which split one aspect.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">The system may first test whether or not a Redemption Instance under consideration is new and cannot be approximated by either an existing. Redemption Instance; a Redemption instance already defined; a Redemption Instance with slightly different terms; or by groupings or combinations of thereof.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">In an initial run <b>1010</b>, a CRI system can search over existing Redemption instances, the possibilities for new Redemption Instances with slightly different terms, or groupings or combinations thereof in order to display the characteristics of the Redemption Instances that may be thus generated.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">In some embodiments, another Redemption Instance with slightly different terms may be close enough to that proposed. Some embodiments may therefore include a user that signals that an entered Redemption Instance is not sufficiently new, or if one of the possibilities put forward is satisfactory, logic branches to <b>1015</b> and existing records are pulled from a database for the already extant Redemption Instance including the instruments and assets or group thereof comprising the instance, with logic shifted to a separate subroutine <b>1020</b>.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">In some circumstances, such as, for example, in a corporate financing for an operating Issuer, a Redemption Instance that is not otherwise considered sufficiently new still results in a positive response to test <b>1010</b>.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">A positive response to test <b>1010</b> branches logic to <b>1025</b> wherein the parameters of the Compound Redeemable Instruments and Exchangeable Assets including the numbers and classes of Compound Redeemable Instruments redeeming in exchange for Exchangeable Assets, are specified. Requirements concerning the relative proportion of different classes of Compound Redeemable Instruments permitted to be outstanding can be specified and the instruments can be created. It is contemplated that in certain cases this limitation will correspond to coefficients of redemption for each specified class and in other cases it will not. The requirement l&#x2032;or collateral, if any, in the form of Exchangeable Assets or otherwise to back instances of redemption is specified. The system continues to <b>1030</b> wherein the database is updated to include the specified information.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">At <b>1035</b> a CRI system may query concerning a default cycle for reviewing the Redemption instance for adjustment. A negative response to the query allows custom entry of a controlling cycle at <b>1050</b> setting the time interval or other interval determinant between adjustments. A positive response defaults the controlling interval to a system-stored value, <b>1040</b> and <b>1045</b>. This completes the first portion of the processing with logic shifted to the next sequence, <b>1055</b>.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">It is appreciated that a single Issuer can provide for more than one type of Redemption Instance comprising different sets of instruments and assets and apply the above logic running in parallel or staggered to two or more different types of Redemption Instances Involving similar or different Compound Redeemably Instruments, Exchangeable Assets, Instrument Sets and Asset Sets compared to other Redemption Instances.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, formulation of the Redemption Instance and associated computer files and displays forming the foundation for the Redemption Instance in some embodiments is accomplished by the logic commands shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. Beginning at <b>1100</b>, a Process Manager may provide a server running executable software with logic that may first enable the entry of the pending Redemption Instance, Instance(I) <b>1105</b>. This may include the Instrument Set and Asset Set comprising said Redemption Instance. The software may check whether an Instance is a new Instance at <b>1110</b>. If it is not a new instance, the system is directed to a separate subroutine <b>1115</b>. If it is a new Instance, the logic continues to <b>1120</b> wherein the parameters specifying the Redemption Instance are entered. This may include an Instrument Set, coefficient v, Instrument Unit, coefficients r<sub>1-x</sub>, and Compound Redeemable Instruments R<sub>1-x</sub>. It may also include the Asset Set, coefficient u, Asset Unit, coefficients e<sub>1-d</sub>, and Exchangeable Assets E<sub>1-d</sub>.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">At <b>1130</b> the logic queries whether collateral is required to back the Issuer's redemption obligations under the Redemption instance. If yes, the Collateral Balance required per Redemption Instance can be entered at <b>1135</b>. The Collateral may take the form of any type of collateral in any amount specified by the system including Exchangeable Assets or other collateral in an amount less than, equal to or greater than that sufficient to satisfy the requirement of the Issuer to distribute Exchangeable Assets in a Redemption Instance. Implementation is made at <b>1140</b> wherein the collateral account is set up. This account may be held and managed by a third party or the Issuer or some combination thereof. The account may be managed actively, passively or not at all. The system checks in <b>1145</b> whether custom account parameters are required. If yes, entry occurs in <b>1150</b>, otherwise default values are entered in <b>1155</b>.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">In addition, the system may generate instructions to maintain at least one account associated with each user. The account may include enumerations of Compound Redeemable Instruments and instrument Sets and enumerations of the Exchangeable Assets and the Asset Sets. In some embodiments, currency amounts for which the Compound Redeemable Instruments may be redeemed and created may also be tracked and maintained. The system may maintain the at least one account for a user. In preferred embodiments, the one or mote accounts for a user are maintained on an ongoing basis.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">As previously described, the system may include a communications link between various participants and governing institutions. A book window is created at <b>1160</b> for traders on the trading system, indicating the initial instrument Set comprising Compound Redeemable Instruments redeeming in exchange for the initial Asset Set comprising Exchangeable Assets even though no instruments yet exist. As such, in some exemplary embodiments, customers may place orders that will appear on the book window. To create a first instrument Set, a CRI trading system may first identify an Instrument Set whose offer price equals (or exceeds) the offer price of the Asset Set unless the issuer is willing to risk potential losses by allowing for the creation of Instruments for less than their redemption cost. Unless an Issuer creates a first Instrument Set by transforming outstanding instruments that are not Compound Redeemable Instruments into Compound Redeemable Instruments, when an Instrument Set is first created the Issuer must be notified with the transfer of funds or assets in payment of said Instrument Set. This is the case unless funds or assets are to be transferred to a repository other than the issuer such as a bank, or similar repository of capital, in which case creation of the Instrument Set is specified in advance. Thereafter, the system can fill orders both by exchanging existing Compound. Redeemable Instruments and by finding, Instrument Sets among orders <b>1165</b>. During the routine operation of the system, the system proprietor will be directly responsible for calculating and updating the parameters comprising the Redemption Instance and administering the Collateral Account. The Issuer is appraised in <b>1170</b>.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> after the database is updated with current (and new) Redemption Instance specifications logic queries on the next Instance value (I+1) at 1.175; if another batch is ready, logic continues to the beginning and the process is repeated for the next in series, If no batch is ready processing ends at <b>1180</b>.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, in some embodiments, day-to-day operation of a CRI system can include analysis of a variety of time-varying inputs and selective calculation of a number of distinct variables to allow operation of the process of Compound Redemption. A number and proportion of Compound Redeemable Instruments redeeming in exchange for a number and proportion of Exchangeable Assets is processed by the system in the Redemption Instance as previously illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, several of the operations and routine procedures enabling the Redemption Instance are depicted as examples of system processing, recognizing that many other variables are tracked in like fashion and many other variations of the system are possible.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">Beginning with <b>1200</b>, logic in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> first inputs the current date, date(T), and enters this into the process at <b>1205</b>. The file for the current Instrument Unit is recalled and read in <b>1210</b>. The event date for a change in any of the instruments comprising the Instrument Unit is compared to the present date to determine if the current date is an event date for adjusting the Instrument Unit. A positive response to test <b>1215</b> reflects the match of dates causing logic of the system to recall the proportion of Compound Redeemable Instruments R<sub>1-x </sub>according to coefficients r<sub>1-x </sub>comprising the current Instrument Unit <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> <b>202</b> in <b>1220</b>. A determination is made in <b>1225</b> as to whether die Instrument Unit requires rebalancing to reflect changes, if any, in its composition for reasons of operation of the instruments such as corporate actions, maturity events, or distributions affecting Compound Redeemable Instruments, legal or regulatory requirements or marketing reasons. For example, a 2:1 split in common equity Compound Redeemable Instruments may result in double the number of shares after the Instrument Unit adjustment. In the event that the determination calls for rebalancing, the database is updated in <b>1230</b> accordingly to reflect the new composition of the instrument Unit.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">Continuing, the system can recall and read the file for the current Asset Unit in <b>1235</b>. The event date is compared to the present date to determine if the current date is an event date for adjusting the Asset Unit.

The discussion is meant to be illustrative and not limiting in character.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0402">In some embodiments, an Issuer may be a legal entity such as a trust issuing two classes of Compound Redeemable Instruments in a private placement exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. The Compound Redeemable Instruments may be resold in accordance with Rule <b>144</b>A. Generally, Rule <b>144</b>A permits the resale of certain unregistered securities to Qualified Institutional Buyers without requiring registration under the 1933 Act. The CR is are traded on the NASDAQ PORTAL Alliance system or other similar private services enabling a certain amount of liquidity among institutional buyers without listing on a national exchange or registering under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and rely on Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 which provides an exemption from its provisions for Qualified Purchasers.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0403">One class may comprise derivative contracts of a single type and another class may comprise units of trust equity of a single type. In exchange for issuing the contracts and the units, the trust deposits Exchangeable Assets comprising bonds of an unaffiliated issuer. The instruments redeem as an Instrument Set. Each Instrument Set including ten instrument Units each Instrument Unit including one contract and one unit of trust equity redeeming in exchange for assets exchanging as an Asset Set each including one Asset Unit comprising one bond or the cash equivalent thereof.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0404">Conversely, instruments issue as an instrument Set each comprising ten Instrument Units each comprising one said contract and one said unit issuing in exchange for the deposit of assets as Asset Sets each comprising one Asset Unit each comprising one said bond or the cash equivalent thereof. Redemptions and issuances take place through a Depositor charging a fee. Said contracts and units own and trade separately until redeemed or maturing in the case of said contract. Redeeming instruments may be retained, extinguished or reissued by the Issuer.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0405">Contracts may include terms selected from a broad universe of terms including virtually any payoff formulation and underlying reference either singly or in combination including those that may or may not be possible to buy, hold, sell or otherwise invest in either directly or indirectly. Examples of such payoff formulations include any linear, exponential, digital or other mathematical formulation. Examples of such underlying references may include any flow, claim, return, price, level, outcome, statistical result, event or other measurable effect. Units represent a residual value in the trust Issuer after all expenses of the trust and the payments due under the terms of the contract.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0406">As a result, amounts payable under said unit and said contract may vary inversely to each other and may be limited in aggregate by the value of the bonds. In the event that the terms of the contract are not self-limiting, its payout may equal or exceed the corresponding, value of said bonds such that the value of the said units would be driven to zero.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0407">In some embodiments, the present invention provides benefits of a derivative contract with additional liquidity and transparency and without the counter-party risk, hedging limitations, and costs associated with traditional dealer offerings, among others. This distinguishes over other products which do not offer the ability to jointly redeem instruments of a plurality of different classes of interests to accomplish such benefits.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0408">In furtherance of the preceding specific exemplary embodiment, the terms of the contract provide for payment of an amount on the maturity date of the contract two years hence equal to the price one week prior to the maturity date of a single share of stock listed on a nationally recognized stock exchange. As the price of the stock increases the contract becomes more valuable reflecting its likely increased payoff amount on the maturity date. Because the trust owns bonds that pay a fixed amount, the anticipated residual value available to units reduces as the payoff on the contract increases. As a result, the equity unit resembles a short position in the stock increasing in value as the stock declines and decreasing in value as the stock increases. Unlike an actual short position in the stock, the holder of the unit cannot lose more than the cost of the unit. Compared to traditional means for shorting stock, the system provides a more efficient less cumbersome alternative eliminating the need to locate, borrow and sell shares thereby eliminating the costs, inefficiencies and risks associated with locating stock, borrowing stock, losing the ability to borrow stock, selling shares, repurchasing shares, paying stock lending intermediaries, stock borrow fees and fees associated with posting and managing collateral, among others. In addition, compared to selling a single stock futures the unit is appealing as a cash instrument with a limited downside unlike a single stock futures position where the potential loss is unlimited.</p><p id="p-0364" num="0409">In furtherance of the preceding specific exemplary embodiment, the contract may be based on climate measurements or the performance of a sports team.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0410">In another specific exemplary embodiment, a newly formed ETF issues one class of shares in a public offering subject to the Securities Act of 1933 Act, the Investment Company Act of 1940 Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Contemporaneously, the ETF or an affiliate, such as a depositary account or custodial arrangement, issues Compound Redeemable Instruments of disparate classes jointly redeeming for Exchangeable Assets comprising the ETF shares. In one example, a first disparate class receives dividend payments based on a stock portfolio held by the ETF and a second disparate class receives payments based on the residual value of the stock portfolio. In another example, a first disparate class receives payments based on the best performing shares in a stock portfolio held by the ETF, a second disparate class receives payments based on the worst performing shares in the portfolio and a third disparate class receives payments based on the average performance of the shares in the portfolio. In another example, a first disparate class receives positively leveraged payments based on the performance of a bond portfolio held by the ETF, and a second disparate class receives negatively leveraged payments based on the performance of the bond portfolio. In still another example, a first disparate class receives payments based on the positive return of a real estate index not held by an ETF invested in fixed income and equity securities, and a second disparate class receives payments based on the negative return of the real estate index.</p><p id="p-0366" num="0411">In another specific exemplary embodiment., a newly formed issuer is a corporation issuing four classes of Compound Redeemable Instruments in a private placement exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. The Compound Redeemable Instruments may be resold in accordance with Rule 144A permitting the resale of certain unregistered securities to qualified institutional buyers without requiring registration under the 1933 Act, are traded on the NASDAQ PORTAL Alliance system enabling a certain amount of liquidity among institutional buyers without listing on a national exchange or registering under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and rely on Section 3(c)(7) of the investment Company Act of 1940 which provides an exemption from its provisions for Qualified Purchasers. Three classes comprise bonds with terms separate and distinct from each other class and another class comprises equity shares of the Issuer. In exchange for issuing the bonds and the shares the corporation deposits Exchangeable Assets comprising a pool of notes backed by similar residential real estate mortgages on units in a condominium development.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0412">The instruments may redeem as an Instrument Set each comprising 2 Instrument Units each comprising four hundred of the bonds of one class, three hundred of the bonds of another class, two hundred of the bonds of another class and one hundred of the shares in exchange for assets exchanging as an Asset Set each comprising 1 Asset Unit comprising two said mortgages. Conversely, instruments issue as an Instrument Set each comprising 2 instrument Units each comprising, four hundred of the bonds of one class, three hundred of the bonds of another class, two hundred of the bonds of another class and one hundred of the shares issuing in exchange for the deposit of assets as an Asset Set each comprising one Asset Unit each comprising two said mortgages.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0413">Redemption and issuance takes place directly with an Issuer charging a fee. The bonds and the shares own and trade separately until redeemed or maturing in the case of said bonds. Redeeming instruments may be retained, extinguished or reissued by the Issuer. The bonds of each class of bonds comprise terms selected from a broad universe of terms including virtually any combination of interest payments, interest payment dates, maturity dates, seniority, and others, one or more of which are different compared to bonds of each other class. The share represents the residual value in the company after all expenses of the company and the payments due under the terms of the bonds. The bonds provide security of terms in their seniority to each other and to the shares. The shares benefit from unlimited upside leveraged by the bonds. The system provides the benefits of more efficient leverage resulting from increased liquidity and transparency of Compound Redeemable instruments compared to other instruments not Compound Redeemable Instruments.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0414">In furtherance of the preceding exemplary embodiment, the Issuer is an existing corporation with additional outstanding instruments that are not Compound Redeemable Instruments.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0415">In another specific exemplary embodiment, the financial structure of an existing publicly registered corporate Issuer comprises one class of publicly listed thinly traded shares and one class of illiquid bonds neither being Compound Redeemable Instruments. Subsequently, said Issuer converts said classes including all outstanding and future issues of each into Compound Redeemable Instruments redeeming in exchange for Exchangeable Assets comprising readily marketable widgets of said Issuer's manufacture. Said Compound Redeemable Instruments redeem as an Instrument Set each comprising 3 Instrument Units each comprising 11 shares and 1 bond exchanging for an Asset Set each comprising one Asset Unit each comprising 1000 Exchangeable Assets each Exchangeable Asset representing one said widget.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0416">The system provides liquidity and transparency to the Issuer's securities by enabling a market to place an objective value on an Instrument Set enabling arbitrageurs to create and redeem shines and bonds jointly against said value.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0417">The system thereby stimulates market interest in the issuer's securities enabling the Issuer to raise capital more efficiently. The system enables the Issuer to &#x201c;buy back&#x201d; its securities at a discount as a result of the profit margin that it builds into the widgets in accordance with its normal operations. The system enables the use of widgets to redeem its instruments thereby reducing inventory, increasing the volume of widget production and improving profit margins. The system accomplishes this without requiring the Issuer to place a relative value on its Shares compared to its bonds.
