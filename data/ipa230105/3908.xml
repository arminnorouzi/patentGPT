end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to nuclear imaging. More particularly, this disclosure relates to attenuation correction in positron emission tomography (PET).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">PET is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that produces a three-dimensional image representing the distribution of positron emitting isotopes within a body. As the radioisotope undergoes positron emission decay (also known as positive beta decay), it emits the antimatter counterpart of electrons. As the positrons lose energy, they ultimately encounter and annihilate with electrons, usually producing a pair of annihilation (gamma) photons moving in opposite directions. The PET system determines the line along which the annihilation occurred, by detecting the pair of gamma photons in time coincidence.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Attenuation correction in PET imaging is an important component for the production of artifact-free, quantitative data. The most attenuation correction methods are based on measured transmission scans acquired before, during, or after the emission scan. The ability to acquire high-quality transmission data is beneficial in achieving accurate attenuation correction.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Attenuation in PET imaging is the loss of detection of true coincidence events because of their absorption in the body or due to their scattering out of the detector field of view (FOV). In PET imaging two photons must escape the patient simultaneously to be detected as a true event. The loss of true coincidence event detection due to attenuation in PET imaging can range between 50 to 95%.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Loss of counts due to attenuation increases image noise, image artifacts, and image distortion. Without attenuation correction, significant artifacts which may occur on whole-body PET scans include: (1) prominent activity at body surface edges due to relative lack of attenuation at the surfaces compared to deeper structures, (2) distorted appearance of areas of intense activity (e.g. urinary bladder) due to variable degrees of attenuation in different directions of activity originating from these areas, and (3) diffuse, relatively increased activity in tissues of relatively low attenuation (e.g. lungs). Therefore, attenuation correction of data is necessary for accurate measurements of PET scan data.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In PET/CT systems, x-rays from a CT scan are used to construct an attenuation map of density differences throughout the imaging target region that can then be used to correct for the absorption of the photons emitted from the fluorodeoxyglucose decay in the emission scan. However, such integrated PET/CT systems require the additional CT scanning hardware to be integrated with the PET imaging hardware. Thus, it would be useful if a transmission type scan data can be obtained using a PET scanner without the additional transmission scanning hardware such as a CT scanner to construct attenuation map. Such ability to obtain transmission type scan data in a PET scanner system for generating attenuation map would be useful in PET/MR systems also as the MR systems do not measure all of the things in the system that attenuate radiation in PET scans. For example, PET/MR systems use coils and the associated electronics and cables which attenuate the annihilation photons but, by design, they are ignored so that they do not show up in the MR images and their effect on annihilation photon attenuation cannot be accounted for.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some PET scanner designs have been proposed in which attenuation correction is derived from background radiation emitted in the lutetium-based scintillation crystals in the detectors themselves (e.g. LSO or LYSO scintillation crystals, for example). However, the intensity of the LSO background radiation is generally too low to be used in patient scans of normal duration. Thus, improved PET scanners that can generate transmission imaging data faster to generate attenuation &#x3bc;-map without the CT hardware would be beneficial.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Provided is a PET scanner system that comprises a gantry; a plurality of PET detector ring assemblies provided within the gantry, where each detector ring assembly comprises a plurality of PET detectors arranged in a ring configuration around a central opening, where the plurality of PET detector ring assemblies are coaxially aligned along a longitudinal axis defined through the central openings; a patient tunnel extending through the central openings of the coaxially aligned PET detector ring assemblies, wherein the plurality of PET detector assemblies are coaxially aligned along a length of the patient tunnel, wherein each of the plurality of PET detectors comprising a detector and one or more scintillator crystals associated with the detector; and one or more stationary gamma-ray sources provided in each of the PET detector ring assembly within the gantry.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also provided is a method for using one or more stationary gamma-ray sources provided in a PET scanner as a transmission scan radiation source for generating scan data that can be used to generate attenuation maps, where the PET scanner comprises a plurality of PET detector ring assemblies.

A human subject <b>4</b> for PET scanning is shown positioned inside a gantry <b>210</b> of the PET scanner system <b>200</b>. The gantry <b>210</b> comprises a plurality of PET detector rings <b>100</b>. Each detector ring comprises multiple scintillating crystals <b>216</b> and the associated detector <b>213</b>. The open space in the center of the detector rings <b>100</b> define the patient tunnel T of the gantry <b>210</b> and the FOV of the PET scanner. When a PET scan is performed, a positron-emitting radioisotope <b>6</b> is introduced into the human subject <b>4</b> on metabolically active molecules. The metabolically active molecules are then carried to an organ of interest by the human subject's blood flow.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">When a positron emitted from the radioisotope now inside the human subject encounters an electron, both are annihilated, yielding two gamma photons <b>7</b> that travel in approximately opposite directions. The annihilation events are identified by a time coincidence between the detection of the two gamma photons by two oppositely disposed detectors by the interaction of the gamma photons with the detector's scintillating crystals <b>216</b>, i.e., the gamma photon emissions are detected virtually simultaneously by each detector <b>213</b>.

To provide the PET scanner with a facility to generate a simultaneous transmission scan data during PET scan sessions, one or more stationary gamma-ray sources <b>130</b> are incorporated into each of the PET detector ring assembly <b>100</b> in the gantry <b>210</b>. Each of the PET detector ring assembly <b>100</b> comprises a plurality of detector electronic assemblies <b>110</b> arranged in a ring configuration around the patient tunnel T. Each detector electronic assembly <b>110</b> includes, among other things, a detector <b>213</b> (a photo-detector), associated one or more scintillator crystals <b>216</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is schematic and for simplifying the illustration, the detector <b>213</b> and the associated one or more scintillator crystals <b>216</b> are, as a group, referred to as a PET detector block <b>214</b>. This nomenclature will be carried through the remainder of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The stationary gamma-ray source <b>130</b> is located within the PET gantry <b>210</b> and positioned close to but behind the PET detector blocks <b>214</b> away from the patient tunnel T so that some of the gamma photons from the gamma-ray source forward scatter through a first scintillator crystal associated with a first PET detector block <b>214</b><i>a, </i>then across the PET scanner's FOV to a second scintillator crystal associated with a second PET detector block <b>214</b><i>b </i>on the opposite side of the PET scanner's FOV. The gamma-ray sources <b>130</b> are preferably positioned within the PET gantry <b>210</b> for practical reasons to shield and contain the gamma rays within the PET scanner.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the arrow <b>11</b> represents an exemplary gamma-photon forward scattering through the first scintillator crystal of the first detector block <b>214</b><i>a, </i>then the arrow <b>12</b> represents the trajectory of the scattered gamma-photon crossing the PET scanner's FOV and reaching the second scintillator crystal of the second detector block <b>214</b><i>b. </i>The scattered gamma-photon is denoted by <b>12</b>. Because the forward scattered gamma-photon <b>12</b> goes through the FOV, by identifying sufficient number of such forward scattered gamma-photons via the PET scanner's coincidence electronics, the scattered gamma-photons <b>12</b> can be used for transmission imaging in that PET scanner.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some preferred embodiments, the one or more stationary gamma-ray sources <b>130</b> in each detector ring assembly <b>100</b> are positioned behind the detector blocks <b>214</b>. This configuration allows more of the gamma-photons emitting from the gamma-ray source <b>130</b> to forward scatter through the scintillator crystals in one or more nearby detector blocks <b>214</b> thus increasing the amount of radiation for the transmission imaging.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, providing and identifying a sufficient number of forward scattered gamma-photons for transmission imaging would be more practicably achieved by providing a plurality of stationary gamma-ray sources <b>130</b> in each of the PET detector ring assembly <b>100</b>. All of the gamma-ray sources <b>130</b> are located behind the PET detector blocks <b>214</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. Being positioned behind the PET detector blocks <b>214</b> refers to a position that is anywhere on the side of the detector blocks <b>214</b> that is facing away from the patient tunnel T. The gamma-ray sources <b>130</b> can be positioned anywhere within the gantry as long as they are behind the PET detector blocks <b>214</b>. However, in some preferred embodiments, each stationary gamma-ray source <b>130</b> is positioned to align between a pair of detector electronics assemblies <b>100</b>, i.e., in between two sets of PET detector blocks <b>214</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C</figref>, to maximize the detection of the forward scattering photons by the detectors. If a gamma-ray source is directly behind a detector, that corresponds to zero-degree scatter which cannot be detected because the scattering process in that case leaves almost no energy in the detector where it scatters. The scattering process is not detectable until the energy left behind in scattering is above the threshold of the detector electronics (the particular threshold value varies depending on the PET scanner manufacturer but an example is about 150 keV), so the most favorable scatter angles are about 40 degrees or more. This can be achieved by positioning the stationary gamma-ray source <b>130</b> behind the PET detector blocks <b>214</b> and between a pair of detector electronic assemblies <b>110</b>. When the gamma-ray source is positioned behind the PET detector blocks <b>214</b> and between a pair of detector electronic assemblies <b>110</b>, the two detector blocks <b>214</b> to either side are well positioned for scattering.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">All of the stationary gamma-ray sources <b>130</b> would be emitting some gamma-photons that forward scatter through the FOV thus providing more radiation necessary for transmission imaging. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is merely a schematic illustration and the number of detector electronic assemblies, detector blocks <b>214</b>, and the gamma-ray sources <b>130</b> illustrated do not represent the actual numbers that would be in an actual PET scanner system employing the embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">With this configuration, the scattering event in a first scintillator crystal in the first PET detector block <b>214</b><i>a </i>provides the start signal for the coincidence electronics and the detection of the scattered gamma photon <b>12</b> by a second scintillator crystal in the second PET detector block <b>214</b><i>b </i>provides the stop signal for the coincidence electronics to detect coincidence. A photon from the gamma-ray source undergoes Compton scattering in a scintillating crystal of the first PET detector block <b>214</b><i>a. </i>Some of the photon's energy is transferred to an electron in the scintillator, and this electron is immediately stopped by its interaction with the scintillator, resulting in a flash of light in one scintillator crystal of the first PET detector block <b>214</b><i>a, </i>this resulting in a start signal for the coincidence electronics.

Cs-137 is a good choice for the gamma-ray source <b>130</b> because the gamma ray energy is favorable, somewhat above 511 keV normally used in PET, but not so high that the gamma rays are out of the range normally used by many PET detectors. Also, the half-life of 30 years for Cs-137 is advantageous because the source would never need replacement in the expected life of the PET scanner. Also, there is just one gamma ray per decay whereas other isotopes have multiple gamma rays of different energies.

The middle row shows the net-true histograms with the LSO background subtracted, with a correction for the different scan times. The column representing scan 1 shows the expected energy spectra, including a spectrum of beta and gamma radiation in one detector and a 202 or 307-keV photopeak in the other one. The scan-2 column shows normal PET coincidences with several features of interest. Near the upper right corner, one sees a small circular pattern representing 511 keV photopeaks in each detector. Below this and to the left, one sees the signature of scattered radiation in the source or in one of the detectors, including another prominent feature at the low end of the energy range, representing 511-keV backscatter through angles near 180 degrees. Also shown as a diagonal box in part 2-B is the locus of points for which E<sub>A</sub>+E<sub>B</sub>=511 keV, E<sub>A </sub>and E<sub>B </sub>representing the energies of the pair of coincidence events referred to as A and B. These represent backscatter of 511-keV photons, like the line DF in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Most of the backscatter overlaps with the LSO background. The scan-3 column, where one photon at a time was emitted from the cesium source, shows random coincidences in the bottom row but these disappear in the top row where delayed coincidences have been subtracted. In this case another diagonal locus is shown, representing E<sub>A</sub>+E<sub>B</sub>=662 keV, for each pair of coincidence events A and B generated by the 662-keV photons from the cesium source. These represent backscatter of 662-keV photons from the cesium source. Again, this signature of backscatter overlaps strongly with the LSO background. The scan-4 column shows the forward-scattered radiation on lines like GH in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The locus of points representing E<sub>A</sub>+E<sub>B</sub>=662 keV is again shown. Notably, the signature of these photon pairs did not overlap as strongly with the LSO background radiation.

The maximum singles rate was about 1&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>counts/block in the area near the cesium source, compared to about 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>counts/block in areas where singles were mainly from LSO background radiation. The shape of the distribution confirmed that the source position was about 25 cm beyond the detectors. One expects that the actual amount of radiation striking the detectors was more than this, because the singles rate only included events in which the deposited energy was above the arming threshold of about 150 keV, and one expects roughly half of 662-keV Compton scattering to result in a recoiling electron with energy below that. A simple simulation suggested that about 40% of the incident radiation was detected in singles mode. Other relevant effects include absorption and scattering by materials between the detector crystals and the sources, for example electronics and an aluminum channel, 3 to 8 mm thick, to hold coolant that stabilized the detectors during use.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows the net-true sinograms from scans 1, 4, and 5 (parts A, B, C of the figure) and also the ratio of the scan-5 sinogram to the scan-4 sinogram (part D).

The LSO-background sinogram from scan 1 was mainly featureless except for the expected pattern of high and low values at the edges of detector blocks, and the lower number of counts in the middle, due to solid-angle variations with position. The cesium spectrum from scan 4 featured a prominent diagonally-oriented feature due to forward-scattered radiation. As expected, sinogram regions corresponding to small-angle scatter were reduced in brightness because less than 150 keV was imparted to the crystal where scattering occurred, that is, the electron recoil energy was too low to detect.

The investigation showed that forward-scattered cesium gamma rays can provide such a speed-up. Use of the forward-scattering gamma-photon approach of the present disclosure provides advantages such as: the hardware, stationary gamma-ray sources, can be straightforwardly built into the PET scanner; only a few, simple moving parts for the gamma-ray source housing may be needed; potentially no CT scanner is needed; and nothing blocks the PET FOV or restrict the PET FOV diameter.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0067">In a carefully engineered implementation, the sources would be provided with collimating shielding, allowing gamma rays directed toward the detectors to shine with full intensity whereas gamma rays directed in other directions would be absorbed by the shielding, reducing radiation exposure to people near the scanner.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0068">There are reasons to suppose that the speed-up or sensitivity gain predicted by equation (4) underestimates the advantages of the forward-scattering approach. First, the scan-1 sinogram, used in this analysis, combined the 202 and 307-keV gamma rays emitted by <sup>176</sup>LU; yet experience has shown that it may be better to use only the 307 keV one. Second, the forward-scattered gamma rays from cesium mostly have higher energy than lutetium gamma rays. Once can see this from part 4B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Higher energy results in advantages including lower attenuation as radiation penetrates through phantoms and patients' bodies. Also, less scatter is expected, and fewer complications due to backscattering of 511-keV radiation from the patient.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0069">Physical effects at the low end of the energy range are important in the use of forward-scattered radiation. This is shown by part (B) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The angular distribution of Compton scattering at 662 keV favors small angles, yet scattering at the smallest angles leaves only a little energy in the scintillator crystal, and this may be below the scanner's low-energy threshold. As a consequence, much of the scattered radiation cannot be detected. The use of multiple cesium sources, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, results in a sinogram without sharply defined edges. This is shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, where nineteen source positions have been combined with a calculation.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0070">A figure of merit called coincidence efficiency was introduced to account for the relative efficiencies of the two methods. LSO background and cesium forward scattering. Equation (5) and Table I indicates that LSO background radiation can be used efficiently because <sup>176</sup>Lu beta decays are detected in nearly 100% of all decays, and two gamma rays are emitted in each decay. In the experiment, the cesium source was positioned close to the ring of PET detectors, resulting in a solid angle of 6.3% of 4&#x3c0; steradians. Considering all factors, the forward-scattering method was shown to be fairly efficient, 1.24&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>compared to 3.72&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>in the case of LSO background. To explain why some coincidences that might have been detected were in fact not seen, one calls attention to three effects. First, some of the 662-keV gamma rays may have passed through the detectors without interacting at all, or were scattered or absorbed by materials between the source and the scintillator. These effects are estimated to account for a loss of about 40% in the case of the detector blocks closest to the cesium source. Second, some of the gamma rays may have entered the detectors and scattered through angles less than 40 degrees, leaving an amount of energy that fell below the detection threshold. This effect is estimated to reduce detection rates by another factor of about 40%, based on simple analysis of the Compton scattering formula with weighting by the sine of the scattering angle. These two effects, by themselves, account for most of the missing coincidences. A third type of effect also happened where after scattering, most of the photons were not directed toward a detector on the other side of the FOV. Because this overall geometrical efficiency factor would have been similar in the case of LSO background emissions, the ratio of the two coincidence efficiencies in Table I is not easily predicted. To summarize, the ratio is close to the amount one would expect based on a simple calculation.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0071">To use forward scattering in a practical way in a PET scanner, there is a tradeoff between radiation hazard, real or perceived, and the quality of transmission images. Thus, one would determine the optimal amount of gamma-ray source material. In the example where Cs-137 is used, one could consider 38 sources with As=30 MBq per source, a total of 1110 MBq exactly matches the total Cs-137 content used in the ECAT ART PET scanner. Equation (4) suggests that the sensitivity gain in this case would be 6.5.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0072">The experiment verified that forward scattering of gamma rays, using 662-keV gamma rays from Cs-137 as an example, can be used for transmission imaging in a PET scanner. Energy windows and coincidence timing windows should be opened wide in this application. The resulting sinogram can even be added to the sinogram of LSO background radiation. If such a PET scanner were manufactured with a total of 1110 MBq distributed among 38 cesium sources, transmission imaging in the 3-minute duration of a typical PET acquisition could have about the same quality as a 20-minute scan based on LSO background alone.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0073">The principle that the photon energies E<sub>A </sub>and E<sub>B </sub>detected from each pair of coincidence events A and B from forward scattered gamma photons add up to the initial energy E<sub>I </sub>of the gamma-photons emitting from the gamma-ray source <b>130</b>, i.e. E<sub>A</sub>+E<sub>B</sub>=E<sub>I </sub>can be utilized to have the PET system reject almost all background noise such as from false coincidence events.
