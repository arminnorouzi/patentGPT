It has been reported that by administrating a vaginal preparation of lactoferrin to a patient with refractory vaginosis, the vaginal bacterial flora turns to <i>Lactobacillus</i>-predominant, thereby improving a symptom (Non-Patent Documents 1, 2 and 3). On the other hand, it has been known that the vaginal bacterial flora fluctuates with the menstrual cycle (Non-Patent Document 4). Vaginal acidity may decrease due to hormonal changes just before and during menstruation and during pregnancy, thereby making the bacteria which cause an infectious disease easily proliferate. It has been reported that vaginal bacterial flora is <i>Lactobacillus</i>-predominant in a normal healthy condition of female at a childbearing age, but that a cycle in which the bacterial flora diversifies during menstruation and turns back to previous <i>Lactobacillus</i>-predominant state with the termination of menstruation is repeated (Non-Patent Document 5). The rate of turning back of the bacterial flora to its previous state varies depending on the health condition, age, and the like of each person. However, it is thought that if the bacterial flora disturbed during menstruation can be restored to its previous <i>Lactobacillus</i>-predominant state as quickly as possible, the risk of getting a vaginal infectious disease and the like caused by other microorganism(s) can be reduced. Further, according to a recent study, the disturbance of the bacterial flora in the female reproductive organ has been known to be one of the causes of infertility, and normalization of the bacterial flora is an important factor for normal pregnancy and delivery (Non-Patent Document 2). However, until now no report has been known on an improving agent or an improving process which is focused on the aggravation of the bacterial flora during menstruation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Non-Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0003">Non-Patent Document 1: Pino A et al., Microbial Ecology in Health and Disease, 2017, 28, 1-11, 1357417 Bacterial biota of women with bacterial vaginosis treated with lactoferrin, open prospective randomized trial.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0004">Non-Patent Document 2: Otsuki K. et al., Biochem.

which is used in the present invention, any lactoferrin can be used as long as it exhibits an improving effect on the vaginal bacterial flora. Lactoferrin is a macromolecule having a molecular weight of about 80,000 and has a property of forming a chelate with two trivalent iron ions; however, the &#x201c;lactoferrin&#x201d; as used in the present invention includes all types including an iron ion-free type to a completely iron-ion saturated type. Further, in the present invention, any lactoferrin can be used regardless of its origin. For example, lactoferrin derived from a living body which is extracted from milk and the like of mammals such as human being and cow and genetically modified lactoferrin produced by genetic engineering or a salt thereof can be used. Commercially available lactoferrin which is purified from milk is available from vendors such as Morinaga Milk (Japan), Tatura (Australia), Tatua (New Zealand), and the like. A process for purifying lactoferrin from milk is disclosed in detail in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 9,115,211 (issued on Aug. 25, 2015), and lactoferrin can be easily purified, basically through steps of adsorbing and desorbing lactoferrin contained in nonfat milk or whey on a cation exchange resin, followed by desalting, freeze-drying or spray drying, and the like.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0036">In the present invention, only 1 kind of lactoferrin may be used, or 2 or more kinds of lactoferrin may be used in combination.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0037">The sanitary product of the present invention carries lactoferrin, or a composition comprising lactoferrin and an auxiliary substance.

For the data analysis, the quality check of whole sequence was carried out by using &#x201c;fastqQC&#x201d; (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), and the bacteria were identified by using &#x201c;USEARCH&#x201d; (https://www.drive5.com/usearch/) and &#x201c;QIIME&#x201d; (http://qiime.org/) at their genus levels.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0087">The present application is based on the Japanese Patent Application No. 2020-013871 filed on Jan. 30, 2020, and the subject matters described in the specification and the scope of the claims for patent of Japanese Patent Application No. 2020-013871 are all incorporated in this specification.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
