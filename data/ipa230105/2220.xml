energy has been highly expected as next-generation energy. In order to realize a hydrogen energy society, techniques for producing, storing, and utilizing hydrogen are required. However, as for hydrogen storage, there are various problems regarding storage, transportation, safety, cycle, cost and the like.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As hydrogen storage material, various materials such as hydrogen storage alloys, organic hydrides, inorganic hydrides, organic metal complexes, and porous carbon materials has been studied to develop.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The organic hydrides have attracted attention because of advantages such as ease of handling, high hydrogen storage density, and light weight. Some organic hydrides are considered as hazardous substances, and thus may be used as low-concentration solutions. When extracting hydrogen by dehydrogenation reaction, it is necessary to separate and recover hydrogen with high efficiency.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the organic hydrides, there has been known hydrocarbon compounds such as formic acid, benzene, toluene, biphenyl, naphthalene, cyclohexane, and methylcyclohexane. Since formic acid among these required low energy for dehydrogenation reaction and can be handled easily, the formic acid is considered to be an excellent compound as a hydrogen storage material and is attracting attention.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When formic acid is used as a hydrogen storage material, formic acid is generated in a basic solution by bringing carbon dioxide and hydrogen into contact with each other, or by a reaction of electrochemically reducing carbon dioxide, or the like. However, the reaction is stopped by equilibrium, and only a formic acid solution having a low concentration can be obtained. In order to reduce a transportation cost, it is necessary to obtain a formic acid solution having a high concentration. Further, it is necessary to separate and recover formic acid from a formic acid solution with high efficiency.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, in Patent Literature 1, for the purpose of performing the production of formic acid by hydrogenation of carbon dioxide, the production of hydrogen by dehydrogenation of formic acid, and the storage and production of hydrogen with high efficiency and high energy efficiency, a method of producing formic acid and/or formate using a catalyst and producing hydrogen from formic acid and/or formate using a catalyst has been studied.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent No. 5812290</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The technique described in Patent Literature 1 relates to a catalyst for producing formic acid and producing hydrogen by dehydrogenation of formic acid, and concentration of a hydrogen storage material has not been studied.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, the present invention provides a hydrogen storage method, a hydrogen gas production method, and a hydrogen gas production system, by which hydrogen can be stored in a state excellent in handling by using an alkali metal formate as a hydrogen storage material, and can be concentrated by a simple method, and a hydrogen gas can be produced with high efficiency.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Means for solving the above problems are as follows.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0000">[1] A hydrogen gas production method using an alkali metal formate as a hydrogen storage material, the method comprising:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">a first step of concentrating an aqueous solution containing the alkali metal formate;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">a second step of protonating at least a part of the alkali metal formate by electrodialysis to produce formic acid;

The alkali metal formate has a high hydrogen storage density and can be easily handled. Since the alkali metal formate is safe and stable as a chemical substance when the alkali metal formate is used as the hydrogen storage material, the alkali metal formate has an advantage in that the alkali metal formate can be stored for a long period of time.
