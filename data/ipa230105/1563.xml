The hinge may allow the gripping devices to move so that the gripping devices are movable to an open position where the arms of the forceps are moved apart and upon an application of a closing force the arms of the gripping devices are moved into a closed position where an item of interest can be gripped within the gripping device. Other gripping devices such as pliers, nail cutters, cuticle nippers, or the like have added features that extend between the arms and create a direct force on both of the arms so that the arms are biased open. These devices always bias the arms apart and cannot be disconnected. Some attempts have been made to create a device that is disengageable by pivoting the device from an &#x201c;on&#x201d; position to an &#x201c;off&#x201d; position or by adding a device that is removable. However, these devices may become lost or damaged over time such that the application of force is changed or is not possible. Further, these devices impart a force directly on both of the arms so that the arms are directly moved apart by the feature.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Examples of some gripping devices such as pliers and cuticle nippers that include a feature that generates a force may be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. D386,054; 5,619,892; and 8,555,754 all of which are incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. It would be attractive to have a gripping device including a bias device that is selectively engageable. It would be attractive to have a gripping device with bias device that is engageable and disengageable without removing the bias device form the gripping device or moving the bias device on or along the gripping device. What is needed is a bias device that can be activated and deactivated with one hand. What is needed is a bias device that may apply a force to one arm individually or two or more arms. It would be attractive to have one or more bias devices where a force generated by the one or more bias devices is variable.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present teachings provide: a device comprising: (a) a first working arm; (b) a shuttle located on the first working arm, and (c) a bias device; wherein the bias device biases the first working arm when the shuttle is in a first position, and wherein the bias device is free of biasing the first working arm when the shuttle is in a second position.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present teachings meet one or more of the present needs by providing: a device comprising: (a) a first working arm; (b) a shuttle, and (c) a bias device; wherein the bias device biases the first working arm when the shuttle is in a first position, and wherein the bias device is free of biasing the first working arm when the shuttle is in a second position.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present teachings provide: a device comprising: (a) a first working arm; (b) a second working arm; (c) a shuttle, and (d) a bias device; wherein the bias device biases the first working arm away from the second arm with a first force when the shuttle is in a first position, and wherein the bias device biases the first working arm away from the second arm with a second force when the shuttle is in a second position.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present teachings provide: a device comprising: (a) a first working arm; (b) a second working arm; (c) a shuttle; and (d) a bias device located on the first working arm; wherein the bias device biases the first working arm away from the second arm with a first bias force when the shuttle is in a first position, and wherein the bias device biases the first working arm away from the second arm with a second bias force or no force when the shuttle is in a second position, and the first bias force is greater than the second bias force.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present teachings provide: a device comprising: (a) a first working arm; (b) a second working arm; (c) a shuttle; and (d) a bias device located on the shuttle; wherein the bias device biases the first working arm away from the second working arm with a first bias force when the shuttle is in a first position; and wherein the bias device biases the first working arm away from the second working arm with a second bias force when the shuttle is in a second position, and the first bias force is greater than the second bias force.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present teachings provide: a device comprising: (a) a first working arm; (b) a second working arm; (c) a shuttle; (d) a bias device located on the first working arm; and (e) a recess located within the second working arm; wherein the shuttle covers the recess when the shuttle is in a first position so that the bias device biases the first working arm away from the second working arm with a first bias force; and wherein the recess is exposed when the shuttle is in a second position so that the bias device extends into the recess so that the bias device biases the first working arm away from the second working arm with a second bias force or the bias device is free of creating a bias force.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The teachings provide a gripping device including a bias device that is selectively engageable.

Those skilled in the art may adapt and apply the teachings in its numerous forms, as may be best suited to the requirements of a particular use. Accordingly, the specific embodiments of the present teachings as set forth are not intended as being exhaustive or limiting of the teachings. The scope of the teachings should, therefore, be determined not with reference to the above description, but should instead be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. The disclosures of all articles and references, including patent applications and publications, are incorporated by reference for all purposes. Other combinations are also possible as will be gleaned from the following claims, which are also hereby incorporated by reference into this written description.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present teachings relate to an instrument. The instrument may function to grip one or more objects of interest. Preferably, the instrument is a gripping device. More preferably, the instrument is forceps. Most preferably, the gripping device is surgical forceps. The instrument may be forceps, tweezers, scissors, retaining ring tool, or a combination thereof. The instrument may function to grip, hold, squeeze, or a combination thereof one or more objects. The instrument may include one or more finger grips (i.e., configured like scissors) that may be used to move the instrument so that the instrument may be used to grip one or more objects. The instrument may be free of finger grips and be actuated by direct pressure being applied to opposing sides of the forceps so that the instrument closes and grips an object. The instrument may have working arms that cross and form an X shape. The instrument may be opened when a distal end of a first working arm is moved towards a distal end of a second working arm. The instrument may be closed when a distal end of a first working arm is moved towards a distal end of a second working arm. For example, the first working arm and the second working arm may be moved apart but the distal ends may be opened when the working arm and the distal ends are colinear, but when the distal ends cross an opposing working arm the distal ends may be biased closed. The first working arm and the second working arm may move laterally, within a plane, or both (e.g., perpendicular to a longitudinal axis). Preferably, the first working arm and the second working arm move towards and away from each other without rotating, moving out of a plane, or both. The instrument has a distal end and a proximal end. The instrument may have working arms that are generally straight. The instrument includes at least two working arms.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The working arms may function to grip, hold, squeeze, or a combination thereof an object when the object is between the two or more opposing working arms. The working arms include a proximal end and a distal end. The proximal end may be in contact with a body, a handle, or both. The first working arm and the second working arm may converge together at their respective proximal ends, at the handle, the body, or a combination thereof. The distal end may include one or more electrodes, one or more tips, or both for applying a therapy current, a gripping force, or both. The working arms may include one or more gripping features that may assist in gripping, holding, squeezing, or a combination thereof an object. The instrument may include two or more working arms. Preferably, the instrument includes at least two working arms. The instrument may include three or more, four or more, five or more, or even six or more working arms. More preferably, the instrument only includes two working arms. The working arms may all be substantially identical. When only a first working arm and a second working arm are present the first working arm and the second working arm may be mirror images of each other. When only a first working arm and a second working arm are present the instrument is configured as forceps.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The working arms, forceps, electrosurgical device, or a combination thereof may be movable between at least a first position and a second position. For example, in the second position the working arms are immobilized so that the working arms cannot be used a forceps. The working arms may be longitudinally static and moveable relative to each other (e.g., laterally within a plane). The working arms may be longitudinally moveable and may be moveable relative to each other (e.g., laterally movable) so that a gripping force may be created. Preferably, the working arms may be movable laterally relative to each other (i.e., towards and away from each other within a single plane). The working arms may not be rotatable. The working arms may rotate about a pivot or a pivot pin to grip or create a force. A pin may connect a first working arm and a second working arm and the pin may be the pivot point. The working arms may be movable about a pivot point so that as one end of the working arms are moved closer together (e.g., a proximal end) an opposing end is moved further apart (e.g., a distal end). The working arms may each have a pivot point. The working arms may extend cantilever and may pivot about a cantilever connection with the body, the handle, the gripping portion, or a combination thereof. The working arms may be retractable and/or extendable individually, simultaneously, or both. The working arms may be selectively retractable and/or extendable so that one or more tip regions are exposed. The working arms may be rigid. The rigid working arms may rotate about a pivot or a pin to create a gripping force. The working arms may be connected to each other, a body portion, or both by a pin that extends through a pivot and the working arms may rotate about the pivot to create a gripping force. The working arms may include one or more cross overs.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The one or more cross overs may function to change the forceps from a bias open device to a bias closed device. The cross overs may be where the working arms cross each other so that a distal end of the working device is located on an opposing side of the forceps as a working arm that it was connected, a proximal end, or both. The cross over may have one working arm passing over or under another working arm. The cross over may have a portion of one working arm passing through another working arm. The cross over may form an X shape. The cross over may be located on an opposite end of the arms as the one or more bosses, the pivot point, or both.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The working arms may include one or more bosses that a pin extends through to connect the working arms to body so that a pivot point is created. Preferably, each working arm includes at least two bosses and the bosses extend on both sides of a portion of the body and the pivot pin extends through the bosses and a portion of the body to connect the arms to the body. The pivot pin may movably connect the working arms to a body. The pivot point may create a hinge. A single pivot pin may connect more than one working arm. For example, the working arms may be connected together by a single pivot pin. Each working arm may be connected individually by a pivot pin. The connection may form a joint. The joint may be a pivot joint, a cantilever joint or both. Each working arm may include a joint. Both working arms may be connected by a single joint. The bias device may be located on a distal side of the joint or the proximal side of the joint. The first working arm, second working arm, and body may all be part of the joint. The first working arm and body and the second working arm and body may form a joint. The pivot pin may be made of any material that permits the working arms to rotate. For example, the pivot pin may be plastic, metal, stainless steel, surgical steel, or a combination thereof. The working arms may be free of a pivot pin. For example, a first working arm may extend over (e.g., cross-over or cross-under) a second working arm so that the distal end is located on an opposite side of the forceps and the proximal end. The cross-over/cross-under may create a device that opens upon an application of force. The working arms may be flexible and may flex to open and close. For example, the working arms may be constrained (at one end) and upon release of the constraint the working arms may flex open. The working arms may be movable between two or more positions. Preferably, the working arms are movable between at least a first position (e.g., open) and a second position (e.g., closed). The working arms may be movable between a bipolar configuration (e.g., first position) and a monopolar configuration (e.g., second position). The working arms may be movable between an open position (i.e., first position) and a closed position (i.e., second position). The working arms in the first position may be off, energized, one working arm may be energized, or a combination thereof. The working arms in the second position may be off, one or both of the working arms may be electrically disconnected, one or both of the working arms may be electrically connected, one working arm may be shorted by the other working arm, or a combination thereof. The working arms may be moved between one or more positions by a user applying a force to a gripping portion.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The gripping portion may function to open the working arm, close the working arms, allow a user to manipulate the forceps, or a combination thereof. The gripping portions may move the working arms when a force is applied to the working arms. The gripping portions may be located at the proximal end or the distal end of each of the working arm. The gripping portion may be located proximate to the handle, the body, or both. The gripping portion of the working arms may extend over the handle, the body, or both. The gripping portions may extend along the handle, the body, or both. The gripping portions may be located opposite a tip region of the working arms. The gripping portions may be located at a proximal end and the tip region may be located at a distal end.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The working arms may include a tip region. The tip region may include a portion that is configured to assist in facilitating gripping, holding, squeezing, or a combination thereof. The tip region may be located at the distal most end (i.e., an end of the instrument furthest from the user) of the working arms. The tip regions when moved towards each other may grip an object of interest between the two working arms (e.g., tissue). Additionally, the tip region may be configured in one or more electrosurgical configurations (e.g., a monopolar configuration, bipolar configuration, or a combination of both). The tip region may include teeth, serrations, mouse teeth, be free of teeth (i.e., smooth), or a combination thereof. The tip region may be fully and/or partially insulated. Preferably, the tip region includes insulation on the non-contact portions of the working arms so that electrosurgical energy is not transferred through incidental contact. The tip region may include or may be an active portion (e.g., an electrode), an inactive portion (e.g., an insulated portion), or a combination of both.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The electrode may function to provide a therapy signal (e.g., current, voltage, power, electricity, or a combination thereof) to a location of interest. The electrode may be electrically conductive so that the instrument is an electrosurgical device. The electrode may transmit a therapy signal between the working arms, from a working arm to the blade, from a working arm to the blade electrode, from one or both working arms to a ground pad, or a combination thereof. The electrode may both provide power and a contact surface for gripping and holding an item of interest. The electrode may be connected to an electrical path that provides a therapy signal from the body, a generator, or both to a location of interest.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The electrical path may function to provide a therapy signal to a feature or location of interest. The electrical path may extend along one or more of the working arms. The electrical path may be one or more structures that when connected together provide a path for power to flow through the instrument. The electrical path may be engageable and disengageable. The electrical path may extend from a handle, gripping portion, body, or a combination thereof to the working arms (e.g., first working arm, second working arm, or both. The first working arm, the second working arm, or both may be mechanically moved to form a blade.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The blade may function to mechanically cut, electrically cut, electrically coagulate, apply a therapy current, or a combination thereof. The blade may be any device that may be used to apply monopolar power during a procedure, that may be longitudinally movable, rotationally movable, extendable, retractable, or a combination thereof. The blade may be movable along or relative to a handle, a body, a gripping portion, or a combination thereof. The blade may be connected to and extend from a handle, a body, a gripping portion or a combination thereof. The blade may be static. Preferably, in one embodiment the blade may be static and the working arms moved relative to the blade so that when the working arms are moved the blade is exposed. More preferably, the blade is a movable. The blade may have one or more positions. The blade may have a plurality of positions. The blade may have a first position (e.g., retracted), a second position (flush), and a third position (e.g., extended). The blade may be formed by retracting one of the working arms. The first position may be where the blade is located relative to a working arm so that one working arm (e.g., the blade) extends past another working arm (e.g., a working arm is retracted so that a second working arm is extend past the retracted working arm). The first position may be where the blade is electrically connected, electrically in communication with another handpiece component, or a both. The second position may be where a distal end of the blade (i.e., second working arm) is flush with the distal end of the first working arm. The third position may be where the blade is located relative to the first working arm so that the blade is retracted relative to the first working arms (e.g, the blade is retracted so that the blade is located proximate to the user). The second position and/or first position may be where the blade is electrically connected, supplies a therapy current, is electrically continuous, or a combination thereof. The blade may be a separate piece that when activated may be used to supply monopolar power. The blade may be formed by connecting the two working arms together and supplying power through only one working arm. The blade may be formed by retracting one working arm so that only one working arm is extending distally. The blade may be used for electrically cutting, mechanically cutting, or both. The blade may be a discrete third working arm that may extend from one of the working arms. The electrosurgical device may be free of a blade. The blade may include a blade electrode. The blade electrode may supply a therapy current to a location of interest. The blade electrode may contact tissue so that a therapy current is supplied from the blade electrode to the first working arm. One or more shuttles may move relative to the blade, along the blade, parallel to the blade, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The one or more shuttles may function to activate or deactivate one or more functions of the instrument, move one or more components of the instrument, obstruct one or more buttons of the instrument, move a bias device, move a deactivation feature, deactivate a deactivation feature, align a bias device and deactivation feature, align a bias device and a contact zone, or a combination thereof. The one or more shuttles may move independent of the first working arm, the second working arm, the blade, the body, or a combination thereof. For example, if the blade is longitudinally movable, a shuttle located on the body may move longitudinally without the blade moving or vice versa. The electrosurgical device may include one or more shuttles, two or more shuttles, three or more shuttles, four or more shuttles, or even five or more shuttles. For example, there may be three shuttles on the body, one that moves the blade and two that move along the body to activate and deactivate bias, and each working arm may include a shuttle. Each working arm may include one or more shuttles. The body, blade, or both may include one or more shuttles. The body may include two shuttles or even three shuttles. The shuttles may function to carry one or more bias devices. The shuttle may function to carry one or more deactivation features. The shuttles may function to provide a contact zone or contact location for one or more bias devices. The shuttles may only have one or more bias devices, one or more deactivation features, one or more contact zones, or a combination thereof on one side. For example, a shuttle may only face a first side of a body or a first working arm. The shuttle may have two sides and each side may include one or more deactivation features, one or more bias devices, one or more contact zones, or a combination thereof. The shuttles may include two or more bias devices, contact zone, deactivation features, or a combination thereof on each side so that as the shuttle is longitudinally moved the amount of force created may be varied based upon the distance of the shuttle from pivot point, body, or both. The shuttle may have two or more pieces. The shuttle may be a plurality of pieces. The shuttle may have a first shuttle first portion, a first shuttle second portion, a third shuttle portion, a fourth shuttle portion, or a combination thereof. For example, two shuttle portions may be located on the body and the two shuttle portions may be moved as one shuttle or moved as two discrete shuttles. Three shuttles may be located on the body. The three shuttles may be a first shuttle first portion and a first shuttle second portion and a second shuttle portion. The first shuttles may control bias and the second shuttle may control the blade position. A first shuttle first portion may be located on a first working arm and a first shuttle second portion may be located on a second working arm. A first shuttle portion may be located on a first side of the body and a second shuttle portion may be located on a second side of the body. The shuttle may be movable between a plurality of positions. The one or more shuttles may be movable between one or more positions. Preferably, the shuttle is movable between at least a proximal position (e.g., first position) and a distal position (e.g., second position). The shuttle may retract and extend the blade, a working arm, or both. For example, the shuttle may extend a blade out of one or both of the working arms. The shuttle may engage and disengage one or more bias devices. The shuttle may cover, expose, or both one or more deactivation features, one or more buttons, or both. Each shuttle may include two or more positions, three or more positions, four or more positions, or even five or more positions. The shuttle may move along one or more of the working arms. The shuttle may engage the bias device. The shuttle may engage the bias device when the shuttle is in the first position, the second position, the third position, the fourth position, or a combination thereof. The shuttle may be free of engagement with the bias device when the shuttle is in the first position, the second position, the third position, the fourth position, or a combination thereof. The shuttle may have one or more contact zones that are contacted by the bias devices.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The one or more contact zones may function to create a contact surface for the bias device to contact. The one or more contact zones may function to assist is biasing the working arms. The one or more contact zones may be any area of the instrument where the bias device contacts to create a bias force. The one or more contact zones may be a region of the shuttle, the one or more of the working arms, or both that assists in biasing the working arms. For example, the bias device may be connected to the working arms and may contact a contact zone of the shuttle. In another example, the bias device may be connected to a shuttle and may contact a contact zone of the working arms. The one or more contact zones may either engage the bias device or be free of engagement with the bias device. The one or more contact zones may be generally planar. The one or more contact zones may have one or more steps that extend in different planes so that contact with each step varies the amount of force created by the bias device. For example, movement of a shuttle or a bias device may move from a first step to a second step or even a third step which may increase or decrease an amount of force created by the bias device. The one or more steps may change the thickness of the shuttle so that compression of the bias device varies the amount of generated by the bias device. When steps are present the shuttle may have a position that corresponds to each of the steps. The force may be sufficiently low so that finger pressure may overcome the force to bias the working arms. The force may be about 1 Kg or more, about 2 Kg or more, about 5 Kg or less, or about 3 Kg or less (i.e., between about 0.5 Kg and about 2 Kg). The amount of force may be varied by moving one or more shuttles, bias members, or both toward a distal end, towards a proximal end, towards a pivot point, towards a cross over, a combination thereof. The shuttle may be distally or proximally moved to vary the bias force provided to each working arm depending upon a longitudinal location of the shuttle. The bias device may provide a force that is close to zero but greater than a zero bias force. The shuttle may have a distal position, a first position, a second position, a third position, a proximal position, or a combination thereof. The contact zones may have one or more recesses so that when a portion of a bias device (e.g., a free end or contact portion) contacts the contact zone the bias device and shuttle form at least a temporary connection. The one or more recesses may substantially prevent the bias device from moving (e.g., sliding) along the contact zone (e.g., the bias device may move 1 mm or less relative to the contact zone). The contact zone may be curved, include a detent, be flat, disc shaped, or a combination thereof. The contact zone may be moved so that the bias device is free of contact with the shuttle and the bias device is disabled.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The one or more bias devices may function to move one or more of the working arms. The bias device may bias one or more of the working arms open (i.e., away), one or more of the working arms closed (i.e., towards), or both. The bias devices may move the ends of the working arms towards the body, the blade or both. The bias devices may move the ends of the working arms away from the body, the blade, or both. The bias device may bias one or more of the working arms off of a body, a shuttle, a handle, an inner shell, a contact zone, or a combination thereof. The bias device may be free of providing a bias (e.g., the bias device may be disabled, turned off, or both). The one or more bias devices may be free of contact with a working arm, shuttle, body, contact zone or a combination thereof when the shuttle is in the second position. The bias device may longitudinally movable (e.g., along a length of the electrosurgical device), laterally movable (e.g., move with a working arm along a plane that is at an angle relative to the length (e.g., perpendicular)), rotationally movable (e.g., around a working arm), or a combination thereof. The bias device may be longitudinally static.

The bias device may be made of plastic, metal, rubber, or a combination thereof. The bias device may extend between a first working arm and the body, a second working arm and the body, or both. Depending on the position of the shuttle the bias device may be opposing a working arm or a body. The bias device may be made of an elastic material. The bias device may include elastomeric characteristics. The bias device may be a spring. The bias device may be a leaf spring, a cantilever spring, a helical spring, compression spring, a coil, a helical extension, or a combination thereof. The bias device may include one or more constrained ends, one or more free ends, one or more contact portions, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The one or more constrained ends may function to connect the bias device to a part of an instrument. The one or more constrained ends may permanently connect the bias device to a part of an instrument. The one or more constrained ends may removably connect the bias device to a part of an instrument. Preferably, the constrained ends may be connected to a working arm or a shuttle. The one or more constrained ends may be a single constrained end. The one or more constrained ends may be located on opposing ends of the bias device. For example, two opposing ends of the bias device may be constrained and a middle section may extend outward to provide the bias. The one or more constrained ends may not be an end but may constrain the bias device between to a part of the instrument at a location between the ends. For example, a central section may be constrained and two portions may extend outward from the constrained central section. The one or more constrained ends preferably are located at an end that is towards the distal end of the device. For example, the bias device may include a distal end and a proximal end and the constrained end may be the distal end of the bias device. The constrained end may be connected to a working arm, the shuttle, or both. The first working arm and the second working arm may each be connected to a constrained end of a bias device. The bias device may extend outward from the constrained end. For example, the bias device may extend from a constrained end on a first working arm towards a second working arm. The constrained end may form a cantilever connection. The bias device may only be connected at the constrained end and may include a free end that is not constrained to any part of the instrument (i.e., the working arms or the shuttle).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The free end may function to contact one or more parts of the instrument to create a bias force. The free end may extend away from the constrained end but may be free of contact with another part of the instrument to create the bias force. For example, the free end may extend outward and contact the same part as the constrained end (e.g., an arm or shuttle) and a contact surface between the free end and the constrained end may create the bias force. The free end may extend towards the same part of the instrument as the bias device (e.g., the shuttle or a working arm). Preferably, the free end contacts a contact zone and assists in creating the bias force. The free end may move along a portion of the instrument as the contact portion is biased. The free end may be in contact with a part of the instrument and move as the working arms are moved towards each other. The free end may be substantially static during movement of the working arms towards each other so that energy is stored within the bias device. The free end may be opposite a constrained end (e.g., cantilever connection). The free end may be in the same plane as the constrained end.

The one or more breaks may prevent one or more portions of the bias device from moving. The one or more breaks, bias device, or both may include the contact portion.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The one or more contact portions may function to contact another portion of the instrument to bias one or more of the working arms apart or bias one or more of the working arms together. Preferably, the contact portions of the bias device contact a contact zone on a working arm, the shuttle, or both. The one or more contact portions may contact a first working arm, a second working arm, a shuttle, or a combination thereof. The one or more contact portions may contact a piece adjacent to a working arm. The one or more contact portions may contact a working arm. For example, the bias device may be connected to a first working arm and the contact portion may contact the first working arm and a second working arm or a shuttle to create a bias force.
