present invention provides methods for treating patients suffering from familial hypercholesterolemia, including both HeFH and HoFH. The methods of the invention provide for lowering at least one lipid parameter in the patient by administering a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to ANGPTL3 in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a statin, a first lipid lowering agent other than a statin, and a second lipid lowering agent other than a statin. The first non-statin lipid lowering agent is an agent that inhibits cholesterol uptake (e.g. ezetimibe) and the second non-statin lipid-lowering agent is an inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (e.g. lomitapide). The combination therapy is useful in treating hypercholesterolemia, as well as hyperlipidemia, hyperlipoproteinemia and dyslipidemia, including hypertriglyceridemia, chylomicronemia, and to prevent or treat diseases or disorders, for which abnormal lipid metabolism is a risk factor, such as cardiovascular diseases.</p></abstract><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

More specifically, the invention relates to the use of an ANGPTL3 inhibitor with concomitant lipid-lowering therapies to treat patients with familial hypercholesterolemia in order to achieve optimal serum lipid and lipoprotein levels.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hyperlipidemia is a general term that encompasses diseases and disorders characterized by or associated with elevated levels of lipids and/or lipoproteins in the blood. Hyperlipidemias include hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, combined hyperlipidemia, and elevated lipoprotein a (Lp(a)). A particular prevalent form of hyperlipidemia in many populations is hypercholesterolemia.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hypercholesterolemia, particularly an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, constitutes a major risk for the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD) (Sharrett et al., 2001, Circulation 104:1108-1113). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is identified as the primary target of cholesterol lowering therapy and is accepted as a valid surrogate therapeutic endpoint. Numerous studies have demonstrated that reducing LDL-C levels reduces the risk of CHD with a strong direct relationship between LDL-C levels and CHD events; for each 1 mmol/L (&#x2dc;40 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C, cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and morbidity is lowered by 22%. Greater reductions in LDL-C produce greater reduction in events, and comparative data of intensive versus standard statin treatment suggest that the lower the LDL-C level, the greater the benefit in patients at very high cardiovascular (CV) risk.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited disorder of lipid metabolism that predisposes a person to premature severe cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Kolansky et al., (2008), Am J Cardiology,102(11):1438-1443). FH can be either an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive disease that results from mutations in the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), or in at least 3 different genes that code for proteins involved in hepatic clearance of LDL-C can cause FH. Examples of such defects include mutations in the gene coding for the LDL receptor (LDLR) that removes LDL-C from the circulation, and in the gene for apolipoprotein (Apo) B, which is the major protein of the LDL particle. In all cases, FH is characterized by an accumulation of LDL-C in the plasma from birth and subsequent development of tendon xanthomas, xanthelasmas, atheromata, and CVD. FH can be classified as either heterozygous FH (heFH) or homozygous FH (hoFH) depending on whether the individual has a genetic defect in one (heterozygous) or both (homozygous) copies of the implicated gene.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Current LDL-C-lowering medications include statins, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, fibrates, niacin, bile acid sequestrants and Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. Statins are a commonly prescribed treatment for LDL-C lowering. However, despite the availability of such lipid-lowering therapies, many high-risk patients fail to reach their guideline target LDL-C level (Gitt et al., 2010, Clin Res Cardiol 99(11):723-733). For patients who are still unable to achieve guideline target level for LDL-C, despite available lipid-modifying therapy (LMT), mechanical removal of LDL-C by lipoprotein apheresis (e.g., LDL apheresis) is sometimes prescribed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, patients who are not at LDL-C goal despite receiving an optimized LMT regimen, would greatly benefit from alternative LDL-C lowering therapies, or through use of a combination of therapeutic agents, such as the agents and regimens described herein.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In its broadest aspect, the invention relates to methods of treating patients who suffer from familial hypercholesterolemia by administering an ANGPTL3 inhibitor in combination with other lipid modifying therapies to achieve optimal levels of serum lipids and lipoproteins.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the method comprises administering to the patient suffering from familial hypercholesterolemia a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of (a) a statin; (b) one lipid lowering agent other than a statin and (c) an inhibitor of ANGPTL3.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the patient is administered (a) a statin; (b) one lipid lowering agent other than a statin; (c) an inhibitor of ANGPTL3, and (d) a second lipid-lowering agent other than a statin.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the familial hypercholesterolemia is selected from the group consisting of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the statin is selected from the group consisting of atorvastatin (LIPITOR&#xae;), pitavastatin (LIVAL&#xae;), lovastatin (MEVACOR&#xae;), simvastatin (ZOCOR&#xae;), pravastatin (PRAVACHOL&#xae;) fluvastatin (LESCOL&#xae;) and rosuvastatin (CRESTOR&#xae;).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, the statin is rosuvastatin (CRESTOR&#xae;), which is administered orally once a day at a dose of about 5 mg to about 40 mg.

For example, as used herein, the expression &#x201c;about 100&#x201d; includes 99 and 101 and all values in between (e.g., 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, 99.4, etc.).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0066">Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are now described. All publications mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference to describe in their entirety.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Methods for Treating Hyperlipidemias</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0067">The present invention relates generally to methods and compositions for reducing lipoprotein levels in patients suffering from familial hypercholesterolemia, by administering a combination of (a) a statin; (b) a first lipid lowering therapy other than a statin; and (c) an inhibitor of ANGPTL3. In certain embodiments, the combination includes a second lipid lowering agent other than a statin. In certain embodiments, the first lipid-lowering agent that is not a statin is an agent that inhibits cholesterol absorption, such as ezetimibe (ZETIA&#xae;). In certain embodiments, the second lipid lowering agent that is not a statin is an agent that inhibits microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, such as lomitapide (JUSTAPID&#xae;). In one embodiment, the ANGPTL3 inhibitor is an antibody that binds specifically to ANGPTL3, such as evinacumab. In certain embodiments of the invention, treatment with the combination of an ANGPTL3 inhibitor (e.g. evinacumab) with the other therapies noted above (a statin, ezetimibe and lomitapide), may serve to lower the levels of lipoproteins in these patients to an acceptable range, thereby lowering their risk for development of atherosclerosis, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. In certain embodiments, the methods described may be used to treat patients suffering from familial hypercholesterolemia, including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and/or homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 inhibitor may also be added to the combined therapies described above to further lower the level of at least one lipid parameter described herein. In a related embodiment, the combination of therapies described above may also be used in patients that are undergoing apheresis to achieve normalization of at least one of the lipid parameters described. The combination of therapies described may eliminate the need for apheresis, or may increase the time interval between the need for apheresis procedures. The combination of therapies described, when used alone or in combination with apheresis may serve to lower the risk for the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD) in these patients.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0068">As used herein, the term &#x201c;lipoprotein&#x201d; means a biomolecular particle containing both protein and lipid. Examples of lipoproteins include, e.g., low density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0069">The present invention, according to certain embodiments, includes methods for treating patients who are non-responsive to, inadequately controlled by, or intolerant to lipid modifying therapies, other than those described and included in the combination described herein. As used herein, a particular patient who is &#x201c;non-responsive to, inadequately controlled by, or intolerant to, lipid modifying therapy&#x201d; is determined by a physician, physician's assistant, diagnostician, or other medical professional on the basis of the level of one or more lipoproteins (e.g., LDL-C and/or non-HDL-C) measured or otherwise detected in the serum of the patient after treatment with the lipid modifying agent. The physician, physician's assistant, diagnostician, or other medical professional can also determine if the patient is intolerant to certain lipid modifying therapies based on the side effect profile of the lipid modifying therapies, which the patient may experience, including, but not limited to, muscle aches, tenderness or weakness (myalgia), headache, skin flushing, difficulty sleeping, abdominal cramping, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, rash, nausea, or vomiting. A patient who is non-responsive to, inadequately controlled by, or intolerant to certain lipid modifying therapy may also be determined or influenced by other factors such as the patient's family history, medical background, current therapeutic treatment status, as well as generally accepted or prevailing lipoprotein targets adopted by national medical associations and physicians' groups. For example, in certain contexts, if a patient is undergoing therapy with a certain lipid modifying agent, and exhibits an LDL-C level of greater than or equal to about 70 mg/dL, this indicates that the patient is &#x201c;non-responsive to, or inadequately controlled by, or intolerant to that lipid modifying therapy&#x201d; and may benefit by treatment using the therapies described herein. In other contexts, if a patient is undergoing therapy with a certain lipid modifying agent, and exhibits an LDL-C level of greater than or equal to about 100 mg/dL, this indicates that the patient is &#x201c;non-responsive to, inadequately controlled by, or intolerant to that lipid modifying therapy&#x201d; and may benefit by treatment using the therapies described herein. In certain contexts, if a patient is undergoing therapy with a certain lipid modifying agent, and exhibits an LDL-C level of greater than or equal to about 150 mg/dL, 200 mg/dL, 250 mg/dL, 300 mg/dL, 400 mg/dL or higher, this indicates that the patient is &#x201c;non-responsive to, inadequately controlled by, or intolerant to a certain lipid modifying therapy&#x201d; and may benefit by treatment using the therapies described herein. In yet other contexts, whether or not a particular percentage reduction in LDL-C or non-HDL-C level is met, relative to the patient's LDL-C or non-HDL-C level at a particular start point (&#x201c;baseline&#x201d;) can be used to determine whether the patient has responded to a lipid modifying therapy or whether that patient is in need of further treatment using the methods and agents of the present invention. For instance, a reduction in LDL-C or non-HDL-C of less than 50% (e.g., less than 40%, less than 35%, less than 30%, less than 25%, etc.) from baseline may signify a need for therapy using the methods and agents of the invention.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0070">The present invention, accordingly, includes methods of treatment comprising administering one or more doses of an ANGPTL3 inhibitor (e.g. evinacumab) and one or more doses of a combination of a statin, ezetimibe, a PCSK9 inhibitor, mipomersen and/or lomitapide to a patient who is undergoing other types of lipid modifying therapy (e.g. bile acid sequestrants, niacin, fenofibrate), but is non-responsive to such therapy, or is intolerant to such therapy, wherein, after receiving one or more doses of the combination therapy described herein, the patient is able to achieve normal levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, or non-HDL-C. In certain instances, the patient may be taken off of the other lipid modifying therapy, or the other lipid modifying therapy may be continued, but may be administered at lower doses and may be used in combination with the ANGPTL3 inhibitor and a statin plus ezetimibe and lomitapide, and optionally, a PCSK9 inhibitor, and/or mipomersen to achieve and/or maintain a particular target lipoprotein level. Alternatively, the patient may be administered the other lipid modifying therapy at the normal prescribed dose, but the frequency of administration of the other lipid modifying therapy may be reduced if the other lipid modifying therapy is to be administered in conjunction with the combination described herein. In some instances, the need for treatment with the other lipid modifying therapy by the patient to achieve and/or maintain a particular target lipoprotein level may be eliminated altogether following administration of one or more doses of the combination therapies described herein.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0071">According to certain embodiments, the present invention comprises methods for reducing or eliminating the need for certain lipid modifying therapy, wherein the methods comprise selecting a patient with hyperlipidemia (e.g., hypercholesterolemia) who has been treated with certain lipid modifying therapies within the last month, the last 2 months, the last 3 months, the last 4 months, the last 5 months, the last 6 months, or for a longer period, and administering one or more doses of an ANGPTL3 inhibitor in combination with the agents described herein (ezetimibe, lomitapide and a statin) to the patient. The methods according to this aspect of the invention result in lowering the level of at least one lipid, or lipoprotein in the serum of the patient, and consequently allow for a reduction or elimination of the need for treatment with the other lipid modifying therapy to which the patient did not respond (e.g. a bile acid sequestrant, niacin, or fenofibrate), or for which the patient showed an intolerance. The methods described herein may also be used in patients undergoing apheresis and the combination of lipid lowering agents used in this patient population may result in elimination of the need for apheresis, or may increase the time interval between apheresis procedures. For example, in certain embodiments of the present invention, following administration of one or more doses of an ANGPLT3 inhibitor in combination with a statin, ezetimibe and/or lomitapide, the serum LDL-C level of the patient is reduced to less than a defined level (e.g., less than 100 mg/dL or less than 70 mg/dL), or the total cholesterol is lowered to a defined level (e.g. less than 200 mg/dL, or less than 150 mg/dL, or the serum level of LDL-C shows at least a 40% reduction compared to the baseline levels before treatment with the combination described herein.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0072">According to certain embodiments, the patient who is treatable by the methods of the present invention has hypercholesterolemia (e.g., a serum LDL-C concentration of greater than or equal to 70 mg/dL (e.g. if the patient has a history of a cardiovascular event), or a serum LDL-C concentration greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL (e.g. if the patient has no history of a cardiovascular event). In certain embodiments, the patient's hypercholesterolemia is inadequately controlled by certain standard lipid modifying therapies, such as bile acid sequestrants, niacin, or fenofibrates. The present invention also includes methods for reducing total cholesterol, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, triglycerides (TG), ApoB, ApoClIl and Lp(a) in a patient who has familial hypercholesterolemia, including HeFH and HoFH.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Patients Suitable for Treatment</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0073">The present invention includes methods and compositions useful for treating patients who are diagnosed with or identified as being at risk of developing a hypercholesterolemia condition such as, e.g., Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) resulting from mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), Autosomal Dominant Hypercholesterolemia (ADH, e.g., ADH associated with one or more gain-of-function mutations in the PCSK9 gene), documented presence of homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the Apo B gene, autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH, e.g., ARH associated with mutations in LDLRAP1), as well as incidences of hypercholesterolemia that are distinct from Familial Hypercholesterolemia (non FH). A patient who is suitable for treatment using the methods of the invention may also include patients who exhibit LDLR mutations that fall within any of the following classes: Class I: Receptor null mutations, whereby LDLR is not synthesized at all; Class II: Transport defective alleles, whereby LDLR is not properly transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus for expression on the cell surface (class IIA (no receptor transport) and class IIB (reduced receptor transport); Class III: Binding defective alleles, whereby LDLR does not properly bind LDL on the cell surface because of a defect in either apolipoprotein B100 (R3500Q) or in LDL-R; Class IV: Internalization defective alleles whereby LDLR bound to LDL does not properly cluster in clathrin-coated pits for receptor-mediated endocytosis; Class V: Recycling defective alleles, whereby LDLR is not recycled back to the cell surface.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0074">Diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia (e.g., heFH or hoFH) can be made by genotyping and/or clinical criteria. For patients who are not genotyped, clinical diagnosis may be based on either the Simon Broome criteria with a criteria for definite FH, or the WHO/Dutch Lipid Network criteria with a score&#x3e;8 points.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0075">According to certain embodiments, a patient may be suitable for treatment on the basis of having a history of coronary heart disease (CHD).

In addition to the statin plus the ANGPTL3 antibody therapy, the addition of either ezetimibe alone, or in combination with lomitapide results in significantly lower levels of serum lipids or lipoproteins when the combination is administered. In other embodiments, the ANGPTL3 inhibitors are administered as add-on therapy to a therapeutic statin regimen comprising a statin in an amount that is more than or less than the dose of statin the patient was on prior to receiving the ANGPTL3 inhibitor, or the combination therapy described herein. For example, after starting a therapeutic regimen comprising an ANGPTL3 inhibitor administered at particular dosing frequencies and amounts, in addition to ezetimibe and lomitapide, the daily dose of statin administered or prescribed to the patient may (a) stay the same, (b) increase, or (c) decrease (e.g., up-titrate or down-titrate) in comparison to the daily statin dose the patient was taking before starting the ANGPTL3 inhibitor, ezetimibe and/or lomitapide therapeutic regimen, depending on the therapeutic needs of the patient.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Therapeutic Efficacy</heading><p id="p-0081" num="0086">The methods of the present invention may result in the reduction in serum levels of one or more lipid components selected from the group consisting of total cholesterol, LDL-C, IDL, non-HDL-C, ApoB 100, ApoB 48, Apo A-1, Apo CIII, VLDL-C, triglycerides, Lp(a), chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, and remnant cholesterol.

Antigen-binding fragments of an antibody may be derived, e.g., from full antibody molecules using any suitable standard techniques such as proteolytic digestion or recombinant genetic engineering techniques involving the manipulation and expression of DNA encoding antibody variable and optionally constant domains. Such DNA is known and/or is readily available from, e.g., commercial sources, DNA libraries (including, e.g., phage-antibody libraries), or can be synthesized.

In any configuration of variable and constant domains, including any of the exemplary configurations listed above, the variable and constant domains may be either directly linked to one another or may be linked by a full or partial hinge or linker region. A hinge region may consist of at least 2 (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60 or more) amino acids, which result in a flexible or semi-flexible linkage between adjacent variable and/or constant domains in a single polypeptide molecule.

The human antibodies of the invention may nonetheless include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for example in the CDRs and in particular CDR3. However, the term &#x201c;human antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences. The term includes antibodies recombinantly produced in a non-human mammal, or in cells of a non-human mammal. The term is not intended to include antibodies isolated from or generated in a human subject.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0098">The term &#x201c;recombinant human antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, is intended to include all human antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies expressed using a recombinant expression vector transfected into a host cell (described further below), antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial human antibody library (described further below), antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes (see e.g., Taylor et al. (1992) Nucl. Acids Res. 20:6287-6295) or antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involves splicing of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In certain embodiments, however, such recombinant human antibodies are subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic mutagenesis) and thus the amino acid sequences of the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human germline V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0099">Human antibodies can exist in two forms that are associated with hinge heterogeneity. In one form, an immunoglobulin molecule comprises a stable four chain construct of approximately 150-160 kDa in which the dimers are held together by an interchain heavy chain disulfide bond. In a second form, the dimers are not linked via inter-chain disulfide bonds and a molecule of about 75-80 kDa is formed composed of a covalently coupled light and heavy chain (half-antibody). These forms have been extremely difficult to separate, even after affinity purification.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0100">The frequency of appearance of the second form in various intact IgG isotypes is due to, but not limited to, structural differences associated with the hinge region isotype of the antibody. A single amino acid substitution in the hinge region of the human IgG4 hinge can significantly reduce the appearance of the second form (Angal et al. (1993) Molecular Immunology 30:105) to levels typically observed using a human IgG1 hinge.

An isolated antibody also includes an antibody in situ within a recombinant cell. Isolated antibodies are antibodies that have been subjected to at least one purification or isolation step. According to certain embodiments, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0102">The term &#x201c;specifically binds,&#x201d; or the like, means that an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof forms a complex with an antigen that is relatively stable under physiologic conditions. Methods for determining whether an antibody specifically binds to an antigen are well known in the art and include, for example, equilibrium dialysis, surface plasmon resonance, and the like. For example, an antibody that &#x201c;specifically binds&#x201d; ANGPTL3, as used in the context of the present invention, includes antibodies that bind ANGPTL3, or a portion thereof with a K<sub>D </sub>of less than about 1000 nM, less than about 500 nM, less than about 300 nM, less than about 200 nM, less than about 100 nM, less than about 90 nM, less than about 80 nM, less than about 70 nM, less than about 60 nM, less than about 50 nM, less than about 40 nM, less than about 30 nM, less than about 20 nM, less than about 10 nM, less than about 5 nM, less than about 4 nM, less than about 3 nM, less than about 2 nM, less than about 1 nM or less than about 0.5 nM, as measured in a surface plasmon resonance assay. An isolated antibody that specifically binds human ANGPTL3, however, has cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as ANGPTL3 molecules from other (non-human) species.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0103">The anti-ANGPTL3 antibodies useful for the methods of the present invention may comprise one or more amino acid substitutions, insertions and/or deletions in the framework and/or CDR regions of the heavy and light chain variable domains as compared to the corresponding germline sequences from which the antibodies were derived. Such mutations can be readily ascertained by comparing the amino acid sequences disclosed herein to germline sequences available from, for example, public antibody sequence databases. The present invention includes methods involving the use of antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments thereof, which are derived from any of the amino acid sequences disclosed herein, wherein one or more amino acids within one or more framework and/or CDR regions are mutated to the corresponding residue(s) of the germline sequence from which the antibody was derived, or to the corresponding residue(s) of another human germline sequence, or to a conservative amino acid substitution of the corresponding germline residue(s) (such sequence changes are referred to herein collectively as &#x201c;germline mutations&#x201d;). A person of ordinary skill in the art, starting with the heavy and light chain variable region sequences disclosed herein, can easily produce numerous antibodies and antigen-binding fragments which comprise one or more individual germline mutations or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, all of the framework and/or CDR residues within the V<sub>H </sub>and/or V<sub>L </sub>domains are mutated back to the residues found in the original germline sequence from which the antibody was derived. In other embodiments, only certain residues are mutated back to the original germline sequence, e.g., only the mutated residues found within the first 8 amino acids of FR1 or within the last 8 amino acids of FR4, or only the mutated residues found within CDR1, CDR2 or CDR3. In other embodiments, one or more of the framework and/or CDR residue(s) are mutated to the corresponding residue(s) of a different germline sequence (i.e., a germline sequence that is different from the germline sequence from which the antibody was originally derived). Furthermore, the antibodies of the present invention may contain any combination of two or more germline mutations within the framework and/or CDR regions, e.g., wherein certain individual residues are mutated to the corresponding residue of a particular germline sequence while certain other residues that differ from the original germline sequence are maintained or are mutated to the corresponding residue of a different germline sequence. Once obtained, antibodies and antigen-binding fragments that contain one or more germline mutations can be easily tested for one or more desired property such as, improved binding specificity, increased binding affinity, improved or enhanced antagonistic or agonistic biological properties (as the case may be), reduced immunogenicity, etc. The use of antibodies and antigen-binding fragments obtained in this general manner are encompassed within the present invention.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0104">The present invention also includes methods involving the use of anti-ANGPTL3 antibodies comprising variants of any of the HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences disclosed herein having one or more conservative substitutions.

A single antigen may have more than one epitope. Thus, different antibodies may bind to different areas on an antigen and may have different biological effects. Epitopes may be either conformational or linear. A conformational epitope is produced by spatially juxtaposed amino acids from different segments of the linear polypeptide chain. A linear epitope is one produced by adjacent amino acid residues in a polypeptide chain. In certain circumstance, an epitope may include moieties of saccharides, phosphoryl groups, or sulfonyl groups on the antigen.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0108">According to certain embodiments, the anti-ANGPTL3 antibodies used in the methods of the present invention are antibodies with pH-dependent binding characteristics.

Thus, according to certain embodiments of the present invention, methods are provided comprising administering an anti-ANGPTL3 antibody which comprises CDR amino acid sequences (e.g., heavy and light chain CDRs) which are identical to the CDR amino acid sequences of a parental ANGPTL3 antibody except for the substitution of one or more amino acids of one or more CDRs of the parental antibody with a histidine residue.

In addition, with respect to subcutaneous delivery, a pen delivery device readily has applications in delivering a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Such a pen delivery device can be reusable or disposable. A reusable pen delivery device generally utilizes a replaceable cartridge that contains a pharmaceutical composition. Once all of the pharmaceutical composition within the cartridge has been administered and the cartridge is empty, the empty cartridge can readily be discarded and replaced with a new cartridge that contains the pharmaceutical composition. The pen delivery device can then be reused. In a disposable pen delivery device, there is no replaceable cartridge. Rather, the disposable pen delivery device comes prefilled with the pharmaceutical composition held in a reservoir within the device.

Preclinical studies and human genetic analyses suggest that inhibition of angiopoietin-like protein (ANGPTL3) lowers LDL-C and provides cardiovascular benefit, independently of the LDL receptor. Evinacumab, a human ANGPTL3 antibody, was administered to nine HoFH adults (three null homozygotes) already on maximally-tolerated conventional therapies. LDL-C decreased 49% (range &#x2212;25% to &#x2212;90%) at week 4 (primary endpoint). Overall mean peak reduction in LDL-C was &#x2212;58&#xb1;18% (&#x2212;90% to &#x2212;33%) between weeks 4 and 12, showing that ANGPTL3 inhibition by evinacumab substantially reduces LDL-C in HoFH patients.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0143">Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) play a major role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and risk of cardiovascular disease. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is typically a disorder occurring through mutations in genes encoding proteins that regulate clearance of LDL. These include the genes for the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), and low-density lipoprotein receptor adaptor protein 1 (LDLRAP1) (Cuchel, et al. 2014 <i>Eur Heart J </i>35:2146-57). Patients with heterozygous FH usually have untreated plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels ranging from 350 to 550 mg per deciliter and generally respond to lipid-lowering therapies, including moderate to high doses of high-potency statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 antibodies (Goldberg, et al. 2011 <i>J Clin Lipidol </i>2011; 5:S1-8; Kastelein, et al. 2014 <i>Cardiovasc Drugs Ther </i>28:281-9). Homozygous FH (HoFH) is a rare disease, which affects 1 in 160,000 to 300,000 people. Patients with HoFH carry two FH-causing mutations (homozygous or compound heterozygous), have much higher untreated LDL-C levels, generally ranging from 500 to 1000 mg per deciliter (Kolansky, et al. 2008 <i>The American journal of cardiology </i>102:1438-43), and are significantly less responsive or unresponsive to standard lipid-lowering therapies. Most individuals with HoFH develop severe xanthomatosis, coronary heart disease, and peripheral atherosclerosis at an early age, and can die before the age of 30 if left untreated (Nordestgaard, et al. 2013 <i>Eur Heart J </i>34:3478-90a).</p><p id="p-0139" num="0144">Genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity in HoFH can translate into broad variability in cardiovascular disease manifestation and response to lipid-lowering therapies. Some FH-causing mutations result in defective LDL receptors with residual activity, whereas others have no activity and therefore do not respond to conventional lipid-lowering medications, such as statins and PCSK9 antibodies, which mainly target the process of LDL-receptor expression (Santos P C, Pereira A C. 2015 <i>Pharmacogenomics </i>16:1743-50; Rader D J, Kastelein J J. 2014 <i>Circulation </i>129:1022-32). Drugs with mechanisms of action unrelated to the LDL receptor, such as lomitapide and mipomersen, have been approved recently for treating HoFH, but their use can be hampered by tolerability and safety issues.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0145">Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) is a secreted protein expressed in the liver. It acts to increase plasma levels of triglycerides, LDL-C, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) by inhibiting the activity of lipoprotein lipase and endothelial lipase or by modulating the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins upstream of LDL production (Wang, et al. 2015 <i>J Lipid Res </i>56:1296-307; Musunuru, et al. 2010 <i>N Engl J Med </i>363:2220-7). Preclinical studies show that knockout of ANGPTL3, or blockade by an antibody, can lower triglycerides and LDL-C independently of the LDL-R, and have benefit in models of atherosclerosis (Ando, et al. 2003 <i>J Lipid Res </i>44:1216-23; Dewey, et al. 2017 <i>New Engl J Med</i>; in press). Consistent with this, large-scale genetic studies in man show that loss-of-function mutations in ANGPTL3 lead to reduced plasma levels of triglycerides, LDL-C, and HDL-C (Robciuc, et al. 2013 <i>Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology </i>33:1706-13; Pisciotta, et al. 2012 <i>Circ Cardiovasc Genet </i>5:42-50; Minicocci, et al. 2013 <i>J Lipid Res </i>54:3481-90; Wang, et al. 2015 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112:11630-5; Noto, et al. 2012 Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology 32:805-9; Martin-Campos, et al. 2012 <i>Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry </i>413:552-5), and even more importantly, that these lipid changes associated with ANGPTL3 mutations are also associated with protection from cardiovascular disease (Stitziel, et al. 2017 <i>Journal of the American College of Cardiology</i>). Altogether, the preclinical studies as well as the human genetic analyses suggest that ANGPTL3-inhibiting therapies could reduce LDL-C and provide benefit in patients with FH, including those suffering from profound homozygous disease, Evinacumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically blocks ANGPTL3 (Gusarova, et al. 2015 <i>J Lipid Res </i>56:1308-17). In normal healthy volunteers, evinacumab was well tolerated and reduced the three major lipid fractions. A phase 2 study was conducted to determine whether evinacumab reduced LDL-C levels in nine patients with genetically and phenotypically confirmed HoFH, including patients homozygous for null mutations completely lacking LDLR activity.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">METHODS</heading><p id="p-0141" num="0146">Patients: The nine patients (5 men, 4 women) were selected based on their genotypes and phenotypes.

Importantly, these reductions were on top of baseline levels already achieved on stable, maximally-tolerated lipid-lowering therapy with or without lomitapide, PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies or portacaval shunt. These results provide proof-of-concept of a substantial additional reduction in LDL-C by evinacumab, on top of standard of care, in the treatment of HoFH, with the potential for LDL-C normalization in some patients presenting with extremely high LDL-C levels. Evinacumab given as a 250-mg subcutaneous injection at baseline and as a 15 mg per kilogram intravenous infusion at week 2 was well tolerated. In a recently reported first-in-human study of healthy human volunteers, evinacumab was also shown to reduce LDL-C and was also well tolerated in a larger number of patients (Dewey, et al. 2017 <i>New Engl J Med</i>; in press). All nine patients, including the three homozygous null patients lacking LDLR activity, demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions in LDL-C from baseline. Together with recent preclinical studies and human genetic analyses, the results suggest that Angptl3 inhibition can not only lower LDL-C and triglycerides, but also provide protection from cardiovascular disease. These studies provide real hope for a well-tolerated and impactful treatment for patients suffering from profound familial hypercholesterolemia. Based on the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (CTTC) analyses (Cholesterol Treatment Trialists (CTT) Collaboration 2010 Lancet 376:1670-81), an absolute decrease of 39 mg/dL in LDL-C corresponds to a 22% relative risk reduction over 4-5 years of statin treatment; recent outcomes data with a PCSK9 antibody support similar risk reductions per unit LDL-C reduction when accounting for shorter treatment duration (Sabatine, et al. 2017 <i>N Engl J Med </i>e-publication 3-17-17; in press). Together with the genetic data on the protective effects of ANGPTL3 mutations on cardiovascular risk (Stitziel, et al. 2017 <i>Journal of the American College of Cardiology </i>69(16):2054-2063), the absolute reductions of a 150-200 mg/dL achieved with evinacumab in HoFH patients could have unprecedented benefit for these very high risk patients.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0152">The mechanism that led to such large reductions in LDL-C is currently under investigation. Evinacumab relieves the normal inhibition, by ANGPTL3, of both lipoprotein lipase (a major regulator of triglycerides and endothelial lipase (a regulator of HDL-C (Shimamura, et al. 2007 <i>Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology </i>27:366-72); thus, the lowering of both triglycerides and HDL-C by evinacumab. The instant results, combined with the results of a recent in vivo study (Wang, et al. 2015 <i>J Lipid Res </i>56:1296-307), suggest that the effects of evinacumab on LDL-C involve a combination of canonical and noncanonical mechanisms acting upstream of</p><p id="p-0151" num="0153">SPECIFICATION - CLEAN COPY LDL-particle formation. In a mouse model, inactivation of ANGPTL3 with evinacumab did not affect the number of VLDLs secreted by the liver, but qualitatively altered the VLDL particles that were made. Following secretion, VLDLs are rapidly hydrolyzed to form triglyceride-poorer VLDL remnants due to evinacumab-induced up-regulation of lipoprotein lipase, which may increase their clearance through receptors other than LDL receptors. In terms of the modest reductions seen with HDL-C, extensive previous genetic analyses involving endothelial lipase (Voight, et al. 2012 <i>Lancet </i>380:572-80), as well as the recent genetic findings with ANGPTL3 protection (Dewey 2017, Stitziel 2017), are consistent with the emerging view that levels of HDL-C do not directly affect cardiovascular risk (Ko, et al. 2016 <i>Journal of the American College of Cardiology </i>68:2073-83).</p><p id="p-0152" num="0154">Patient C and G concomitantly received lomitapide&#x2014;a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor&#x2014;during the study. These patients showed a 90% and 44% reduction in LDL-C, respectively, 2 weeks after evinacumab intravenous administration, raising the hypothesis of a multiplicative synergy between lomitapide (which affects VLDL production) and evinacumab (which affects the characteristics of secreted VLDL). However, patient D did not receive lomitapide and showed a &#x2212;77% reduction in LDL-C at week 4.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0155">The results reported herein provide proof-of-concept that ANGPTL3 inhibition with evinacumab leads to a substantial additional reduction in LDL-C in patients with HoFH on stable lipid-lowering therapy, including those who have null/null mutations. Evinacumab add-on therapy allowed normalization of LDL-C concentrations in four HoFH participants in this study. For example, Patient C, a 47-year-old woman, presented LDL-C values above 800 mg per deciliter at age 26. Her lipid profile progressively improved (reaching 150 to 170 mg per deciliter) with the successive introduction of high-dose statins, ezetimibe and lomitapide. LDL-C reached 15 mg per deciliter at week 4, 2 weeks after evinacumab intravenous administration.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="1">Example 3: Inhibition of ANGPTL3 by Evinacumab Reduced Triglycerides (TGs) and LDL-C in Subjects Presenting with Modest Elevations in TGs and/or LDL-C</heading><p id="p-0154" num="0156">Elevations in LDL-C and TGs have been linked to increased risk in CHD. Recent discoveries have demonstrated a central role for Angiopoietin like-3 (ANGPTL3) in lipid metabolism.

The most frequent TEAEs were headache (7 [11.3%] vs. 0 [0%]) and increases in ALT/AST [&#x3e;2&#xd7; ULN] (5 treated subjects vs 1 PBO subject). There was no dose-related safety trend.

The duration of TG reduction and LDL was dose-dependent and extended to 64 and 43 days, respectively, after 20 mg/kg IV evinacumab administration.
