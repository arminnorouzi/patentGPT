invention can prevent stickiness, provide good fastness to rubbing, and improve color reproducibility and texture.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0274">According to an embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to provide a textile printing ink that can prevent stickiness, has good fastness to rubbing, and can improve color reproducibility and texture.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0275">The expression mechanism or action mechanism of the effect of an embodiment of the present invention is not clear, but is presumed as follows.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0276">In general, it is desirable to use high-molecular weight polymer particles in order to bind the pigment and the fiber because the high-molecular weight polymer particles are sticky and hardly peeled off. After dyeing, polymer particles are crosslinked in order to suppress stickiness, but when the high-molecular weight polymer particles are crosslinked, the strength of the polymer is increased, impairing the texture.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0277">In light of this, first polymer particles and second polymer particles are mixed at a specific ratio of the weight average molecular weight, that is, high-molecular weight polymer particles as the first polymer particles and low-molecular weight polymer particles as the second polymer particles are mixed to bond these polymer particles. This reduces network structure due to bonding between the high-molecular weight polymer particles, and thus secures softness (texture) and color reproducibility.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0278">In addition, an advantage of bonding high-molecular weight polymer particles and low-molecular weight polymer particles (that is, the post crosslinking) is to provide a function of bonding the pigment and the fiber before crosslinking Furthermore, when polymer particles, which are sticky as they are, are crosslinked to be an ultrahigh-molecular weight polymer, the stickiness thereof can be prevented after crosslinking, so that the fastness to rubbing is improved.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0279">Here, the crosslinking reaction mechanism of the high-molecular weight polymer particles and the low-molecular weight polymer particles will be described.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0280">The reaction mechanism described below is a mechanism in which crosslinkable monomers contained in the high-molecular weight polymer particles and the low-molecular weight polymer particles react with a crosslinking agent contained in the ink.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0281">For example, when monomers constituting the basic skeleton of the polymers contained in the high-molecular weight polymer particles and the low-molecular weight polymer particles are butyl acrylate (BA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA), and the crosslinkable monomer is diacetone acrylamide (DAAM), if a crosslinking agent (adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH)) is dissolved in the ink, in the drying step, the ADH and the crosslinkable functional group derived from the crosslinkable monomer (DAAM) in each polymer particle react with each other, and the high-molecular weight polymer particles and the low-molecular weight polymer particles are bonded to each other. This can prevent the stickiness of the surface of the fabric, and ensure the improvement in the fastness to rubbing and the texture and color reproducibility as described above.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0282">In this reaction mechanism, although not illustrated, a basic skeleton (for example, BA-MMA) constituting the polymer particle is bonded to a structural portion derived from DAAM.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="140.80mm" wi="155.36mm" file="US20230002967A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0253" num="0283">Although embodiments of the present invention have been described and illustrated in detail, the disclosed embodiments are made for purposes of illustration and example only and not limitation.
