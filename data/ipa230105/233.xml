Applicators of this type generally take the form of a brush having an elongate central core with a plurality of bristles extending radially therefrom. Embodiments of the disclosed and claimed subject matter may be described herein in with reference to mascara and brushes for applying the same, however, it will be appreciated that the disclosure is not limited to mascara and brushes. In this regard, the term &#x201c;mascara&#x201d; more generally includes cosmetic formulations of the type described herein to be applied to keratin fibers. Further, as used herein, the term &#x201c;brush&#x201d; is not limited to a particular applicator configuration and may include various configurations having a plurality of bristles extending from a core.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is desirable that the mascara brushes be configured to retain a sufficient amount of product, i.e., cosmetic formulation, so that it is not necessary to recharge the brush too often during application. Further, these applicators must make it possible to grasp the lashes, to separate the lashes, to lengthen the lashes, and/or to bend the lashes, according to the type of makeup desired. Known applicators, such as mascara brushes or combs, have fixed characteristics with regard to flexibility and the arrangement in the space of the bristles or teeth. For example, known applicators typically have a hardness in the range of 45 shore A to 55 shore A.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The performance of a mascara usually is less dependent on the brush itself or the formula itself, but instead depends on the specific combinations of brush/material/wiper/formula being used. Some combinations of specific dimensions/material hardnesses/formula viscosities/etc., will deliver performance superior to competition with similar brushes and/or similar formulations but missing one or more of the key attributes. The present disclosure describes combinations not formerly practiced in the industry.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows packaging set 100 for a cosmetic composition 60 according to aspects of the present disclosure. The set 100 includes a container 50 with an interior cavity in which the cosmetic composition 60 is stored. An opening is formed in the container and is covered by a wiper 54 with an aperture 56 extending therethrough.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">An applicator 40 includes a handle 30 that engages threads 58 formed on the container 50 to detachably couple the applicator to the container. An elongate stem 52 extends from the handle 30 and includes a brush 10 positioned on the end of the stem opposite the handle. When the handle 30 of the applicator 40 is coupled to the container 50, the stem 20 extends through the aperture 56 of the wiper 54, and the handle covers the aperture to seal the interior of the container. At the same time, the brush 10, which will be described in further detail, is positioned within the container 50 and in contact with the cosmetic composition 60 disposed therein.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Suitable embodiments of a cosmetic composition according to the present disclosure may comprise a wax and a polymer. According to a first embodiment, the composition comprises, in a physiologically acceptable medium, a wax and a polymer with a specific amide unit, intended in particular for the cosmetic field. In an embodiment, the composition is in the form of a composition for coating the eyelashes (in particular mascara), eyeliner, product for the eyebrows, product for the lips, blush or eyeshadow, foundation, body makeup product, concealer, nail polish, skin care product, including scalp, hair product (hair mascara, spray). The composition can also be applied to make-up accessories (support) such as false eyelashes, hairpieces, wigs, false nails or else on sticks or patches adhering to the skin or hares (of the fly type).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the composition, the use of a polymer with a particular amide unit in combination with a wax-in-water emulsion makes it possible to improve the adhesion properties of the composition on keratinous materials, in particular on keratin fibers such as eyelashes. The composition is easily applied to keratinous materials and allows the composition to be deposited quickly in sufficient quantity to obtain a makeup having the expected cosmetic properties. In particular, a thick deposit of make-up is quickly obtained on the keratinous materials, which prevents users from applying the composition for too long to the keratinous materials. Thus, for a mascara, a makeup is obtained that rapidly thickens the keratin fibers, in particular the eyelashes; there is thus an instantaneous loading of the eyelashes. In addition, the mascara gives good lengthening to the made-up eyelashes.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the composition may comprise, in a physiologically acceptable aqueous medium, a wax-in-water emulsion and at least one first polymer of weight average molecular weight less than 100,000, comprising a polymer backbone, having non-pendant amide units and at least one pendant fatty chain and/or at least one terminal fatty chain optionally functionalized, having from 6 to 120 carbon atoms and being linked to these amide units.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the composition may include a combination of at least one first polymer of weight-average molecular mass of less than 100,000 and better still less than 50,000, comprising a) a polymer backbone having repeating hydrocarbon patterns provided with at least one non-pendant amide unit, and at least one pendant fatty chain and/or at least one terminal fatty chain optionally functionalized, having from 6 to 120 carbon atoms and being linked to these amide units, and at least at least one wax, in a physiologically acceptable composition in the form of a wax-in-water emulsion, for obtaining an adherent deposit on keratinous materials and/or for rapid makeup of keratinous materials and/or for rapidly thickening and/or lengthening the eyelashes.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, a &#x201c;physiologically acceptable medium&#x201d; is a non-toxic medium capable of being applied to the skin, the integuments, or the lips of human beings, such as a cosmetic medium.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, a &#x201c;functionalized chain&#x201d; is an alkyl chain comprising one or more functional or reactive groups chosen in particular from amide, hydroxyl, ether, oxyalkylene or polyoxyalkylene, halogen groups, including fluorinated or perfluorinated groups, ester, siloxane, polysiloxane. In an embodiment, the hydrogen atoms of one or more fatty chains are substituted at least partially by fluorine atoms. In an embodiment, these chains are linked directly to the polymer backbone or via an ester function or a perfluorinated group.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein, a &#x201c;polymer&#x201d; is a compound having at least 2 repeating units, and preferably at least 3 repeating units.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, a &#x201c;hydrocarbon repeating unit&#x201d; is a unit comprising from 2 to 80 carbon atoms, and preferably from 2 to 60 carbon atoms, carrying hydrogen atoms and optionally atoms of oxygen, which, in an embodiment, are linear, branched or cyclic, saturated or unsaturated.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">These units further comprise each of one or more non-pendant amide units found in the polymer backbone.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an embodiment, the pendant chains are linked directly to at least one of the amide units of the polymer backbone.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an embodiment, the first polymer comprise, between the hydrocarbon units, silicone units or oxyalkylene units.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition, in some embodiments, the first polymer of the composition can include from 40% to 98% of fatty chains relative to the total number of amide units and fatty chains and better still from 50% to 95%. The proportion of amide patterns may depend on the nature of the fatty phase and is in particular similar to the polar nature of the fatty phase. Thus, the higher the proportion of amide units in the first polymer, which corresponds to the presence of several amide units, the more the first polymer has affinity with polar oils.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an embodiment, the first polymer of the composition has a weight-average molecular mass of less than 100,000 (in particular ranging from 1,000 to 100,000), in particular less than 50,000 (in particular ranging from 1000 to 50,000), and more particularly ranging from 1,000 to 30,000, preferably 2000 to 20,000, and better from 2000 to 10,000.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first polymer, and in particular polyamide, is not soluble in water, in particular at 25&#xb0; C.

For example, a semi-circle is more rigid (less flexible) than a circle; an oval has different stiffnesses along the major axis and the minor axis, a rectangle has a more rigid base, etc.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0119">In some embodiments, the rigidity of the rows follows a set pattern. For example, in some embodiments, every fourth row is more rigid than the remaining rows. These and other variations in the bristle flexibility are contemplated and should be considered within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0120">In some embodiments, the core 12 and the bristles 14 are separately formed and then joined by mechanical fasteners, interference fits, adhesives, or other suitable means. In some embodiments, the core 12 and bristles 14 are manufactured by overmolding, insert molding, or any other suitable manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0121">In some embodiments, the bristles 14 comprise thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs), including styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS), HYTREL, other suitable TPEs, and/or mixture thereof.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">In addition to having a hardness in the range of 32 shore D to 38 shore D, the bristle material is preferably configured to provide the bristles 14 with bend recovery in the range of 90% to 100%. With respect to nylon and other thermoplastic materials, &#x201c;bend recovery&#x201d; is an indication of the material's &#x201c;memory.&#x201d; In a brush filament, the bend recovery is the tendency for a deflected filament to return to its original deployment. The bend recovery for nylon is generally over 90%, i.e., the filament returns to about 90% of its original deployment after being deflected.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0123">For previously known cosmetic compositions, brushes having bristles with a hardness in the range of 45 shore D to 55 shore D were utilized because using softer brushes, e.g., brushes having a hardness in the range of 32 shore D to 38 shore D was not feasible. In this regard, brushes with softer bristles were not effective because the bristles were too soft to work with typical formulations that were thick enough to require a stronger stroking motion. More specifically, softer bristles flex too much to effectively deposit the cosmetic composition onto the lash.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0124">It was discovered, however, that a cosmetic composition comprising a wax emulsion and a polymer in the manner of the described embodiments achieved unexpectedly superior application results using a brush having a hardness in the range of 32 shore D to 38 shore D. Contrary to conventional views, it was discovered that a soft bristle material provides improved application of the disclosed cosmetic compositions because the formulation is creamy enough to create just the right amount of flexing of brush the core relative to the pressure against lashes, with the bristles being more flexible than traditional brushes. As a result, the bristles adjust to the various angles that lashes create during stroking, making the brush more adaptive so that the cosmetic composition is deposited evenly across the lashes.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0125">While illustrative embodiments have been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230000234A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230000234A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-claim-statement>The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
