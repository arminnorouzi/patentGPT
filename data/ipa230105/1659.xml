In fact, while in order to confer good rolling resistance to a pneumatic tire treads that are manufactured with compounds with a low hysteresis loss are used, in order to confer good wet grip performance to a pneumatic tire compounds having a relatively higher hysteresis loss become necessary.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Consequently, an optimal tread compound for simultaneously enhancing all dynamic responses should exhibit opposing hysteresis characteristics, at least over certain required performance limits.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known that the properties of the aforementioned rubber compound influence not only the balance between wet grip performance/rolling resistance, but also other performance of the pneumatic tire, such as the balance between winter/wet grip performance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As is known, the tread is composed of a plurality of blocks, which are elements that are delimited by a plurality of grooves that are formed within the tread. These grooves may have differing dimensions depending upon the function that they must fulfill. For example, when the grooves are small in size they are called blades and are intended to provide greater grip on snow and ice.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In other words, a tread block is a rubber filled portion bounded by a plurality of grooves, independently of whatever the dimensions of the latter may be.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The inventors of the present invention have found that, if the blocks of the tread are composed of different portions manufactured with respective compounds having differing hysteresis losses, it is possible to obtain a synergistic effect that is capable of imparting significant improvements in terms of wet grip performance, without thereby adversely affect the rolling resistance.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The inventors of the present invention have implemented a process and an associated plant in order to be able to manufacture, in an effective and productive manner, a tread comprising blocks composed of different portions having differing hysteresis losses.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The object of the present invention is a process for the manufacture of a tread band, wherein, the blocks thereof comprise different portions having differing hysteresis losses; said process being characterized in that it comprises a step for the extrusion of a preliminary tread band consisting of a first rubber compound and an injection step, wherein the preliminary tread band, once extruded, is subjected to the action of at least one injector arranged such as to penetrate into the layer of the preliminary tread band and to discharge a second rubber compound, which is distributed within the layer consisting of said first compound, maintaining exposed a surface that is suitable for defining a portion of the ground-contacting surface of the resulting tread band; said first and said second compounds having different dynamic properties in terms of: dynamic modulus at 30&#xb0; C., tan &#x3b4; at 0&#xb0; C., tan &#x3b4; at 30&#xb0; C. and tan &#x3b4; at 60&#xb0; C., said first compound has a dynamic modulus at 30&#xb0; C. of between 11.0 and 17.0 MPa, a tan &#x3b4; at 0&#xb0; C. of between 0.85 and 1.1, a tan &#x3b4; at 30&#xb0; C. of between 0.45 and 0.65 and a tan &#x3b4; at 60&#xb0; C. of between 0.19 and 0.30; said second compound having a dynamic modulus at 30&#xb0; C. of between 5.5 and 15 MPa and at least 2 MPa less than that of said first compound, a tan &#x3b4; at 0&#xb0; C. of between 0.40 and 0.99 and at least 0.02 less than that of said first compound, a tan &#x3b4; at 30&#xb0; C. of between 0.21 and 0.63 and at least 0.02 less than that of said first compound, a tan &#x3b4; at 60&#xb0; C. of between 0.10 and 0.28 and at least 0.02 less than that of said first compound.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, said extrusion step is continuous and said injection step is discontinuous.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, said process comprises an interconnection step, wherein said preliminary tread band, which is produced continuously, is stopped at intervals in order to then be recovered and subjected to said injection step.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, said first compound having a dynamic modulus at 30&#xb0; C. of between 11.0 and 17.0 MPa, a tan &#x3b4; at 0&#xb0; C. of between 0.85 and 1.1, a tan &#x3b4; at 30&#xb0; C. of between 0.45 and 0.65 and a tan &#x3b4; at 60&#xb0; C. of between 0.19 and 0.30, said second compound having a dynamic modulus at 30&#xb0; C. lower than that of said first compound with a value of between 7.5 and 10.5 MPa, a tan &#x3b4; at 0&#xb0; C. lower than that of said first compound with a value of between 0.70 and 0.84, a tan &#x3b4; at 30&#xb0; C. lower than that of said first compound with a value of between 0.21 and 0.42 a tan &#x3b4; at 60&#xb0; C. lower than that of said first compound with a value of between 0.10 and 0.17.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The dynamic properties were measured in accordance with the ISO 4664 standard.
