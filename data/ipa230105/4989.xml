When a Payment Card transaction is initiated, the card network conveys cardholder identifying information to the bank that issued the Payment Card. The issuing bank generate a random, one time data code (OTDC) upon receipt of cardholder identifying information. Alternatively, the cardholder may request an OTDC, by directly messaging the issuing bank or via an automated communication between the cardholder's mobile device and the issuing bank. The issuing bank then sends the cardholder an OTDC, preferably via an encrypted, secured transmission. The cardholder provides the OTDC to the merchant. The OTDC is part of the issuing bank's transaction approval criteria. The transaction should not be approved unless the merchant provides the OTDC to the issuing bank. The OTDC will only work for the transaction in question, and it will preferably expire shortly after its generation, if it remains unused.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="85.43mm" wi="111.42mm" file="US20230004990A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="176.87mm" wi="113.45mm" file="US20230004990A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="175.18mm" wi="115.65mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230004990A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIORITY CLAIM</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of and claims benefit to U.S. PCT application PCT/US2021/021774 which was filed on Mar. 10, 2021, and which claimed benefit to U.S. provisional patent application No. 62/987,402, filed on Mar. 10, 2020, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

In 2018, global Payment Card fraud exceeded $27 Billion (USD). Numerous efforts exist to stem fraud in this arena. One is the EMV or &#x201c;Chip and Pin&#x201d; protocol. This is a relatively effective security system in which a computer chip is embedded in the Payment Card. When the Payment Card is placed in a card reader, the system can verify that the Payment Card is authentic by reading information on the chip. This makes it much more difficult to create a useable counterfeit Payment Card. Unfortunately, the result has been to push Payment Card fraud online. Between 2015 and 2016, card-present fraud&#x2014;fraud where a fraudulent card was physically presented to a merchant&#x2014;fell in the U.S. from $3.6 Billion (USD) to $2.9 Billion (USD) annually. In the same time frame, card-not-present fraud jumped from $3.4 Billion (USD) to 4.57 Billion (USD). By 2020, card-not-present fraud was over 80 percent more common than card-present fraud.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One way that Payment Card companies attempt to combat online and other card-not-present fraud is with single use account numbers. The account number on a Payment Card typically contains between 13 and 19 digits and most commonly 15 or 16 digits. An account number being compromised is one source of Payment Card fraud. Consumers give the account number to a salesperson over a phone line or enter it into a computer system in the course of making a purchase. This creates opportunities for the account number to become compromised by a person working for the merchant or by a person who has hacked into the merchant's computer system. To avoid this risk, consumers can request a single-use Payment Card number. The Payment Card company will issue a single use 13-19 digit number that can be used only once. If the number is compromised, it will not matter because the number cannot be used again. This method is very effective in combating fraud. However, it is highly inefficient. Telephone and especially online commerce has increased rapidly over the past decade and exploded over the pandemic year of 2020. It is not practical for consumers to request a single use account number every time they want to use their Payment Card to make an online purchase. The limitation of liability policies under which consumers are only responsible for up to $50 (USD) in fraudulent charges provides little incentive for consumers to go to the effort necessary to obtain single use numbers for every transaction. Additionally, the approach does not work at all for card-present transactions, when the physical Payment Card, with the actual card number, is usually presented. Moreover, the effort required to obtain a single use number with every transaction acts as an impediment to the use of the Payment Card by the consumer. This is contrary to the interest of the Payment Card issuers, who want to maximize the use of their cards, not impede them.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another approach to fraud prevention is transaction monitoring. Card companies keep watch on the cardholders' purchase behavior. If a purchase is made with the Card number that appears out of line with the cardholder's ordinary purchasing patterns, whether in terms of location for card-present transactions or in terms of amount or the nature of the purchase for card-not-present transactions, the Card company may put a hold on the transaction, refusing to allow the transaction to proceed until the card holder can be reached. The card may be inactivated as well, pending verification of the transaction by the consumer. The effectiveness of this approach is open to debate, as less brazen criminals are unlikely to trigger the system. Additionally, false positives under this approach are extremely undesirable from the perspective of the Payment Card company, as they inhibit use of the Card by the consumer.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When fraud is detected, the Payment Card companies will cancel the card number and issue a new Payment Card with a new account number to the consumer. In addition to the cost of replacement, this adversely affects the Payment Card issuer because it prevents the consumer from using the Payment Card while it is being replaced. Anything that inhibits the cardholders' use of their Payment Cards is contrary to the interests of Payment Card issuers. Accordingly, a system and method of preventing Payment Card fraud is desired.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the invention to prevent or inhibit Payment Card fraud.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is another object of the invention to prevent or inhibit card-not-present Payment Card fraud.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is still another object of the invention to prevent or inhibit card-present Payment Card fraud.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is yet another object of the invention to prevent or inhibit Payment Card fraud without inhibiting the ability of consumers to use their Payment Cards.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is still another object of the invention to prevent or inhibit Payment Card fraud without requiring any additional affirmative steps from consumers during a Payment Card transaction.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is yet another object of the invention to minimize the amount of time Payment Cards must be inactivated because of suspected or actual fraud.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A system for preventing or inhibiting Payment Card fraud is disclosed.

The merchant transmits (at a minimum) <b>2</b>A the card number <b>30</b> (or a code corresponding to the card number <b>30</b>) and the transaction amount to the merchant bank or its processor(s)(collectively, the &#x201c;merchant bank&#x201d;), which transmits the card number <b>30</b> (or a code) to the issuing bank or its processor(s)(collectively, the &#x201c;issuing bank&#x201d; or &#x201c;issuer bank&#x201d; <b>45</b>) via the appropriate card network <b>80</b>, which are commonly indicated on the face of the Payment Card <b>20</b>. The most common card networks are Banknet&#x2122; which processes MasterCard&#x2122; transactions and VisaNet&#x2122; which processes Visa&#x2122; transactions. Common issuing banks <b>45</b> include Chase&#x2122;, Capital One&#x2122;, Bank of America&#x2122;, etc. American Express&#x2122; and Discover&#x2122; have their own networks; however, in addition to being networks American Express&#x2122; and Discover&#x2122; are also the issuing bank <b>45</b>, serving dual roles in their systems. However, conventional banking facilities are not necessary for a bank to issue payment cards <b>20</b>. The issuing bank <b>45</b> may be a digital bank. Criteria to be an issuing bank <b>45</b> will typically be determined by the card network <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Historically, the cardholder information was contained in a magnetic strip <b>44</b> on the back of the Payment Card <b>20</b>, though most modern Payment Cards <b>20</b> contain this information in the EMV chip <b>90</b> and/or contactless chip <b>49</b>, which are usually provided in addition to the magnetic strip <b>44</b>. The foregoing communication typically takes place over a telecommunication system such as the telephone system or the Internet.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The issuing bank <b>45</b> determines <b>4</b> whether the transaction meets its criteria&#x2014;the &#x201c;transaction approval criteria&#x201d;&#x2014;and issues a code approving <b>14</b>A or declining <b>14</b>B the transaction, which is transmitted back through the card network to the merchant. At this point, the transaction is authorized (or not).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The transaction approval criteria of issuing banks may vary substantially. Most check to ensure that the transaction will not exceed the credit limit or funds available associated with the Payment Card <b>20</b>, that the cardholder <b>40</b> is in good standing, and that the Payment Card <b>20</b> is not expired. For card-present transactions, the issuing bank <b>45</b> may require the cardholder <b>40</b> to enter a personal identification number (PIN) or to provide a signature. When the Payment Card <b>20</b> includes a chip <b>90</b>, the EVC information from the chip <b>90</b> will typically be required. For card-not-present transactions, many issuing banks <b>45</b> require the cardholder's billing address to be provided to the merchant. Many issuing banks <b>45</b> also require the merchant to obtain the card verification value (CVV) <b>46</b> from the cardholder <b>40</b>. This is, typically, a three or four digit code on the back of many Payment Cards <b>20</b>. If the transaction approval information provided by the cardholder <b>40</b> does not match or meet the issuer's transaction approval criteria, the transaction should not be authorized. Many issuing banks <b>45</b> also put a limit on the number of times a particular card number <b>30</b> may be attempted to be used without passing the transaction approval criteria, essentially &#x201c;locking&#x201d; the card number <b>30</b> for some period of time if too many failed attempts are made. How many are too many may vary, but 3 to 5 and most preferably 3 failed attempts before locking the card number <b>30</b> is an appropriate number to avoid brute force attacks.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, an additional security measure is provided. The issuing bank's transaction authorization system, typically a backend server, will generate <b>3</b> a one time data code (OTDC), sometimes referred to as a card-not-present transaction number (CNPN), though it may be used in card-present and card-not-present transactions.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, initiation of the transaction <b>1</b> will cause the cardholder's Payment Card number <b>30</b> or other cardholder identifying information to be transmitted <b>2</b>A to the issuing bank <b>45</b>. (As discussed above, the merchant transmits information to the merchant's bank or processor(s) which transmit information to the issuing bank <b>45</b> or its processor via the card network. Those of skill in the art will understand the channels of communication. Accordingly, these are not repeated for each communication between the merchant and the issuing bank <b>45</b>.)</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Receipt of sufficient information by the issuing bank <b>45</b> to (a) identify the cardholder <b>40</b> and (b) indicate that the cardholder <b>40</b> is attempting to conduct a transaction using the Payment Card <b>20</b> will trigger the issuing bank <b>45</b> to generate <b>3</b> an OTDC.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another embodiment, as addressed in more detail below, the cardholder <b>40</b> may initiate the generation of an OTDC, by sending the issuing bank <b>45</b> a request <b>2</b>B for an OTDC.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Whether the OTDC is generated <b>3</b> automatically by the issuing bank <b>45</b> in response to information indicating that a transaction has been initiated <b>2</b>A or at the request <b>2</b>B of the cardholder <b>40</b>, generation of an OTDC may be done by a random number generator. The random number generator may be a true random number generator, a pseudo-random number generator, or a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator. All of these are intended to be encompassed within the phrase, &#x201c;random number generator.&#x201d; There are many different computer based random number generators known and available to those of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The OTDC may be as many digits as the issuing bank <b>45</b> desires. Typically, the OTDC will be three to five digits. If letters or special characters are desired, they may be included in the OTDC.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As the name implies, a one time data code is intended to be used once. The issuing bank's computer system may check <b>4</b> the OTDC to ensure that it hasn't been utilized by the cardholder <b>40</b> or with the cardholder's Payment Card number <b>30</b> before. If the randomly generated OTDC is not unique, or if it does not meet some other criteria of the issuing bank <b>45</b>, the ineligible OTDC will be discarded and a new OTDC will be generated before the OTDC is transmitted <b>6</b> by the issuing bank <b>45</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the list of OTDC's ineligible for use with a particular Payment Card <b>20</b> will reset. Generally speaking, the shorter the OTDC, the more likely a reset will be required to prevent the system from running out of eligible OTDC's. The list of ineligible OTDC's may reset once a set passage of time has expired&#x2014;every thirty or ninety days for example. The list could reset every time Payment Card <b>20</b> expires and a new Payment Card <b>20</b> is issued. The list could reset every time a new card number <b>30</b> is issued. The list of ineligible OTDC's may never reset. A reset may be unnecessary when the OTDC is five of more digits in length. Finally, a list of ineligible OTDC's is a security option, not a requirement. Because the OTDC is randomly generated, the odds of a new, randomly generated OTDC matching an earlier OTDC will be negligible&#x2014;roughly 1/1000 for a three digit OTDC. Knowing one or even several OTDC's previously used with a particular payment card number <b>30</b> would be very unlikely to enable a third party to use the credit payment number <b>30</b> to make an unauthorized purchase even if the OTDC's were reused because a previously used OTDC is very unlikely to match the OTDC generated for the transaction in question. When the issuing bank <b>45</b> locks card numbers <b>30</b> for excessive failed attempts to pass the transaction authorization criteria, the already small risk of a previously used OTDC being successfully used to fraudulently obtain authorization for a particular transaction is further reduced.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Once the OTDC has been generated <b>3</b> and found to meet the issuing bank's criteria <b>4</b>, the issuing bank <b>45</b> will transmit <b>6</b> the OTDC to the cardholder <b>40</b>. It will be appreciated that generation of the OTDC and any screening of the selection will be performed by the issuing bank's computer system. Transmission of the OTDC to the cardholder <b>40</b> may be via a variety of means. Transmission of the OTDC to the cardholder <b>40</b> may be done by email or text, telephone call, push notification, or any other communication pathway. The issuing bank <b>45</b> may encrypt <b>5</b> the message containing the OTDC and send the message to the cardholder <b>40</b> in a format that may require a security key from the cardholder <b>40</b> to open. The preferred embodiment will preferably use asymmetric encryption to secure the OTDC, though many commercially available encryption systems are available. Examples of security keys that may be used to authorize opening of the message include passwords and biometric keys such as a match from a fingerprint reader, facial recognition software, iris recognition software, voice recognition software or combinations of the foregoing.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Frequently, the transmission <b>6</b> of the OTDC to the cardholder <b>40</b> will be received 7 by the cardholder's personal portable computing device such as a tablet, netbook, or cellphone, which may be a smartphone (collectively, a &#x201c;mobile device&#x201d;) or by a mobile device otherwise associated with the cardholder <b>40</b>. In these uses, the mobile device's security may provide sufficient security. For example, if the cardholder's mobile device requires a password or a biometric key to open the mobile device, this may be sufficient to allow one using the mobile device to open or access the message containing the OTDC. Alternatively, the message containing the OTDC may require similar, independent security to open. Finally, the additional security is an option, not a requirement of the system. There is no requirement that any security be in place to open the message. If the issuing bank <b>45</b> and/or cardholder <b>40</b> so choose, the message containing the OTDC may be transmitted without additional security.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another embodiment, the cardholder <b>40</b> may use his or her mobile device as a digital version of the Payment Card <b>20</b>. In this embodiment, a downloadable mobile application designed to be compatible across mobile operating systems on mobile devices, such as iOS and Android operating systems and other like systems will be installed on the cardholder's mobile device. A connected network may provide data storage, computing functionality, application security, and similar functionality. The cardholder <b>40</b> will enter identification information to create an account. The cardholder's identification information may include, without being limited to these items, some or all of the following: the cardholder's name; the cardholder's social security number; the cardholder's date of birth; the cardholder's home or billing address, and the cardholder's driver's license or other state or federally issued identification number. The cardholder <b>40</b> may also enter a payment card number <b>30</b>, the expiration date <b>47</b> of the Payment Card <b>20</b>, and the CVV number <b>46</b> for the Payment Card <b>20</b>. In this embodiment, the payment card number <b>30</b> and other cardholder identifying information will be stored on the mobile device or in a remote, typically cloud-based, data storage location. Much of the information above may correspond to the information typically found in computer chips <b>90</b> embedded in Payment Cards <b>20</b> utilizing EMV protocol. At a minimum, the information in or associated with the mobile device will be information sufficient to identify cardholder <b>40</b> and the account number <b>30</b>, and information sufficient to identify the issuing bank <b>45</b>. This allows the cardholder <b>40</b> to make contactless purchases&#x2014;that is, a purchase from a merchant without presenting a physical Payment Card <b>20</b> to the merchant.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Some Payment Cards <b>20</b> include contactless chips <b>49</b>. These are chips embedded in the card, usually distinct from the security chip <b>90</b>, that contain the information discussed in the context of using the mobile device as the Payment Card <b>20</b>. Contactless chips <b>49</b> utilize radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. The merchant's card reader powers the contactless chip in the card which then emits a signal containing information sufficient to identify the cardholder <b>40</b> and the issuing bank <b>45</b>. This information is then transmitted to the issuing bank <b>45</b> along with the other transaction information.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">When contactless chips <b>49</b> and/or EMV chip <b>90</b> are present, physical payment cards <b>20</b> need not have the payment card number <b>30</b> printed on their face or, for card-present transactions, printed on them at all.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the cardholder's mobile device includes a downloadable mobile application disclosed herein, the communication to the cardholder <b>40</b> of the OTDC may be performed as an in-application communication. The security measures discussed above may, optionally, be utilized to control access to any in-application communications, including messages containing the OTDC. The cardholder <b>40</b> will provide <b>8</b> the appropriate security key to allow the message containing the OTDC to be opened.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">When the communication to the cardholder <b>40</b> of the OTDC is encrypted, the cardholder <b>40</b> will have a decryption key to allow the cardholder's mobile device to decrypt <b>10</b> the communication. The decryption key may be contained on the cardholder's mobile device and/or contained within the downloadable mobile application on the mobile device. Updated decryption key(s) may be provided by the issuing bank <b>45</b> from time-to-time, via the same communication methods used to transmit the OTDC.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, the issuing bank's computer system may generate <b>3</b> the OTDC upon receipt of information indicating that a transaction has been initiated and identifying the card holder <b>2</b>A. As used herein, a transaction is initiated when the cardholder <b>40</b> does anything to attempt to effect a purchase from a merchant and provides information via the merchant or the merchant's computer network sufficient to allow the issuing bank <b>45</b> to identify the cardholder <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Alternatively, the cardholder's mobile device could contact the issuing bank <b>45</b> directly, via the Internet or other telecommunication network, to alert the issuing bank <b>45</b> that an OTDC needs to be generated. This request <b>2</b>B may occur automatically when the cardholder <b>40</b> commences use of the mobile device as a Payment Card <b>20</b>, or the cardholder <b>40</b> may use the mobile device to contact the issuing bank <b>45</b> to request <b>2</b>B an OTDC prior to using the mobile device or a physical Payment Card <b>20</b> to make a purchase or prior to initiating a card-not-present transaction online or over the phone.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Regardless of what prompts the OTDC to be generated <b>3</b>, it is transmitted <b>6</b> to the cardholder <b>40</b> and added to the issuing bank's transaction approval criteria. If the OTDC is not provided to the issuing bank <b>45</b> by the merchant or the merchant's system, the transaction should not be approved.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the OTDC may have an expiration date or time. The OTDC may not work unless it is used within a set number of hours or minutes from when it is generated. When the OTDC is generated in the course of an initiated transaction, the merchant may be identified to the issuing bank <b>45</b>. In this embodiment, the OTDC may be limited to use in a transactions with the identified merchant.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the system may be configured to notify the cardholder <b>40</b> if an attempt was made to use the cardholder's Payment Card number <b>30</b> that did not meet the issuing bank's transaction approval criteria. This notification may include where the attempted transaction took place and what time the attempted transaction occurred. The system may provide the cardholder <b>40</b> with details as to why the transaction approval criteria were not satisfied, such as failure to input a correct OTDC. The disclosed system may automatically generate a communication, populate the communication with information about the failed transaction attempt, and send the communication to the cardholder <b>40</b>. In one embodiment, the disclosed system may send the communication to the cardholder <b>40</b> via email, text message, telephone call, push notification, or any other communication pathway, and the communication may be provided as an in-application communication.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, validation information may be provided to the cardholder <b>40</b>. This could include date, time, merchant location, and amount. This may be provided to the cardholder <b>40</b> with text, email, push notification, in-application communication or any other means of communication. The validation information may also be maintained in a registry by the issuing bank <b>45</b> in a format accessible to the cardholder <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In operation, a cardholder <b>40</b> will initiate <b>1</b> a purchase either in the physical presence of the merchant, online, or over the telephone. For a card-present or otherwise cardholder-present transaction, transmission <b>2</b>A to the issuing bank <b>45</b> of the payment card number <b>30</b> or other cardholder identifying information will prompt the issuing bank <b>45</b> to generate <b>3</b> an OTDC. The issuing bank <b>45</b> will transmit <b>6</b> the OTDC to the cardholder <b>40</b>, most typically by transmitting <b>6</b> the OTDC to the cardholder's mobile device. The mobile device may prompt the cardholder <b>40</b> to provide a security key, which if provided will allow the mobile device to decrypt, display, and/or otherwise release <b>10</b> the OTDC. The cardholder <b>40</b> will then enter or otherwise provide <b>11</b> the OTDC to the merchant. For in-store transactions or transactions where the merchant and cardholder <b>40</b> are both physically present, this may be done on a keypad as the PIN stage of the transaction or in addition to the PIN stage of the transaction. For online or telephonic transactions, this may be done as the CVV stage of the transaction or in addition to the CVV stage of the transaction. For touchless transactions, the mobile device may provide the OTDC directly to the merchant's terminal. The merchant will then transmit <b>12</b> the OTDC, and any other transaction information not already provided, to the issuing bank <b>45</b>. If the OTDC matches the number generated by the issuing bank <b>45</b>, and the issuing bank's other transaction authorization criteria are met, <b>13</b> the transaction will be authorized <b>14</b>A. However, if the OTDC provided to the merchant <b>4</b> does not match the OTDC generated by the issuing bank <b>45</b>, or if the bank's other authorization criteria are not met, the transaction should not be authorized <b>14</b>B.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The OTDC may be used in ATM transactions as well. For purposes of this application, the term merchant includes an ATM. Most ATM (automated teller machine) transaction utilize card and PIN security. In an embodiment of the invention, placing the Payment Card <b>20</b> into the ATM or, in any ATM's that utilize touchless technology, scanning the cardholder information into the ATM will cause a signal to be transmitted to the issuing bank <b>45</b>, triggering the generation of an OTDC which will then be transmitted to the cardholder's mobile device. The cardholder <b>40</b> will provide the OTDC to the ATM in lieu of or in addition to the PIN, at which point the ATM transaction will be allowed to proceed. If the OTDC is not provided to the ATM, the ATM transaction should not be authorized.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Although the issuing bank <b>45</b> (or its processors) are responsible for generating the OTDC in most of the embodiments disclosed herein, those of skill in the art will appreciate that an intermediary could be responsible for generating the OTDC. For example, the card network <b>80</b> could generate the OTDC and transmit it to both the cardholder <b>40</b> and the issuing bank <b>45</b>. From there, the process would be the same. The cardholder <b>40</b> would transmit the OTDC to the merchant who would then transmit the OTDC to the issuing bank <b>45</b>. The transaction would not be approved unless the OTDC provided to the issuing bank <b>45</b> by the merchant matched the OTDC generated by the intermediary. The identity of the intermediary is not important, except that the intermediary should not be the merchant, nor should the intermediary ever convey the OTDC to the merchant.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The advantages of the present security system are multi-fold. If the cardholder's payment card number <b>30</b> is compromised, it cannot be used to make a purchase without the OTDC. Acquiring the OTDC will not allow a third party to make a purchase without the payment card number <b>30</b> and other elements of the issuing bank's transaction approval criteria. Even acquiring the OTDC and the payment card number <b>30</b> will not allow a third party to make additional purchases on the Payment Card <b>20</b>. The OTDC is a single use code. It is generated for the transaction in question and good for that transaction only. Having the payment card number <b>30</b> and an old OTDC will not allow a third party to make a purchase. A third party must have both the payment card number <b>30</b> and the current OTDC to make a purchase using the Payment Card <b>20</b>. Obtaining one without the other is useless.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Although the preferred embodiments have been described herein, those skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains will appreciate that modifications, changes, and improvements may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention defined by the following claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>I claim:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
