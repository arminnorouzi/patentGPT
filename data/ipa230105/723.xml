Individual trays are configured to dispense a medication on a set regimen. When the base unit detects that it is time for a medication of a particular regimen to be dispensed, it will activate any tray that is configured for that regimen to dispense a single dosage of that medication. When activated, a tray will advance the compartments forward by one position, causing a single dosage of medication to fall through an opening in the bottom of the tray. The opening will allow the medication to fall through the device and into a receptacle. Once all medications for a particular regimen have been dispensed, a notification may be triggered informing the user that it is time to take their medication.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The example embodiments are best understood from the following detailed description when read with the accompanying drawing figures.
