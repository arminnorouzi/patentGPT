2021, which application is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a rear side entry type wheelchair.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wheelchair is a device for assisting movement of a user, and refers to a chair with wheels that allows a patient or a person having a difficulty in walking to move while being seated thereon. In a description of a boarding scheme of the wheelchair, generally, first, after a user is located on a front side of the wheelchair while standing, the user grips the wheelchair located on the rear side by stretching out the hand while moving rearwards by one or two steps, and is seated on a saddle provided in the wheelchair while the body of the user is supported by the arms.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the method in which, after people having a difficulty in walking move backwards and enter a front side of the wheelchair, they board the wheelchair, significantly increases inconvenience of the user, and the boarding process of arranging a seating location while the wheelchair is located on the backside is also unstable so that another accident may be caused. Furthermore, the wheelchair generally has a form of a chair provided with the saddle at a height of a knee joint of the user who stands upright so that the joints of the upper and lower bodies may be burdened when the user who has a difficulty in behavior is seated. Accordingly, help of an assistant is necessary for stable seating in the conventional wheelchair.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, because the wheelchair basically is a means for allowing a user to move while being seated, it may assist movement of the user, but it cannot be a treatment equipment for rehabilitation of the patient.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, a treatment device for rehabilitation of walking of the patient is a walker. The walker is a device equipped with wheels that may assist movements of patients or people who have a difficulty in walking, and has a similar aspect to the wheelchair, but unlike the wheelchair, is used while a user stands upright and the user directly walks by using the lower body. The walker helps rehabilitation through kinetic stimulation by assisting the standing posture of the user.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2020-508826 discloses an invention related to &#x2018;a wheelchair for assisting walking&#x2019; in which functions of a wheelchair and a walker are combined. However, according to Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2020-508826, because a user has to enter the wheelchair located on the rear side and be seated on a saddle located at a low height to board the wheelchair, there is still an aspect of the safety of the user, and in order for the user to be seated on the wheelchair after using the device for the purpose of a walker in a standing state and converting the function of the device to the wheelchair, the proceeding direction of the user may be changed for a stop, a rotation, or a rearward movement, which causes a problem in an aspect of convenience.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, a device that allows a rehabilitation treatment of a user who uses a wheelchair and also provides further improved safety and convenience is necessary.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the present disclosure can solve the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art while advantages achieved by the prior art are maintained intact.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An embodiment of the present disclosure provides a rear side entry type wheelchair that functions as a walker that helps rehabilitation while a user is standing and functions as a movement means while the user is seated, and, in particular, allows the user to be seated after adjusting a location and a height of a saddle after entering a rear side of the wheelchair to improve convenience and secure safety.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The technical problems to be solved by embodiments
