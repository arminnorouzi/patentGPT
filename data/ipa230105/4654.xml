which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The following disclosure is directed to methods and systems for cybersecurity risk mitigation and/or management, more specifically, methods and systems for accelerating an entity's protocols for monitoring and managing cybersecurity risks to determine and validate levels of assessment for affiliates having relationships with the entity.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Businesses, corporations, organizations, and other &#x2018;entities&#x2019; often outsource tasks to third parties. As a result, such entities have relationships with (e.g., are &#x2018;related to&#x2019; or &#x2018;connected to&#x2019;) numerous third party affiliates (i.e., vendors). These relationships can leave entities vulnerable to risks (e.g., threats) arising from the security practices of these third party affiliates. Accordingly, entities may wish to identify third party affiliates requiring additional risk assessment and customize levels of risk assessment based on the cyber security states of the identified third party affiliates.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Reliably monitoring dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of third party affiliates can consume a large amount of an entity's time and other resources. For entities with a large number of third party affiliates, assessing and monitoring each and every affiliate&#x2014;especially to the same level of detail&#x2014;can be prohibitively difficult, expensive, and/or time-consuming. Thus, an entity may wish to allocate risk assessment resources to affiliates based on their criticality to the entity and their associated cybersecurity risk. However, an entity may face difficulty in efficiently prioritizing affiliates for risk assessment (e.g., based on having a large quantity of third part affiliates), as well as in determining appropriate levels of assessment based on the criticality of affiliates to the entity. When an entity chooses an unsuitable risk management protocol for a given affiliate, resources may be wasted (e.g., if the risks associated with the affiliate are small but the risk management protocol selected by the entity for the affiliate uses significant resources) or significant risks may be ignored (e.g., if the risks associated with the affiliate are great but the risk management protocol selected by the entity for the affiliate uses insufficient resources). Further, when a risk management protocol is implemented, an entity may lack techniques to validate completed risk assessments, allowing affiliates to mischaracterize and inaccurately portray their associated cybersecurity states. Such deficiencies can negatively impact the efficacy an entity's risk management and mitigation protocols by allowing cybersecurity risks and threats to go unnoticed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there exists a current need for a cybersecurity risk management technique and supporting systems for (1) tiering (i.e., ranking) an entity's affiliates for risk assessment (2) determining a level (i.e., protocol) of risk assessment for each affiliate that optimizes the allocation of security assessment resources of an entity, and (3) validating responses corresponding to the risk assessment from the assessed affiliates. In some embodiments, an entity's affiliates may be tiered based on their criticality to the entity and/or their cyber security risk. Such tiering may be used in combination with one or more security characteristics (e.g., a security rating, security procedure, security control, etc.) to automatically determine a level of risk assessment to perform for a particular affiliate, where the risk assessment may include a plurality of questions as part of a questionnaire. In some embodiments, one or more risk vectors may be mapped to each of the responses corresponding to the questions of the questionnaire, such that the risk vector(s) indicate a state of each response to a question. An assessment report may be generated based on the responses to the questionnaire, where the assessment report may include an indication of flagged responses corresponding to security attributes and/or areas that require further review, improvement, and/or remediation. Responses may be automatically flagged based on a weighted combination of the risk vectors corresponding to each response, such that an entity may automatically identify cyber security risks corresponding to an affiliate and determine the validity of an affiliate's responses. In one aspect, the disclosure features a computer-implemented method including selecting, for an affiliate of a plurality of affiliates of an entity, a cybersecurity action plan, wherein the selection is based on a combination of a cybersecurity criticality tier, one or more risk vector ratings, and a security rating for the affiliate, wherein each risk vector rating is indicative of a state of a cybersecurity characteristic of the affiliate, wherein the cybersecurity criticality tier is selected from a set of cybersecurity criticality tiers. The method also includes sending, to the affiliate, one or more questions, wherein each question is indicative of a cybersecurity risk of the affiliate, wherein at least one question of the one or more questions is mapped to at least one risk vector and at least one risk vector rating of the one or more risk vector ratings. The method also includes receiving, from the affiliate, a response to each of the one or more questions. The method also includes, for each question mapped to at least one risk vector rating, determining a risk score based on a weighted combination of the at least one risk vector rating and at least one weight; determining, based on a comparison of the risk score to a threshold, an indication of whether the question is indicative of a cybersecurity risk; and if the risk score is less than or equal to the threshold, assigning a flag to the question to indicate the question is indicative of a cybersecurity risk. The method also includes displaying an assessment report configured to show an assessment of cybersecurity risk of the affiliate, wherein the assessment report comprises the one or more questions, the response to each of the one or more questions, the at least one risk vector rating for each question mapped to the at least one risk vector, and the flag for each question that is assigned the flag. Other aspects of the invention comprise systems implemented in various combinations of computing hardware and software to achieve the methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the risk vector may include at least one of an amount of capital investment; a measure of employee training; an amount of the entity's budget for security; a number of spam propagation instances originating from a computer network associated with the entity; a number of malware servers associated with the entity; a number of potentially exploited devices associated with the entity; and a number of hosts authorized to send emails on behalf of each domain associated with the entity. The risk vector rating may be a numerical rating. Each of the risk vectors may correspond to one of a plurality of risk vector types. The plurality of risk vector types may include data breaches, open ports, botnet infections, potentially exploited devise, file sharing, and other risk vector type. Each of the plurality of risk vector types may correspond to one of a plurality of weight, the plurality of weight being numerical. The risk score may be calculated by dividing a sum of a multiplication of each of the risk vector rating and a corresponding weight by a sum of a total weight. The cybersecurity criticality tier may be a level of criticality of a relationship between the entity and the affiliate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">These and other objects, along with advantages and features of embodiments of the present invention herein disclosed, will become more apparent through reference to the following description, the figures, and the claims.

An entity's portfolio may include any number of the entity's affiliates (e.g., one or more, dozens, hundreds, thousands, etc.).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">&#x201c;Characteristics&#x201d; of an entity (e.g., an affiliate or other entity) may include, without limitation, size (e.g., the number of employees or other members of the entity, the entity's market capitalization or annual revenues, etc.); the business sector (e.g., industry, sub-industry, etc.) in which the entity operates (e.g., legal services, technology, finance, etc.); age; rate of growth; North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code; Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code; a number of services provided by the entity; a security rating (e.g., as provided by BitSight Technologies, Inc. of Boston, Mass., USA); a geographical location of the entity; a location of the entity based on one or more IP addresses associated with the entity (e.g., &#x201c;geo IP&#x201d; footprint); a number of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses associated with the entity; the technology used by the entity (e.g., server software, user software, etc.); one or more security risk types of an entity; and/or known competitors or entities similar to the particular entity based on the web activity of the entity. Values for one or more of the above-listed entity characteristics may be provided by the entity itself, obtained from third party sources (e.g., a firmographics data source, data from BuiltWith&#xae; Pty Ltd), and/or collected or extracted from publicly available information. In some embodiments, the values for one or more entity characteristics can be stored in a database.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A &#x201c;security profile&#x201d; of an entity may reflect the past, present, and/or future security characteristics of an entity. In some embodiments, the security profile may reflect security risks to which the entity is exposed balanced by the countermeasures that the entity has taken or can take to mitigate the security risk. As referred to herein, a security profile of an entity can include a &#x201c;security rating&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;security score&#x201d;) for the entity. A security rating may be quantitative or qualitative. For example, a quantitative security rating may be expressed as a number within a predetermined range (e.g., between 250 and 900, as provided by BitSight Technologies, Inc. of Boston, Mass., USA). Some non-limiting examples of techniques for determining security ratings of entities are described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 16/802,232, 13/240,572, 15/142,677, and 16/514,771.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used herein, &#x201c;monitoring&#x201d; an affiliate may refer to determining (e.g., obtaining) a security rating of the affiliate from time to time, identifying one or more activities or events relevant to the affiliate's security profile, etc. Some non-limiting examples of techniques for determining security ratings of entities are described in U.S. patent application Ser.

Thus, it is often appropriate for an entity to adopt different risk management protocols for different affiliates, depending on characteristics of the entity, characteristics of the affiliates, the nature of the entity's relationship to the entity, and/or other factors. However, determining the most suitable risk management protocol for a given affiliate can be difficult and time-consuming, which can be exacerbated by an entity having relationships with a large number of affiliates. When an entity chooses an unsuitable risk management protocol for a given affiliate, resources may be wasted or significant risks may be ignored. Moreover, as characteristics change, the protocols may change, requiring ongoing reassessments of how a particular affiliate or group of affiliates may be monitored.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Thus, a tool for determining, executing, and validating the appropriate cybersecurity risk management protocols for an entity's various affiliates is needed. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an example of a risk management tool <b>100</b> is shown. In some embodiments, the risk management tool <b>100</b> may recommend risk management protocols for various affiliates based, for example, on characteristics of the affiliate, characteristics of the entity, the nature of the entity's relationships to the affiliates, risk management protocols adopted by other entities for the same affiliates or similar affiliates, and/or other factors. The risk management protocols may specify, for example, (1) which of an entity's affiliates are to be prioritized for cybersecurity risk assessment, (2) what action(s) are to be taken with respect to an affiliate that poses a potential cybersecurity risk, and/or (3) under what conditions those action(s) are to be taken. In some embodiments, the risk management tool <b>100</b> may be included with a cybersecurity monitoring system of a risk management service provider. Some non-limiting examples of cybersecurity monitoring systems are described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 16/802,232, 13/240,572, 15/142,677, and 16/514,771. In some embodiments, the risk management tool <b>100</b> may be communicatively coupled to a third party computing system. In some cases, the risk management tool may be coupled to more than one third party computing system.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Some embodiments of a risk management tool <b>100</b> are described below. In some embodiments, the risk management tool may include a tier recommendation module <b>110</b>, which may recommend assignment of an entity's affiliates (e.g., monitored affiliates, unmonitored affiliates, or monitored and unmonitored affiliates) to various &#x201c;criticality tiers.&#x201d; The criticality tier to which an affiliate is assigned may indicate a level of criticality of the entity's relationship to the affiliate. For example, the criticality tier to which an entity assigns an affiliate may indicate the extent to which the entity's well-being (e.g., operational integrity, health, reputation, financial position, security state, etc.) is sensitive to (e.g., dependent on) the affiliate's well-being. In some embodiments, the tier recommendation module <b>110</b> may determine the recommended criticality tiers for an entity's affiliates by performing a risk management method <b>200</b> as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the risk management tool <b>100</b> may include a risk vector rating module <b>120</b>. The risk vector rating module <b>120</b> may obtain one or more risk vector ratings and/or grades for an entity's affiliates. Risk vector ratings or grades may be determined for a risk vector based on a metric (e.g., a measurement, value, number, or amount) or an evaluation (e.g., a categorical or binary determination) associated with the risk vector. The risk vector ratings or grades may be determined based on mapping the metric to one or more thresholds or ranges that are indicative of a risk vector rating or grade. The risk vector ratings or grades may be determined based on mapping the evaluation to one or more categories or partitions that are indicative of a risk vector rating or grade. Examples for determining security ratings and risk vector ratings or grades for an entity are described further below in the section titled &#x201c;Security Ratings of Entities.&#x201d; A risk vector may be based on externally observable information for an entity that serves as a proxy (i.e. indicator) of a cyber security state of an entity (e.g., affiliate). This externally observable information can be categorized into observable subject areas (i.e. risk vectors), which can each be independently determined and/or characterized.

The machine-learned model may identify a particular recommended criticality tier for a particular affiliate based on (1) one or more characteristics of the particular affiliate and (2) an analysis of a plurality of tier assignments made by a plurality of peer entities included in the peer group, wherein each of the tier assignments is an assignment of an affiliate of at least one of the peer entities to a criticality tier. In some embodiments, the model's identification of a criticality tier for an affiliate may also be based on one or more characteristics of the entity (e.g., the size of the entity's portfolio of monitored affiliates). In some embodiments, the machine-learned model is a regression model (e.g., a linear regression model).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0067">In some embodiments, a process for identifying the recommended criticality tiers for a plurality affiliates includes steps of (1) generating, using the machine-learned model, respective criticality scores for the plurality of affiliates; (2) normalizing the criticality scores, thereby generating normalized criticality scores within a bounded range; (3) partitioning the normalized criticality scores into a number of partitions equal to the number of criticality tiers, wherein each of the partitions corresponds to a respective one of the criticality tiers; and (4) for each affiliate, selecting the criticality tier corresponding to the partition to which the normalized criticality score of the affiliate is assigned, and identifying the selected criticality tier as the recommended criticality tier for the affiliate.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0068">In step <b>204</b> of the method <b>200</b>, the risk management tool <b>100</b> receives user input adjusting and/or adopting the recommended criticality tier for each of the affiliates.

Accordingly, affiliates may be mapped to one or more action plans as a part of the risk management protocols based on the security ratings, risk vector ratings or grades, and the assigned criticality tiers of the affiliates. Such action plans may include monitoring the affiliates, investigating the affiliates, and/or contacting the affiliates, as well as terminating relationships with affiliates.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0077">In some embodiments, an action plan may require an entity (e.g., affiliate) to provide an entity attestation, where the entity may attest to one or more standard cybersecurity practices or frameworks. Examples of standard cyber security practices or frames may include those defined by the NIST, ISO, SOC, etc. In some embodiments, an action plan may include onboarding, where an entity may allow an affiliate to establish or maintain a relationship with the entity without further assessment at that instance. In some embodiments, an action plan may include an onsite audit, where an entity may directly engage with an affiliate (e.g., at an affiliate's office, data center, information technology center, etc.) and/or an affiliate's computing system(s) to review and evaluate the affiliate's security practices. In some embodiments, an action plan may include an Enable Vendor Access (EVA) outreach, where an entity may invite an affiliate to access the risk management tool <b>100</b> and/or a third party application to collaborate and/or address the affiliate's cybersecurity practices. In some embodiments, an action plan may include a refusal, where an entity may terminate or choose not to establish a relationship with an affiliate. An entity may refuse an affiliate based on a combination of risky security ratings, risky risk vector ratings or grades, and a high criticality tier. In an example, based on the risk assessment matrix, a first affiliate having a security rating of less than 500 and a moderate criticality tier (e.g., Tier 2) may be assigned an onsite audit as an action plan, while a second affiliate having a security rating of less than 500 and a high criticality tier (e.g., Tier 1) may be assigned a refusal as an action plan.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0078">In some embodiments, an action plan may include sending a questionnaire (e.g., full or partial questionnaire) to an affiliate, such that the affiliate may complete the questionnaire by responding to one or more included questions.

This externally observable information can be categorized into observable subject areas, or &#x201c;risk vectors&#x201d; as described herein, which can each be independently determined and/or characterized. For example, one possible proxy for entity vulnerability is the number of entity-owned IP addresses which are reported by third parties to be malicious. The greater the number of reports, the more likely the particular entity was vulnerable and had been compromised.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0096">In some embodiments, received data for an entity can include two or more subject areas (e.g., of those listed above in the section titled &#x201c;Some Embodiments of Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Method&#x201d;). In some cases, determining the security rating for an entity can include determining the relationship between the first subject area and the second subject area. This relationship can be stored in a database and accessed for use. For example, the number of botnet infections of an entity may be correlated with the number of potentially exploited devices associated with the entity. This correlation can be stored and referenced in the future. In some embodiments, the security characteristic of an entity is associated with, related to, or equal to the security rating of that entity (e.g., on a scale from 250 to 900, as provided by BitSight Technologies, Inc., Boston, Mass.).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0097">In some embodiments, to compute the security ratings for an entity, obtained data pertaining to the IT assets owned by that entity may be aggregated. For example, IT assets can include the IP addresses controlled by the entity and obtained data can include the activity associated with those IP addresses. To determine externally observable information about IP address-based assets, one or more IP addresses can be associated with an entity. The data may be processed to determine additional information. For example, processing may yield a list of IP addresses for an entity that has demonstrated suspicious or malicious behavior or fails to follow best security practices for the given reference data point. Similar methods can be used for other types of assets, e.g., domain-based assets, or other information for which an asset can be determined to be associated to an organization. Using these techniques, information about that asset can be associated with the entity.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0098">The exemplary security ratings systems and methods may be configured to account for differences in data sources and types. Given each data source's potentially unique insight of an entity, there can be two or more techniques used to take advantage of the respective data. Data source-specific modeling techniques may be applied to some or all of the data sources to demonstrate feasibility and validate the approach for each data source and modeling technique.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0099">In some embodiments, the combination of two or more vectors may produce a security rating that reflects the effectiveness of an entity's security efforts. The determination of individual vectors and the overall security rating can be influenced by security best-practices as promoted by standardized and accepted cybersecurity frameworks. In some embodiments, evidence of security compromise can be used to understand the specific impact the individual vectors have on the security rating of the entity. For instance, correlation between sources of externally observed information can be used to determine the impact of vectors. For example, the vectors representing evidence of compromised workstations (owned or controlled by an entity) may represent a significant portion of the entity's ability to implement security controls correctly, and thus may influence the entity's security rating more than other types of information.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0100">Computer-Based Implementations</p><p id="p-0089" num="0101">In some examples, some or all of the processing described above can be carried out on a personal computing device, on one or more centralized computing devices, or via cloud-based processing by one or more servers.
