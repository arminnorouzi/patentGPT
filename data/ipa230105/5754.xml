The glass die <b>14</b> may provide galvanic isolation (e.g., up to several kV) between the die pad <b>11</b> of the leadframe and the semiconductor die <b>13</b> (e.g., a sensor die).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For instance, galvanic isolation may be involved in current sensors where the exposed pads are used to drive a current in package to be sensed from Hall sensors in a sensor die. The current line, in this case, may be galvanically isolated.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The semiconductor die <b>13</b> may be provided with electrically conductive bonding pads <b>15</b> configured for electrical coupling to the leads <b>12</b> by means of bonding wires (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Such bonding pads <b>15</b> may be provided on a front (e.g., top) surface <b>13</b>A of the semiconductor die <b>13</b>, i.e., on the surface facing away from the die pad <b>11</b>. As conventional in the art, the bonding pads <b>15</b> may be provided at the periphery of said front surface <b>13</b>A.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Additionally, the semiconductor device <b>10</b> may comprise package molding material <b>16</b> (e.g., epoxy molding material) encapsulating the semiconductor die <b>13</b> and the leadframe. At least a portion of the leads <b>12</b> is exposed outside of the package molding material <b>16</b> (e.g., at a rear or bottom side thereof) to allow electrical coupling of the semiconductor device <b>10</b>, e.g., to a printed circuit board (PCB).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one or more embodiments, the semiconductor die <b>13</b> may comprise at least one element or region <b>17</b> which is sensitive to piezoelectric effect (e.g., at least one piezo-resistor and/or a Hall sensor). For instance, such element or region <b>17</b> may be located near or at the front surface <b>13</b>A.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Therefore, mechanical stresses (e.g., normal and/or shear stresses, mainly lateral but also out of plane) applied to the semiconductor device <b>10</b> (e.g., applied to the package <b>16</b>) may affect the device performance. For instance, in case the element or region <b>17</b> comprises a sensing device such as a Hall sensor, an applied mechanical stress may result in an unwanted drift of the device output.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Mechanical stresses applied to the package <b>16</b> are one major source of stresses which may influence the performance of the device (e.g., the drift of a sensor). The contact region(s) between the molding compound of the package <b>16</b> and the front surface <b>13</b>A, where piezo-sensitive components <b>17</b> may be located (e.g., implanted), may act as a transmission point of mechanical stress from the package to the sensitive region(s).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Where the molding compound is a relatively rigid and viscoelastic polymer, the influence on the performance of the device may turn out to be relevant especially under certain harsh conditions.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Therefore, in one or more embodiments, a semiconductor device <b>20</b> as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may comprise a layer of stress absorbing material <b>21</b> interposed between the semiconductor die <b>13</b> (in particular, the top surface <b>13</b>a) and the package molding material <b>16</b>. The stress absorbing material <b>21</b> may be a deformable material or a &#x201c;stress-relief&#x201d; material. Such a layer of stress absorbing material may act as a (mechanical) stress buffer layer.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one or more embodiments, such a layer of stress absorbing material <b>21</b> may be provided by resorting to a &#x201c;dam-and-fill&#x201d; approach, that is, by:</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">providing a &#x201c;dam-like&#x201d; containment structure <b>22</b> on the front surface <b>13</b>A of the semiconductor die <b>13</b> that delimits (peripherally surrounds) a cavity region, and</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">filling the cavity region with the stress absorbing material <b>21</b>, wherein a volume of the included stress absorbing material <b>21</b> is defined by the size and shape of the containment structure <b>22</b> and the front surface <b>13</b>A.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The containment structure <b>22</b> may comprise a set of peripheral &#x201c;walls&#x201d; configured to provide a closed perimeter for the cavity region suitable to be filled by the stress absorbing material <b>21</b>, which may be dispensed (e.g., poured) therein. The containment structure <b>22</b> and the front surface <b>13</b>A may thus define a sort of molding cavity for molding of the stress absorbing material <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The peripheral walls of the containment structure <b>22</b> may be approximately 100 &#x3bc;m high.

However, any closed shape may be used in alternative embodiments.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The containment structure <b>22</b> may be designed so to enclose the area <b>17</b> of the semiconductor device <b>13</b> which is sensitive to the piezoresistive effect (e.g., a piezo-resistor) within the closed perimeter. Thus, the stress absorbing material <b>21</b> will effectively cover over the area <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The containment structure <b>22</b> may be designed so to leave the bonding pads <b>15</b> on the front surface <b>13</b>A of the semiconductor die <b>13</b> outside of (i.e., external to) the closed perimeter, thereby allowing a conventional wire bonding manufacturing step, even after dispensing of the stress absorbing material <b>21</b> over the semiconductor die <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Such a &#x201c;dam-and-fill&#x201d; approach may solve the concern of having the stress absorbing material <b>21</b> possibly flowing on the wire bonding pads <b>15</b>, thereby resulting in some of the bonding wires being immersed in the stress absorbing material. In fact, this might result in some wires that are partially immersed in the stress absorbing material and partially encapsulated within a molding compound. During thermal cycling, this may result in relevant thermo-mechanical stresses due to mismatches of the coefficients of thermal expansion, possibly causing failures of the bonding wire(s).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one or more embodiments, a plurality of containment structures <b>22</b> filled with stress absorbing material <b>21</b> may be provided on a same semiconductor die <b>13</b>, e.g., in order to cover a plurality of distinct regions <b>17</b> sensitive to piezoresistive effect.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The containment structure <b>22</b> may comprise resin material, e.g., epoxy resin material. The mechanical characteristics of the resin material of the containment structure <b>22</b> may be similar to those of the package molding material <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The stress absorbing material <b>21</b> may comprise a silicone material and/or other types of soft gel materials.
