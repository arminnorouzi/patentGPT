There are two fundamental topologies to achieve bidirectional coherent transport; dual-fiber and single-fiber. The dual fiber configuration requiring two strands of fibers one for transmission and one for receiving signals at the same or different wavelengths&#x2014;has been a long-time established industrial standard.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The main motivation for considering bidirectional transmission over a single optical fiber instead of two unidirectional fibers is the reduction of the infrastructure (fibers, optical splitters and optical amplifiers) by a factor two and the potential cost reduction by an integrated transceiver design. Also, a single fiber configuration is less susceptible to connection errors because there are fewer connections or end points in the network. In addition, customer can also choose to use single fiber to decrease redundancy in the network.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, the mainstream single-fiber transmission technology is based on two different wavelengths traveling in opposite directions (BiDi transmission) which doubles the fiber capacity. The key to this technology is wavelength division multiplexing/de-multiplexing (BiDi WDM) couplers, also known as diplexers, which combine and separate data transmitted over a single fiber based on the wavelengths of the light. Generally, this WDM coupler in integrated into a standard interface photonic optical transceiver module. The WDM however is a sophisticated and thus expensive device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a bidirectional transmission system using a single optical fiber to send data in both directions Tx, Rx. Two BiDi WDM transceivers each are used to combine and separate wavelengths. If, for example, one of BiDi WDM transceivers has a receiving wavelength of 1550 nm and a transmit wavelength of 1310 nm, then it is necessary to use its matching module which has a receiving wavelength of 1310 nm and a transmit wavelength of 1550 nm. As a consequence, the capacity of the single fiber is twice the capacity of the two fiber system. But does it meet the necessary requirements imposed by a modem web-scale world? On-demand content, bandwidth-hungry mobile apps, high-definition video streaming, and new cloud-based IT applications are driving massive scale and unpredictable traffic patterns. Network capacities are increasing by 25 to 50 percent every year, and current systems just cannot keep up with this rapid scalability.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Coherent optics at least partially addresses the capacity problems network providers are facing. It takes the typical ones and zeroes in a digital signal&#x2014;the blinking on and off of the light in the fiber&#x2014;and uses sophisticated technology to modulate the amplitude and phase of that light and send the signal across each of two polarizations. This, in turn, imparts considerably more information onto the light propagating through a fiber optic cable. Thus the BiDi WDM coherent detection is associated with at least: 1. high order amplitude/phase modulation; 2. polarization multiplexing; 3. coherent detection using a local oscillator in the receiver; and 4. high speed analog-digital converters (ADCs) and sophisticated digital signal processing in the receiver.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There are very few practical implementations of coherent technologies on the market today. Mainly it can be explained by the complexity of these systems requiring an unusual mixture of optical, digital and radio modem experience, which is coupled with a very demanding optical transmitter and receiver circuit design.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A need therefore exists for a cost-effective bidirectional single-fiber coherent transmission system.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disclosed cost-effective Bi-Di single-fiber coherent transmission system increases the fiber capacity by providing two single frequency (SF) continuous wave (CW) lasers operating at respective, different wavelengths &#x3bb;<sub>1o </sub>and &#x3bb;<sub>2o </sub>each of the modules. Due to WDM technology, only signals at respective different wavelengths are simultaneously guided through a single fiber in opposite directions providing the interference-free transmission of these signals between two modules.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The modules of the disclosed bidirectional coherent system have the same configuration and include respective photonic Bi-Di WDM transceivers. The transceivers each are integrated in a silicon photonic chip, which is configured with optoelectronic devices on a photonically-enabled integrated circuit (PIC), and include signal transmitting and signal receiving branches. The transmitting branch is configured with one or multiple phase and polarization optical modulators, whereas the receiving branch has a photodiode (PD). In accordance with one feature of the disclosure, the lasers of each module generate respective reference signals at different wavelengths &#x3bb;<sub>1o </sub>and &#x3bb;<sub>2o </sub>both of which are coupled into the transmuting and receiving branches of respective transceivers.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The signal transmitting branches each are configured with one or more modulators receiving reference signals &#x3bb;<sub>1o </sub>and &#x3bb;<sub>2o </sub>and modulating them so as to output respective modulated signals &#x3bb;<sub>1o</sub>T and &#x3bb;<sub>2o</sub>T. In the disclosed schematic, the phase and polarization, are utilized to carry the data in opposite directions between the transceivers.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The Bi-Di transceivers are fitted with Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) couplers which, in general, combine and separate data transmitted over a single fiber based on the wavelengths of the light. In particular, the WDMs each receive modulated signals at respective wavelengths &#x3bb;<sub>1o</sub>T and &#x3bb;<sub>2o</sub>T and sort out one of them such that only modulated signals at respective different wavelengths &#x3bb;<sub>1o</sub>T and &#x3bb;<sub>2o</sub>T are transmitted in opposite directions through the single fiber linking the WDM couplers.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The transmitted modulated signals are received by respective WDMs of the transceivers which guide the received modulated signals to respective receiving branches. As known, a PD cannot directly detect the phase coding. To provide the decoding of the received data in the disclosed system each of the transmitted modulated signals interferes with both reference signals &#x3bb;<sub>1o </sub>and &#x3bb;<sub>2o </sub>which results in two beat frequencies.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with one of salient features of the disclosure, only the beating of reference and modulated signals having the same wavelength provide the phase information that will be converted from the optical domain to the electrical domain by a PD in each of the receiving branches. The beat frequency generated by the interference of reference and modulated signals at respective different wavelengths lies outside the responsivity range of the PD and is practically undetectable by the PD. As known, the responsivity of a PD beyond a 0-45 GHz frequency range drops sharply. Thus, when the reference signal at wavelength &#x3bb;<sub>2o </sub>in one of the transceivers interferes with modulated signal &#x3bb;<sub>1o</sub>T and reference signal &#x3bb;<sub>1o </sub>and modulated signal &#x3bb;<sub>2o</sub>T beat against each other in the other transceiver, the respective resulting beat frequencies each lie in a spectral range outside the detection bandwidth of the PD. As a result, the disclosed PDs each function as a spectral filter.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Other features of the disclosed system include a few structural additions to the above disclosed inventive concept. Thus, for instance, WDM couplers may be integrated in respective PICs or may be pigtailed. The same modification relates to each pair of laser diodes which are this may be pigtailed or fully integrated in the PIC. The modules each can include additional photonic devices well known to one of ordinary skill in the telecommunication art and typically integrated in the PIC.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The above and additional features of the disclosed structure will be discussed in detail below and illustrated by the following drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a simplified optical schematic of the known single fiber bidirectional communication system;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is the inventive schematic including two terminals or modules;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is the schematic of the disclosed structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrating a multi-terminal hub communication system.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates the results of optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR) vs. bit error rate (BER) observed in an experimental system configured in accordance with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the sensitivity test of the experimental system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SPECIFIC STRUCTURE</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Disclosed herein are architectures for a bidirectional coherent transmission system based on the use of photonic devices.

The SF diode lasers <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> each are pigtailed, i.e., the optical connection between the SF lasers and PIC <b>20</b> is realized by respective single mode (SM) fibers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> both coupled into a 50-50 coupler <b>36</b>. Alternatively, the SF lasers may be integrated in PIC <b>20</b>. Each module is configured to send/receive modulated signals at respective different wavelengths &#x3bb;<sub>1o </sub>and &#x3bb;<sub>2o </sub>and compound them to one optical fiber without interference by using WDM technology. In the latter, communications flow continuously in one direction at one wavelength and simultaneously in the other direction at the other wavelength.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The PICs <b>20</b> each have integrated high speed phase modulator <b>25</b> operative to modulate the phase of reference signals at respective wavelengths &#x3bb;<sub>1o </sub>and &#x3bb;<sub>2o </sub>and output respective modulated signals &#x3bb;<sub>1o</sub>T and &#x3bb;<sub>2o</sub>T which further propagate through a bidirectional WDM <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> wherein one of the modulated signals is filtered out. The remaining modulated signal high &#x3bb;<sub>1o</sub>T transmitted by modulator <b>25</b> of module <b>12</b> and nodulated signal high &#x3bb;<sub>2o</sub>T transmitted by other modulator <b>25</b> of module <b>14</b> are coupled into respective ends of a SM fiber <b>30</b> and guided in the opposite directions.

Similarly, PD <b>34</b> integrated in other module <b>12</b> detects the beat frequency between transported modulated signal at &#x3bb;<sub>2o</sub>T and reference signal at the same wavelength &#x3bb;<sub>2o</sub>, while the interference between the signals at different wavelengths produces a weak constant current amounting to insignificant background noise.
