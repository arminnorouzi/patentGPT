However, a detailed description more than necessary may be omitted. For example, a detailed description of an already well-known matter and a duplicate description for substantially the same configuration may be omitted to avoid unnecessary redundancy of the following description and to facilitate the understanding of those skilled in the art. The accompanying drawings and the following descriptions are provided for those skilled in the art to fully understand the present disclosure, and are not intended to limit the subject matter described in the scope of the claims.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For example, when a touch panel is covered with an anti-glare (AG) film (or a protective film), and when the heated AG film is attached to a display and cooled, a shear load is applied to an adhesive layer between the film and the display due to a difference in heat shrinkage, such that glue may be stretched, and unnaturalness in appearance may occur at an edge portion of the display.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Hereinafter, an example of a film wrapping display that can improve an aesthetic appearance of the edge portion and eliminate the unnaturalness in appearance will be described.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view illustrating a configuration example of a film wrapping display provided with a transparent plate to which a film according to a first embodiment is attached. A film wrapping display <b>11</b> includes a film <b>13</b>, a touch panel <b>15</b> which is a transparent plate, a display device <b>17</b>, a bezel <b>19</b>, and a housing <b>21</b>. The film wrapping display <b>11</b> is an assembly thereof.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the film wrapping display <b>11</b> in an assembled state cut in a direction perpendicular to the touch panel <b>15</b>. The touch panel <b>15</b> is disposed on a display surface side of the display device <b>17</b>. The touch panel <b>15</b> includes a cover glass <b>23</b> and a sensor glass <b>25</b>. The sensor glass <b>25</b> is a glass having a function of a sensor for detecting a touch operation performed by a user. An example of the touch panel <b>15</b> includes a glass panel provided with, for example, an electrostatic capacitance type sensor that detects, by coating a thin conductive substance on a surface of a glass and allowing a small amount of current to flow, a change in the current when the surface of the glass is touched and that identifies a touched position from an amount of the change. The cover glass <b>23</b> is a glass plate installed to protect the sensor glass <b>25</b> to improve durability of the touch panel <b>15</b> or to improve designability of an appearance. When the sensor glass <b>25</b> has sufficient durability, the cover glass <b>23</b> may not be used.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The display device <b>17</b> is a device that displays data (information) of an image or a video by emitting (radiating) light from a display area <b>27</b> installed in a direction in which the touch panel <b>15</b> is provided. Examples of the display device <b>17</b> include a liquid crystal panel, an organic EL panel, or a 7-segment LED, or the like. In addition to the liquid crystal panel, the display device <b>17</b> includes a substrate on which a circuit for controlling the touch panel <b>15</b> and the display device <b>17</b> is mounted, a wiring for connecting each module, or the like as components of the film wrapping display <b>11</b>. Since the descriptions thereof becomes complicated, the descriptions of the configurations such as the substrate, the wiring for connecting each module, or the like described above will be omitted.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the touch panel <b>15</b>, a surface on a side where the display area <b>27</b> exists becomes a touch surface <b>29</b>. A protective glass having the touch surface <b>29</b> is disposed on at least one surface of the touch panel <b>15</b>. In the first embodiment, the protective glass is the cover glass <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The display device <b>17</b> and the touch panel <b>15</b> may adhere to each other by filling a gap therebetween with resin.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the present example, the display device <b>17</b> is fixed to the housing <b>21</b> by using, for example, a screw <b>31</b>. A height of a side surface of the housing <b>21</b> is lower than that of an edge <b>33</b> of the film <b>13</b>. A cover <b>35</b> is installed on an outside of the housing <b>21</b>. The cover <b>35</b> is mounted on the housing <b>21</b> by screwing, fitting, gluing, or the like, and is disposed so that the edge <b>33</b> of the film <b>13</b> becomes invisible when the user looks at the appearance of the film wrapping display <b>11</b>. As a result, it is possible not only to prevent a boundary between a place where the film <b>13</b> is attached and a place where the film <b>13</b> is not attached from being visible so that the aesthetic appearance thereof is not spoiled, but also to prevent the film <b>13</b> from being peeled off from the edge <b>33</b>. Here, a height of an upper end of the cover <b>35</b> and a height of the touch surface <b>29</b> of the touch panel <b>15</b> are made almost the same as each other, and a flat appearance (flattening a front surface) in which an outer frame or the like are not viewed from a user is made, thereby improving the designability.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The film wrapping display <b>11</b> includes a bezel <b>19</b> having a support portion <b>37</b>. The bezel <b>19</b> is disposed around a periphery of the display device <b>17</b> and includes the support portion <b>37</b> that supports the touch panel <b>15</b> which is a transparent plate. The bezel <b>19</b> includes a square box-shaped bezel main body portion <b>39</b> having an opening on a side opposite to the touch panel <b>15</b>, and the support portion <b>37</b> is formed to protrude outward from the opening of the bezel main body portion <b>39</b>. The bezel <b>19</b> is located inside the housing <b>21</b>, and fixes the touch panel <b>15</b> by supporting the touch panel <b>15</b> from an opposite surface of the touch surface <b>29</b> with the support portion <b>37</b>. In the film wrapping display <b>11</b>, a periphery of the display area <b>27</b> in which the touch panel <b>15</b> is supported by the support portion <b>37</b> forms an edge portion <b>41</b>. The bezel <b>19</b> may be a portion molded to be integrated with the housing <b>21</b>. The bezel <b>19</b> is a separate component from the housing <b>21</b> and may be configured to be fixed to the housing <b>21</b> by screwing or fitting. In the first embodiment, the housing <b>21</b> is defined as a component, and the housing <b>21</b> is not an essential component. When the film wrapping display <b>11</b> is installed by directly attaching the bezel <b>19</b> to a wall surface, the housing <b>21</b> may not be required.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the first embodiment, the film <b>13</b> is attached to cover the touch surface <b>29</b> of the touch panel <b>15</b>. The film <b>13</b> is attached to the touch surface <b>29</b> of the touch panel <b>15</b> and is also continuously attached to an end surface of the cover glass <b>23</b>, and further is also attached to the support portion <b>37</b> of the bezel <b>19</b>. That is, the film <b>13</b> is continuously attached to the touch panel <b>15</b> and the bezel <b>19</b>. The edge <b>33</b> of the film <b>13</b> is located to cover an outermost periphery of the touch panel <b>15</b>, to sandwich the touch panel <b>15</b>, and to wrap around up to a space opposite to a side where the user viewing information is present.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the first embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the edge <b>33</b> of the film <b>13</b> is located to be closer to the inside than the end surface of the cover glass <b>23</b>. However, it is not necessarily required to attach the film <b>13</b> to that extent. When the film <b>13</b> is applied to a part of the support portion <b>37</b>, a certain effect is obtained.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As such, in the film wrapping display <b>11</b>, the film <b>13</b> is attached to the touch surface <b>29</b> of the touch panel <b>15</b>, and is also continuously attached to the end surface of the cover glass <b>23</b>. In the film wrapping display <b>11</b>, the film <b>13</b> is further continuously attached to the support portion <b>37</b>, such that glass pieces can be prevented from scattering in a direction approximately parallel to the touch surface <b>29</b> even when the cover glass <b>23</b> is broken by an impact applied to the touch panel <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the film <b>13</b> is attached so that the edge <b>33</b> of the film <b>13</b> is located to be closer to the inside than the end surface of the cover glass <b>23</b> as shown in the first embodiment, and when the touch panel <b>15</b> is deformed by the impact applied to touch panel <b>15</b>, the edge <b>33</b> of the film <b>13</b> can be prevented from being peeled off from the support portion <b>37</b>. The reason is that resistance when the film <b>13</b> is pulled toward the side where the user is present in a direction perpendicular to the touch panel <b>15</b> is increased (that is, an anchor effect is generated).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view illustrating an overall image of the touch panel <b>15</b> wrapped with the film <b>13</b>.

The decorative layer <b>43</b> does not necessarily have the same pattern or color on a side where the user viewing the information is present with the adhesive layer <b>45</b> sandwiched therebetween and a touch panel side which is an opposite side thereof. The reason is that a required function of the decorative layer <b>43</b> on the side where the user is present with the adhesive layer <b>45</b> sandwiched therebetween may change due to an opposite side thereof.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, when the decorative layer <b>43</b> at the edge portion <b>41</b> is provided on the side where the user is present with the adhesive layer <b>45</b> sandwiched therebetween (for example, the decorative layer <b>43</b> is provided between the film <b>13</b> and the adhesive layer <b>45</b>), brightness of the decorative layer <b>43</b> thereat is lower (closer to black) than that of the display area <b>27</b>, and when the decorative layer <b>43</b> thereat is provided on the side opposite to the side where the user is present with the adhesive layer <b>45</b> sandwiched therebetween (for example, a back surface of the touch panel <b>15</b>), the brightness thereof is high (the color gets closer to white).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The color of the decorative layer <b>43</b> has higher brightness, lower saturation, higher reflectance, or lower transparency than those of the display area <b>27</b>.

The brightness is an intensity of brightness (light). The saturation is a degree at which there is no whiteness (vividness). The reflectance is a ratio of an intensity of a reflected wave to an intensity of an incident wave. The transparency is a value representing transparency.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The brightness, the saturation, the reflectance, or the transparency of the decorative layer <b>43</b> may gradually change as a distance between the decorative layer <b>43</b> and the display area <b>27</b> increases.

The wrapping device <b>47</b> includes a chamber <b>49</b> having an airtight structure, an elevation table <b>51</b> provided in the chamber, and a heater <b>53</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The chamber <b>49</b> is provided with a frame-shaped film fixing portion <b>55</b> at a boundary that divides an internal space of the chamber <b>49</b> into an upper space and a lower space. The film fixing portion <b>55</b> fixes a whole periphery of the film <b>13</b>. An internal space of the chamber <b>49</b> is divided into an upper space <b>57</b> and a lower space <b>59</b> by the film <b>13</b> fixed to the film fixing portion <b>55</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">An upper air supply and exhaust pipe <b>61</b> is connected to the upper space <b>57</b> of the chamber <b>49</b>, and a lower air supply and exhaust pipe <b>63</b> is connected to the lower space <b>59</b>. The upper air supply and exhaust pipe <b>61</b> and the lower air supply and exhaust pipe <b>63</b> are integrated and connected to a vacuum pump which is not illustrated or can be opened to the atmosphere. The lower air supply and exhaust pipe <b>63</b> and the lower space <b>59</b> can be freely opened and closed by a closing valve <b>65</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The film <b>13</b> is fixed to the film fixing portion <b>55</b> in order to perform film wrapping by using the wrapping device <b>47</b>. A workpiece <b>67</b> is placed on the elevation table <b>51</b> and fixed thereto. Here, the workpiece <b>67</b> is assembled with, for example, the bezel <b>19</b> and the touch panel <b>15</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The workpiece <b>67</b> is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The vacuum pump is driven to reduce pressure in the upper space <b>57</b> and the lower space <b>59</b>. Here, the film <b>13</b> and the adhesive layer <b>45</b> are simultaneously heated and softened by using the heater <b>53</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">After the film <b>13</b> is softened to a predetermined hardness, the elevation table <b>51</b> is raised. The elevation table <b>51</b> is raised until the touch panel <b>15</b> of the placed workpiece <b>67</b> pushes up the film <b>13</b> up to a predetermined height. The height is set to at least a height in which a back surface of the bezel <b>19</b> is located above the film fixing portion <b>55</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The closing valve <b>65</b> is closed while the heater <b>53</b> generates heat, and the lower space <b>59</b> is sealed in an almost vacuum state. An operation of the vacuum pump is stopped, and the upper air supply and exhaust pipe <b>61</b> and the lower air supply and exhaust pipe <b>63</b> are opened to the atmosphere. Here, while the upper space <b>57</b> is returned to an atmospheric pressure, the lower space <b>59</b> where the closing valve <b>65</b> is closed remains in the almost vacuum state. The film <b>13</b>, which partitions the upper space <b>57</b> and the lower space <b>59</b> and is in a softened state, is drawn to a lower space side due to a difference in an air pressure and is deformed. As a result, the film <b>13</b> adheres to an outer peripheral surface of the workpiece <b>67</b> to wrap around the workpiece <b>67</b> from the touch panel <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to the wrapping of the film wrapping display <b>11</b> by the TOM molding, the edge <b>33</b> of the film <b>13</b> is also wrapped around a side surface of the bezel <b>19</b> and a back surface of the support portion <b>37</b> opposite to the touch panel <b>15</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), such that the film <b>13</b> can be more reliably attached to the work <b>67</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As described above, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in the touch panel <b>15</b> whose touch surface <b>29</b> is covered with the film <b>13</b>, a corner portion <b>71</b> at which adjacent end surfaces <b>69</b> intersect each other is covered with the continuous film <b>13</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the support portion <b>37</b> of the bezel <b>19</b> is omitted. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in the bezel <b>19</b>, in addition to a side surface of the support portion <b>37</b>, an edge of the back surface is further covered by the edge <b>33</b> of the continuous film <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As described above, the attaching method such as the TOM molding or the like can satisfactorily cover the corner portion <b>71</b> at which the adjacent end surfaces <b>69</b> intersect each other in the touch panel <b>15</b> with the continuous film <b>13</b>. For example, the touch panel <b>15</b>, which is formed in a shape of a quadrangular plate, has four corners provided on the touch surface <b>29</b> which is one surface. Four corners are also provided on the other surface which is a surface opposite to the one surface. Side surfaces of the touch panel <b>15</b> in a plate thickness direction, which are sandwiched between the touch surface <b>29</b> and the other surface, become four end surfaces <b>69</b>. The adjacent end surfaces <b>69</b> of the four end surfaces <b>69</b> respectively intersect each other at the corner portion <b>71</b>. The corner portion <b>71</b> forms a linear edge connected to a corner of the touch surface <b>29</b> and a corner of the other surface. That is, the corner portion <b>71</b> forms a sharp corner. Both ends of the corner portion <b>71</b> are connected to sharp corners that become triangular-pyramid-shaped apex angles on front and back surfaces of the touch panel.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Strictly speaking, the corner portion <b>71</b> may not be linear. That is, the corner portion <b>71</b> may be chamfered by cutting a sharp corner away. Then, microscopically, the corner portion <b>71</b> becomes a surface.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the attaching method such as the TOM molding or the like, in the plate-shaped touch panel <b>15</b>, one continuous film <b>13</b> can be covered to adhere to the adjacent two end surfaces <b>69</b> without any gap from the one surface, to simultaneously adhere to the sharp corners having the triangular pyramid shape, and thus to wrap around the touch panel <b>15</b>. The one continuous film <b>13</b> has a shape cut in from an outer shape to an inner side or has a shape without a concave portion. According to the adhering method such as the TOM molding or the like, the cross-shaped film <b>13</b> having a development view of the surface of the touch panel <b>15</b> and the four side surfaces of the touch panel <b>15</b> is generated, and when respective side portions of the cross-shaped film are bent parallel to the four side surfaces of the touch panel <b>15</b> to cover the four side surfaces thereof, an overlapped portion is not formed along the corner portion <b>71</b>. That is, the corner and the corner portion <b>71</b> can be continuously wrapped around without providing a gap.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the touch panel <b>15</b> on which the film <b>13</b> is covered by the attaching method such as the TOM molding or the like, the overlapped portion is not formed at the corner portion <b>71</b>, such that broken pieces and powder are difficult to jump out during breakage of glass. Since the corner portion <b>71</b>, which is most likely to become a sharp edge during the breakage of the glass, can be continuously covered by the continuous film <b>13</b>, the sharp edge is difficult to be formed.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">A part of the other surface (an edge of the back surface) in addition to the corner portion <b>71</b> is also covered by the continuous film <b>13</b>, whereby an anchor effect is generated. As a result, the film <b>13</b> is difficult to come off outward in a direction perpendicular to the touch surface <b>29</b>. The film <b>13</b> extends to the other surface, such that a peeling point when the film <b>13</b> is peeled off can be further moved toward an inner side direction from an outer shape of the touch surface <b>29</b>, which is difficult to be visually recognized by the user.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As a result, in order to improve the designability, in the film wrapping display <b>11</b> that expose the corners and the corner portions <b>71</b> of the touch panel <b>15</b> to the front surface, it is possible to more effectively prevent broken pieces of the broken touch surface <b>29</b> from scattering, or prevent a component from falling, or prevent a sharp edge of the glass from adhering to the user.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Comparative Example</heading><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a display <b>73</b> according to a comparative example in which the side surface of the housing <b>21</b> forms the bezel <b>19</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a display <b>75</b> according to a comparative example of a design having a flat front surface.

The formation of the fine bubble causes the appearance damage. The void <b>77</b> existing in the transparent adhesive layer <b>45</b> diverges and converges luminous flux at a boundary surface with the adhesive layer <b>45</b>, and particularly, when brightness of a printing portion <b>79</b> or the like in the support portion <b>37</b> of the bezel <b>19</b> is low (for example, when the color is close to black), presence of the void <b>77</b> is emphasized and easy to be seen.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the film wrapping display <b>11</b> according to the first embodiment, the decorative layer <b>43</b> is provided on the edge portion <b>41</b> with respect to the display <b>75</b> according to the comparative example described above, such that the adhesive layer <b>45</b> is difficult to be seen.
