By forming the plurality of grooves <b>139</b> along the outer periphery of the guide protrusion <b>137</b>, the connection member <b>150</b> can be sequentially moved along the grooves <b>139</b>, and thus it is possible to alleviate the shock received when the connection member <b>150</b> is seated in the latching groove <b>170</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to the present disclosure, the mount bracket <b>100</b> provides effects to prevent damage to the communication device when the communication device <b>30</b> is separated/detached/fallen from the mount bracket <b>100</b>, then collides with the ground in the process of installing the communication device <b>30</b> on the structure <b>10</b> such as a wall or a ceiling.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As described above, a preferred embodiment of the mount bracket according to the present disclosure has been described.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is to be understood that the above-described embodiments are illustrative and non-restrictive in all aspects and that the scope of the present disclosure is indicated by the appended claims rather than the foregoing description.
