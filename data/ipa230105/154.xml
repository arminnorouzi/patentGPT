As referred to herein, a non-combustible aerosol provision system comprises a non-combustible aerosol provision device in combination with one or more articles <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032;, <b>10</b>&#x2033; for use with the non-combustible aerosol provision device.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0100">The article <b>10</b> comprises a chamber <b>4</b>, which comprises an inlet aperture <b>3</b> and an outlet aperture <b>9</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). An air flow path is defined between the inlet aperture <b>3</b> and outlet aperture <b>9</b>. The article <b>10</b> may comprise multiple inlet apertures <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0101">In the present example, article <b>10</b> comprises 3 inlet apertures, formed in an end face <b>41</b> of the chamber. Outlet aperture <b>9</b> is formed on an opposing end face of the chamber <b>44</b> (outlet aperture <b>9</b> and end face <b>44</b> not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In alternative embodiments the article can comprise a different number of inlet apertures, for example 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 inlet apertures. In certain embodiments, in addition to inlet apertures <b>3</b> on end face <b>41</b>, inlet apertures may also be provided on an adjacent face, such as adjacent face <b>42</b> and/or adjacent face <b>43</b>, to introduce additional external air to the flow path. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is hypothesized that providing additional inlet apertures on a face perpendicular to the air flow path can result in increased turbulence in the air flow through the article. Such increased turbulence can result in greater mixing of aerosol in the article, and result in an improved sensory experience when the aerosol is inhaled by the user.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0102">In the present embodiment, inlet apertures <b>3</b> are of fixed size. However, in alternative embodiments the size of one or more inlet apertures may varied by a movable or otherwise adjustable element, provided to selectively close off one or more inlet apertures. In certain embodiments, the cross sectional area of the inlet and/or outlet aperture or apertures is less than the cross sectional area, measured perpendicular to the direction of flow, of the air flow path through the body. Providing an inlet and/or outlet aperture with a cross-sectional area that is less than that of the air flow path through the body provides a barrier to diffusion in and out of the body, and thereby restricts the mixing of the aerosol and ambient air. This arrangement can allow for improved control of the aerosol concentration delivered to the user.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0103">The chamber <b>4</b> may have any suitable inner dimensions. For example, in various embodiments the chamber <b>4</b> may have a length (in the dimension along A-A&#x2032;) of between 40-120 mm, or between 50-90 mm, or between 60-80 mm. In the present example the chamber has a length of 75 mm. The chamber may have any suitable width (in the dimension along B-B&#x2032;), such as 10-50 mm, or 15-25 mm. In the present example chamber <b>4</b> has a width of 20 mm. The chamber may also have any suitable height, for example in various embodiments in the range 2-10 mm, or 3-6 mm, or 3-5 mm.

In alternative embodiments, the aerosolizable material may be provided in other forms, as described herein. In the present case amorphous solid material <b>7</b> is laminated on a carrier material <b>8</b>, which in the present case is a sheet of aluminum foil.

In alternative embodiments, the lower face <b>4</b>&#x2033; of the chamber may itself comprise the carrier material, and amorphous solid material <b>7</b> may be provided directly on the inner surface of the face <b>4</b>&#x2033;. In the present example the layer of amorphous solid material <b>7</b> has a width of 7.4 mm, and a length of 65 mm, however in alternative embodiments the layer of amorphous solid sheet material may have any suitable dimensions for the size of the chamber <b>4</b> in which it is provided.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0107">A sheet of corrugated material is mounted on an upper face <b>4</b>&#x2032; of the chamber <b>4</b>, so as to form an arrangement of ridges <b>5</b><i>a </i>and grooves <b>5</b><i>b</i>. Ridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>and groove <b>5</b><i>b </i>together comprise corrugation <b>5</b>. In the present case, the corrugations <b>5</b> are arranged such that the ridges <b>5</b><i>a </i>are uniformly spaced, and extend across the article, perpendicular to the direction of air flow. In alternative embodiments, the ridges and grooves may be configured to extend in other directions, such as parallel, or diagonal to the direction of air flow, and/or may be configured to have non-uniform spacing in any direction. Examples of such embodiments are set out in more detail herein. The term &#x2018;arrangement of ridges and grooves&#x2019; as used herein refers to an arrangement comprising at least two ridges.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0108">In the present case, the ridges <b>5</b><i>a </i>and grooves <b>5</b><i>b </i>are formed on a sheet of corrugated cardboard material which is mounted on the upper face <b>4</b>&#x2032; of the chamber, such that upper face <b>4</b>&#x2032; acts as a support for the corrugations. In this embodiment, the support is substantially planar, such that the ridges and the grooves each lie in substantially the same plane. In alternative embodiments, the ridges and corresponding grooves may be formed in other ways, such as by depositing material on the upper face <b>4</b>&#x2032;, or by embossing. Alternatively, the sheet of corrugated material on which the ridges <b>5</b><i>a </i>and grooves <b>5</b><i>b </i>are formed may comprise a different material, such as paper, foil or plastic. In embodiments where the corrugations are formed on a metal material, such as aluminum foil, the corrugations may be heated by induction, when the article is used with a suitable device. This can be advantageous in reducing condensation of the aerosol on the surface of the corrugations.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0109">Forming ridges and grooves on the upper surface <b>4</b>&#x2032; of the chamber reduces the volume of the chamber above the aerosolizable material. The inventors have found that reducing the chamber volume above the aerosolizable material results in improved aerosol delivery from the article, in use. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is hypothesized that this results in increased velocity of the airflow through the chamber, and a reduction in the cooling and condensation of the aerosol within the article.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0110">Where the ridges <b>5</b><i>a </i>and grooves <b>5</b><i>b </i>are formed as corrugations <b>5</b> on a sheet of corrugated material, ridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>and groove <b>5</b><i>b </i>may together also be referred to as a &#x2018;flute&#x2019;. A sheet of corrugated material comprises a number of flutes, and the material may be defined in terms of the &#x2018;flute height and &#x2018;flute frequency&#x2019;. Flute height is defined as the distance from the lowest point of a groove to the highest point of a corresponding ridge. The flute height is selected to provide a desirable separation between the ridges and the aerosolizable material, for example to reduce the height between the aerosolizable material and the ridges to less than 3 mm, or less than 2 mm, or less than 1.5 mm, for example 1 mm. In the present example, the flute height is between 2.5 mm and 3 mm, and the chamber height is 4 mm. The separation of the ridges formed by the flutes of the corrugations and the amorphous solid material <b>7</b> is therefore about 1 mm to 1.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0111">In alternative embodiments the flute height may be between 4.5 and 5 mm, or between 3.5 and 4 mm, or between 1.1 and 1.5 mm, or may be 0.75 mm, or 0.5 mm. The flute height may be an average value within the given ranges, or may be given as a target height with a manufacturing tolerance determining the range of flute heights on a sheet of corrugated material.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0112">Flute frequency is a measure of the width of corrugations, and is defined as the number of flutes per meter (flutes/m). In the present example, the flute frequency is 154 flutes/m. However, in alternative examples the flute frequency can vary between 100 flutes/m and 600 flutes/m, or between 100 and 200 flutes/m, or between 200 and 200 flutes/m, or between 200 and 400 flutes per m, or between 100 and 180 flutes/m. The ranges for flute height and frequency defined herein are equally suitable for the height and spacing of an arrangement of ridges and grooves formed in any of the other ways described herein.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0113">In the present example, corrugations <b>5</b> do not extend to the end faces of the chamber <b>41</b>, <b>44</b>, such that an area <b>14</b> which is free of corrugations is provided at each end of the chamber, adjacent to the inlet apertures <b>3</b> and the outlet aperture <b>9</b>. The provision of an area free from corrugations at the inlet and outlet ends of the chamber results in a larger volume for aerosol mixing in these areas, which can result in the delivery of a more consistent aerosol, in use. The area <b>14</b> may have any suitable length, for example at least 1 mm, at least 2 mm, at least 3 mm, at least 4 mm or at least 5 mm. In the present example, the area <b>14</b> free of corrugations is 5 mm in length, and extends from both end faces <b>41</b>, <b>44</b> of the chamber.
