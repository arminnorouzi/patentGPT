The links are configured as latency sensitive links having parameters designed to meet the requests or requirements of latency sensitive applications. An access point (AP) device can configure a subset of links having latency sensitive link capabilities and can advertise the latency sensitive link capabilities to a plurality of station devices (STAs). The access point can grant admission to one or more of the latency sensitive links based in part on the capabilities of the requesting station device or client device and/or properties of network traffic associated with the station device or client device. The access point can use the latency sensitive link capabilities, link admission and link steering techniques to provide and maintain a desired or targeted quality of service for latency sensitive applications.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Some applications (e.g., AR/VR applications) can be more sensitive to latency issues when transmitting and receiving communications or data. The latency sensitive applications can include one or more downlink (DL) and/or one or more uplink (UL) streams having (pre)determined parameters. The amount of traffic for the latency sensitive applications can vary from interval to interval. The streams may include communications that are bursty or periodic. The latency sensitive applications can have increased bandwidth requirements. However, present communication protocols (e.g., WLAN protocols that are based on best effort support schemes) may not support the needs of latency sensitive traffic, for example, resulting in degraded/reduced user experience for an end user of the particular application.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The techniques described herein can provide differentiated quality of service over different links (e.g., wireless links) to meet the unique needs of latency sensitive applications. In some embodiments, including multi-link operations (e.g., 802.11 multi-link operation), an access point device (e.g., AP MLD) can offer differentiated quality of service over different wireless links. The access point device can configure a subset of links to provide the minimal/desired quality of service to meet the requirements of latency sensitive applications. The subset of links can be referred to as latency sensitive links (LSL) and the service provided through the latency sensitive links can be referred to as latency sensitive service (LSS). The latency sensitive links can be configured to have modified capability advertisement, link admission, link steering and/or channel access parameters to provide a latency sensitive application a requested or desired quality of service.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The access point device can configure the links having the latency sensitive capabilities (e.g., parameters) and can advertise the link capabilities to one or more station devices (e.g., non-AP devices). The link capabilities can be advertised in a beacon frame, probe response frame and/or any other form of management frames containing capability information. The advertisement can include a per link indication (e.g., LSL enable) to indicate that a specific link is a latency sensitive link. The station devices can use the link capability information to choose or request a network and one or links to conduct communication and enable a desired or target performance.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A client device can also indicate its capability of supporting latency sensitive link operations in a probe request, association request and any other form of management frames containing capability information (e.g., capability fields). The station device and/or client device can support latency sensitive link operations by providing, supporting or configuring a set of features or mechanisms that an access point device uses to provide latency sensitive service/support, including but not limited to, link admission, link steering, and an enhanced channel access mechanism.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The access point device can determine or select link admission for one or more station devices based in part on whether the respective station device supports latency sensitive links or parameters associated with latency sensitive links. During an association or admission period, the access point device can make a determination on whether a station device supports latency sensitive links based in part on a (reported) capability of the respective station device and network load information associated with the station device.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The access point device can use the capability field associated with the station device to determine if the station device supports latency sensitive links. If the station device does not support latency sensitive links as indicated in its capability field, the access point device can prevent or disable a link (e.g., prevent establishment of, or access to the link) between the access point device to the station device. The access point device can monitor network load information over a plurality of links associated with or used by the station device that supports latency service links and can make the determination on whether to accept the station device to operate on a latency sensitive link based in part on the properties of the network load information associated with the station device. In some embodiments, the access point device can accept or deny a station device if an amount of network traffic associated with the station device is above a traffic threshold, for example, to avoid congestion on the latency sensitive links and provide the targeted quality of service. If a station device is denied access to a latency sensitive link, the access point can provide access to a regular link or non-latency sensitive link to maintain connectivity and deliver data transfer over the other links.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The access point device can steer or transfer communications or traffic (e.g., link steering) associated with one or more station devices to particular links to maintain a desired or targeted quality of service for one or more latency sensitive links. After a connection is established between the access point device and a station device, the access point device continuously monitors the traffic load over the network and the plurality of links associated with the access point device. The access point device can invoke or perform link steering techniques to provide and maintain the advertised quality of service for the plurality of links.
