method of manufacturing the same, and a non-rigid pad group for device transfer including the same and, more particularly, to a non-rigid pad for device transfer, which allows uniform contact pressure to be applied between multiple devices and a target substrate to which the devices are to be transferred, a method of manufacturing the same, and a non-rigid pad group for device transfer including the same.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Production equipment used in semiconductor processes, flexible electronics processes, display processes, MEMS processes, LED processes, solar cell processes, and the like requires an apparatus for transferring thin film devices.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For typical thick devices, a transfer process including picking and placing is performed using vacuum chuck technology. However, when applied to thin devices, the vacuum chuck technology has a problem in that the devices can be damaged due to pressure generated by a vacuum chuck. As a result, the vacuum chuck technology is generally not applicable to thin film devices having a thickness of 5 &#x3bc;m or less. In addition, there is a method of transferring devices using an electrostatic chuck. However, when applied to thin devices, this method has a problem in that the devices can be damaged due to static electricity.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For the above reasons, there has been proposed technology for attaching or transferring thin film devices having a very small thickness using van der Waals force acting on a nanoscale. Such thin film devices can be transferred using a transfer apparatus capable of controlling van der Waals force. However, when such a transfer apparatus has a very hard surface, the transfer apparatus cannot be brought into good contact with the thin film devices due to a slight thickness difference between the devices, a curvature of a substrate, and the like, making it impossible to achieve attachment and transfer of the thin film devices. Therefore, a transfer apparatus manufactured using a material having a very low elastic modulus, for example, a polymer or a rubber, is used to transfer such thin film devices. One example of such a transfer apparatus is a flexible stamp.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, transfer apparatuses may be classified into a roll type and a plate type.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the roll-type transfer apparatus, a roller is disposed on a target substrate. Here, the roller is provided on an outer circumferential surface thereof with an adhesive layer to which micro-devices to be transferred to the target substrate are adhesively attached.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the plate-type transfer apparatus, a pressure plate is disposed on a target substrate. Here, the pressure plate is provided on a lower surface thereof with an adhesive layer to which micro-devices to be transferred to the target substrate are adhesively attached.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the roll-type transfer apparatus or the plate-type transfer apparatus, it is important to allow uniform contact pressure to be applied between multiple micro-devices and the adhesive layer so as to ensure that the multiple micro-devices are picked from a source substrate to be attached to the adhesive layer or that the multiple micro-devices attached to the adhesive layer are placed on the target substrate.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, it can be difficult to provide uniform contact pressure between the micro-devices and the adhesive layer due to tolerances for the transfer apparatus, such as machining errors of the roller or the pressure plate and assembly tolerance, height non-uniformity of the micro-devices, warpage of the substrate, and the like.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating problems of a conventional roll-type transfer process.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, when terminals of devices <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> are temporarily bonded to respective electrodes <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> on a warped target substrate <b>10</b>, a transfer film <b>30</b> is also warped due to warpage of the target substrate <b>10</b>.

The pillar <b>120</b> may be bent and deformed upon application of external force, wherein external force may be applied to the other end <b>122</b> of the pillar <b>120</b>. Here, bending deformation of the pillar <b>120</b> may include buckling.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0072">The base plate <b>110</b> and the pillar <b>120</b> may be formed of at least one selected from among silicone rubber, urethane rubber, fluororubber, ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM), nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and an epoxy-based negative photoresist.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0073">In one embodiment, the non-rigid pad for device transfer may be directly manufactured through a photolithography process using a UV light source, a <b>3</b>D printing process, or a LIGA process using X-rays. Here, as a material for the non-rigid pad, at least one selected from among silicone rubber, PMMA, and an epoxy-based negative photoresist may be used.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0074">In another embodiment, the non-rigid pad for device transfer may be manufactured by a method including: fabricating a mold corresponding in shape to the non-rigid pad through a <b>3</b>D printing process or a LIGA process; and forming the non-rigid pad by injecting a molding liquid into the mold, followed by curing.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0075">The molding liquid may include at least one selected from among silicone rubber, urethane rubber, fluororubber, EPDM, and NBR. The molding liquid may be subjected to room temperature vulcanization or high temperature vulcanization.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, even when the pillar <b>120</b> is bent and deformed by a first displacement d<b>1</b> and then is further bent and deformed to a second displacement d<b>2</b> greater than the first displacement d<b>1</b>, the non-rigid pad <b>100</b> according to the present invention can generate a constant load F over a displacement range from the first displacement d<b>1</b> to the second displacement d<b>2</b>.

This means that, when a pressing unit provides an appropriate magnitude of force such that the non-rigid pad <b>100</b> is deformed within the specific displacement range, uniform contact pressure can be applied between multiple devices and a target substrate.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0078">Accordingly, even when uniform pressing force cannot be applied to a transfer film due to machining errors of a component applying pressing force to the transfer film, such as a pressing unit, thickness errors of the transfer film, assembly errors between various components including the pressing unit, or load control errors occurring in the process of controlling pressing force applied to devices, uniform contact pressure can be applied between the devices and the target substrate by providing an appropriate magnitude of pressing force such that the non-rigid pad <b>100</b> is deformed within the specific displacement range. The pressing unit <b>40</b> may include a roller or a planar stamp.
