Advertisements targeted to particular intended audiences are made possible when the MSO gains access to personal identifiable information (PII) about their subscribers, made available within set top boxes or via the Internet. PII may include the location of a set top box including its hardware MAC address, marketing information, such as which programs and commercials have been viewed, and direct subscriber personal information such as a subscriber's name, home address, subscription or order history, and credit score.

The ad inventory event may indicate a position or break in the content item or asset where additional content such as an advertisement may be provided as part of the consumption of the content item. The advertisement inventory event may be filled with an advertisement or other content from one or more sources. The content item may be or comprise audio, video, text or other information. The advertisement may be intended for general audiences, targeted audiences, or both. A targeted advertisement may be based on personal identifiable information (PII) about users/subscribers which may comprise location of a device including its hardware MAC address, marketing information, such as which programs and commercials have been viewed, and direct user/subscriber personal information such as a name, home address, subscription or order history, and credit score.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">However, the MSO, or another entity filling ad opportunities, may not want to expose PII outside a closed or trusted system operated by the MSO due to at least user privacy or other concerns. For example, the PII may facilitate unwanted tracking of viewing behavior of particular users/clients by entities outside the system operated by the MSO. For example, if a national network obtains information about subscribers in the New York metropolitan area, then the national network may begin selling ads for a premium to companies that are only in the New York metropolitan area, which a local advertiser may not be able to afford. However, an entity may satisfy different parties, both legally and commercially, by purging certain PII that identifies an individual subscriber or other local or regional market information, and may still provide certain statistical demographic information, e.g., the number of people who are male or have a certain income level.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Additionally or alternatively, in managing the delivery of the content item, a network system may leverage a user identifier that maps to a household, user, or segment of audience consuming the content item. The system and methods of the present disclosure may generate and/or maintain a mapping of a persistent user identifier and a perishable second identifier (e.g., session identifier). The second or secondary identifier may persist at the session level or some other configurable duration of time. As an example, when an advertisement rights management platform routes advertisement decision rights to an external entity (e.g., upstream entity) from the network system owner/operator, the advertisement rights management platform may pass along the perishable secondary identifier to that upstream entity while passing both the perishable secondary identifier and the primary persistent user identifier to the instance of the rights management platform of the network system owner.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The use of two identifiers in this manner enables the upstream entity that has been granted the rights to see and use the perishable secondary identifier to target advertising to attributes associated with the persistent user identifier without ever having possession of that persistent user identifier nor being able to reverse engineer or impute those targeting attributes to a proxy persistent user identifier. As such, the persistent user identifier is maintained by the system operator and is not exposed to entities interacting with the content items or advertisement inventory events.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Traditionally, programming of broadcast and cable television and radio, including content (i.e., the video or audio program) and (the placement of) advertisements in a video or audio signal stream, has followed a linear model. Programming may be linear in the sense that a program begins and is streamed and in progress when a user chooses to view entertainment content. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a conventional linear or video-on-demand (VOD) model for advertisement placement. Content <b>100</b>, when processed as a digital data stream over a cable network, may be divided into a number of time intervals. The time intervals <b>102</b> include time reserved for a viewed program (content), such as a television program. The intervals <b>102</b> may represent sections of time reserved for advertisements or &#x201c;avails.&#x201d; These &#x201c;avails&#x201d; may be viewed as advertisement placement opportunities. As used herein, a &#x201c;placement opportunity&#x201d; was traditional called an avail and is sometimes referred to as a slot (spots into slots). A placement opportunity (PO) is a construct that represents an opportunity to insert an advertisement or entertainment content, and defines the rules for that opportunity, such as its duration, interactivity, ownership, and technical constraints.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In linear over-the-air or traditional cable TV broadcasting, advertisement time may occur before, during, or after the intervals <b>102</b>. The list of intervals <b>102</b> (e.g., programs and breaks) may be received by a service provider in a schedule, and may provide additional information as to which entity, e.g., a network, an operator, or other entity, owns each of the avails. A traffic and billing system then reads the schedule and identifies which network, operator, or other entity has the right to place an advertisement during a particular avail of a given pod during a given break. Existing cable systems provide static sales&#x2014;e.g., a 30 second spot in a particular geographic market which may be inserted into one or more of the intervals <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In non-linear systems, such as Video-on-Demand (VOD), the intervals <b>102</b> may take on new meanings. The interval <b>102</b> may be a pre-roll, i.e., the space in a video that occurs immediately after a user clicks to start a VOD video. The interval <b>102</b> may be a post-roll, i.e., the space after all of the VOD video segments have finished playing. The intervals <b>102</b> may be mid-rolls, i.e., mini-breaks in the middle of a VOD video, or may be interstitials, i.e., pod-like locations between consecutive VOD video segments. VOD advertisement placement opportunities may appear based on space, time, content, and user context and may be highly non-linear (i.e., the user chooses to initiate the playing of content and in response, the content starts). One or more of the intervals <b>102</b> in such play lists may be ripe for the insertion of advertisements, i.e., advertisement placement opportunities.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, the term &#x201c;binding&#x201d; refers to an identification of signals and content within a placement opportunity (PO). PO's are frequently created for broad amounts of content that are not yet published (i.e., any show on TNT network in the evening). When the show airs and a signal is detected, the signal is bound to the relevant PO's for that show.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein, the term &#x201c;impression&#x201d; refers to a showing of an ad to a single viewer. For example, if a 30 second spot is placed in 50,000 video-on-demand (VOD) streams and it is known that 30,000 of the streams actually played the ad, then 30,000 impressions of that ad have been generated.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used herein, a &#x201c;status notification&#x201d; may be, but is not limited to, an HTTP call from a VOD server with a unique ID that was created when a decision was delivered.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, the term &#x201c;break&#x201d; refers to all of the space in a stream between entertainment content. For example, a group of 4 consecutive 30 second spots between 2 segments of a television show may be considered as a single break.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the traditional model for the placement of ads in television programming, avails are specified by a simple combination of channel and time and decided weeks ahead of broadcast. However, new cable content delivery systems permit advertising spots of varying duration, permit different levels of interactivity (e.g., polling or linking) through the use of buttons on a remote control, may be defined by geography, etc. In a world where TV viewing is becoming increasingly non-linear (e.g., video-on-demand (VOD), networked-based personal video recorders (PVR), interactive programs), a key goal of advertisement opportunity placement systems is to determine how to define placement opportunities that are non-deterministic and manifest dynamically. Advanced advertising needs to accommodate advertisement placement opportunities that are invoked by user events, which may include anything from playback of a VOD title to pausing one's DVR. As the scope of potential placement opportunities expands accordingly, it becomes necessary to precisely define those placement opportunities with attributes representing relevant business rules. These may be used to specify such things as inventory splits, quantity, duration, and position of ad breaks (pre-roll, mid-roll, post-roll); placement of pause ads and overlays; and levels and types of interactivity.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">On the Internet, a content publisher and an advertiser may be isolated from one another, with an advertising network acting as an intermediary. On TV, the advertising network was formerly the national network, the cable network, or the cable operator, that had fixed avails. However, emerging advanced advertising standards for dynamic television provide an opportunity for content providers to derive value from a cable operator's ad placement infrastructure by creating new and more flexible advertising inventory (i.e., Potential Viewership*Placement Opportunities=Advertising Inventory). This new business model imposes unique technical challenges: unlike the Internet, where browsers access/display content and then are separately &#x201c;referred&#x201d; to a shared ad network, the cable television infrastructure selects and assembles both the advertisement and the content together in the network and delivers the combined result to customers' set top boxes. For this to work, cable television advanced advertising networks may need to at least partially operate within the infrastructure of an MSO. To achieve optimal addressability and user experience and achieve bandwidth efficiencies, advertising service elements and digital delivery components need to be located close to the edge of a network, i.e., at or near set top boxes. Decisions need to be made based upon relevant context (infrastructure, platform, content, geography, demographics, etc), which are applicable to non advertisements as well (e.g., suggested content). By making placement decisions and insertions at the time of a user request&#x2014;or even at the appropriate times during content playout&#x2014;fully dynamic ad placement may be achieved.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Certain embodiments of the present invention are compatible with and make use of elements defined according to the SCTE-130 standard. The SCTE-130 standard provides a standardized and extensible message based interface defining a minimal set of cooperating logical services necessary to communicate placement opportunities, placement decisions, and placement related event data necessary for accountability measurements. SCTE-130 defines an extensible framework of interfaces among a set of advertising system logical services. The SCTE-130 standard encompasses: a minimal set of cooperative logical services needed to implement advanced addressable advertising systems; the core data types and extensible message framework forming a vocabulary needed to communicate among the defined logical services; the interfaces among these logical services using the core data types and messages; and, mechanisms for extensibility that allow innovation while preserving backward compatibility with already deployed systems&#x2014;thereby reducing the complexity for incorporating new features within the standard.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The normative parts of the SCTE-130 standard define mechanisms for integrating systems implementing features such as VOD-based advertising, linear-based advertising, enhanced advertising capabilities such as ad rotation groups (rotation groups refer to placement opportunities that run in rotation so that the same add is not viewed again immediately), subscriber-based addressing for advertising or content tailoring, extension points for more advanced advertising or addressing features, logical services that are implemented as one or more physical systems created by the same vendor, deployment of a logical service that may simultaneously include systems from one or more vendors, and an implementation that may incorporate one or more of the defined logical services and interfaces.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The SCTE-130 standard defines a set of logical services comprising an advanced advertising system. Each logical service may itself be a complex system. In an embodiment, one or more of the following logical services may be used by or interact with certain embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">An Ad Management Service (ADM) may be configured to define messages in support of ad insertion activities. The primary consumer of these messages is an Ad Decision Service (ADS). The message interfaces exposed by an ADM permit both pre-configured ad decisions as well as real-time fulfillment models. An ADM implementation may incorporate some simple ad selection rules (e.g., ad rotations) but more complex ad decisions are the responsibility of an ADS.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">An Ad Decision Service (ADS) may be configured to determine how advertising content is combined with non-advertising (i.e., entertainment) content assets. The decisions made by an ADS may be straightforward (i.e., specific ad content placed at a specific time in a specific asset) or arbitrarily complex (based on subscriber data, advertising zone, etc.).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A Content Information Service (CIS) may be configured to manage metadata describing assets (both advertising assets and non-advertising assets) available to the other SCTE-130 logical services. The CIS provides query and notification interfaces to the other logical services. The query service is available on an ad-hoc basis and may be called by any other logical service at any time without any prior registration. Queries specify values or patterns to be sought in the query message metadata and the specified matching information (or an error indication) is returned in a response message.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The Content Information Service (CIS) may be a storage and distribution engine. It stores metadata about entertainment and advertising assets; provides notifications to registered clients when metadata is modified; registers, receives and processes notifications from other CIS services; and supports real-time metadata queries. The CIS permits an Advertising Manager (ADM) and/or Ad Decision Service (ADS) to retrieve and utilize content metadata in their advanced advertising decision processing.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A Placement Opportunity Information Service (POIS) may hold, maintain, and retain descriptions of placement opportunities. The POIS may also contain attributes and constraints for each placement opportunity, platform compliance, rights, and policies of the content in which the placement opportunity exists. These placement opportunities are content specific, therefore attributes and constraints may vary by network, geographic region, or other content distribution dimension.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The POIS may be a Placement Opportunity (PO) storage and inventory execution engine. It stores PO metadata and statistics; provides notifications to registered clients when PO metadata is modified; registers, receives and processes notifications from other POIS services; and supports real-time PO metadata queries. Through the POIS appliance, an Advertising Manager (ADM) and/or Ad Decision Service (ADS) can retrieve and utilize placement opportunity metadata in their advanced advertising decision making.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The Subscriber Information Service (SIS) may be configured to manage per-subscriber information relevant to ad placement decisions. The SIS provides a mapping between subscriber or client identifiers, such as a MAC address, serial number, etc., and subscriber or audience attributes, e.g., age, sex, location of a subscriber.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The term &#x201c;computer&#x201d; or &#x201c;computer platform&#x201d; is intended to include any data processing device, such as a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a mainframe computer, a server, a handheld device, a digital signal processor (DSP), an embedded processor (an example of which is described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), or any other device able to process data. The computer/computer platform is configured to include one or more microprocessors communicatively connected to one or more non-transitory computer-readable media and one or more networks.

The system <b>200</b> can comprise one or more upstream devices <b>202</b> for accessing and/or transmitting data, such as a data stream. In an aspect, the upstream devices <b>202</b> can comprise a content provider (e.g. audio content, video content, data, news feed, sports programming, advertisements, etc.) configured to transmit the data (e.g., as a content assets, stream, fragments, files, etc.) to various end-users. In an aspect, one or more upstream devices <b>202</b> can comprise or access an advertisement database having a plurality of advertisements stored therein. As an example, the advertisement database can comprise a plurality of video advertisements. As a further example, the plurality of advertisements can each have a particular time duration associated therewith. In an aspect, the time duration associated with the advertisements or alternate content can be varied in duration for application in various time dependent circumstances. As an example, a particular advertisement can have multiple versions, wherein each version of the same advertisement can have a different time duration. Accordingly, an advertisement having a particular time duration can be retrieved to fill a time slot having a substantially equal time duration. However, any advertisement or advertisements can be retrieved or transmitted to the end user.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The system <b>200</b> may be used to select and assemble both the advertisement <b>212</b> and the content together and may deliver the combined result to user devices <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>n </i>(e.g., set-top box, Internet ready televisions, radios, smartphones, tablets, PCs, etc.). The user devices <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>n</i>, may be configured to receive content from various sources including, but not limited to, VOD and/or Internet streaming services, over WiFi or other wireless, or wired connection. Content may be transmitted (e.g., streamed) to the user device <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>n </i>via a network such as a content delivery network (CDN) <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In certain aspects, a content provider (e.g., MSO, streaming service, etc.) may wish to provide video streams to the user devices <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>n</i>. However, certain video may need to be formatted for transmission and/or processing for rendering. Various content creators/players may have incompatible formats. To overcome this problem, a signal received from an upstream devices <b>206</b> may be transmitted to a transcoder <b>208</b> to place the signal in a desired format and to fragment the formatted signal into the predetermined (e.g., 2 second, 10 second, etc.) chunks of data. These chunks may be stored for subsequent retrieval and transmission.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The system <b>200</b> may be or include a network system, such as a closed or managed system, whereby certain components, functions, and/or information are limited to one or more particular entities (e.g., MSO). As an example, the system <b>200</b> may be a network system of devices managed or operated by an entity, and the network system may communicate with one or more upstream devices <b>206</b> that are associated with entities outside of the network system. For example, the upstream devices <b>206</b> may be or comprise devices associated with content inventory, such a repositories of content, advertisers, and/or entities configured to provide content to the managed system without having operative control over the network system. As such, selective information may be communicated to the upstream devices <b>206</b> to facilitate certain services or functions such as advertisement placement, as discussed in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A network system such as at least a portion of the system <b>200</b> may generate an advertisement (ad) inventory event via the consumption of an item of content. The ad inventory event may indicate a position or break in the content where an advertisement may be provided as part of the consumption of the content item. The advertisement inventory event may be filled with an advertisement from one or more sources. The content item may be or comprise audio, video, text or other information. As an example, to identify a particular channel data stream, including times when a program has ended and before the next program begins, or when there is a break in the program, e.g., a placement opportunity, a signal or marker, such as a q-tone, may be inserted in the digital stream a predetermined time before the next program begins, for example. An observer <b>210</b>, which may be the transcoder <b>208</b>, informs an ad service (ADS) <b>212</b> of the arrival of the signal or marker for subsequent placement of one or more advertisements into the channel data stream.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In managing the delivery of content, the network system may leverage a user identifier <b>214</b> that maps to a household, user, or segment of audience consuming the content item.

The secondary identifier <b>216</b> may persist at the session level or some other configurable duration of time, or may be associated with a fixed time-to-live (TTL). As an example, when an advertisement rights management platform (e.g., ADS <b>212</b>) routes advertisement decision rights to an external entity (e.g., upstream device <b>206</b>) from the network system, the advertisement rights management platform may pass along the perishable secondary identifier <b>216</b> to that upstream device <b>206</b> while passing both the perishable secondary identifier <b>216</b> and the primary persistent user identifier <b>214</b> to the instance of the rights management platform of the network system owner.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The use of two identifiers in this manner enables the upstream device <b>206</b> that has been granted the rights to see and use the perishable secondary identifier <b>216</b> to target advertising to attributes associated with the persistent user identifier <b>214</b> without ever having possession of that persistent user identifier <b>214</b> nor being able to reverse engineer or impute those targeting attributes to a proxy persistent user identifier <b>214</b>.
