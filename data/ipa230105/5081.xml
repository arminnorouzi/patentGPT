This may be achieved through a combination of facilitation of team building activities and discussion on their application to the real world. When operating remotely, many organizations (including professional experiential educators) may struggle to transfer this ideology to a virtual platform.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Team building activities configured for in-person learning may not easily transfer to a remote environment, while some team building activities (e.g., ropes course) may not transfer at all. Experiential learning generally includes learning by doing followed by reflection on the experience. Participants in remote activities may be relatively more susceptible to local distractions that may not be present in an in-person learning environment. Thus, implementing experiential teambuilding activities remotely presents challenges.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, there is provided a computing device for remote experiential teambuilding activities.

Some examples of prompts include: I prefer Netflix over Hulu. I am from New York. If a participant agrees with a statement, they may then stand up. If a participant disagrees with a statement, they will remain sitting. The facilitator will debrief the results and moderate any discussion that comes about from the statements and participant's opinions.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0092">For example, for a facilitator and facilitator computing device <b>102</b>-<b>1</b>, local user input <b>103</b> may include the spoken prompts (UI <b>116</b> corresponding to microphone) and local device output <b>105</b>-<b>1</b> may correspond to a digital representation of the spoken prompts. Each remote device output <b>105</b>-<b>2</b> may then correspond to the digital representation of the spoken prompts. For each participant and participant computing device, local user input may then include captured image (UI corresponding to camera) of participant position (i.e., standing, sitting or some other gesture) and local device output may correspond to a digital representation of the image. The facilitator remote device output may then correspond to the digital representation of participant gestures. Subsequent facilitator local user input may then include, for example, spoken or typed words or phrases corresponding to answers to the results (UI corresponding to microphone, and/or keyboard, keypad or touch sensitive display), corresponding to remote device output for participants.

For a selected participant computing device, a remote device output may then be a digital representation of characters corresponding to text provided by the facilitator. The digital representation of characters corresponding to the text may be processed and the alphanumeric description may be provided to the participant visually using a display. Subsequently, continuing with the facilitator, the operations may be repeated for a gibberish phrase that is to be translated. The corresponding local device output may then be provided to all participant computing devices.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0111">For each participant and participant computing device, local user input may then include a spoken or typed translation of a selected word in the gibberish phrase (UI corresponding to microphone, and/or keyboard, keypad or touch sensitive display) and local device output may correspond to a digital representation of the participant spoken translation.
