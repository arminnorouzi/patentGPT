Smart, profitable and sustainable businesses maximize their market presence, productivity and corresponding revenue streams by ensuring that all prospective and actual patrons and employees are afforded safe, well-designed access with respect to ingress, egress and all through out a business' topography. Maximized accessibility makes good business sense, as fully accessible businesses and workplaces attract new customers, facilitate diversifying workplace employment opportunities, and potentially expand a company's footprint into emerging fields and new areas of expertise.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Within businesses and workplace venues, isles, routes and other access pathways that are obstructed or narrowly constructed render such buildings inaccessible to&#x2014;and unusable by&#x2014;customers, employees or other patrons with disabilities. According to the United States Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, the Americans with Disabilities Act (&#x201c;ADA&#x201d;) requires businesses that service the American public to remove access barriers from older buildings and to design and build new facilities to provide ADA-compliant access to customers, patrons and employees with disabilities.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A pivotal component of ADA compliance is constructing and maintaining existing and new structures to facilitate full use and access by people with disabilities. If key structural and design components of public access buildings, such as ingress and egress, routes and isle space throughout an establishment, restroom access and parking structures are not maintained in compliance with the ADA, then public access is reduced&#x2014;or completely eliminated. For instance, prospective, existing and future employees, customers and patrons with disabilities will not be ale to effectively work or shop in venues if access routes through internal isle ways or ingress and egress points are constructed too narrowly. Thus, the ADA requires that such internally disposed isles and other pathways in public access establishments be constructed to provide for not less than 3 feet (36 inches) in full width. According to the ADA, the minimum clear width for a single wheelchair passage must be 32 inches at a point for a maximum length of 24 inches and 36 inches continuously.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention solves the long-standing problem of conventional foliage cultivation equipment and corresponding workspaces not being ADA compliant, specifically with respect to creating wheelchair accessible, 36-inch workspace isles in industrial cultivation facilities. In order to achieve ADA compliance in this regard, the inventive budding foliage cultivation table comprises an inventive roller guide assembly, which facilitates 36-inch lateral movement of the inventive budding foliage cultivation table to provide ADA complaint workspace isles during use according to the present invention. The inventive roller guide assembly comprises a plurality of vertical aluminum rollers. A plurality of lower rollers allow a surface for the inventive budding foliage cultivation table to travel upon, while a plurality of upper rollers are constructed to prevent the inventive budding foliage cultivation table from flipping over off of the inventive base of the budding foliage cultivation table according to the present invention. A plurality of lateral rollers keep the inventive budding foliage cultivation table from binding, to ensure smooth transition during forward and backward movement of the inventive budding foliage cultivation table during use.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The inventive roller guide assembly is attached to the base of the inventive budding foliage cultivation table. Collectively, the inventive roller guide assembly and corresponding plurality of rollers facilitate the expansion and/or contraction of the inventive budding foliage cultivation table width to create ADA Compliant 36-inch workspace isles. Moreover, during use of the inventive budding foliage cultivation table, the inventive roller guide assembly is anchored to the workplace floor, which allows the inventive budding foliage cultivation table to travel at least 36 inches laterally, creating an effective weight distribution to achieve 36 inch lateral movement in a safe manner, eliminating the prospect of Table malfunction, including overturning, collision, table damage and a variety of potential workplace injuries.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An additional inventive safety feature of the present invention comprises an inventive cam lock, which is a part of the inventive roller guide assembly, and stabilizes the inventive budding foliage cultivation table in a desired stationary work position to enhance safety during use.
