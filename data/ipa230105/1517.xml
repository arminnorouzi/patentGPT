The laser annealing apparatus <b>1</b> (laser irradiation apparatus) is, for example, an excimer laser annealing (ELA) apparatus for forming a low temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) film.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The laser annealing apparatus <b>1</b> irradiates a silicon film formed on a substrate <b>8</b> with laser light. In this way, it is possible to convert an amorphous silicon film (a-Si film) into a polycrystalline silicon film (polysilicon film: p-Si film). For example, the substrate <b>8</b> is a transparent substrate such as a glass substrate.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As illustrated in the figure of the present embodiment, in a XYZ three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, a Z-direction is a vertical direction and is a direction perpendicular to the substrate <b>8</b>. An XY-plane is a plane parallel to a plane on which the silicon film of the substrate <b>8</b> is formed. For example, an X-direction is a longitudinal direction of the rectangular substrate <b>8</b>, and a Y-direction is a lateral direction of the substrate <b>8</b>. When using a &#x398;-axis stage <b>71</b> that can rotate from 0&#xb0; to 90&#xb0; about a Z-axis, the X-direction can be the lateral direction of the substrate <b>8</b> and the Y direction can be the longitudinal direction of the substrate <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The laser annealing apparatus <b>1</b> includes an annealing optical system <b>11</b>, a laser irradiation chamber <b>7</b>, and a control device <b>9</b>. The laser irradiation chamber <b>7</b> accommodates a base <b>72</b> and a stage <b>71</b> disposed on the base <b>72</b>. In the laser annealing apparatus <b>1</b>, a silicon film <b>201</b> is irradiated with laser light while the substrate <b>8</b> is conveyed in a +X-direction by the stage <b>71</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The annealing optical system <b>11</b> is an optical system for generating laser light for crystallizing an amorphous silicon film formed on the substrate <b>8</b> and converting the amorphous silicon film into a polysilicon film, and irradiating the amorphous silicon film with the laser light. The annealing optical system <b>11</b> is an optical system including a laser light source <b>2</b> including a first laser light source <b>21</b> and a second laser light source <b>22</b>, a first attenuator <b>31</b>, a second attenuator <b>32</b>, a synthetic optical system <b>5</b>, a beam shaping optical system <b>6</b>, an epi-illumination mirror <b>61</b>, and a projection lens <b>65</b> and emitting laser light obtained by synthesizing a plurality of laser light rays.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The laser light source <b>2</b> includes the first laser light source <b>21</b> and the second laser light source <b>22</b>, and includes a plurality of laser light sources <b>2</b>. In the present embodiment, a two-laser light source configuration of the first laser light source <b>21</b> and the second laser light source <b>22</b> is adopted. However, this configuration is an example, and the disclosure is not limited to the two-laser light source configuration. The laser light source <b>2</b> may include a single laser light source <b>2</b> or three or more laser light sources <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The first laser light source <b>21</b> and the second laser light source <b>22</b> are laser generators that generate pulsed laser light as laser light for irradiating the amorphous silicon film (processed object). The generated laser light is laser light for crystallizing a non-crystalline film on the substrate <b>8</b> to form a crystallized film, and is, for example, gas laser light such as excimer laser light having a center wavelength of 308 nm.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the first laser light source <b>21</b> and the second laser light source <b>22</b>, a gas such as xenon is enclosed in a chamber, and two resonator mirrors are disposed to face each other with the gas interposed therebetween. One resonator mirror is a total reflection mirror that reflects all light, and the other resonator mirror is a partial reflection mirror that transmits a part of light. Gas light excited by the gas is repeatedly reflected between the resonator mirrors, and amplified light is emitted from the resonator mirror as laser light. For example, the first laser light source <b>21</b> and the second laser light source <b>22</b> repeatedly emit pulsed laser light in a cycle of 500 Hz to 600 Hz. The first laser light source <b>21</b> emits the laser light toward the first attenuator <b>31</b>. The second laser light source <b>22</b> emits the laser light toward the second attenuator <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first attenuator <b>31</b> and the second attenuator <b>32</b> attenuate incident laser light to adjust an energy density to a predetermined energy density. As a characteristic, these attenuators have a transmittance indicating a ratio of the emitted laser light to the incident laser light, and the transmittance is configured to be variable based on a signal from the control device <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The first attenuator <b>31</b> is provided in the middle of an optical path from the first laser light source <b>21</b> to the synthetic optical system <b>5</b>. The second attenuator <b>32</b> is provided in the middle of an optical path from the second laser light source <b>22</b> to the synthetic optical system <b>5</b>.

The second attenuator <b>32</b> attenuates laser light emitted by the second laser light source <b>22</b> according to the transmittance.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A first polarization ratio control unit <b>41</b> and a second polarization ratio control unit <b>42</b> are disposed on emission sides of the first attenuator <b>31</b> and the second attenuator <b>32</b>, respectively. The first polarization ratio control unit <b>41</b> and the second polarization ratio control unit <b>42</b> include, for example, a 1/2 wave plate (&#x3bb;/2 plate) and a polarization beam splitter, and change a polarization ratio of a P-polarized wave and an S-polarized wave of incident laser light.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first polarization ratio control unit <b>41</b> changes a polarization ratio of laser light emitted from the first attenuator <b>31</b>. The second polarization ratio control unit <b>42</b> changes a polarization ratio of laser light emitted from the second attenuator <b>32</b>. The first polarization ratio control unit <b>41</b> and the second polarization ratio control unit <b>42</b> are configured to change (vary) the respective polarization ratios based on a control signal output from the control device <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The synthetic optical system <b>5</b> has, for example, a beam splitter, etc., and synthesizes laser emitted from the first laser light source <b>21</b> and laser light emitted from the second laser light source <b>22</b>. Since the first attenuator <b>31</b> and the second attenuator <b>32</b> are disposed in the optical path between the synthetic optical system <b>5</b> and the first laser light source <b>21</b> and the optical path between the synthetic optical system <b>5</b> and the second laser light source <b>22</b>, laser emitted from the first attenuator <b>31</b> and laser light emitted from the second attenuator <b>32</b> are incident on the synthetic optical system <b>5</b>, and the laser light is synthesized by the synthetic optical system <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a plan view orthogonal to an optical axis, the laser light from the first laser light source <b>21</b> and the laser light from the second laser light source <b>22</b> overlap each other. By the synthetic optical system <b>5</b>, the laser light from the first laser light source <b>21</b> and the laser light from the second laser light source <b>22</b> are spatially overlapped and coaxial, so that synthesized laser light is obtained. The laser light synthesized by the synthetic optical system <b>5</b> is incident on the beam shaping optical system <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The laser light synthesized by the synthetic optical system <b>5</b> is incident on the beam shaping optical system <b>6</b>, and the beam shaping optical system <b>6</b> shapes the incident laser light (synthesized laser light) to generate beam-shaped laser beam suitable for irradiating the silicon film.

By inputting a plurality of time-series feature amounts from the past to the present time to the feature amount learning model <b>925</b>, it is possible to output one or more feature amounts (future feature amounts) which are subsequent points after a feature amount at the present point, that is, for a last feature amount among the input time-series feature amounts. Furthermore, by recursively inputting a plurality of time-series feature amounts including the output feature amount after the subsequent point to the feature amount learning model <b>925</b>, it is possible to output (expect) a subsequent feature amount. In this way, it is possible to derive the time until failure by perceiving an increasing tendency of the feature amount and calculating a time until reaching a preset threshold value (value of the feature amount leading to failure) from a present time.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The threshold value may be dynamically changed by, for example, an operation by an administrator of the laser annealing apparatus <b>1</b>. The control unit <b>91</b> of the control device <b>9</b> receives the change of the threshold value by the administrator, etc., and when the threshold value is changed, the control unit <b>91</b> recalculates the time until the failure based on the changed threshold value. The control unit <b>91</b> of the control device <b>9</b> calculates the failure time by adding the time until the failure to the current date and time. Alternatively, the control unit <b>91</b> of the control device <b>9</b> may calculate the failure time by adding the time until the failure and a planned suspension time to the current date and time.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In the maintenance work advice display area, generated advice text is displayed based on the time until failure of the target movable part or the failure time. The control unit <b>91</b> of the control device <b>9</b> may refer to a table in which, for example, a state (time until failure or failure time) and action (advice) stored in the storage unit <b>92</b> are associated, thereby generating advice on the time until failure of the movable part at the present time.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Other Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, and <b>16</b></figref> are process sectional views illustrating a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to another embodiment (method of manufacturing a semiconductor device).
