Obviously, the described embodiments are a part of embodiments of the present disclosure, rather than all the embodiments. Based on the embodiments of the present disclosure, all other embodiments obtained by those of ordinary skill in the art without creative efforts fall within the protection scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Shapes and dimensions of components in the accompanying drawings do not reflect a real scale of the touch panel, and are only intended to illustrate the contents of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">At present, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a touch panel in the related art basically adopts a touch control structure composed of a barrier layer (Barrier) <b>01</b>, a bridge layer (Bridge) <b>02</b>, an interlayer insulator layer (Insulator) <b>03</b>, an electrode layer (Metal Mesh) <b>04</b> and a protective layer (OC) <b>05</b>. The barrier layer <b>01</b> and the interlayer insulator layer <b>03</b> both adopt a SiNx thin film formed by a low temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technology, and there may be residue of gases including nitrogen and ammonia gas in a formed SiNx thin film because the SiNx thin film is relatively poor in compactness. After a polarizer (POL) <b>06</b> is attached to the touch control structure in the related art, it is discovered in a reliability verification process that the POL severely fades. It is verified that a phenomenon of severe fading of the POL is mainly caused by the ammonia gas escaping from the SiNx thin film. Therefore, to prevent the POL from fading, those of skill in the art needs to find a technical solution for avoiding escape of the ammonia gas from the SiNx thin film.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In view of this, a touch panel provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, includes: a substrate <b>1</b>, a touch control structure <b>2</b> and a polarizer <b>3</b> sequentially arranged on the substrate <b>1</b>, and an insulator layer <b>4</b> arranged between the substrate <b>1</b> and the polarizer <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The insulator layer <b>4</b> includes a silicon nitride layer <b>41</b> and a blocking layer <b>42</b> on a side of the silicon nitride layer <b>41</b> away from the substrate <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to the above touch panel provided by the embodiment of the present disclosure, the insulator layer <b>4</b> between the substrate <b>1</b> and the polarizer <b>3</b> is arranged to include the silicon nitride layer <b>41</b> and the blocking layer <b>42</b> on the side of the silicon nitride layer <b>41</b> away from the substrate <b>1</b>. On the one hand, the blocking layer <b>42</b> may serve as a covering layer to prevent ammonia gas escaping from the silicon nitride layer <b>41</b> from flowing to the polarizer <b>3</b>, therefore avoiding fading of the polarizer. On the other hand, the insulator layer <b>4</b> adopts a form of double thin films, namely the silicon nitride layer <b>41</b> and the blocking layer <b>42</b>, the blocking layer <b>42</b> is formed on a surface of an existing insulator layer <b>4</b>, and therefore, the silicon nitride layer <b>41</b> with a sufficient thickness is preserved on the basis of reducing an escaped amount of the ammonia gas, so the insulator layer <b>4</b> will not completely lose dielectric properties, optical properties and insulation properties in film layers of the touch panel. Moreover, since the insulator layer <b>4</b> is a composite insulator layer composed of the silicon nitride layer <b>41</b> and the blocking layer <b>42</b>, a breakdown voltage of a circuit may be increased significantly.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Optionally, during specific implementation, in the above touch panel provided by the embodiment of the present disclosure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the silicon nitride layer <b>41</b> may include a first silicon nitride layer <b>411</b> and a second silicon nitride layer <b>412</b>.

Therefore, by arranging the interlayer insulator layer <b>10</b> between the bridge layer <b>21</b> and the electrode layer <b>22</b> including the first compact silicon nitride layer and the first blocking layer <b>421</b>, the first compact silicon nitride layer is relatively compact and may serve as a covering layer to stop the ammonia gas escaped from the first silicon nitride layer <b>411</b> from flowing to the polarizer <b>3</b>, so the fading phenomenon of the polarizer is avoided.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The touch panel and a display panel are usually integrated to form a touch display apparatus. A general manufacturing method of a touch display apparatus is that, a display device is manufactured first on a substrate, the display device is then encapsulated (currently, TFE encapsulation is adopted more frequently), a barrier layer (Barrier) is further manufactured on a TFE encapsulation layer to further isolate external water vapor after encapsulation, a material of the barrier layer is usually silicon nitride, a touch control structure is then manufactured, and then processes of attaching a polarizer (POL) and encapsulating cover glass (Cover Glass) are performed. The barrier layer usually adopts a SiNx thin film formed by a low temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technology. Because the SiNx thin film is relatively poor in compactness, there may be residue of gases, such as nitrogen and ammonia gas etc., in a formed SiNx thin film.
