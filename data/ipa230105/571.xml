controlling a surgical manipulator arm.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A surgical system that performs surgery by moving manipulator arms has been conventionally known (see Patent Literature 1, for example).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In this surgical system, the proximal ends of the manipulator arms are removably mounted on a platform, and the manipulator arms are arranged adjacent to one another.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0005"

Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the surgical system described in Patent Literature 1 is disadvantageous in that when any of the manipulator arms is moved, the manipulator arm is likely to interfere with another component, such as the adjacent manipulator arm, of the surgical system or with the surrounding environment.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to solve the above problem, a surgical system according to one aspect includes: a surgical tool including a shaft; a manipulator arm holding the surgical tool at a distal end thereof and having seven or more degrees of freedom, the manipulator arm including joints and actuators that drive the joints to effect positioning of the joints, the joints including a proximal end roll joint disposed at a proximal end of the manipulator arm, a distal end roll joint disposed distal to a distal end of the proximal end roll joint and having a rotation axis coinciding with a central axis of the shaft, and a pivotal joint disposed between the proximal end roll joint and the distal end roll joint, the pivotal joint having a rotation axis crossing a reference plane including the rotation axis of the distal end roll joint, the rotation axis of the pivotal joint being in a fixed orientation relative to the reference plane; a console that receives an operation input provided by an operator to the manipulator arm; and a controller that controls the actuators based on the operation input, wherein the controller is configured to: set a center point; set a reference point on a reference line that is an extension of a rotation axis of the proximal end roll joint or that is offset from the extension in a direction normal to the extension; and position the joints such that the shaft passes through the center point and that the reference plane passes through the reference point.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this configuration, the motion of the manipulator arm can be controlled such that most of the rotational motion of the shaft can be effected by the motion of the distal end roll joint, and the manipulator arm can be prevented from significantly changing its posture to effect the rotational motion of the shaft. As such, interference of the manipulator arm with another component of the surgical system or with the surrounding environment can be prevented.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has the advantage of preventing interference of a manipulator arm of a surgical system with another component of the surgical system or with the surrounding environment.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front view showing an example of the configuration of a surgical system according to Embodiment 1.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view showing an example of the overall configuration of a manipulator arm of the surgical system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plan view showing an example of the configuration of an arm base of the surgical system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram schematically showing an example of the control system configuration of the surgical system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an example of the operation of the surgical system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an example of the operation of the surgical system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an example of the operation of the surgical system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a front view showing an example of the configuration of a surgical system according to Embodiment 2.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows an example of the operation of the surgical system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments will be described with reference to the drawings.

The console <b>2</b> is placed in a surgery room and near or far from a surgical bed <b>111</b> or placed outside the surgery room. The console <b>2</b> includes: operation inputters such as a manually-operated manipulator arm and a foot-operated pedal which are used by the operator S to input operation commands; and a monitor that displays an image captured by an endoscope assembly attached as a surgical tool <b>40</b> to the patient-side system <b>1</b>. The operator S maneuvers the operation inputters to input an operation command to the console <b>2</b> while viewing an affected zone (surgical site <b>110</b>) on the monitor.

The vicinity of the surgical bed <b>111</b> in the surgery room is a sterile field subjected to sterilization.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The patient-side system <b>1</b> includes the positioner <b>7</b>, the arm base (platform) <b>5</b> mounted on the distal end of the positioner <b>7</b>, patient-side manipulator arms (simply referred to as &#x201c;arms <b>3</b>&#x201d; hereinafter) removably mounted on the arm base <b>5</b>, a shaft <b>43</b>, and the end effector <b>44</b>. The positioner <b>7</b> extends from a given support and connects the support and the arm base <b>5</b>. In the present embodiment, the positioner <b>7</b> is configured as a vertical articulated robot, in particular a multi-articulated (seven axis-articulated) arm having multiple degrees of freedom (seven degrees of freedom). The positioner <b>7</b> can move the arm base <b>5</b> three-dimensionally (in X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis directions orthogonal to one another) relative to a movable cart <b>70</b> serving as the given support. The positioner <b>7</b>, the arm base <b>5</b>, and components of each arm <b>3</b> which are arranged in order from the proximal end of the arm <b>3</b> to a holder <b>36</b> of the arm <b>3</b>, are covered by a non-illustrated sterile drape, and thus the positioner <b>7</b>, the arm base <b>5</b>, and the components of each arm <b>3</b> which are arranged in order from the proximal end to the holder <b>36</b> described later, are separated from the sterile field in the surgery room.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each of the arms <b>3</b> includes a tool holder (holder <b>36</b>) capable of holding the surgical tool <b>40</b> including an elongated shaft.

Hereinafter, the arm <b>3</b> equipped with the endoscope assembly may be referred to as a &#x201c;camera arm&#x201d;, and each arm <b>3</b> equipped with the instrument <b>42</b> may be referred to as an &#x201c;instrument arm&#x201d;. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the patient-side system <b>1</b> of the present embodiment includes four arms <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>3</b>C, and <b>3</b>D, one of which is a camera arm and the other three of which are instrument arms. In explanation of a feature specific to a particular one of the arms <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>3</b>C, and <b>3</b>D, the arm of interest is clearly indicated by adding the letter &#x201c;A&#x201d;, &#x201c;B&#x201d;, &#x201c;C&#x201d;, or &#x201c;D&#x201d; after the numeral 3.

In the translational motion unit <b>35</b>, upon a change in the relative position between the proximal end-side link <b>61</b> and coupling link <b>63</b>, the relative position between the coupling link <b>63</b> and distal end-side link <b>62</b> in the long axis direction Dt is also changed by the action of the interlocking mechanism. Thus, the translational motion unit <b>35</b> can change the position of the instrument <b>42</b>, which is attached to the holder <b>36</b> mounted on the distal end-side link <b>62</b>, relative to the proximal end-side link <b>61</b> in the long axis direction Dt. The translational motion unit <b>35</b> can advance the instrument <b>42</b> in an insertion direction or withdraw the instrument <b>42</b> in a removal direction. More specifically, the coupling link <b>63</b> includes a pair of guide rails extending in the long axis direction Dt. One of the guide rails supports the proximal end-side link <b>61</b> such that the proximal end-side link <b>61</b> is slidable in the long axis direction Dt, while the other guide rail supports the distal end-side link <b>62</b> such that the distal end-side link <b>62</b> is slidable in the long axis direction Dt. Once the proximal end-side link <b>61</b> slides on the one of the guide rails to one side in the long axis direction Dt, the interlocking mechanism causes the distal end-side link <b>62</b> to slide on the other guide rail to the opposite side in the long axis direction Dt. The interlocking mechanism is a double-speed mechanism and may be, for example, a mechanism employing a pulley and a timing belt or a mechanism including a gear train. The translational motion unit <b>35</b> serves as an eighth joint J<b>38</b> which is a prismatic joint that couples the distal end-side link <b>62</b> and holder <b>36</b> to the proximal end-side link <b>61</b> and that moves the distal end-side link <b>62</b> and holder <b>36</b> linearly in the long axis direction Dt.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The holder <b>36</b> removably holds the tool base <b>45</b> of the surgical tool <b>40</b> described later.

The proximal end of the shaft <b>43</b> is coupled to the tool base <b>45</b> via the ninth joint J<b>39</b> which is a torsional (roll) joint (distal end roll joint).

In response to this instruction, the controller <b>600</b> performs forward transformation based on the posture of the arm <b>3</b>, the positional relationship of the distal end of the shaft <b>43</b> of the surgical tool <b>40</b> for teaching relative to the tool base <b>45</b> of the surgical tool <b>40</b>, the position and posture of the base <b>80</b>, and information on parameters related to the arm links, thereby calculating the location of the remote center RC.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the first direction D<b>1</b>, the arms <b>3</b> and the sleeves <b>112</b> are associated in one-to-one correspondence such that the remote centers RC associated respectively with the arms <b>3</b> are arranged in the order in which the arms <b>3</b> are arranged. That is, the rightmost sleeve <b>112</b> in the first direction D<b>1</b> is associated with the rightmost arm <b>3</b>A in the first direction D<b>1</b>. Upon calculation of the remote center RC for this sleeve <b>112</b>, the arm <b>3</b>A and the rightmost remote center RC in the first direction D<b>1</b> are associated with each other. The same applies to the arms <b>3</b>B, <b>3</b>C, and <b>3</b>D.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The surgery assistant or operator S replaces the surgical tool <b>40</b> for teaching by the endoscope assembly or instrument <b>42</b>. Through the preliminary procedures as described above, the positioner <b>7</b>, arm base <b>5</b>, and arms <b>3</b> are positioned to establish a given initial positional relationship between the sleeves <b>112</b> retained on the body surface of the patient P that is the surgical site <b>110</b> and the surgical tools <b>40</b> attached to the arms <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In each arm <b>3</b> which is in the initial posture, the base <b>80</b> extends substantially in a horizontal direction. The second and third links <b>82</b> and <b>83</b> connected to the bent first link <b>81</b> extend obliquely downward. More specifically, the second and third links <b>82</b> and <b>83</b> extend downward in the direction (second direction D<b>2</b>) in which the rotation axis R<b>1</b> of the first joint J<b>31</b> extends from the proximal end to the distal end of the base <b>80</b> (direction towards the feet of the patient P in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The fourth link <b>84</b> is turned in the opposite direction at the elbow <b>31</b>, and the fourth, fifth, and sixth links <b>84</b>, <b>85</b>, and <b>86</b> extend obliquely downward. More specifically, the fourth, fifth, and sixth links <b>84</b>, <b>85</b>, and <b>86</b> extend downward in the direction in which the rotation axis R<b>1</b> of the first joint J<b>31</b> extends from the distal end to the proximal end of the base <b>80</b> (direction towards the head of the patient P in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The initial posture of the arm <b>3</b> may be determined so as to meet additional constraints described later.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the present embodiment, the controller <b>600</b> disables operation inputs received through the console <b>2</b> while the patient-side system <b>1</b> (the positioner <b>7</b>, arm base <b>5</b>, and arms <b>3</b>) is moved from the retracted position to the preparatory position. Once the patient-side system <b>1</b> is placed in the preparatory position, the controller <b>600</b> enables operation inputs received through the console <b>2</b>. During surgery subsequent to the placement of the patient-side system <b>1</b> in the preparatory position, the controller <b>600</b> basically keeps the positioner <b>7</b> and arm base <b>5</b> at rest, and in this state the arm controller <b>601</b> generates an operation command based on an input provided by the operator S operating the console <b>2</b>. Thus, in response to the operation input received from the console <b>2</b>, the arm controller <b>601</b> performs motion control to move the arm <b>3</b> of interest such that the position and posture of the surgical tool <b>40</b> are changed as desired. In the control of the arm <b>3</b>, the arm controller <b>601</b> constrains the posture of the surgical tool <b>40</b> such that the surgical tool <b>40</b> inserted into the sleeve <b>112</b> passes through the remote center RC. This can restrict the sleeve <b>112</b> from moving in the in-plane direction of the body surface of the patient P.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Moving the surgical tool <b>40</b> to a target position and placing the surgical tool <b>40</b> in a target posture at the target position during surgery are accomplished through motions including joint motions involving the nine axes of the joints J<b>31</b> to J<b>39</b>. Since each arm <b>3</b> has more than seven degrees of freedom and redundancy, the posture of the arm <b>3</b> is not uniquely determined for a given target position and target posture of the shaft <b>43</b> of the surgical tool <b>40</b>. In particular, rotation of the shaft <b>43</b> in a circumferential direction about the central axis C of the shaft <b>43</b> can be effected not only by rotating the ninth joint J<b>39</b> whose rotation axis coincides with the central axis C but also by rotating the distal end of the arm body <b>30</b> in the circumferential direction about the central axis C. Thus, the controller <b>600</b> combines a motion of the arm body <b>30</b> and a motion of the ninth joint J<b>39</b> to rotate the shaft <b>43</b> in the circumferential direction about the central axis C. Additionally, when effecting the rotation of the shaft <b>43</b> in the circumferential direction about the central axis C, the controller <b>600</b> moves the arm body <b>30</b> and the ninth joint J<b>39</b> in such a manner as to meet the additional constraints described below.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In setting of the additional constraints, first, the arm controller <b>601</b> sets a reference point RD for each arm <b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the reference point RDB of the arm <b>3</b>B is located on a reference line RLB that is an extension of the rotation axis R<b>1</b> of the first joint J<b>31</b> of the arm <b>3</b>B. The reference point RDA of the arm <b>3</b>A is located on a reference line RLA (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) which is offset to one side (+ direction) from the rotation axis R<b>1</b> of the first joint J<b>31</b> of the arm <b>3</b>A in the first direction D<b>1</b> (the direction normal to the rotation axis R<b>1</b>). In this operation example, the first direction D<b>1</b> is a horizontal direction. Additionally, the first direction D<b>1</b> is parallel to the longitudinal direction of the arm base <b>5</b>. The reference point RDC of the arm <b>3</b>C is located on a reference line RLC which is offset to the other side (&#x2212; direction) from the rotation axis R<b>1</b> of the first joint J<b>31</b> of the arm <b>3</b>C in the first direction D<b>1</b>. The reference point RDD of the arm <b>3</b>D is located on a reference line RLD which is offset to the other side (&#x2212; direction) from the rotation axis R<b>1</b> of the first joint J<b>31</b> of the arm <b>3</b>D in the first direction D<b>1</b>. The offset distances of the reference lines RL of the arms <b>3</b> are set individually. This can reliably prevent each arm <b>3</b> from interfering with another component such as the adjacent arm <b>3</b> of the surgical system <b>100</b> or with the surrounding environment including the surgery assistant.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the arm controller <b>601</b> subsequently determines whether a length L of a perpendicular line vh drawn from the reference point RD to the central axis C of the shaft <b>43</b> assuming the target posture at the target position is smaller than a predetermined minimum length Lmin. Upon determining that the length of the perpendicular line vh is smaller than the minimum length Lmin, the arm controller <b>601</b> moves the reference point RD on the reference line RL in a direction away from the central axis C of the shaft <b>43</b> such that the length of the perpendicular line vh becomes greater than the predetermined length Lmin. The arm controller <b>601</b> does not perform this process in case that the length of the perpendicular line vh is determined to be greater than the minimum length Lmin. The arm controller <b>601</b> need not make the above determination, and may choose the location of the reference point RD on the reference line RL based on a continuous function defining the relationship between the length L of the perpendicular line vh and the location of the reference point RD on the reference line RL.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the arm controller <b>601</b> subsequently positions the joints J<b>31</b> to J<b>39</b> such that the reference plane RP passes through the reference point RD. As previously stated, the reference plane RP is a plane including the rotation axis R<b>9</b> of the ninth joint J<b>39</b> which extends in the long axis direction Dt and orthogonal to the rotation axis R<b>7</b> of the seventh joint J<b>37</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Thus, the postures of the translational motion unit <b>35</b> and tool base <b>45</b> are constrained such that the translational motion unit <b>35</b> and tool base <b>45</b> pivot about an axis line Rv connecting the reference point RD and the remote center RC. As such, when effecting rotation of the shaft <b>43</b> in the circumferential direction about the central axis C, the required proportion of rotation of the distal end of the arm body <b>30</b> in the circumferential direction about the central axis C can be reduced. Additionally, the proportion of rotation of the ninth joint J<b>39</b> can be increased for rotation of the shaft <b>43</b>. Thus, the translational motion unit <b>35</b> is located in a direction orthogonal to the seventh joint J<b>37</b>, and the arm controller <b>601</b> can place the arm <b>3</b> in a posture in which the translational motion unit <b>35</b> is located outside the seventh joint J<b>37</b> with respect to the reference point RD. This can prevent the translational motion unit <b>35</b> and tool base <b>45</b> from assuming a posture in which the translational motion unit <b>35</b> and tool base <b>45</b> protrude laterally (first direction D<b>1</b>) from the arm body <b>30</b>. As a result, interference of each arm <b>3</b> with another component such as the adjacent arm <b>3</b> of the surgical system <b>100</b> or with the surrounding environment can be prevented. Additionally, since the arm <b>3</b> can be placed in a posture in which the sixth link <b>86</b> of the arm body <b>30</b> is directed from the seventh joint J<b>37</b> towards the center of the arm <b>3</b>, the link length of the arm body <b>30</b> can be effectively utilized, and the movement range of the arm <b>3</b> can be extended. Furthermore, since the arms <b>3</b> are placed in such postures as to spread in a fan shape from the arm base body <b>50</b>, interference between the adjacent arms can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In a situation where, for example, the shaft <b>43</b> has pivoted upward about the remote center RC and moved towards the reference point RD as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the radius of rotation in the movement of the distal end of the arm body <b>30</b> about the central axis C could be small during rotation of the shaft <b>43</b> about the central axis C. As a result, the motion response of the arm body <b>30</b> could be excessively high, and the translational motion unit <b>35</b> and tool base <b>45</b> could be subjected to intense vibrations or suffer reduced responsivity due to rapid motion of the arm body <b>30</b>. However, upon determining that the length L of the perpendicular line vh is smaller than the minimum length Lmin, the arm controller <b>601</b> moves the reference point RD on the reference line RL such that the length of the perpendicular line vh becomes greater than the predetermined length Lmin. Thus, the radius of rotation in the movement of the distal end of the arm body <b>30</b> about the central axis C can be prevented from being small owing to the closeness of the shaft <b>43</b> to the reference point RD, and this can avoid excessively high motion response of the arm body <b>30</b>. In the case where the arm controller <b>601</b> chooses the location of the reference point RD on the reference line RL based on a continuous function defining the relationship between the length L of the perpendicular line vh and the location of the reference point RD on the reference line RL, the occurrence of excessively high motion response can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As described above, the arm controller <b>601</b> controls the arm <b>3</b> such that the shaft <b>43</b> of the surgical tool <b>40</b> assumes the target posture at the target position. Once a new target position and target posture are set, the arm controller <b>601</b> repeats the process starting from the determination of whether the length L of the perpendicular line vh is smaller than the predetermined minimum length Lmin.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a front view showing an example of the configuration of a surgical system <b>200</b> according to Embodiment 2.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">An arm mount <b>252</b> of the surgical system <b>200</b> according to Embodiment 2 is disposed to face the same side as a positioner mount <b>251</b> in the second direction D<b>2</b>.
