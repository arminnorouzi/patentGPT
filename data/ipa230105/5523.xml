A memory device has numerous memory cells. The memory device performs a write operation to store information in the memory cells, a read operation to read the stored information, and an erase operation to erase information (e.g., obsolete information) from some or all of the memory cells of the memory device. Memory cells in a memory device are usually organized in blocks. A memory device has access lines to access the blocks during a memory operation (e.g., read, write, or erase operation) and data lines to carry information (e.g., in the form of signals) to be stored in or read from the blocks. The memory device also has driver circuits to provide signals to circuit elements of the blocks and buffer circuitry to hold information received from or to be stored in memory cells of the blocks. In some conventional memory devices, the blocks are formed in a single deck. Device performance, device size, or both, are often candidates for improvement consideration in memory devices. However, as described in more details below, incorporating such improvements in some conventional memory devices (e.g., single-deck memory devices) may pose a challenge.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a block diagram of an apparatus in the form of a memory device, according to some embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of a portion of a memory device including decks of memory cells of a memory cell block, according to some embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of a portion of the memory device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> including details of a driver circuit of the memory device and associated conductive lines coupled to the driver circuit, according to some embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a structure of the memory device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> including some of the memory cell blocks of the memory device, according to some embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a side view (e.g., cross-sectional view) of a portion of the memory device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> including two memory cell blocks of the memory device, according to some embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows another perspective view of the memory device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> including locations of driver circuits and page buffer circuits of the memory device, according to some embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a side view of a structure of a portion of the memory device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> including more details of pillars and of memory cells of a memory cell block of the memory device, according to some embodiments described herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The techniques described herein include a memory device having multiple decks of memory cells.
