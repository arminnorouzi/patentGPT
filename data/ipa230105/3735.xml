It is an autoimmune disease in which the immune cells attack the myelin sheath causing its eventual breakdown around the nerve. As the nerves die, lesions that can be monitored by MRI may appear in the brain and spinal cord.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There is no cure for MS, but several disease-modifying therapies (DMT) exist that can decrease the severity of or delay disease relapses, with most acting through modulation of the immune system. In 2013, the FDA approved dimethyl fumarate (DMF) (Tecfidera&#xae;, Biogen Inc.) for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), and a formulation of DMF (Skilarence&#xae;, Almirall) was approved in 2017 in Europe for the treatment of psoriasis. Phase III trials have demonstrated that DMF can significantly reduce the rate of relapse, and MRI imaging of patients also suggests that it is neuroprotective, potentially increasing myelin density. While many MS therapies can slow disease progression, the fact that DMF may promote re-myelination is particularly exciting. Alternatives to DMF are also being developed, such as, but not limited to, BIIB098 (formerly ALKS 8700), a monomethyl fumarate (MMF) prodrug that is currently in Phase III clinical trials for RRMS.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">DMF is structurally related to the citric acid cycle metabolite fumarate. Fumarates have been shown to react directly with cysteine residues in proteins (known as protein succination) and to permanently modify them to affect a protein's structure or function. Specifically, the chemical modification of proteins by fumarate yields S-(2-succino)cysteine (2SC), which has been shown to increase in adipocytes under diabetic conditions, as well as in fumarase-deficient tumors where fumarate levels are endogenously elevated. Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) has been shown to be a direct target of DMF action (Linker 2011) through similar modification of cysteine residues. This DMF modification of KEAP1 stabilizes a transcription factor&#x2014;Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)&#x2014;that, in turn, activates an antioxidant response that increases the cellular capacity to respond to oxidative stress, which is a mediator of the beneficial response in MS patients.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Despite the documented benefits and the fact that Tecfidera&#xae; is reported to be the No. 1 prescribed pill for RRMS in the US, the drug still has a number of mild side effects (gastrointestinal discomfort, flushing), as well as a serious risk of lymphopenia (low lymphocyte counts). This reduction in white blood cells is associated with an increased risk of susceptibility to John Cunningham virus (JC virus) and to the development of the deadly brain infection progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Several deaths related to PML in patients being treated with DMF for RRMS have been reported to date. As a result, both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), have issued updated safety recommendations to minimize PML risk. In addition, the EMA recommends complete blood counts every 3 months to identify patients at risk. Presently, there is no suggested DMF cutoff other than careful monitoring in patients with lymphocyte blood counts lower than 0.5&#xd7;10<sup>9</sup>/L.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As increasing numbers of patients are treated with DMF for the modulation of RRMS or psoriasis, new reports indicate that current guidelines are insufficient to accurately monitor the risk for PML. There is currently no precise cut-off in white blood cell count that can inform clinicians when a patient should discontinue treatment with DMF or DMF alternatives such as MMF prodrugs. New tests that look at very specific populations of lymphocytes may be one option, but this is not standard clinical practice. Currently, there is no accurate way to assess a patient response to such therapy in order to know when therapy should be stopped.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">What are needed in the art are independent measures that assess the level of protein modification (e.g., succination) on a subject due to disease or disease treatment. For instance, a method that can assess the impact of DMF on a patient's immune cells/blood profile through determination of presence or level of protein modification due to the treatment could help the clinician determine when removal from DMF should be considered, if even for a short while. Any measurement that could allow more accurate monitoring would be of great benefit to patients wishing to utilize such a neuroprotective drug (versus other therapies that only slow progression by working on the immunomodulatory aspects of disease therapy).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Disclosed are methods for determining the protein modification level in a test sample, and in one embodiment, methods for determining the fumarate ester-derived succination level in a test sample. One method can include hydrolyzing proteins of a test sample. The test sample can be one that includes succination protein targets of interest. For instance, the sample can include white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets, total serum, urinary proteins, or a combination of sources of protein targets. A method can also include determining a quantity of modified cysteine (DMF-cysteine, MMF-cysteine, and/or 2SC) in the sample. A method can then include comparing this determined quantity to a control quantity of modified cysteine and, depending upon the comparison, determining that the subject should modify or alter a treatment program, e.g., discontinue treatment with DMF.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another embodiment, rather than hydrolyzing components of a sample, a method can include isolating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of a sample and enzymatically digesting the proteins of the PBMC. Following this, the digested product can be examined to determine the presence or quantity of modified peptides in the sample, the modified peptides including modified cysteine in the peptide sequence. In those embodiments in which the quantity of modified peptides is determined, a method can also include comparing this determined quantity to a control quantity of modified peptides, and depending upon this comparison, determining that a subject should alter a treatment program, e.g., discontinue treatment with DMF.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A full and enabling disclosure of the present subject matter, including the best mode thereof to one of ordinary skill in the art, is set forth more particularly in the remainder of the specification, including reference to the accompanying figures in which:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a table presenting peptide sequences (SEQ ID NO: 1-36) derived from proteins modified upon interaction of neural cells with DMF or its metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates mass spectrometry data of the modified peptide SEQ ID NO: 1 derived from Collapsin Response Mediator Protein 2 (CRMP2).</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Repeat use of reference characters in the present specification and drawings is intended to represent the same or analogous features or elements of the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, one or more examples of which are set forth below. Each embodiment is provided by way of explanation of the subject matter, not limitation thereof. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations may be made in the present disclosure without departing from the scope or spirit of the subject matter. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment may be used in another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In general, disclosed herein are methods for determining the protein modification level of a test sample. More specifically, disclosed methods are directed for examination of a test sample that includes proteins of interest so as to determine the presence or quantity of fumarate ester-derived modification of proteins of the subject. The proteins can include, for example, PBMC proteins (e.g., proteins of mononuclear blood cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, etc.) or serum proteins. The methods can be beneficially utilized, in one embodiment, for determination of excessive fumarate ester-derived modification (e.g., succination) of PBMC proteins, which can be utilized in prevention or early detection of lymphopenia. In those embodiments in which a subject is under treatment with DMF, for instance, in treatment of MS or other autoimmune disorders (e.g., psoriasis), the method can be utilized as a determination that treatment of the subject with DMF should be slowed or stopped.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The mode of action of DMF in treatment of MS is understood to be through the KEAP1/Nrf2 pathway. The disclosed method has been developed through realization that KEAP1 is not the only physiological target of DMF, and other targets including the nervous system, lymph system and/or plasma/serum/urinary/tissue proteins may be affected by the drug. For example, a specific cysteine residue on CRMP2 can be modified by DMF (specific mass spectrometry evidence of this is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). This cysteine is adjacent to several other serine/threonine residues that become phosphorylated as an axon retracts (degenerates) in the progress of MS.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the modification of this cysteine residue may prevent the phosphorylation of the adjacent residues and, thereby, may prevent the signal for axon degeneration, acting in a neuroprotective manner. An article (Morinaka et al. Sci Signaling 2011, 26:4(170):ra26) demonstrating that this cysteine needs to be oxidized prior to the phosphorylation signal supports this understanding (as succination by DMF would prevent oxidation).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition to being present in brain cells, CRMP2 is also present in lymphocytes and plays a role in their migration, e.g., in response to viral infections (see, e.g., Varrin-Doyer, et al. J Immunol. 2012 188:1222-33). Thus, the CRMP2 protein is involved in both neural motility and lymphocyte motility&#x2014;2 key cell types that are altered in MS disease progression. DMF modification of lymphocyte CRMP2 by succination may alter cell migration properties in response to, e.g., JC virus, and may enable the infection to develop in susceptible individuals.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Other proteins have also been found capable of being succinated or otherwise modified by fumarate esters. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> describes multiple different brain cell proteins and particular peptides modified by DMF/MMF, at least some of which also present in lymphocytes, blood cells, or other tissues, the modification of which could affect the immune response of an individual. Additional DMF-modified proteins have been described by others (see, e.g., Blewett, et al., Science Signaling, Vol. 9, Iss. 445, September 2016), at least some of which are present in lymphocytes, blood cells, or other tissues, the modification of which could affect the immune response of an individual. For instance, Kornberg et al. (Science. 2018 360:449-453) have demonstrated the specific succination of the protein GAPDH in isolated PBMCs from patients treated with DMF for 3 months, a protein that is also identified in DMF treated neurons in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Thus, in one embodiment, modification of specific proteins can be detected in isolated patient cells.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Disclosed methods can be beneficially utilized to determine the presence or quantity of succination of blood cell proteins and/or lymphocyte proteins and can be useful in determining potential immune system problems related to protein modification due to interaction with DMF and/or MMF. In particular, methods can be useful for monitoring DMF activity and potential lymphopenia or PML in individuals receiving a drug or prodrug. The disclosed methods can provide a more accurate measure of immune cell or protein susceptibility to excessive fumarate ester modification, as well as individual susceptibility to developing unwanted DMF side effects.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Protein modification can be measured in isolated lymphocytes or other white blood cells (e.g., peripheral blood mononuclear proteins), plasma proteins other than white blood cells, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, or other tissue samples (skin, biopsy material, tumor sample) derived from an individual. A quantified modification level beyond a control value in a subject under treatment with DMF or a prodrug therefore can indicate that the therapy should be slowed or temporarily halted to allow the immune cells time to recover, or alternatively, to be permanently halted in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">While disclosed methods may be of use with subjects under treatment with DMF or a prodrug, it should be understood that the methods are not limited to this application, and the examination of a sample for the presence or quantity of succinated proteins may be of use in other applications, for instance, in cancer patients with suspicious kidney tumors. Such applications could be utilized to determine a 2SC level due to causes other than DMF treatment. For instance, this approach could be useful in diagnosis and/or treatment of disease that demonstrates an endogenous increase in fumarate due to, e.g., tumor growth or metabolism change. By way of example, mitochondrial diseases appear to lead to increased succination in tissues, e.g., brain tissue as discussed by Piroli, et al. (Molecular &#x26; Cellular Proteomics, 2016, 15:445-61) for subjects suffering from Leigh Syndrome, and disclosed methods could be useful in diagnosis and/or treatment of such disease states.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The determination or quantification of succination of proteins in urine, blood, or other sample sources, e.g., lymphocyte protein succination, can be performed, in one embodiment, by use of isotope dilution mass spectrometry, e.g., using gas chromatograph mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (LC-MS). For instance, in one embodiment, the absolute quantification of succination (measured by GC-MS) according to methods as described previously (e.g., Alderson 2006, Nagai 2007, Piroli 2016) can be used to accurately measure the overall level of succination in tissue proteins, plasma proteins, and urine, among other sample sources.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, a sample as directly obtained can be examined for presence or quantity of succination. Alternatively, a sample as obtained can be pretreated, for instance, to isolate one or more components of the sample as obtained for examination of succination level. By way of example, a sample can be pretreated to isolate white blood cells of the sample, and this isolated portion of the sample can be examined for presence or quantity of succination.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, a total serum/plasma sample can be treated in order to precipitate the total protein, for example, using an agent that precipitates the protein. The precipitated proteins can then be collected, e.g., by centrifugation, for further analysis of all collected protein of a sample, including PBMC protein. This approach may be beneficial as this can allow for a desired delay from the time of sample collection to succination examination. For instance, serum samples could be frozen with protein extraction and examination for succination carried out at a later time.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to one embodiment, total succination quantification of a sample (or one or more components thereof), irrespective of particular proteins affected by the modification, can be carried out via hydrolysis of the proteins and determination of presence/quantity of modified cysteines in the sample. By way of example, whole cell sample (e.g., white blood cells isolated from a sample) or whole protein sample (e.g., total protein separated from a serum or urine sample) can be subjected to lysis. Following, protein from the whole cell or whole protein lysate can be used for analysis of 2SC. For instance, the protein can be precipitated (e.g., with an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid) to form a protein pellet, optionally with removal of other sample components such as lipids. The dried pellet can then be hydrolyzed, for instance, by hydrochloric acid (e.g., 6M HCl at 110&#xb0; C. for 24 hours) and dried (in vacuo). The hydrolyzed samples can be further separated (e.g., on C18 columns) to remove particulate matter and elute polar amino acids. N,O trifluoroacetyl methyl ester derivatives can be prepared and analyzed for succination by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) GC-MS/MS. The parent and daughter ion pairs monitored can include lysine m/z 180&#x3e;69, d8-lysine, m/z 188&#x3e;69; 2SC, m/z 284&#x3e;242, U-13C3,15N-2SC m/z 288&#x3e;246, or any other specific ions produced by fragmentation of the above products.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods (LC-MS) may be used to quantify total levels of 2SC. This approach does not require the preparation of the methyl ester derivatives. Instead, free 2SC levels can be detected by methods including, but not limited to, negative ion mode mass spectrometry, e.g., similar to methods used by Drusian et al. Cell Reports, 24:1093-1104.e6.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Quantification of modified cysteine in a sample including proteins can be performed, in one embodiment, by isotope dilution mass spectrometry based on standard curves constructed from mixtures of known amounts of heavy labeled and natural abundance standard. The amounts of all analytes can be normalized to the lysine content of the samples when detected simultaneously. They can also be normalized to the total protein content or the DNA content of the samples.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, a quantified sample can be compared to a control sample so as to determine undesirable cysteine modification levels of the test sample. For example, an acceptable modified cysteine range of a control can be developed from data obtained from a control group comprising individuals that are not under DMF treatment, individuals under DMF treatment with normal blood counts, individuals not suffering from the disease at issue (e.g., mitochondrial disease), or some other suitable standard. A finding that the modified cysteine level of a subjects falls outside of the control range by about 20% or more, or about 10% or more, in some embodiments, optionally examined in combination with a total lymphocyte count or a normalized value thereof, can lead to a determination that the individual has an undesirably high level of protein succination, and, in one embodiment, that DMF treatment should be modified.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">For instance, Table 1, below, presents protein succination levels of human blood leukocytes as determined via GC-MS analysis from samples obtained from individuals not under treatment with DMF or any prodrug.

In the absence of ester hydrolysis, there was limited detection of succinated proteins in rat primary neurons using the anti-2SC antibody, with only one band &#x2212;50 kDa showing a significant increase in intensity following 100 &#x3bc;M DMF treatment. This indicated that at least one or both of the methyl groups had not been removed by intracellular esterases and was preventing interaction with the anti-2SC antibody that recognizes the S-(2-succino)cysteine epitope. To ensure that the succinated proteins detected were solely of neuronal origin, N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells were differentiated to a neuronal phenotype (confirmed by increased synaptophysin content) and treated with DMF for 24 hours. The hydrolysis of the ester in the presence of KOH facilitated the detection of a large number of succinated proteins. Fibroblasts that had fumarase knocked down using a lentiviral mediated shRNA approach to increase endogenous fumarate levels were used as a positive control for succination. The intensity of succinated proteins in the DMF-treated neurons versus the positive control indicated that fumarate esters readily enter cells and react with a wide range of protein thiols. Both DMF and MMF are significantly more reactive than fumarate itself and are capable of modifying intracellular proteins before they are de-methylated. Since DMF is known to modify thiols in Keap1, leading to the induction of antioxidant response proteins such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), it was confirmed that DMF treatment significantly induced HO-1 expression.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0047">In order to identify the succinated proteins in DMF-treated neurons, LC-MS/MS was used and results were searched for the succination of protein thiols by either DMF (C<sup>DMF</sup>), or the demethylated metabolites MMF (C<sup>MMF</sup>) and fumarate (C<sup>2SC</sup>) This proteomic approach allows for confirmation of the exact sites of succination, which does not require the base hydrolysis of the ester that can also result in a partial loss of protein. As noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, all of the proteins identified were succinated by DMF or MMF rather than 2SC, suggesting that both of these fumarate esters reacted with intracellular proteins more rapidly than they could be converted to fumarate. In primary rat neurons, the identity of 4 succinated proteins was confirmed, and in N1E-115 neurons, a total of 15 protein subunits modified by either DMF or MMF was confirmed. Since the N1E-115 cultures were devoid of any glial cells that may be present in primary neuronal cultures, the identified proteins reflect true neuronal targets of fumarate ester modification. Since fumarate esters were previously shown to induce Nrf2 in glial cells in vivo (Linker 2011), additional protein targets of DMF-mediated succination in primary astrocyte cultures were also investigated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> presents the results, confirming the detection of 11 succinated protein subunits in primary rat astrocytes after 24 hours treatment with up to 100 &#x3bc;M DMF.
