Spring brake actuators are regularly connected to a service brake actuator and often act upon the same brake components which transmit the brake force to the vehicle wheel. Utilizing these two brake types together leads to the challenge of ensuring that only one of the brakes is activated at a time. This challenge is present because whenever one of the brakes, such as the parking brake, is activated, adding additional brake force by the second brake, such as the service brake, can potentially cause damage to the brake components. Activating the two brakes together is also called compounding.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To reduce brake forces in case of compounding, overpressure valves are used in modern brake systems. In spring brake actuators, for example, overpressure check valves are utilized, which are regularly arranged in the spring guide of the spring brake piston.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To retain such valves to the spring guide, a combination of a circlip and a plate is utilized. The circlip and plate help to retain the valve and also to ensure that air may pass through the retaining components and reach the valve.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are, however, certain drawbacks associated with this solution. First of all, it has been found that the assembly of the two parts is rather difficult and time-consuming as these parts need to be assembled in the correct order, correct orientation, and they need to be centered within an accommodation space of the spring guide. Furthermore, the airflow through the circlip/plate combination has been found to be uneven and a turbulent airflow may be generated, which is generally unwanted.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Consequently, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide a spring brake actuator having a retaining device that is easier and faster to assemble and that improves the airflow characteristics through the device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure attains this object by providing a retaining device for retaining the valve, the retaining device comprising a basic body and clamping members for clamping the device to a spring guide. In particular, the present disclosure attains this object in one embodiment where the clamping members are arranged at the basic body and along a circumference of the basic body and wherein the clamping members are spaced apart from each other forming slits between the clamping members to allow for a circulation of air through the slits.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, the actuator includes a cylinder housing comprising a cylinder housing base, a spring brake piston located in said cylinder housing for applying a braking force, a spring guide being attached to the spring brake piston and a compression spring located between the cylinder housing base and the spring guide of the spring brake piston, said compression spring being effective to push the spring brake piston away from the base, wherein the spring guide includes a valve and a retaining device for retaining the valve, the retaining device including a basic body and clamping members for clamping the device to a spring guide.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure is based on the finding that by combining the basic body and the clamping members into one component, the likelihood of erroneous assemblies can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, the design, according to an aspect of the disclosure, allows for a self-centering capability of the retaining device in the accommodation space of the spring guide. Additionally, the slits allow for an increased and even airflow through the retaining device towards the valve. Based on the number, geometry, and width of the slits between the clamping members, the airflow characteristics may be influenced individually depending on the valve type and the assembly conditions.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a preferred embodiment, the basic body has a shape of a disc. With the help of this disc shape, the retaining surface of the retaining device is increased while the basic body at the same time provides enough stability to securely retain the valve.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to yet another embodiment, the retaining device includes a circular groove arranged circumferentially around a longitudinal axis of the basic body. This groove has been found to be beneficial to facilitate the clamping functionality of the clamping members as the groove provides room into which the clamping members may be bent when the retaining device is assembled into the accommodation space of the spring guide.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a preferred embodiment, the circular groove is V-shaped. This shape has been found to be beneficial to maintain the stability of the retaining device while at the same time providing enough room for the clamping members to bend to the inside when the retaining device is assembled.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the retaining device has a first side and a second side, the second side being arranged axially opposite of the first side, wherein the circular groove is arranged at the first side, only. This ensures that at the second side, which is preferably used to retain the valve, the retaining surface is maximized. On the other hand, on the first side, which is preferably the air inlet side of the retaining device, enough room is provided for the clamping members to bend inwardly when assembled without closing the slits between the clamping members.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a preferred embodiment, the clamping members extend diagonally outwards from the basic body in an angle of 1&#xb0;-60&#xb0; relative to the longitudinal axis, preferably 25&#xb0;-40&#xb0;. By designing the clamping members in a way that they extend diagonally outwards from the basic body, the retaining device may be clamped securely into an accommodation space. This diagonal extension helps to ensure that the valve is kept in place during operation. Furthermore, the retaining device may be easily assembled and dissembled while the clamping members help to center the retaining device in the accommodation space.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In yet another preferred embodiment, the clamping members are integrally formed with the basic body. In other words, it is preferred that the clamping members and the basic body are manufactured as one piece. This not only reduces manufacturing costs but also ensures a lower part-complexity.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, it is preferred that the basic body includes 5-20 clamping members, preferably 8 clamping members. This number of clamping members has been found to be beneficial to ensure that the retaining device may be securely fixed in an accommodation space, center itself, and provide a reasonable airflow through the device while the complexity of the device is kept low.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a preferred embodiment, the slits between the spaced apart clamping members have a width of 0.3-2 mm, preferably 0.7 mm. This dimensioning of the slits has been found to facilitate a sufficient and mostly unturbulent airflow through the valve. Furthermore, the slits support the bending capabilities of the clamping members, facilitating the assembly of the retaining device in the accommodation space.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In yet another preferred embodiment the basic body has a thickness t<sub>b </sub>of 0.5 mm-2 mm, preferably 1 mm. This thickness keeps the dimensions of the retaining device low and ensures that the retaining device may be utilized in accommodation spaces in which the room available for the accommodation of the retaining device is limited.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, it is preferred that the clamping members include a circular shoulder for positioning the retaining device in a spring guide. Such a circular shoulder ensures that the retaining device may be properly secured to an accommodation space that also preferably has a corresponding shoulder. This correspondence helps to ensure that the valve is safely retained with respect to the spring guide.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In yet another preferred embodiment, the retaining device is partially or completely made of plastic material, sheet metal, or a combination of the above. Preferably, the plastic material is a crystalline or semi crystalline plastic material, particularly preferred polypropylene terephtalate (PPT), polyamide (PA), polyoxymethylene (POM), polyphthalamide (PPA), or polypropylene (PP). It is furthermore preferred that the sheet metal is steel, a steel alloy, aluminum, or an aluminum alloy. This selection of materials has been found to be beneficial for the proposed application of the retaining device.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a preferred embodiment, the retaining device is fitted to the spring guide by at least one of the following: press fit, snap fit, threaded fastening, adhesive bonding, shrink fitting, and wobbles riveting. These different ways of fitting the retaining device to the spring guide have been found to be beneficial for various applications of the retaining device at vehicle brakes.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a further aspect, the present disclosure also relates to a retaining device for retaining a valve, the retaining device comprising a basic body and clamping members for clamping the device to a spring guide.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to this further aspect, the clamping members are arranged at the basic body and along a circumference of the basic body, wherein the clamping means are spaced apart from each other forming slits between the clamping members to allow for a circulation of air through the slits. The retaining device takes advantage of the same benefits and preferred embodiments as the spring brake actuator comprising such a retaining device according to the present disclosure. In this regard, reference is made to the above explanations and their content is included herein.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For a more complete understanding of the present disclosure, the present disclosure will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">This present disclosure will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example and not by way of limitation, one of several possible embodiments of the brake actuator proposed herein, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a sectional view of a spring brake actuator according to an aspect of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an enlarged sectional view of the spring brake actuator according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> showing a retaining device according to an aspect of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of one side of the retaining device according to an aspect of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of another side of the retaining according to an aspect of the disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a sectional view of the retaining device according to an aspect of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional schematic view of a spring brake actuator <b>2</b>. The spring brake actuator <b>2</b> includes a cylinder housing <b>4</b>. Inside the cylinder housing <b>4</b>, a compression spring <b>8</b> and a pressure chamber <b>23</b> are arranged. The compression spring <b>8</b> rests on the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> against a cylinder housing base <b>6</b> and on the opposite side on a spring guide <b>12</b> of a spring brake piston <b>10</b>.

The release bolt <b>29</b> is utilized to release the spring brake actuator <b>2</b> in case of malfunctions, for example. The spring brake actuator <b>2</b> moreover includes a flange <b>18</b> which is utilized to connect a service brake <b>27</b> to the spring brake actuator <b>2</b>.
