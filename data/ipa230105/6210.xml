which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method of preparing a lithium metal electrode and a lithium metal secondary battery which includes the electrode prepared by the above preparation method.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A lithium secondary battery is typically composed of a positive electrode, a negative electrode, a separator disposed therebetween, and an electrolyte. Recently, development of a lithium metal secondary battery using lithium metal itself, an active material, as a negative electrode capable of obtaining high energy density has been made as the demand for a high-capacity secondary battery increases.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The lithium metal secondary battery is a secondary battery using lithium metal or a lithium alloy as a negative electrode, wherein the lithium metal secondary battery, for example, includes a lithium-metal oxide battery, a lithium-sulfur battery, or a lithium-air battery. With respect to the lithium metal, since density is low at 0.54 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and a standard reduction potential is also very low at &#x2212;3.045 V(SHE: based on a standard hydrogen electrode), it has received the most attention as an electrode material for a high energy density battery.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, unlike a conventional lithium ion secondary battery, the lithium metal secondary battery is charged while the lithium metal of the negative electrode is plated, and is discharged while the lithium metal is stripped, wherein lithium dendrite growth occurs during charge, and, as a result, since a short circuit in the battery may occur and a surface area of the electrode is increased to also increase a side reaction with an electrolyte solution, life characteristics and stability of the battery may be rapidly degraded. Thus, in order to commercialize a lithium metal electrode, there is a need to develop a technique for stabilizing the lithium metal electrode and suppressing dendrites.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The lithium metal electrode is generally prepared by rolling a lithium metal strip with a rolling roll. The rolling rolls are mostly prepared from a metallic material to ensure rigidity and durability, wherein lithium metal has a property of strongly adhering to most metals only by simple contact. Thus, it is essential to use a lubricant to prevent adhesion between the rolling roll and lithium during the preparation of the lithium metal electrode.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication No. 1998-058007 (Patent Document 1) discloses a method of preparing a lithium metal foil by using a chain saturated hydrocarbon having 8 or more carbon atoms as a lubricant. However, the chain saturated hydrocarbon lubricant having 8 or more carbon atoms has a problem in that handling is difficult due to its high flammability and it is very harmful to the human body.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also, Korean Patent Application Laid-open Publication No. 10-2016-0142350 (Patent Document 2) discloses a method of preparing a lithium metal film by using a lubricant composition including a polymer having a specific structure. However, the lubricant composition also has a problem in that an aromatic or hydrocarbon having very high flammability and harmfulness to the human body is used as a solvent.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, in a case in which the lubricant composition of Patent Document 2 is used, a passivation layer including LiCO<sub>3</sub>, Li<sub>2</sub>O, and LiOH is formed on a surface of the lithium metal film, wherein there is a limitation in that the above components form dendrites and dead lithium (Li) by continuously reacting with an electrolyte solution through breakage due to non-uniform plating/stripping of lithium during continuous charge and discharge and the resulting volume change.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An aspect of the present invention provides a method of preparing a lithium metal electrode which is not harmful to the human body and the environment and may effectively suppress dendrite formation due to a reaction with an electrolyte solution by forming a stable protective layer on a surface of the lithium metal electrode.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another aspect of the present invention provides a lithium metal secondary battery in which resistance characteristics and life characteristics are excellent by including the lithium metal electrode prepared by the above-described method.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of preparing a lithium metal electrode which includes the steps of: providing a lithium metal strip; and providing a lubricant composition including a fluorine-based solvent and a fluorine-based compound on the lithium metal strip and rolling the lithium metal strip.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In this case, the fluorine-based solvent may have a boiling point of 150&#xb0; C. or less, preferably 50&#xb0; C. to 130&#xb0; C., and more preferably 80&#xb0; C. to 120&#xb0; C., and may have a vapor pressure of 0.1 kPa to 30 kPa, preferably 1 kPa to 20 kPa, and more preferably 2 kPa to 10 kPa.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Specifically, the fluorine-based solvent may be a compound represented by [Formula 1].</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">[Formula 1]</p><p id="p-0017" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>CF<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;O&#x2014;[CF(CF<sub>3</sub>)&#x2014;CF<sub>2</sub>O]<sub>x</sub>&#x2014;[CF<sub>2</sub>O]<sub>y</sub>&#x2014;CF<sub>3 </sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">In Formula 1, x and y are each independently an integer of 1 to 20.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">The fluorine-based compound may be an oligomer or polymer having a weight-average molecular weight of 100 g/mol to 100,000 g/mol, for example, 2,000 g/mol to 20,000 g/mol, and, specifically, may be an oligomer or polymer including a unit represented by [Formula 2].</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">[Formula 2]</p><p id="p-0021" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>*-[CF<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;O]<sub>m</sub>&#x2014;[CF<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CF<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;O]<sub>n</sub>&#x2014;*<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0022" num="0019">In Formula 2, m to n are each independently an integer of 1 to 100.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0020">The lubricant composition may include 90 wt % to 99 wt % of the fluorine-based solvent and 1 wt % to 10 wt % of the fluorine-based compound.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0021">Also, the lubricant composition may have a viscosity of 0.5 cp to 100 cp.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0022">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a lithium metal electrode which is prepared by the above-described method, and includes a lithium metal thin film; and a protective layer formed on the lithium metal thin film, wherein the protective layer contains LiF.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0023">In this case, the LiF may be formed by a reaction between a lithium metal and a fluorine atom in the lubricant composition during a rolling process. Also, the protective layer may include the LiF in an amount of 0.1 wt % to 10 wt %, and may have a thickness of 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0024">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a lithium metal battery including a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and an electrolyte, wherein the lithium metal battery includes the above-described lithium metal electrode of the present invention as the negative electrode.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0025">According to a method of preparing a lithium metal electrode of the present invention, lithium and fluorine contained in a lubricant react during rolling to form a protective layer containing LiF on a surface of the lithium metal electrode. In a case in which the protective layer containing LiF is formed on the surface of the lithium metal electrode, an increase in resistance and a decrease in life characteristics due to a side reaction between lithium metal and an electrolyte solution may be effectively suppressed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0026">Also, a fluorine-based solvent and a fluorine-based compound, which are used in the present invention, have excellent process stability due to low flammability and toxicity.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0027">Furthermore, according to the method of preparing a lithium metal electrode of the present invention, since the protective layer is formed during the rolling process, a separate coating process for forming the protective layer is not required, and thus, processability and economic efficiency are excellent.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0028">In addition, since the method of preparing a lithium metal electrode of the present invention does not require a separate process for drying by using a high volatile solvent with a boiling point of 150&#xb0; C. or less and a vapor pressure of 0.1 kPa to 30 kPa as the fluorine-based solvent, processability is excellent.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0029">Since the lithium metal electrode prepared according to the method of the present invention includes the protective layer containing LiF on its surface and the LiF, unlike components such as LiCO<sub>3</sub>, Li<sub>2</sub>O, and LiOH, is not easily decomposed during battery charge and discharge, a stabilization effect of the lithium metal electrode is excellent. Thus, in a case in which the lithium metal electrode prepared according to the method of the present invention is used, a lithium metal battery having excellent life characteristics may be prepared.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view for explaining a method of preparing a lithium metal electrode according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a graph illustrating the results of measuring life characteristics according to Experimental Example 1;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a view illustrating the results of evaluating initial resistance characteristics according to Experimental Example 2; and</p><p id="p-0036" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a view illustrating the results of evaluating initial resistance characteristics after 48 hours according to Experimental Example 2.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0034">It will be understood that words or terms used in the specification and claims shall not be interpreted as the meaning defined in commonly used dictionaries, and it will be further understood that the words or terms should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and the technical idea of the invention, based on the principle that an inventor may properly define the meaning of the words or terms to best explain the invention.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0035">The terms used in the present specification are used to merely describe exemplary embodiments, but are not intended to limit the invention.
