id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Provided herein are variant adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid proteins having one or more modifications in amino acid sequence relative to a parental AAV capsid protein, which, when present in an AAV virion, confer increased infectivity of one or more types of retinal cells as compared to the infectivity of the retinal cells by an AAV virion comprising the unmodified parental AAV capsid protein. Also provided are recombinant AAV virions and pharmaceutical compositions thereof comprising a variant AAV capsid protein as described herein, methods of making these rAAV capsid proteins and virions, and methods for using these rAAV capsid proteins and virions in research and clinical practice, for example in, e.g., the delivery of nucleic acid sequences to one or more ceils of the retina for the treatment of retinal disorders and diseases.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="114.64mm" wi="158.75mm"

Listing is provided herewith as a text file, &#x201c;0904005020US014DSeqListST25.txt&#x201d; created on May 16, 2022 and having a size of 198 KB. The contents of the text file are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention disclosed herein relates generally to the field of adeno-associated virus (AAV) virions comprising variant capsid proteins and the generation of such variant capsids using directed evolution techniques.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Inherited retinal diseases encompass a large group of heterogenous genetic diseases that affect approximately 1 in 3000 people (greater than 2 million people worldwide) and are a major source of severe vision loss or blindness. Complex, multifactoral retinal diseases such as wet age related macular degeneration (wAMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) impact even more individuals, with 1.7 million Americans currently living with severe central vision loss associated with wAMD and almost one-third of adults over age 40 years with diabetes being visually impaired. These diseases are typically associated with the dysfunction or death of one or more types of cell of the retina, in some instances due to the absence of expression or function of a key protein, e.g. RPE65 in LCA2, in other instances due to gene mutations that create toxic gene products, e.g. dominant mutations that affect rhodopsin protein folding, or in yet other instances due to changes in retinal physiology induced by the ectopic expression of a protein, e.g. VEGF in wAMD.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One approach to addressing this great unmedical need is gene-based adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated therapy, in which a recombinant adeno associated virus (rAAV) is used to deliver a gene to one or more types of cells in the retina, for example to replace a missing gene, to correct a dominant defective gene, or to provide a template for continuous protein therapy. While AAV-based clinical gene therapy has been increasingly successful, it is still fraught with shortcomings with regard to viral vector properties, including, for example, targeting the desired cells of the retina with high efficiency. For example, multiple homologous primate AAV serotypes and numerous nonhuman primate serotypes have been identified and characterized, with AAV2 being the best characterized among the AAV serotypes and the first to be adapted as a gene delivery vehicle in the eye. However, these AAVs (including AAV2) have not been reported to be effective at transducing the deeper cell types of the retina when delivered via intravitreal administration. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for new AAV variants with superior transduction capabilities that will provide for more effective gene-based delivery to the cells of the retina for the treatment of ocular disease. There is a need in the art for such AAV variants which exhibit an enhanced retinal transduction profile&#x2014;in some instances broadly, in other instances preferentially to certain retinal cell types&#x2014;as compared to wild-type AAVs and AAV variants as known in the art.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Naturally occurring AAV is a single stranded DNA virus that contains three open reading frames, rep, cap, and aap. The first gene, rep, encodes four proteins necessary for genome replication (Rep78, Rep68, Rep52, and Rep40), the second, cap, expresses three structural proteins (VP1-3) that assemble to form the viral capsid, and the third expresses the assembly activating protein (AAP) that is essential for capsid assembly. AAV is dependent upon the presence of a helper virus, such as an adenovirus or herpesvirus, for active replication. In the absence of a helper virus, AAV establishes a latent state in which its genome is maintained episomally or integrated into the host chromosome in the AAVS1 locus.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In vitro and in vivo-directed evolution techniques may be used to select for AAV variants that offer an improvement over current AAV-based gene delivery vectors. Such directed evolution techniques are known in the art and described, e.g., in PCT publication WO 2014/194132 and Kotterman &#x26; Schaffer (Nature Review Genetics, AOP, published online 20 May 2014; doi: 10.1038/nrg3742), both of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. Directed evolution is a capsid engineering approach that emulates natural evolution through iterative rounds of genetic diversification and selection processes, thereby enabling the accumulation of beneficial mutations that progressively improve the function of a biomolecule such as an AAV-based virion. In this approach, wild-type AAV cap genes are diversified to create large genetic libraries that are packaged to generate libraries of viral particles, and selective pressure is applied to isolate unique variants with superior phenotypes that can overcome gene delivery barriers.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">AAV variants have been disclosed in, for example, in U.S. Pat.

The genome contains three open reading frames (ORF) flanked by inverted terminal repeats (ITR) that function as the viral origin of replication and packaging signal. The rep ORF encodes four nonstructural proteins that play roles in viral replication, transcriptional regulation, site-specific integration, and virion assembly. The cap ORF encodes three structural proteins (VP 1-3) that assemble to form a 60-mer viral capsid. Finally, an ORF present as an alternate reading frame within the cap gene produces the assembly-activating protein (AAP), a viral protein that localizes AAV capsid proteins to the nucleolus and functions in the capsid assembly process.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">There are several naturally occurring (&#x201c;wild-type&#x201d;) serotypes and over 100 known variants of AAV, each of which differs in amino acid sequence, particularly within the hypervariable regions of the capsid proteins, and thus in their gene delivery properties. No AAV has been associated with any human disease, making recombinant AAV attractive for clinical applications.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For the purposes of the disclosure herein, the terminology &#x201c;AAV&#x201d; is an abbreviation for adeno-associated virus, including, without limitation, the virus itself and derivatives thereof. Except where otherwise indicated, the terminology refers to all subtypes or serotypes and both replication-competent and recombinant forms. The term &#x201c;AAV&#x201d; includes, without limitation, AAV type 1 (AAV-1 or AAV1), AAV type 2 (AAV-2 or AAV2), AAV type 3A (AAV-3A or AAV3A), AAV type 3B (AAV-3B or AAV3B), AAV type 4 (AAV-4 or AAV4), AAV type 5 (AAV-5 or AAV5), AAV type 6 (AAV-6 or AAV6), AAV type 7 (AAV-7 or AAV7), AAV type 8 (AAV-8 or AAV8), AAV type 9 (AAV-9 or AAV9), AAV type 10 (AAV-10 or AAV10 or AAVrh10), avian AAV, bovine AAV, canine AAV, caprine AAV, equine AAV, primate AAV, non-primate AAV, and ovine AAV. &#x201c;Primate AAV&#x201d; refers to AAV that infect primates, &#x201c;non-primate AAV&#x201d; refers to AAV that infect non-primate mammals, &#x201c;bovine AAV&#x201d; refers to AAV that infect bovine mammals, etc.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The genomic sequences of various serotypes of AAV, as well as the sequences of the native terminal repeats (TRs), Rep proteins, and capsid subunits are known in the art.

The terms &#x201c;variant AAV capsid protein&#x201d; or &#x201c;AAV variant&#x2019; refer to an AAV capsid protein comprising an amino acid sequence that includes at least one modification or substitution (including deletion, insertion, point mutation, etc.) relative to a naturally existing or &#x201c;wild-type&#x201d; AAV capsid protein sequences, e.g. as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1-12 herein. A variant AAV capsid protein may have about 80% identity or more to the amino acid sequence of a wild type capsid protein, for example, 85% identity or more, 90% identity or more, or 95% identity or more to the amino acid sequence of the wild type capsid protein, for example, 98% or 99% identity to the wild type capsid protein. A variant AAV capsid protein may not be a wild type capsid protein.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For the purposes of the disclosure herein, &#x201c;AAV virion&#x201d; or &#x201c;AAV viral particle&#x201d; refers to a viral particle composed of at least one AAV capsid protein and an encapsidated AAV polynucleotide.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For the purposes of the disclosure herein, the terminology &#x201c;rAAV&#x201d; is an abbreviation that refers to recombinant adeno-associated virus. &#x201c;Recombinant,&#x201d; as applied to a polynucleotide means that the polynucleotide is the product of various combinations of cloning, restriction or ligation steps, and other procedures that result in a construct that is distinct from a polynucleotide found in nature. A recombinant virus is a viral particle comprising a recombinant polynucleotide. The terms respectively include replicates of the original polynucleotide construct and progeny of the original virus construct.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The term &#x201c;rAAV vector&#x201d; encompasses rAAV virions (i.e., rAAV viral particles) (e.g., an infectious rAAV virion), which by definition include an rAAV polynucleotide; and also encompasses polynucleotides encoding rAAV (e.g., a single stranded polynucleotide encoding rAAV (ss-rAAV); a double stranded polynucleotide encoding rAAV (ds-rAAV), e.g., plasmids encoding rAAV; and the like).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">If an AAV virion comprises a heterologous polynucleotide (i.e. a polynucleotide other than a wild-type AAV genome, e.g., a transgene to be delivered to a target cell, an RNAi agent or CRISPR agent to be delivered to a target cell, etc.), it is typically referred to as a &#x201c;recombinant AAV (rAAV) virion&#x201d; or an &#x201c;rAAV viral particle.&#x201d; In general, the heterologous polynucleotide is flanked by at least one, and generally by two, AAV inverted terminal repeat sequences (ITRs).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The term &#x201c;packaging&#x201d; refers to a series of intracellular events that result in the assembly and encapsidation of an AAV particle. AAV &#x201c;rep&#x201d; and &#x201c;cap&#x201d; genes refer to polynucleotide sequences encoding replication and encapsidation proteins of adeno-associated virus. AAV rep and cap are referred to herein as AAV &#x201c;packaging genes.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The terminology &#x201c;helper virus&#x201d; for AAV refers to a virus that allows AAV (e.g. wild-type AAV) to be replicated and packaged by a mammalian cell. A variety of such helper viruses for AAV are known in the art, including adenoviruses, herpesviruses and poxviruses such as vaccinia. The adenoviruses encompass a number of different subgroups, although Adenovirus type 5 of subgroup C is most commonly used. Numerous adenoviruses of human, non-human mammalian and avian origin are known and available from depositories such as the ATCC. Viruses of the herpes family include, for example, herpes simplex viruses (HSV) and Epstein-Barr viruses (EBV), as well as cytomegaloviruses (CMV) and pseudorabies viruses (PRV); which are also available from depositories such as ATCC.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The terminology &#x201c;helper virus function(s)&#x201d; refers to function(s) encoded in a helper virus genome which allow AAV replication and packaging (in conjunction with other requirements for replication and packaging described herein). As described herein, &#x201c;helper virus function&#x201d; may be provided in a number of ways, including by providing helper virus or providing, for example, polynucleotide sequences encoding the requisite function(s) to a producer cell in trans. For example, a plasmid or other expression vector comprising nucleotide sequences encoding one or more adenoviral proteins is transfected into a producer cell along with an rAAV vector.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The terminology &#x201c;infectious&#x201d; virus or viral particle is one that comprises a competently assembled viral capsid and is capable of delivering a polynucleotide component into a cell for which the viral species is tropic. The term does not necessarily imply any replication capacity of the virus. Assays for counting infectious viral particles are described elsewhere in this disclosure and in the art. Viral infectivity can be expressed as the ratio of infectious viral particles to total viral particles. Methods of determining the ratio of infectious viral particle to total viral particle are known in the art. See, e.g., Grainger et al. (2005) Mol. Ther. 11: S337 (describing a TCID50 infectious titer assay); and Zolotukhin et al. (1999) Gene Ther. 6:973. See also the Examples.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The term &#x201c;tropism&#x201d; as used herein refers to the preferential targeting by a virus (e.g., an AAV) of cells of a particular host species or of particular cell types within a host species. For example, a virus that can infect cells of the heart, lung, liver, and muscle has a broader (i.e., increased) tropism relative to a virus that can infect only lung and muscle cells. Tropism can also include the dependence of a virus on particular types of cell surface molecules of the host. For example, some viruses can infect only cells with surface glycosaminoglycans, while other viruses can infect only cells with sialic acid (such dependencies can be tested using various cells lines deficient in particular classes of molecules as potential host cells for viral infection). In some cases, the tropism of a virus describes the virus's relative preferences. For example, a first virus may be able to infect all cell types but is much more successful in infecting those cells with surface glycosaminoglycans. A second virus can be considered to have a similar (or identical) tropism as the first virus if the second virus also prefers the same characteristics (e.g., the second virus is also more successful in infecting those cells with surface glycosaminoglycans), even if the absolute transduction efficiencies are not similar. For example, the second virus might be more efficient than the first virus at infecting every given cell type tested, but if the relative preferences are similar (or identical), the second virus can still be considered to have a similar (or identical) tropism as the first virus. In some embodiments, the tropism of a virion comprising a subject variant AAV capsid protein is not altered relative to a naturally occurring virion. In some embodiments, the tropism of a virion comprising a subject variant AAV capsid protein is expanded (i.e., broadened) relative to a naturally occurring virion. In some embodiments, the tropism of a virion comprising a subject variant AAV capsid protein is reduced relative to a naturally occurring virion.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The terminology &#x201c;replication-competent&#x201d; virus (e.g. a replication-competent AAV) refers to a phenotypically wild-type virus that is infectious, and is also capable of being replicated in an infected cell (i.e. in the presence of a helper virus or helper virus functions). In the case of AAV, replication competence generally requires the presence of functional AAV packaging genes. In general, rAAV vectors as described herein are replication-incompetent in mammalian cells (especially in human cells) by virtue of the lack of one or more AAV packaging genes. Typically, such rAAV vectors lack any AAV packaging gene sequences in order to minimize the possibility that replication competent AAV are generated by recombination between AAV packaging genes and an incoming rAAV vector. In many embodiments, rAAV vector preparations as described herein are those which contain few if any replication competent AAV (rcAAV, also referred to as RCA) (e.g., less than about 1 rcAAV per 10<sup>2 </sup>rAAV particles, less than about 1 rcAAV per 10<sup>4 </sup>rAAV particles, less than about 1 rcAAV per 10 rAAV particles, less than about 1 rcAAV per 10<sup>12 </sup>rAAV particles, or no rcAAV).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The term &#x201c;polynucleotide&#x201d; refers to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, including deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides, or analogs thereof. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and nucleotide analogs, and may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. If present, modifications to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The term polynucleotide, as used herein, refers interchangeably to double- and single-stranded molecules. Unless otherwise specified or required, any embodiment herein that comprises a polynucleotide encompasses both the double-stranded form and each of two complementary single-stranded forms known or predicted to make up the double-stranded form.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">A polynucleotide or polypeptide has a certain percent &#x201c;sequence identity&#x201d; to another polynucleotide or polypeptide, meaning that, when aligned, that percentage of bases or amino acids are the same when comparing the two sequences. Sequence similarity can be determined in a number of different manners. To determine sequence identity, sequences can be aligned using the methods and computer programs, including BLAST, available over the world wide web at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/. Another alignment algorithm is FASTA, available in the Genetics Computing Group (GCG) package, from Madison, Wis., USA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Oxford Molecular Group, Inc. Other techniques for alignment are described in Methods in Enzymology, vol. 266: Computer Methods for Macromolecular Sequence Analysis (1996), ed. Doolittle, Academic Press, Inc., a division of Harcourt Brace &#x26; Co., San Diego, Calif., USA. Of particular interest are alignment programs that permit gaps in the sequence. The Smith-Waterman is one type of algorithm that permits gaps in sequence alignments. See Meth. Mol. Biol. 70: 173-187 (1997). Also, the GAP program using the Needleman and Wunsch alignment method can be utilized to align sequences. See J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453 (1970).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The term &#x201c;gene&#x201d; refers to a polynucleotide that performs a function of some kind in the cell. For example, a gene can contain an open reading frame that is capable of encoding a gene product. One example of a gene product is a protein, which is transcribed and translated from the gene. Another example of a gene product is an RNA, e.g. a functional RNA product, e.g., an aptamer, an interfering RNA, a ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a transfer RNA (tRNA), a non-coding RNA (ncRNA), a guide RNA for nucleases, etc., which is transcribed but not translated.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The terminology &#x201c;gene expression product&#x201d; or &#x201c;gene product&#x201d; is a molecule resulting from expression of a particular gene, as defined above. Gene expression products include, e.g., a polypeptide, an aptamer, an interfering RNA, a messenger RNA (mRNA), an rRNA, a tRNA, a non-coding RNA (ncRNA), and the like.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The term &#x201c;siRNA agent&#x201d; (&#x201c;small interfering&#x201d; or &#x201c;short interfering RNA&#x201d; (or siRNA)) is an RNA duplex of nucleotides that is targeted to a gene interest (a &#x201c;target gene&#x201d;). An &#x201c;RNA duplex&#x201d; refers to the structure formed by the complementary pairing between two regions of a RNA molecule, forming a region of double stranded RNA (dsRNA). siRNA is &#x201c;targeted&#x201d; to a gene in that the nucleotide sequence of the duplex portion of the siRNA is complementary to a nucleotide sequence of the targeted gene. In some embodiments, the length of the duplex of siRNAs is less than 30 nucleotides. In some embodiments, the duplex can be 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11 or 10 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the length of the duplex is 19-25 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, siRNA-mediated gene targeting is accomplished through the use of DNA-directed RNA interference (ddRNAi) which is a gene-silencing technique that utilizes DNA constructs to activate an animal cell's endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) pathways. Such DNA constructs are designed to express self-complementary double-stranded RNAs, typically short-hairpin RNAs (shRNA), that once processed bring about silencing of a target gene or genes. Any RNA, including endogenous mRNAs or viral RNAs, can be silenced by designing constructs to express double-stranded RNA complementary to the desired mRNA target. As such, the RNA duplex portion of an siRNA agent can be part of a short hairpin structure referred to as shRNA. In addition to the duplex portion, the hairpin structure may contain a loop portion positioned between the two sequences that form the duplex. The loop can vary in length. In some embodiments the loop is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 or 13 nucleotides in length. The hairpin structure can also contain 3&#x2032; or 5&#x2032; overhang portions. In some embodiments, the overhang is a 3&#x2032; or a 5&#x2032; overhang 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 nucleotides in length. In general, the level of expression product (e.g., mRNA, polypeptide, etc.) of a target gene is reduced by an siRNA agent (e.g., an siRNA, an shRNA, etc.) that contains specific double stranded nucleotide sequences that are complementary to at least a 19-25 nucleotide long segment (e.g., a 20-21 nucleotide sequence) of the target gene transcript, including the 5&#x2032; untranslated (UT) region, the ORF, or the 3&#x2032; UT region. In some embodiments, short interfering RNAs are about 19-25nt in length. See, e.g., PCT applications WOO/44895, WO99/32619, WO01/75164, WO01/92513, WO01/29058, WO01/89304, WO02/16620, and WO02/29858; and U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040023390 for descriptions of siRNA technology. The siRNA and/or shRNA can be encoded by a nucleic acid sequence, and the nucleic acid sequence can also include a promoter. The nucleic acid sequence can also include a polyadenylation signal. In some embodiments, the polyadenylation signal is a synthetic minimal polyadenylation signal.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The terminology &#x201c;antisense RNA&#x201d; encompasses RNA that is complementary to a gene expression product. For example, an antisense RNA targeted to a specific mRNA is an RNA-based agent (or can be a modified RNA) that is complementary to the mRNA, where hybridization of the antisense RNA to the mRNA alters the expression of the mRNA (e.g., via altering the stability of the RNA, altering the translation of the RNA, etc.). Also included in &#x201c;antisense RNA&#x201d; are nucleic acids encoding an antisense RNA.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">With regards to &#x201c;CRISPR/Cas9 agents&#x201d;, the term &#x201c;CRISPR&#x201d; encompasses Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems that evolved to provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity against viruses and plasmids by using CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to guide the silencing of invading nucleic acids. The Cas9 protein (or functional equivalent and/or variant thereof, i.e., Cas9-like protein) naturally contains DNA endonuclease activity that depends on association of the protein with two naturally occurring or synthetic RNA molecules called crRNA and tracrRNA (also called guide RNAs). In some cases, the two molecules are covalently linked to form a single molecule (also called a single guide RNA (&#x201c;sgRNA&#x201d;)). Thus, the Cas9 or Cas9-like protein associates with a DNA-targeting RNA (which term encompasses both the two-molecule guide RNA configuration and the single-molecule guide RNA configuration), which activates the Cas9 or Cas9-like protein and guides the protein to a target nucleic acid sequence.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">If the Cas9 or Cas9-like protein retains its natural enzymatic function, it will cleave target DNA to create a double-strand break, which can lead to genome alteration (i.e., editing: deletion, insertion (when a donor polynucleotide is present), replacement, etc.), thereby altering gene expression. Some variants of Cas9 (which variants are encompassed by the term Cas9-like) have been altered such that they have a decreased DNA cleaving activity (in some cases, they cleave a single strand instead of both strands of the target DNA, while in other cases, they have severely reduced to no DNA cleavage activity). Cas9-like proteins with decreased DNA-cleavage activity (even no DNA-cleaving activity) can still be guided to a target DNA to block RNA polymerase activity. Alternatively, the Cas9 or Cas9-like protein may be modified by fusing a VP64 transcription activation domain to the Cas9 protein and codelivering the fusion protein with a MS2-P65-HSF1 helper protein and a single guide RNA comprising MS2 RNA aptamers at the tetraloop and stem-loop to form a Synergistic Activation Mediator (Cas9-SAM) complex in the cell that activates transcription. Thus enzymatically inactive Cas9-like proteins can be targeted to a specific location in a target DNA by a DNA-targeting RNA in order to block or activate transcription of the target DNA.

The regulation may affect the frequency, speed, or specificity of the process, and may be enhancing or inhibitory in nature. Control elements known in the art include, for example, transcriptional regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers. A promoter is a DNA region capable under certain conditions of binding RNA polymerase and initiating transcription of a coding region usually located downstream (in the 3&#x2032; direction) from the promoter. Promoters may be ubiquitously acting, i.e. active in many cell types, e.g. CAG or CMV promoters; or tissue or cell specific, e.g. the rho promoter, which is active in rods, or the opsin promoter, which is active in cones.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The terminology &#x201c;operatively linked&#x201d; or &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; refers to a juxtaposition of genetic elements, wherein the elements are in a relationship permitting them to operate in the expected manner. For instance, a promoter is operatively linked to a coding region if the promoter helps initiate transcription of the coding sequence. There may be intervening residues between the promoter and coding region so long as this functional relationship is maintained.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The terminology &#x201c;expression vector&#x201d; encompasses a vector comprising a polynucleotide region which encodes a polypeptide of interest, and is used for effecting the expression of the protein in an intended target cell. An expression vector may also comprise control elements operatively linked to the encoding region to facilitate expression of the protein in the target. The combination of control elements and a gene or genes to which they are operably linked for expression is sometimes referred to as an &#x201c;expression cassette,&#x201d; a large number of which are known and available in the art or can be readily constructed from components that are available in the art.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The term &#x201c;heterologous&#x201d; means derived from a genotypically distinct entity from that of the rest of the entity to which it is being compared. For example, a polynucleotide introduced by genetic engineering techniques into a plasmid or vector derived from a different species is a heterologous polynucleotide. A promoter removed from its native coding sequence and operatively linked to a coding sequence with which it is not naturally found linked is a heterologous promoter. Thus, for example, an rAAV that includes a heterologous nucleic acid sequence encoding a heterologous gene product is an rAAV that includes a polynucleotide not normally included in a naturally-occurring, wild-type AAV, and the encoded heterologous gene product is a gene product not normally encoded by a naturally-occurring, wild type AAV.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The terminology &#x201c;genetic alteration&#x201d; and &#x201c;genetic modification&#x201d; (and grammatical variants thereof), are used interchangeably herein to refer to a process wherein a genetic element (e.g., a polynucleotide) is introduced into a cell other than by mitosis or meiosis. The element may be heterologous to the cell, or it may be an additional copy or improved version of an element already present in the cell. Genetic alteration may be effected, for example, by transfecting a cell with a recombinant plasmid or other polynucleotide through any process known in the art, such as electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation, or contacting with a polynucleotide-liposome complex. Genetic alteration may also be effected, for example, by transduction or infection with a DNA or RNA virus or viral vector.

The presence of the exogenous DNA results in permanent or transient genetic change. The transforming DNA may or may not be integrated (covalently linked) into the genome of the cell. A &#x201c;clone&#x201d; is a population of cells derived from a single cell or common ancestor by mitosis.

The viral genome of a naturally occurring AAV has 2 inverted terminal repeats (ITR)&#x2014;which function as the viral origin of replication and packaging signal&#x2014;flanking 2 primary open reading frames (ORF): rep (encoding proteins that function in viral replication, transcriptional regulation, site-specific integration, and virion assembly) and cap. The cap ORF codes for 3 structural proteins that assemble to form a 60-mer viral capsid. Many naturally occurring AAV variants and serotypes have been isolated, and none have been associated with human disease.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Recombinant versions of AAV can be used as gene delivery vectors, where a marker or therapeutic gene of interest is inserted between the ITRs in place of rep and cap. These vectors have been shown to transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells in vitro and in vivo and can result in stable transgene expression for years in post-mitotic tissue.

However, there are impediments to gene delivery that may limit rAAV's utility, such as anti-capsid immune responses, low transduction of certain tissues, an inability for targeted delivery to specific cell types and a relatively low carrying capacity. In many situations, there is insufficient mechanistic knowledge to effectively empower rational design with the capacity to improve AAV. As an alternative, directed evolution has emerged as a strategy to create novel AAV variants that meet specific biomedical needs. Directed evolution strategies harness genetic diversification and selection processes to enable the accumulation of beneficial mutations that progressively improve the function of a biomolecule. In this process, wild-type AAV cap genes are diversified by several approaches to create large genetic libraries that are packaged to generate libraries of viral particles, and selective pressure is then applied to isolate novel variants that can overcome gene delivery barriers. Importantly, the mechanistic basis underlying a gene delivery problem does not need to be known for directed evolution of function, which can thus accelerate the development of enhanced vectors.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Typically, the variants disclosed herein were generated through use of an AAV library and/or libraries. Such an AAV library or libraries is/are generated by mutating the cap gene, the gene which encodes the structural proteins of the AAV capsid, by a range of directed evolution techniques known by and readily available to the skilled artisan in the field of viral genome engineering. See e.g., Bartel et al. Am. Soc. Gene Cell Ther. 15<sup>th </sup>Annu. Meet. 20, S140 (2012); Bowles, D. et al. J. Virol. 77, 423-432 (2003); Gray et al. Mol. Ther. 18, 570-578 (2010); Grimm, D. et al. J. Virol. 82, 5887-5911; Koerber, J. T. et al. Mol. Ther. 16, 1703-1709 (2008); Li W. et al. Mol. Ther. 16, 1252-1260 (2008); Koerber, J. T. et al. Methods Mol. Biol. 434, 161-170 (2008); Koerber, J. T. et al. Hum. Gene Ther. 18, 367-378 (2007); and Koerber, J. T. et al. Mol. Ther. 17, 2088-2095 (2009). Such techniques, without limitation, are as follows: i) Error-prone PCR to introduce random point mutations into the AAV cap open reading frame (ORF) at a predetermined, modifiable rate; ii) In vitro or in vivo viral recombination or &#x201c;DNA shuffling&#x201d; to generate random chimeras of AAV cap genes to yield a gene library with multiple AAV serotypes; iii) Random peptide insertions at defined sites of the capsid by ligation of degenerate oligonucleotides in the cap ORF; iv) Defined insertions of peptide-encoding sequences into random locations of the AAV cap ORF using transposon mutagenesis; v) Replacing surface loops of AAV capsids with libraries of peptide sequences bioinformationally designed based on the level of conservation of each amino acid position among natural AAV serotypes and variants to generate &#x201c;loop-swap&#x201d; libraries; vi) Random amino acid substitution at positions of degeneracy between AAV serotypes to generate libraries of ancestral variants (Santiago-Ortiz et al., 2015); and a combination of such techniques thereof.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">DNA shuffling generates chimeras which combine their parental properties in unique and, often beneficial, ways; however, some may be incapable of packaging which, in effect, reduces the diversity of the library. Diversity concentration of the library is achieved through peptide insertion techniques such as, without limitation, iii-iv) above. Diversity of the library is also concentrated in techniques such as v) above, and such concentration is directed onto multiple hypervariable regions, which lie on surface exposed loops, of the AAV capsid. While many of the techniques generate variant capsids with only a small area of the capsid mutated, these techniques can be paired with additional mutagenesis strategies to modify the full capsid.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Once the AAV library or libraries is/are generated, viruses are then packaged, such that each AAV particle is comprised of a mutant capsid surrounding a cap gene encoding that capsid, and purified. Variants of the library are then subjected to in vitro and/or in vivo selective pressure techniques known by and readily available to the skilled artisan in the field of AAV. See e.g., Maheshri, N. et al. Nature Biotech. 24, 198-204 (2006); Dalkara, D. et al. Sci. Transl. Med. 5, 189ra76 (2013); Lisowski, L. et al. Nature. 506, 382-286 (2013); Yang, L. et al. PNAS. 106, 3946-3951 (2009); Gao, G. et al. Mol. Ther. 13, 77-87 (2006); and Bell, P. et al. Hum. Gene. Ther. 22, 985-997 (2011). For example, without limitation, AAV variants can be selected using i) affinity columns in which elution of different fractions yields variants with altered binding properties; ii) primary cells&#x2014;isolated from tissue samples or immortal cells lines that mimic the behavior of cells in the human body&#x2014;which yield AAV variants with increased efficiency and/or tissue specificity; iii) animal models&#x2014;which mimic a clinical gene therapy environment&#x2014;which yield AAV variants that have successfully infected target tissue; iv) human xenograft models which yield AAV variants that have infected grafted human cells; and/or a combination of selection techniques thereof.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Once viruses are selected, they may be recovered by known techniques such as, without limitation, adenovirus-mediated replication, PCR amplification, Next Generation sequencing and cloning, and the like. Virus clones are then enriched through repeated rounds of the selection techniques and AAV DNA is isolated to recover selected variant cap genes of interest. Such selected variants can be subjected to further modification or mutation and as such serve as a new starting point for further selection steps to iteratively increase AAV viral fitness. However, in certain instances, successful capsids have been generated without additional mutation.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The AAV variants disclosed herein were generated at least in part through the use of in vivo directed evolution methodology, such as the techniques described above, involving the use of primate retinal screens following intravitreal administration. As such, he AAV variant capsids disclosed herein comprise one or more modifications in amino acid sequence that confer more efficient transduction of primate retinal cells than a corresponding parental AAV capsid protein. As used herein, a &#x201c;corresponding parental AAV capsid protein&#x201d; refers to an AAV capsid protein of the same wild-type or variant AAV serotype as the subject variant AAV capsid protein but that does not comprise the one or more amino acid sequence modifications of the subject variant AAV capsid protein.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some embodiments, the subject variant AAV capsid protein comprises a heterologous peptide of from about 5 amino acids to about 20 amino acids inserted by covalent linkage into an AAV capsid protein GH loop, or loop IV, relative to a corresponding parental AAV capsid protein. By the &#x201c;GH loop,&#x201d; or loop IV, of the AAV capsid protein it is meant the solvent-accessible portion referred to in the art as the GH loop, or loop IV, of AAV capsid protein. For the GH loop/loop IV of AAV capsid, see, e.g., van Viet et al. (2006) <i>Mol. Ther. </i>14:809; Padron et al. (2005) <i>J. Virol. </i>79:5047; and Shen et al. (2007) <i>Mol. Ther. </i>15:1955. Thus, for example, the insertion site can be within about amino acids 411-650 of an AAV VP1 capsid protein.

In some embodiments, the variant AAV capsid comprises the specified one or more amino acid substitutions and/or peptide insertions and is otherwise identical to SEQ ID NO:59.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0203">The AAV variants disclosed herein were generated through the use of in vivo directed evolution involving the use of primate retinal screens following intravitreal administration. In some embodiments, the variant capsid proteins disclosed herein, when present in an AAV virion, confer increased transduction of a retinal cell compared to the transduction of the retinal cell by an AAV virion comprising the corresponding parental AAV capsid protein or wild-type AAV. For example, in some embodiments, the variant capsid proteins disclosed herein, when present in an AAV virion, confer more efficient transduction of primate retinal cells than AAV virions comprising the corresponding parental AAV capsid protein or wild-type AAV capsid protein, e.g. the retinal cells take up more AAV virions comprising the subject variant AAV capsid protein than AAV virions comprising the parental AAV capsid protein or wild-type AAV. In some such embodiments, the AAV variant virion or variant rAAV exhibits at least 2-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 10-fold, at least 15-fold, at least 20-fold, at least 25-fold, at least 50-fold, or more than 50-fold, increased transduction of a retinal cell, compared to the transduction of the retinal cell by a wild-type AAV virion or rAAV comprising the corresponding parental AAV capsid protein. In certain such embodiments, the variant capsid proteins disclosed herein, when present in an AAV virion, confer broader transduction of the primate retinal cells than AAV virions comprising the corresponding parental AAV capsid protein or wild type AAV capsid protein. In other words, the variant AAV virion transduces cell types not transduced by virions comprising the corresponding parental AAV capsid protein, and hence more types of cells in the retina than the corresponding parental AAV virion. In some embodiments, the AAV variant virion preferentially transduces a retinal cell, e.g., a subject rAAV virion infects a retinal cell with 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 20-fold, 25-fold, 50-fold, or more than 50-fold, specificity than another retinal cell or a non-retinal cell, e.g., a cell outside the eye. In some embodiments, the transduced retinal cell is a photoreceptor cell (e.g., rods; cones). In some embodiments, the retinal cell is a retinal ganglion cell (RGC). In some embodiments, the retinal cell is a retinal epithelial cell (RPE cell). In some embodiments, the retinal cell is a M&#xfc;ller glial cell. In some embodiments, the retinal cell is a microglial cell. In some embodiments, the retinal cell is an amacrine cell. In some embodiments, the retinal cell is a bipolar cell. In some embodiments, the retinal cell is a horizontal cell. An increase in transduction of a retinal cell, e.g. increased efficiency of transduction, broader transduction, more preferential transduction, etc. may be readily assessed in vitro or in vivo by any number of methods in the art for measuring gene expression. For example, the AAV may be packaged with a genome comprising an expression cassette comprising a reporter gene, e.g. a fluorescent protein, under the control of a ubiquitous or tissue specific promoter, and the extent of transduction assessed by detecting the fluorescent protein by, e.g., fluorescence microscopy. As another example, the AAV may be packaged with a genome comprising a bar coded nucleic acid sequence, and the extent of transduction assessed by detecting the nucleic acid sequence by, e.g., PCR. As another example, the AAV may be packaged with a genome comprising an expression cassette comprising a therapeutic gene for the treatment of a retinal disease, and the extent of transduction assessed by detecting the treatment of the retinal disease in an afflicted patient that was administered the AAV.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0204">Ocular diseases that can be treated using a variant rAAV vector or virion and/or method disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, monogenic diseases, complex genetic diseases, acquired diseases, and traumatic injuries.

For example, where a dominant allele encodes a defective copy of a gene that, when wild-type, is a retinal structural protein and/or provides for normal retinal function, a site-specific endonuclease can be targeted to the defective allele and knock out the defective allele.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0213">In addition to knocking out a defective allele, a site-specific nuclease can also be used to stimulate homologous recombination with a donor DNA that encodes a functional copy of the protein encoded by the defective allele. Thus, e.g., a subject rAAV virion can be used to deliver both a site-specific endonuclease that knocks out a defective allele, and can be used to deliver a functional copy of the defective allele, resulting in repair of the defective allele, thereby providing for production of a functional retinal protein (e.g., functional retinoschisin, functional RPE65, functional peripherin, etc.). See, e.g., Li et al. (2011) Nature 475:217. In some embodiments, a rAAV virion disclosed herein comprises a heterologous nucleotide sequence that encodes a site-specific endonuclease; and a heterologous nucleotide sequence that encodes a functional copy of a defective allele, where the functional copy encodes a functional retinal protein. Functional retinal proteins include, e.g., retinoschisin, RPE65, retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RGPR)-interacting protein-1, peripherin, peripherin-2, and the like.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0214">Site-specific endonucleases that are suitable for use include, e.g., meganucleases; zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs); transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs); and Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated (Cas), where such site-specific endonucleases are non-naturally occurring and are modified to target a specific gene. Such site-specific nucleases can be engineered to cut specific locations within a genome, and non-homologous end joining can then repair the break while inserting or deleting several nucleotides. Such site-specific endonucleases (also referred to as &#x201c;INDELs&#x201d;) then throw the protein out of frame and effectively knock out the gene. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2011/0301073.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0215">In some embodiments of the variant rAAV vector disclosed herein, a nucleotide sequence encoding a gene product of interest is operably linked to a constitutive promoter.

In some instances, a nucleotide sequence encoding a gene product of interest is operably linked to a retinal pigment epithelia (RPE) cell-specific regulatory element (e.g., a RPE-specific promoter), e.g., a regulatory element that confers selective expression of the operably linked gene in a RPE cell.

with superior gene delivery to retinal cells following intravitreal (IVT) administration, a route of administration with significant advantages over other methods of gene delivery to the human eye (Example 1). The cell tropism following intravitreal administration of the novel AAV variant comprising a P34A substitution and the peptide LAISDQTKHA (SEQ ID NO:28) inserted at amino acid 588 (LAISDQTKHA+P34A) was assessed in vivo in non-human primates (NHP) as a representative example of the ability of ISDQTKH (SEQ ID NO:14)-containing AAV variants to transduce retinal cells.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0238">Recombinant AAV virions comprising either an AAV2 capsid or the novel variant capsid LAISDQTKHA+P34A and a genome comprising a green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene operably linked to a CMV promoter (AAV2.CMV.GFP and LAISDQTKHA+P34A.CMV.GFP, respectively) or a CAG promoter (AAV2.CAG.EGFP and LAISDQTKHA+P34A.CAG.EGFP, respectively) were manufactured using standard methods. African Green Monkeys (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>, <b>8</b></figref>) or Cynomolgus macaques (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) were injected intravitreally with various doses of vector ranging from 4&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>vg to 1&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>1e12 vg per eye (see figure legends for details) and the transduction of retinal cells was assessed in life by fundus fluorescence imaging with a Heidelberg Spectralis&#x2122;.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0239">Intravitreal delivery of AAVs comprising the novel variant LAISDQTKHA+P34A resulted in broader and more robust transgene expression across the NHP retina than AAV2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref>). Images reveal that the novel AAV variant capsid provides for robust expression within the center of the fovea (an area rich in cones); in the parafoveal ring (an area rich in retinal ganglion cells), and in the periphery (an area rich in many types of cells including rods, Muller glia, amacrine cells, bipolar cells) as early as 2 weeks after injection. In contrast, and consistent with results reported by others, wild type AAV2 provides for weaker expression that is primarily in the parafoveal ring and can only be detected at later timepoints. Immunohistochemical analysis of various regions of the retina performed 3 weeks after injection confirmed that many types of retinal cells, including retinal pigment epithelial cells, rod and cone photoreceptors, and retinal ganglion cells, had been successfully transduced throughout the retina (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0227" num="0240">This study in illustrates superior gene delivery by the ISDQTKH-comprising variant following a clinically preferred route of administration as compared to the clinically relevant AAV2.

Human RPE cell cultures were generated from the human embryonic stem cell line ESI-017 or human fibroblast-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (&#x201c;FB-iPSC&#x201d;) using a 45-day differentiation protocol. Maturation into RPE cells was confirmed by detecting the expression of mature RPE markers including RPE65 and BEST1; the synthesis of VEGF and PEDF; and the ability to phagocytose rod outer segments. PR cultures were generated by a multi-step eye cup formation paradigm and confirmed to comprise PRs by detecting the expression of Recoverin and S Opsin after 179 days in culture.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0243">Relative to AAV2, LAISDQTKHA+P34A provided for significantly higher transduction efficiency of and transgene expression in human RPE cultures seven days post-infection as determined by immunofluorescence (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-B</figref>), flow cytometry (2.7-fold increase; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>C-D</figref>) and Western blot analysis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>E-F</figref>). Robust transduction and expression was likewise achieved using LAISDQTKHA+P34A.CAG.EGFP in human PR cultures by 32 days post-infection. This study illustrates the superior ability of ISDQTKH (SEQ ID NO:14)-comprising variants to deliver genes to retinal cells.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0244">The preceding merely illustrates the principles of the invention.
