While different jurisdictions have vastly different rules regarding the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages, there is generally a strict division in the supply chain between manufacturers, distributors or pool buyers, retailers, and purchasers (i.e., users). This strict division can be driven by regulatory requirements in a given jurisdiction.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The strict division within the supply chain can limit the options that a single actor in the supply chain can utilize. For instance, in many jurisdictions, manufacturers can only sell to distributors or pool buyers. This can limit the options by which manufacturers can directly market to users. For instance, manufacturers may wish to provide a promotional giveaway to a user regarding a new type of alcoholic beverage. Due to regulations in many jurisdictions where the manufacturers can only sell to distributors or pool buyers, this is often not possible.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additionally, in some jurisdictions, alcoholic beverage retailers may be restricted from selling certain items that are not alcoholic beverages. This restriction can come at the expense of users who may desire delivery of items that are not alcoholic beverages concurrently with delivery of alcoholic beverages.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Even further, the restrictions in the supply chain can prevent the entire supply chain from efficiently managing inventory. For instance, if a retailer and a distributor or pool buyer are out of stock of a particular alcoholic beverage, the retailer would need to wait until the manufacturer delivers the particular alcoholic beverage to the distributor or pool buyer and then wait until the distributor or pool buyer distributes the particular alcoholic beverage to the retailer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">While some alcohol delivery services may exist, these services have operated on a single portion of the supply chain. These services may deliver the alcoholic beverage from the retailer to the user only and do not involve a manufacturer and a distributor or pool buyer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As such, there is a need for a technological solution that allows for management of a greater portion of the alcoholic beverage supply chain. Such a technological solution would, in some cases, provide an ability to concurrently combine an alcoholic beverage supply chain and non-alcoholic beverages within a single transaction. This technical solution would save computing efficiency and by streamlining multiple transactions which would otherwise occur on multiple levels of the supply chain. Such a technical solution would also improve the user experience by allowing for &#x201c;real time&#x201d; delivery of alcoholic beverages from any level of the supply chain. Such a technical solution would also improve the user experience by allowing the user to obtain free alcoholic beverages directly from manufacturer advertisements. The technical solution would also provide improved inventory management capabilities throughout the supply chain, which would also result in improved computing efficiency.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To solve at least the above technical problems, a method, non-transitory computer readable medium, and system for obtaining and delivering at least one alcoholic beverage, through at least one supply chain, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure are described.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">One or more embodiments of the method, non-transitory computer readable medium, and system include receiving an electronic request from at least one user to purchase at least one alcoholic beverage, determining a location of the at least one user, locating a distributor or pool buyer carrying the at least one alcoholic beverage requested by the at least one user, where the distributor or pool buyer is located at a first predetermined distance from the location of an alcoholic beverage retailer selling the at least one alcoholic beverage requested by the at least one user, locating the alcoholic beverage retailer, where the alcoholic beverage retailer is located at a second predetermined distance from the location of the at least one user, sending instructions to transfer the at least one alcoholic beverage from the distributor or pool buyer to the alcoholic beverage retailer, sending instructions to obtain the at least one alcoholic beverage from the alcoholic beverage retailer, and sending instructions to deliver the at least one alcoholic beverage to the at least one user.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A method, non-transitory computer readable medium, and system for obtaining and delivering at least one alcoholic beverage through a plurality of supply chains are described.

At least one of the supply chains may comprise alcoholic beverages. At least one of the supply chains may comprise items that are not alcoholic beverages. According to one or more embodiments, the items that are not alcoholic beverages may comprise disparately regulated items. As used herein, &#x201c;disparately regulated items&#x201d; are items that are subject to a separate regulatory regime from alcoholic beverages. Examples of disparately regulated items, include but are not limited to, <i>cannabis </i>(where legal), firearms, and tobacco. According to one or more embodiments, the items that are not alcoholic beverages may comprise unregulated items. As used herein, &#x201c;unregulated items&#x201d; are items that are not subject to restrictions on sale, purchase, or title transfer in the ordinary course of business and trade. &#x201c;Unregulated items&#x201d; may in some cases be subject to regulations outside of the ordinary course of business and trade, such as, for instance, manufacturing or labeling regulations. In some embodiments, the disparately regulated items may include unregulated items. Due to their unregulated status, unregulated items are not subject to a regulatory regime during the ordinary course of business and trade. By contrast, alcoholic beverages may be subject to a regulatory regime in certain embodiments. Accordingly, unregulated items may be &#x201c;disparately regulated&#x201d; from alcohol because unregulated items are not regulated, whereas alcoholic beverages may be regulated.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used herein, an &#x201c;alcoholic beverage&#x201d; generally refers to a beverage that includes alcohol. In some examples, an &#x201c;alcoholic beverage&#x201d; may be defined according to laws of a particular jurisdiction. For instance, in certain jurisdictions, a beverage that includes an amount of alcohol falling below a legal threshold, may not be considered an &#x201c;alcoholic beverage&#x201d; in certain embodiments of the present disclosure. In some examples, the alcoholic beverage may include, wine, beer, liquor, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">One or more embodiments of the method, non-transitory computer readable medium, and system include receiving an electronic request from at least one user. As used herein, &#x201c;at least one user&#x201d; or &#x201c;user&#x201d; each may refer, without limitation, to a single user or a plurality of users. In certain examples, the &#x201c;at least one user&#x201d; may comprise a user of a device that is configured to facilitate at least one operation described herein. In certain examples, the electronic request may be received by at least one processor over a computer network.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In certain examples, the electronic request from the at least one user may include a request to purchase at least one alcoholic beverage. In some examples, the electronic request from the at least one user may include a request to purchase a plurality of alcoholic beverages. In certain implementations, the plurality of alcoholic beverages may be of one type or may include different types of alcoholic beverages without limitation.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In certain examples of the present disclosure, an exemplary method may include determining a location of the at least one user. Determining the location of the at least one user may, in some examples, be performed by the user locator described herein. In certain examples, the user locator may comprise a global positioning system (GPS) operating over a computer network. In certain examples, the user locator may be configured to work with a graphical user interface (GUI) of a device described herein. In some such examples, a user may input a location identifier, such as a zip code, into the GUI. The at least one processor described herein would then utilize the GPS to locate the at least one user based on the location identifier input by the at least one user. In other such examples, the location of the user may be automatically determined using pre-existing software that may be present on a device of the at least one user.

The system may then, in some embodiments, initiate a real time transfer of the N&#x2212;M=6 alcoholic beverages from the distributor or pool buyer to the alcoholic beverage retailer.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Upon determining that the distributor or pool buyer does not have at least N&#x2212;M=6 alcoholic beverages, the method, non-transitory computer readable medium, and system would then manually or automatically locate a manufacturer. N&#x2212;M-K alcoholic beverages would then be obtained from the manufacturer. As used herein, K is the number of beverages possessed by the distributor or pool buyer where K&#x3c;M&#x3c;N. By way of example, the present section will take K=2, with the understanding that the value of K is not particularly limited. Accordingly, assuming N=10 and M=4, N&#x2212;M&#x2212;K (10&#x2212;4&#x2212;2=4) alcoholic beverages would be obtained from the manufacturer. The M=4 alcoholic beverages from the alcoholic beverage retailer, the K=2 alcoholic beverages from the distributor or pool buyer, and the N&#x2212;M&#x2212;K=4 alcoholic beverages from the manufacturer can then be delivered to the user to meet the electronic request of N=10 alcoholic beverages.

As used herein an &#x201c;inventory manager&#x201d; is a third party (i.e., an individual or entity outside of the supply chain) that manages the supply chain to ensure that the distributor or pool buyer and the retailer have sufficient inventory. The inventory manager can be, without limitation, a warehouse manager, a software service configured to perform the steps described herein, an artificial intelligence, at least one device configured to perform the steps described herein, or any combination thereof. In some examples, where the inventory manager does not include a physical location, such as, but not limited to, when the inventory manager is a software service, any steps of including the delivery of the at least one alcoholic beverage to the inventory manager may be omitted. In further examples, the &#x201c;request to purchase N alcoholic beverages&#x201d; may be replaced by &#x201c;a request to fulfill inventory of N alcoholic beverages.&#x201d; In some such examples, the alcoholic beverages may never be in physical possession of the inventory manager. Instead, the inventory manager may ensure that at least one of the alcoholic beverage retailer or the distributor or pool buyer has at least N alcoholic beverages. In some further examples, the inventory management to an inventory management method, computer readable medium, and system may use analogous steps to manage inventory of the at least one item that is not an alcoholic beverage, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, the method may include inputting a record of a transfer of the at least one alcoholic beverage within the supply chain (e.g., from a distributor or pool buyer to an alcoholic beverage retailer, from the alcoholic beverage retailer to at least one delivery vehicle, from the at least one delivery vehicle to the at least one user), into a database. The inputting can be performed manually or automatically according to certain embodiments. The database can be any suitable database, such as, but not limited to, a spreadsheet or a blockchain. In some examples, the records of the transfer of the at least one alcoholic beverage within the supply chain can be reproduced from the database, e.g., for a regulatory or tax audit. In certain implementations, records of transaction charges within the supply chain can also be recorded within the supply chain and similarly reproduced. In further implementations, the database may be managed by the inventory manager described herein.
