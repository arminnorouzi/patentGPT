id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">Modern software applications enable efficient execution of tasks. Such tasks may include generation, storage and analysis of data records, and communication with other applications or services based on such data records. For example, a user may operate an application to create a record, to select one or more websites, and to transmit the record to the one or more selected websites. Each of the selected websites may be configured to receive data records in a particular format, and the application therefore formats a data record in accordance with a respective particular format prior to transmission to a website.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Establishing and maintaining the technical details (data structure, protocol, etc.) which govern communication between an application and various third-party platforms such as websites may include multiple stakeholders and manual actions, and thereby consume an unacceptable amount of time and resources. In one example, a recruiting application may include software modules which enable a user to create a job requisition, to select multiple third-party job posting platforms (i.e., job boards), and to transmit the job requisition to the selected job boards. In order to enable the recruiting application to transmit a job requisition to a particular job board, the recruiting application must be configured to transmit the job requisition in conformance with technical specifications which govern communication with the job board.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Configuration typically begins with a request from a user to integrate a new job board with the recruiting application. A provider of the recruiting application prioritizes the request within a queue and, once the request rises to the top of the queue, the provider discusses technical specifications with job board personnel. Agreement on the technical specifications is reached, and the development activities which are required to configure the recruiting application based on the technical specifications are queued based on priority. Once the development activities are performed, the configuration is tested by the provider of the recruiting application and validated by the job board. The thusly-configured application is placed into production if testing and validation are successful.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The foregoing process must occur independently with respect to each job board to which a recruiting application intends to transmit job requisitions. This process may therefore require an unacceptable amount of time and resources. These issues are exacerbated in the case of certain types of third-party platforms, such as job boards, which are rapidly increasing in number and complexity. Systems are therefore desired to facilitate integration between an application and a third-party platform.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an architecture to integrate heterogeneous posting platforms with a posting application according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> comprises a flow diagram of a process to integrate a posting platform with a posting application according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a view of a user interface to provide a markup language sample according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a view of a user interface to define markup language fields and associated attributes according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a view of a user interface to review and confirm a markup language template according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a view of a user interface to specify a data transfer protocol according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram of an architecture including a recruiting application and a plurality of job boards integrated therewith according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> comprises a flow diagram of a process executable by a recruiting application to post a job requisition to a job board integrated therewith according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a view of a user interface to specify a job requisition for posting to a job board according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a view of a user interface to specify one or more job boards to which a job requisition is to be posted according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a view of a user interface for completing fields associated with job boards according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a block diagram of a hardware system for providing a recruiting application according to some embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The following description is provided to enable any person in the art to make and use the described embodiments and sets forth the best mode contemplated for carrying out some embodiments. Various modifications, however, will be readily-apparent to those in the art.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Some embodiments relate to systems which facilitate integration between an application and heterogeneous external platforms (e.g., websites, portals, data aggregators). According to some implementations, an integration service is provided by which a third party may initiate and substantially configure an application for communication with an external platform while reducing a need for corresponding manual actions by a provider/developer of the application. Embodiments may therefore conserve development and management resources while speeding the establishment of integrations between an application and external platforms. For users of the application, embodiments may increase transparency surrounding such an integration because the users may simply request a third-party platform to initiate integration with the application, without having to unduly rely on the provider/developer of the application to do so.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an architecture of system <b>100</b> according to some embodiments. The illustrated elements of system <b>100</b> may be implemented using any suitable combination of computing hardware and/or software that is or becomes known. In some embodiments, two or more elements of system <b>100</b> are implemented by a single computing device. Two or more elements of system <b>100</b> may be co-located. One or more elements of system <b>100</b> may be implemented as a cloud service (e.g., Software-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service). A cloud-based implementation of any elements of system <b>100</b> may apportion computing resources elastically according to demand, need, price, and/or any other metric.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Application platform <b>110</b> may comprise an on-premise, cloud-based, or hybrid computing platform providing an execution platform and services to software applications. Application platform <b>110</b> may comprise one or more virtual machines executing program code of an application server. The software applications may comprise program code executable by one or more processing units (e.g., Central Processing Units (CPUs), processor cores, processor threads) of application platform <b>110</b> to provide various functions.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Posting platforms <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> may each comprise an on-premise, cloud-based or hybrid computing system which may accept data from one or more applications executing on application platform <b>110</b>. Such data will be referred to herein as &#x201c;posts&#x201d; and may comprise any data that is or becomes known. Posting application <b>112</b> may provide functionality for transmitting such data (i.e., posting posts) to selected ones of posting platforms <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>. According to some embodiments, posts received by one of posting platforms <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> from posting application <b>112</b> may be viewed by users of the posting platform. The users, the provider of the posting platform, and the provider of posting application <b>112</b> may be unrelated entities. Specific embodiments thereof will be described below.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Two or more of posting platforms <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> may have different technical requirements associated with posts received from posting application <b>112</b> (or from any other posting system). That is, input data to be received and posted by posting platform <b>120</b>, for example, must be in a different format and/or transmitted via a different protocol than input data to be received and posted by posting platform <b>122</b>. Posting platform <b>124</b> may require input data of yet a third format and/or protocol.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Application platform <b>110</b> also includes program code of integration service <b>113</b>. Although illustrated separately in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, integration service <b>113</b> may comprise a component, module, etc. of posting application <b>112</b> according to some embodiments. Integration service <b>113</b> allows a third party (i.e., different from a provider of posting application <b>112</b>) to specify technical and other details of a posting platform. The technical details will be referred to as a profile and may include a data structure, attributes of various fields of the data structure, a transmission protocol, a name, a logo, contact details, etc. In some embodiments, integration service <b>113</b> provides a portal which may be accessed over the Web.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows direct communication between integration service <b>113</b> and posting platforms <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, a developer of a posting platform connects (i.e., logs on) to the posting platform in an administrator role and accesses integration service <b>113</b> via the posting platform. It should be noted that integration service <b>113</b> may be accessed directly by a separate computing device/system. For example, a developer of posting platform <b>122</b> may execute a Web browser on a laptop/desktop computer to access a Web portal provided by integration service <b>113</b> and provide profile information thereto, independent of posting platform <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Platform profiles <b>114</b> include profiles provided by posting platforms via integration service <b>113</b>. Platform profiles <b>114</b> may be stored in any suitable format within data store <b>115</b>. Data store <b>115</b> may comprise any suitable storage system such as a database system, which may be partially or fully remote from compute elements of platform <b>110</b>, and may be distributed as is known in the art.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, user <b>130</b> may access post management application <b>116</b> executing on application platform <b>110</b>. Post management application <b>116</b> may allow user <b>130</b> to compose a post for posting to one or more posting platforms. As will be described below, such a post may comprise a job requisition, but embodiments are not limited to any particular type of data. Post management application <b>116</b> may store posts in posts <b>117</b> of data store <b>115</b>, and read, update and delete posts therefrom.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">User <b>130</b> may further operate post management application <b>116</b> to select, via posting application <b>112</b>, one or more posting platforms to which a post should be transmitted. In some embodiments, user <b>130</b> may access posting application <b>112</b> directly to select a post of posts <b>117</b> and one or more posting platforms to which to transmit the selected post. In either case, posting application <b>112</b> identifies a platform profile of platform profiles <b>114</b> which corresponds to each selected posting platform and transmits the post to each selected posting platform based on the corresponding profile.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Transmission of a post to a posting platform may comprise formatting the post according to the technical formatting details of a corresponding one of platform profiles <b>115</b> and transmitting the post according to the transmission details of the corresponding platform profile. In a case that two selected posting platforms are associated with different platform profiles, transmission of a post to each selected posting platform may require posting application <b>112</b> to format the post according to two different sets of technical formatting details and to transmit the post via two different transmission protocols.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Post management application <b>116</b> and posting application <b>112</b> may comprise elements of a suite of applications provided by platform <b>110</b>. Each application in the suite may communicate with other applications of the suite via respective Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). In this example, user <b>130</b> may access a landing Web page of the suite of applications, provide suitable credentials, and then be presented with an interface allowing selection of post management application <b>116</b>, posting application <b>112</b>, and any other applications of the suite.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> comprises a flow diagram of process <b>200</b> to integrate a posting platform with a posting application according to some embodiments. Process <b>200</b> will be described with respect to the elements of system <b>100</b>, but embodiments are not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Process <b>200</b> and all other processes mentioned herein may be embodied in processor-executable program code read from one or more of non-transitory computer-readable media, such as, for example, a hard disk drive, a volatile or non-volatile random access memory, a DVD-ROM, a Flash drive, and a magnetic tape, and then stored in a compressed, uncompiled and/or encrypted format. A processor may include any number of microprocessors, microprocessor cores, processing threads, or the like. In some embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with, program code for implementation of processes according to some embodiments. Embodiments are therefore not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Process <b>200</b> may be initiated by a customer of a posting application. For example, the customer (e.g., user <b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may wish to operate a posting application (e.g., posting application <b>112</b>) to post data to a posting platform (e.g., <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> or <b>124</b>) with which the posting application is currently not able to communicate. The customer may therefore contact a provider of the posting platform and request the posting platform to initiate an integration with the posting application. In another example, a provider of a posting platform may independently initiate an integration with the posting platform. For example, a respective administrator of each posting platform <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> may interact with application platform <b>110</b> such that after completion of process <b>200</b> by each administrator, each platform <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> will be better able to communicate more efficiently with customers (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) seeking services from the various platforms. Embodiments are not limited to these examples.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Process <b>200</b> begins at S<b>205</b>, at which communication with an integration service (e.g., integration service <b>113</b>) is established. In this regard, the integration service may include a set of Web pages associated with a publicly-accessible Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The Web pages may be used to receive and provide information as described below. S<b>205</b> may comprise operation of a computing device operated by a provider or administrator of a posting platform to execute a Web browser and direct the Web browser to the URL of the integration service. Process <b>200</b> may utilize any other suitable metaphor for exchanging information with an integration service.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">At S<b>210</b>, one or more markup language files are transmitted from the posting platform to the integration service. According to some embodiments, the markup language files are eXtended Markup Language (XML) files which conform to a preferred and/or required input data format of the posting platform. The one or more files may be provided in any known manner, including but not limited to File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and upload to a secure cloud-based storage location.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Field definitions are received by the posting platform from the integration service at S<b>215</b>. The field definitions are determined by the integration service based on the provided one or more markup language files. Each field definition specifies a field and one or more attributes of the field. The field definitions facilitate configuration of an XML template which may be used as described above.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to some embodiments, the posting platform provider may modify the received field definitions at S<b>220</b>. The modifications may modify, add or remove fields, or modify, add or remove attributes for a given field. Modification of the field definitions and attributes may also include specification of a pick-list of allowed values for one or more of the fields.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The posting platform defines a transfer protocol for receiving posting data from the integration service at S<b>225</b>. Next, at S<b>230</b>, the posting platform requests the integration service to store of the field and attribute definitions and transfer protocol.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates user interface <b>310</b> for providing one or more markup language files to an integration service at S<b>210</b> according to some embodiments. User interface <b>310</b> may comprise a Web page provided by the integration service to a Web browser operated by a provider of a posting platform as described above. For example, an administrator of a posting platform may access an administrator home page of the posting platform, which in turn includes a hyperlink associated with the integration service and selectable to initiate integration of a posting platform.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Selection of such a hyperlink (unshown) may result in display of user interface <b>310</b> by the Web browser. User interface <b>310</b> includes several tabs <b>320</b> comprising a &#x201c;smart template wizard&#x201d;. The smart template wizard is intended to generate a markup language template to be associated with the posting platform (e.g., within a platform profile) and to be used by the posting application to format data and transmit the formatted data to the posting platform.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">User interface <b>310</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> displays the contents of the SampleXML tab <b>320</b>. SampleXML tab <b>320</b> includes input area <b>330</b> for inputting a sample markup language file which conforms to an input format suitable to the posting platform. In some embodiments, a posting platform provider simply pastes an example XML feed into input area <b>330</b>. SampleXML tab <b>320</b> may be configured to accept multiple markup language files in some embodiments. The posting platform administrator may select Generate SmartXML control <b>340</b> to submit the markup language file(s) to the integration service at S<b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows UI <b>311</b> displaying SmartXML tab <b>320</b>. SmartXML tab <b>320</b> includes form <b>350</b> presenting fields definitions at S<b>215</b> according to some embodiments. Form <b>350</b> specifies fields <b>351</b> and, for each field <b>351</b>, XML tag name <b>352</b> and other attributes <b>353</b>.
