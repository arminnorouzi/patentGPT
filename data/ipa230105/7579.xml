The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Systems and methods described herein provide for power savings of access stations in Radio Access Networks (RANs), such as Fifth Generation New Radio (5G-NR) networks. Reducing power consumption of RAN components may lower environmental impact, increase component life, and provide operational cost savings. RAN access stations (e.g., next generation node Bs or gNBs) use power, for example, for amplification, baseband conversion, transmit/receive units, voltage conversion, filtering, etc.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Existing access stations for NR networks consistently send synchronization signals about every 20 milliseconds (ms), regardless of whether user equipment (UE) devices are connecting to the access station. This rate of recurrence precludes any temporary disabling of amplification, transmit/receive units, and other component of the access station for power saving purposes.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an implementation, a framework and methodology is provided to allow access stations to save power when no UE devices require service from the access station. The access station may enter a low power-consumption mode (or &#x201c;sleep mode&#x201d;) that deactivates primary components of the access station when the access station is inactive (e.g., not serving any UE devices). A UE device may wake-up the access station if certain conditions are met. Furthermore, in another implementation, the access station may to continue to operate in a power-efficient way when serving a limited number of UE devices.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary environment <b>100</b> in which power-conserving access stations may be implemented. As illustrated, environment <b>100</b> includes an access network <b>105</b>, one or more edge networks <b>130</b>, and a core network <b>150</b>. Access network <b>105</b> may include wireless access stations <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>110</b>-X (referred to collectively as access stations <b>110</b> and generally as access station <b>110</b>). Environment <b>100</b> further includes one or more UE devices <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The number, the type, and the arrangement of network devices and the number of UE devices <b>190</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are exemplary. A network device, a network element, or a network function (referred to herein simply as a network device) may be implemented according to one or multiple network architectures, such as a client device, a server device, a peer device, a proxy device, a cloud device, a virtualized function, and/or another type of network architecture (e.g., Software Defined Networking (SDN), virtual, logical, network slicing, etc.). Additionally, a network device may be implemented according to various computing architectures, such as centralized, distributed, cloud (e.g., elastic, public, private, etc.), edge, fog, and/or another type of computing architecture.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Environment <b>100</b> includes communication links <b>120</b> between the networks, between the network devices, and between UE devices <b>190</b> and the network devices. Environment <b>100</b> may be implemented to include wired, optical, and/or wireless communication links <b>120</b> among the network devices and the networks illustrated. A connection via a communication link <b>120</b> may be direct or indirect. For example, an indirect connection may involve an intermediary device and/or an intermediary network not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A direct connection may not involve an intermediary device and/or an intermediary network. The number and the arrangement of communication links illustrated in environment <b>100</b> are exemplary.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Access network <b>105</b> may include one or multiple networks of one or multiple types and technologies. For example, access network <b>105</b> may include a 5G RAN, a Fourth Generation (4G) RAN, and/or another type of future generation RAN. By way of further example, access network <b>105</b> may be implemented to include a 5G-NR RAN, an Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) of a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, an LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) network, and/or an LTE-A Pro network, and/or another type of RAN (e.g., a legacy RAN). Access network <b>105</b> may further include other types of wireless networks, such as a WiFi network, a Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) network, a local area network (LAN), or another type of network that may provide an on-ramp to access stations <b>110</b> and/or core network <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Depending on the implementation, access network <b>105</b> may include one or multiple types of access stations <b>110</b>. For example, access station <b>110</b> may include a next generation Node B (gNB) for a 5G NR RAN. In other implementations, access station <b>110</b> may include an evolved Node B (eNB), an evolved Long Term Evolution (eLTE) eNB, a radio network controller (RNC), a remote radio head (RRH), a baseband unit (BBU), a small cell node (e.g., a picocell device, a femtocell device, a microcell device, a home eNB, a repeater, etc.), or another type of wireless node. According to various embodiments, access network <b>105</b> may be implemented according to various wireless technologies (e.g., radio access technology (RAT), etc.), wireless standards, wireless frequencies/bands, and so forth. According to an implementation, access stations <b>110</b> may include a gNB with multiple distributed components, such as a central unit (CU), a distributed unit (DU), a remote unit (RU or a remote radio unit (RRU)), or another type of distributed arrangement. Each access station <b>110</b> typically uses multiple carrier frequencies in a single instance. For example, a single access station <b>110</b> may provide coverage over an area referred to as a cell. According to implementations described herein, access station <b>110</b> may deactivate primary components to save power when access station <b>110</b> is not serving any UE devices (e.g., during off-peak periods). Access station <b>110</b> may include a power saving module to provide a low-power beacon by which UE devices <b>190</b> may recognize access station <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Edge network <b>130</b> includes a platform that provides application services at the edge of a network. For example, edge network <b>130</b> may be implemented as a Multi-access Edge Compute (MEC) platform. Edge network <b>130</b> may include network devices (not shown) located to provide geographic proximity to various groups of access stations <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, components of edge network <b>130</b> may be co-located with access stations <b>110</b> of RAN <b>105</b>. In other embodiments, access stations <b>110</b> may connect to edge network <b>130</b> via wired (e.g., optical) backhaul links <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Core network <b>150</b> may include one or multiple networks of one or multiple network types and technologies. For example, core network <b>150</b> may be implemented to include a next generation core (NGC) network for a 5G network, an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) of an LTE network, an LTE-A network, an LTE-A Pro network, and/or a legacy core network. Depending on the implementation, core network <b>150</b> may include various network components and devices, such as for example, a user plane function (UPF), an access and mobility management function (AMF), a session management function (SMF), a unified data management (UDM) device or function, an authentication server function (AUSF), a network slice selection function (NSSF), network data analytics function (NWDAF), and so forth.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">UE devices <b>190</b> may each include a mobile device, such as wireless or cellular telephone device (e.g., a conventional cell phone with data processing capabilities), a smart phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA) that can include a radiotelephone, etc. In another implementation, UE device <b>190</b> may include any type of mobile or fixed computer device or system, such as a personal computer (PC), a laptop, a tablet computer, a notebook, a netbook, a wearable computer (e.g., a wrist watch, eyeglasses, etc.), a game playing device, a music playing device, etc. In other implementations, UE devices <b>190</b> may be implemented as a machine-type communications (MTC) device, an Internet of Things (IoT) device, a machine-to-machine (M2M) device, etc., that includes communication functionality, such as a home appliance device, a home monitoring device, a camera, etc. UE devices <b>190</b> may connect to access stations <b>110</b> in a wireless manner. According to implementations described herein, UE device <b>190</b> may include logic to operate with power saving modules of access station <b>110</b>. UE devices <b>190</b> may detect beacon signals from access stations <b>110</b> in sleep mode and provide wake-up signals to request service from an access station <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating components of access station <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, access station <b>110</b> may include main access station components <b>210</b>, a main antenna module <b>220</b>, and a power saving module <b>230</b>. Main access station components <b>210</b> and main antenna module <b>220</b> may generally represent primary components that typically are responsible for the majority of the access station's power consumption.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Main access station components <b>210</b> may, in some implementations, be split into various components and located in a distributed fashion. Main access station components <b>210</b> may include a baseband processor <b>212</b>, a transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) unit <b>214</b>, a power amplifier <b>216</b>, and a band filter <b>218</b>. Main access station components <b>210</b> may collectively draw the majority of power consumption of access station <b>110</b>. In some implementations, main access station components <b>210</b> may also include a sleep manager <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Baseband processor <b>212</b> includes a device (e.g., a chip or part of a chip) in a network interface that manages radio functions that require the use of main antenna module <b>220</b>. Baseband processor <b>212</b> may include, in addition to other components, its own memory and software/firmware components.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Tx/Rx unit <b>214</b> may include a transmitter for transmitting data via one or more antennas of main antenna module <b>220</b> and a receiver for receiving data via one or more antennas of main antenna module <b>220</b>. Power amplifier <b>216</b> may amplify signals transmitted, or received, via antennas of main antenna module <b>220</b>. Power amplifier <b>216</b> may typically be the highest power-consuming component of access station <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Band filter <b>218</b> may pass frequencies within a particular band or group of bands from composite signal bands and may reject (or attenuate) frequencies in composite signal bands that are outside the particular band or group of bands.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, main access station components <b>210</b> may additionally include other components. For example, main access station components <b>210</b> may include air conditioning units, power conversion module, and/or other processing components (not shown), along with sleep manager <b>240</b> described further below.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Main antenna module <b>220</b> may include an array of antennas, such as, for example, a Full Dimension Multiple Input Multiple Output (FD-MIMO) or massive MIMO antenna array, that may form antenna beams in horizontal and/or vertical directions to enable each array of antennas to cover a three-dimensional space in the vicinity of each array. For example, each antenna array may include a number of horizontal antennas and a number of vertical antennas arranged in a row(s) and column(s) configuration. The antenna arrays may produce a wireless network coverage area within which UE devices <b>190</b> may transmit to, and receive from, main antenna module <b>220</b> via wireless transmissions. The wireless network coverage area may provide reliable wireless connections over a particular geographic area and have a certain maximum capacity and throughput.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to implementations described herein, main access station components <b>210</b> and main antenna module <b>220</b> may enter into a low power-consumption mode or sleep mode when access station <b>110</b> is not serving any UE devices <b>190</b>. While access station <b>110</b> is in sleep mode, power saving module <b>230</b> may provide a dedicated wake-up control for access station <b>110</b>. Power saving module <b>230</b> may be activated, for example, while main access station components <b>210</b> and main antenna module <b>220</b> are in power saving (or sleep) mode. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, power saving module <b>230</b> may include a power-save beacon transmitter <b>232</b> and a wake-up signal detector <b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Power-save beacon transmitter <b>232</b> may include an electronic device to transmit one or more signals for receipt by UE devices <b>190</b>. In one implementation, power-save beacon transmitter <b>232</b> may include a low-power transceiver for broadcasting a predetermined signal at periodic intervals and a battery or power connection for powering the transmitter. The signals transmitted by power-save beacon transmitter <b>232</b> indicate, for example, a regionally unique identifier value access station <b>110</b>. Power-save beacon transmitter <b>232</b> may transmit a beacon signal indicating access station <b>110</b> is in a power saving mode. For example, power-save beacon transmitter <b>232</b> may transmit a single waveform or tone, using low power, that correlates to a wake-up signal. According to an implementation, the beacon signal may indicate to properly-configured UE devices <b>190</b> that access station <b>110</b> is in a power saving mode. The waveform of the beacon signal may identify, for example, a label for a particular access station (e.g., among multiple neighboring access stations in RAN <b>105</b>). The label may correspond to, for example, a station ID or serial number of the access station <b>110</b>. Additionally, the beacon signal may indicate a power-saving level for access station <b>110</b>. The power-saving level may indicate, for example, a relative level of importance/priority for access station <b>110</b> to remain in power saving mode.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to an implementation, power-save beacon transmitter <b>232</b> may include dedicated circuitry, such as a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that may broadcast the beacon signal without activating main access station components <b>210</b> and main antenna module <b>220</b>. The power consumption of power-save beacon transmitter <b>232</b> may operate, for example, on a rough scale of less than 1% (or less than 0.05%) of normal power consumption levels for access station <b>110</b>. In other implementations, power-save beacon transmitter <b>232</b> may use software-based controls instead of dedicated circuitry.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Wake-up signal detector <b>234</b> may detect a wake-up signal sent by UE device <b>190</b>. The wake-up signal may include, for example, a signal outside the scope or operating parameters of typical radio resource management (RRM) signaling. According to an implementation, the wake-up signal detector <b>234</b> may be implemented with an analog or low complexity digital signal energy (non-coherent) detector, which minimizes power consumption. Wake-up signal detector <b>234</b> may correlate a wake-up signal from a given signal pattern. Wake-up signal detector <b>234</b> may be configured, for example, to only detect a wake-up signal pattern and ignore other signal patterns. In response to detecting a wake-up signal from a UE device <b>190</b>, wake-up signal detector <b>234</b> may activate main access station components <b>210</b> and main antenna module <b>220</b> to resume normal operation for access station <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Sleep manager <b>240</b> may manage powering down and powering up components of access station <b>110</b> for power savings. Sleep manager <b>240</b> may be included within main access station components <b>210</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), within power saving module <b>230</b>, or as a separate component. Sleep manager <b>240</b> may detect periods of inactivity and initiate a low power/sleep mode for access station <b>110</b>. According to an implementation, sleep manager <b>240</b> be configured to only initiate a sleep mode during certain time periods (e.g., night time, weekends, etc.) based on learned usage patterns for access station <b>110</b>. Sleep manager <b>240</b> may also respond to a wake-up signal from power saving module <b>230</b> to initiate a wake-up sequence for access station <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to an implementation, sleep manager <b>240</b> may cause individual components of main access station components <b>210</b> to resume operation gradually as needed during an access procedure from the UE device <b>190</b>. Additionally, if a wake-up signal from a single UE device provides device-type information, sleep manager <b>240</b> may have access station <b>110</b> provide cell search (e.g., primary synchronization signals (PSS), secondary synchronization signals (SSS), etc.) and/or system information (SI) directed for the UE device <b>190</b>. When there are only one or a few UE devices <b>190</b> with low data rate applications, sleep manager <b>240</b> may direct access station <b>110</b> to turn-off all common channels (e.g., PSS, SSS, SI, etc.) and only offer dedicated signals to the UE device(s) currently in service. In this context, power-save beacon transmitter <b>232</b> may continue to transmit a beacon signal to indicate its presence to new UE devices in the cell.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In still other implementations, sleep manager <b>240</b> may redirect UE device <b>110</b> to another cell (access station) based on signal measurements for power saving purposes. In yet another implementation, an active (awake) access station may track a UE device <b>190</b> heading into the cell of an access station in sleep mode.

Therefore, access station <b>110</b> may include additional, fewer and/or different components, that may be configured differently, than depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

According to an implementation, beacon monitor <b>310</b>, access eligibility checker <b>320</b>, wake-up signal generator <b>330</b>, and process timer <b>340</b> may be implemented as software or firmware in UE device <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Beacon monitor <b>310</b> may search for beacon signals (e.g., from power-save beacon transmitter <b>232</b>) to detect access stations <b>110</b> in sleep mode. Beacon monitor <b>310</b> may operate separately from and/or in addition to normal RRM signaling. According to an implementation, beacon monitor <b>310</b> may detect multiple beacon signals from different access stations <b>110</b> in sleep mode.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Access eligibility checker <b>320</b> may include logic to determine if UE device <b>190</b> is authorized to wake up an access station <b>110</b>.

According to an implementation, access eligibility checker <b>320</b> may be included within a unified access control (UAC) framework for 5G networks. In a UAC scenario, UE device <b>190</b> may be assigned an access identity number (AIN) that may indicate an access class configured for the end device, such that only certain AINs are authorized to wake up an access station. As an example, a stationary MTC device for non-critical information may be assigned to an access class that would not be eligible to wake up an access station.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">While existing access control focuses on network capacity and differentiating the UE devices, in a new UAC scenario, the access station power-saving level may be added as a consideration factor. The power saving level information from the beacon signal may influence whether UE device <b>190</b> is eligible to wake up a particular access station <b>110</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, where multiple beacon signals (e.g., from different access stations <b>110</b> in sleep mode) are detected, access eligibility checker <b>320</b> may grant access to wake up one access station (e.g., corresponding to a strongest signal) to avoid unnecessarily waking up multiple access stations.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Wake-up signal generator <b>330</b> may send a wake-up signal to access station <b>110</b>. For example, if access eligibility checker <b>320</b> determines that UE device <b>190</b> passes the eligibility check, wake-up signal generator <b>330</b> may send a wake-up signal to wake up access station <b>110</b>. Similar to the beacon signal from access station <b>110</b>, the wake-up signal generated by UE device <b>190</b> may be a simple waveform, which may contain the tag/label for the targeted access station to wake up.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Process timer <b>340</b> may include a timer to delay initiation of normal cell searching and cell access procedures by UE device <b>190</b>.

According to an implementation, process timer <b>340</b> may provide a configurable interval (e.g., 2-5 seconds after sending a wake-up signal) to enable access station <b>110</b> to begin normal operations before UE device <b>190</b> engages in conventional cell searching procedures.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows exemplary components of UE device <b>190</b>, in other implementations, UE device <b>190</b> may include fewer components, different components, or additional components than depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

In response to entering sleep mode, access station <b>110</b> (e.g., power saving module <b>230</b>) may begin transmitting a power-saving beacon signal <b>410</b>. According to an implementation, beacon signal <b>410</b> may be a simple waveform and may contain limited information, such as a label and a power saving level for access station <b>110</b>. For example, beacon signal <b>410</b> may include a predetermined sequence, such as Zadoff-Chu sequence, m-sequence, etc. As another example, beacon signal <b>410</b> may include a modulated signal of e.g., a tag or ID that may be transmitted constantly or at an interval.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">When UE device <b>190</b> enters a coverage area/cell for access station <b>110</b>, UE device <b>190</b> may receive power-saving beacon signal <b>410</b>.
