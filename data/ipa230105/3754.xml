Particularly, there is great emphasis on providing quick and accurate test results in critical care settings. In vitro diagnostic testing is usually performed using instruments operable to execute one or more processing steps or workflow steps on one or more biological samples and/or one or more reagents, such as pre-analytical instruments, post-analytical instruments and also analytical instruments.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Analytical instruments or analyzers are configured to obtain a measurement value. An analyzer is operable to determine via various chemical, biological, physical, optical or other technical procedures a parameter value of the sample or a component thereof. An analyzer may be operable to measure said parameter of the sample or of at least one analyte and return the obtained measurement value. The list of possible analysis results returned by the analyzer comprises, without limitation, concentrations of the analyte in the sample, a digital (yes or no) result indicating the existence of the analyte in the sample (corresponding to a concentration above the detection level), optical parameters, DNA or RNA sequences, data obtained from mass spectroscopy of proteins or metabolites and physical or chemical parameters of various types. An analytical instrument may comprise units assisting with the pipetting, dosing, and mixing of samples and/or reagents.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The analyzer may comprise a reagent holding unit for holding reagents to perform the assays. Reagents may be arranged for example in the form of vessels, containers or cassettes containing individual reagents or group of reagents, placed in appropriate receptacles or positions within a storage compartment or conveyor. It may comprise a consumable feeding unit. The analyzer may comprise a process and detection system whose workflow is optimized for certain types of analysis. Examples of such analyzers are clinical chemistry analyzers, coagulation chemistry analyzers, immunochemistry analyzers, urine analyzers, nucleic acid analyzers, used to detect the result of chemical or biological reactions or to monitor the progress of chemical or biological reactions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such automatic analyzers allow to increase the number of analytical processes and obtainable measurements values. For this reason, such automatic analyzers use several reagents provided in reagent vessels at the same time. For example, 6 to 8 different reagents are used with such an automatic analyzer. Typically, the reagent is drawn from the reagent vessel by means of an immersion tube immersed into the reagent vessel. In order to ensure that the correct reagent is supplied to the automatic analyzer for its target analytical process, it is necessary to identify the reagent and to ensure that the respective reagent vessel is at its target position. This kind of identification usually takes place only when a reagent vessel is replaced. The replacement process is rather cumbersome as the reagent vessels are usually closed by means of a cap threaded thereto.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Although the embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to specific advantages or functionality, it is noted that in accordance with the present disclosure an automatic analyzer is provided that aims to facilitate the replacement process for the reagent vessel and to reduce the risk of a faulty operation when replacing a reagent vessel.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with one embodiment of the disclosure, an automatic analyzer for analyzing samples is provided, comprising: an immersion tube configured to retrieve a reagent stored in a reagent vessel, a lifting device configured to lift and to lower the immersion tube, wherein the lifting device comprises: a guide rail on which the immersion tube is slidably moveable between a lowered position, in which the immersion tube is configured to be immersed into the reagent vessel, and a lifted position, in which the immersion tube is configured to be retracted from the reagent vessel, and at least one biasing member configured to bias the immersion tube towards the lowered position with a predetermined biasing force, a detector configured to detect an identity of the reagent, and a locking device configured to lock the immersion tube in the lifted position and to allow the immersion tube to be moved towards the lowered position only if the identity of the reagent detected by the detector corresponds to a target identity of the reagent.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These and other features of the embodiments of the present disclosure will be more fully understood from the following detailed description taken together with the accompanying claims.

Thus, these terms may both refer to a situation in which, besides the feature introduced by these terms, no further features are present in the entity described in this context and to a situation in which one or more further features are present. As an example, the expressions &#x201c;A has B&#x201d;, &#x201c;A comprises B&#x201d; and &#x201c;A includes B&#x201d; may both refer to a situation in which, besides B, no other element is present in A (i.e., a situation in which A solely and exclusively consists of B) and to a situation in which, besides B, one or more further elements are present in entity A, such as element C, elements C and D or even further elements.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further, it shall be noted that the terms &#x201c;at least one&#x201d;, &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; or similar expressions indicating that a feature or element may be present once or more than once typically will be used only once when introducing the respective feature or element. In the following, in most cases, when referring to the respective feature or element, the expressions &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; or &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; will not be repeated, non-withstanding the fact that the respective feature or element may be present once or more than once.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further, as used in the following, the terms &#x201c;typically&#x201d;, &#x201c;more typically&#x201d;, &#x201c;particularly&#x201d;, &#x201c;more particularly&#x201d;, &#x201c;specifically&#x201d;, &#x201c;more specifically&#x201d; or similar terms are used in conjunction with optional features, without restricting alternative possibilities. Thus, features introduced by these terms are optional features and are not intended to restrict the scope of the claims in any way. The disclosure may, as the skilled person will recognize, be performed by using alternative features. Similarly, features introduced by &#x201c;in an embodiment of the disclosure&#x201d; or similar expressions are intended to be optional features, without any restriction regarding alternative embodiments of the disclosure, without any restrictions regarding the scope of the disclosure and without any restriction regarding the possibility of combining the features introduced in such way with other optional or non-optional features of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the disclosed automatic analyzer, the automatic analyzer comprises an immersion tube configured to retrieve a reagent stored in a reagent vessel. The automatic analyzer further comprises a lifting device configured to lift and to lower the immersion tube. The lifting device comprises a guide rail on which the immersion tube is slidably moveable between a lowered position, in which the immersion tube is configured to be immersed into the reagent vessel, and a lifted position, in which the immersion tube is configured to be retracted from the reagent vessel, and at least one biasing member configured to bias the immersion tube towards the lowered position with a predetermined biasing force. The automatic analyzer further comprises a detector configured to detect an identity of the reagent. The automatic analyzer further comprises a locking device configured to lock the immersion tube in the lifted position and to allow the immersion tube to be moved towards the lowered position only if the identity of the reagent detected by the detector corresponds to a target identity of the reagent.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">With other words, the immersion tube may be raised from a lowered position, in which it is immersed into the reagent vessel, to an upper position, in which the immersion tube is retracted from the reagent vessel, by means of a lifting device. As the immersion tube is usually manually raised by a user from the lowered position, there is a risk of a faulty operation. Particularly, the user may replace the reagent vessel while the new immersion tube is not fully in the upper position but the user holds the immersion tube at an intermediate position just allowing to change the reagent vessel as the immersion tube is retracted from the reagent vessel. If the user subsequently lowers the immersion tube, the identification process has not been triggered and a wrong reagent may be drawn by the immersion tube with the risk of a damage to the analytical instrument and/or with the result of a wrong measurement result which may be even dangerous to life. With the present disclosure, the identification of the reagent is initiated when the immersion tube is correctly in its upper position. The identification of the reagent is triggered by a locking mechanism configured to at least temporarily lock the immersion tube in its upper position where it is locked by the locking mechanism. Further, as the immersion tube is biased towards the lowered position with a predetermined biasing force, the immersion tube is reliably pressed into the reagent vessel. Thus, any evaporation of the reagent being hazardous may be reliably prevented as a sufficient sealing force may be provided which acts onto a rim defining an opening of the reagent vessel such as an opening at a reagent bottle neck.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The term &#x201c;automatic analyzer&#x201d; as used herein is a broad term and is to be given its ordinary and customary meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art and is not to be limited to a special or customized meaning.

The term specifically may refer, without limitation, to a device, module, machine, or subsystem configured to detect events or changes in its environment and send the information to other electronics, frequently a computer processor. A detector is typically used with other electronics. Particularly, the detector is configured to detect or read information provided by the presence of an information carrier such as a marker.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The detector may be a RFID reader configured to detect the identity of the reagent by means of a RFID tag located at the reagent vessel. Alternatively or in addition, the detector may be a barcode reader configured to detect the identity of the reagent by means of a barcode located at the reagent vessel. Such readers allow a reliable detection of the tag or barcode and the information provided thereby. Thus, the reagent identity may be reliably detected.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The lifting device may further comprise an immersion tube holder holding the immersion tube and moveably mounted to the guide rail, a first support member connected to the at least one biasing member and moveably mounted to the guide rail, and a first engaging member configured to engage the immersion tube holder, wherein the first engaging member may be arranged adjacent a lower end of the guide rail, wherein the first engaging member may be configured to releasably lock the immersion tube holder and to integrally move the immersion tube into the lowered position when engaged therewith. The immersion tube holder safely supports or carries the immersion tube similar to a slide. Thus, the immersion tube is safely guided. The first engaging member allows to temporarily engage the immersion tube holder and to soften the movement of the immersion tube holder by means of locking the same. When the immersion tube holder is engaged and locked by the first engaging member, both concertedly move towards the lowered position with an even and smooth movement.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The first engaging member may be pivotable around a first axis being perpendicular with respect to a centerline of the guide rail. Thus, the immersion tube holder may be reliably locked by means of a pivotal movement of the first engaging member.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The first axis may be spaced apart from the centerline of the guide rail. Thus, a torque is caused around the first axis, which facilitates the pivotal movement and the locking of the first engaging member.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The immersion tube holder may comprise a first pin or roller, wherein the first engaging member may comprise a first slot configured to engage the first pin or roller. Thus, the first pin or roller may be reliably inserted into the first slot which provides a guiding of the first pin or roller. Thereby, the locking operation may be carried out in a reliable manner.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The first slot may be formed at least partially inclined with respect to the centerline of the guide rail such that the first engaging member is configured to be rotated around the first axis when engaging the first pin or roller. Thus, the insertion of the first pin or roller into the first slot is facilitated. Further, the inclination of the first slot increases the torque acting on the first axis.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The automatic analyzer may further comprise a first slotted guide member comprising a first guide slot and being arranged adjacent to the lower end of the guide rail and a first link assembly engaging the first guide slot and pivotally connected to the first engaging member, wherein the first guide slot may comprise a first slot portion being substantially parallel to the centerline of the guide rail and a second slot portion being substantially perpendicular to the centerline of the guide rail. Thus, the pivotal movement of the first engaging member is facilitated and automatically initiated as soon as the first engaging member engages the immersion tube holder.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The first link assembly may comprise a first link engaging the first guide slot and a second link pivotally connected to the first engaging member at a first position spaced apart from the first axis, wherein the first link and the second link may be pivotally connected to one another. Thus, a smooth movement of the links is provided which provides the pivotal movement of the first engaging member with a rather small force.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first link may be connected to a first link biasing member configured to bias the first link in a direction inclined with respect to the centerline of the guide rail and away from the second link. Thus, a kind of automatic guiding is provided.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The lifting device may further comprise a second support member connected to the at least one biasing member and mounted to the guide rail, and a second engaging member configured to engage the immersion tube holder, wherein the second engaging member may be arranged adjacent an upper end of the guide rail, wherein the second engaging member may be configured to releasably lock the immersion tube holder and to integrally move the immersion tube into the lifted position when engaged therewith.

Thus, the pivotal movement of the second engaging member is facilitated and automatically initiated as soon as the second engaging member engages the immersion tube holder.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The second link assembly may comprise a third link engaging the second guide slot and a fourth link pivotally connected to the second engaging member at a second position spaced apart from the second axis, wherein the third link and the fourth link may be pivotally connected to one another. Thus, a smooth movement of the links is provided which provides the pivotal movement of the second engaging member with a rather small force.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The third link may be connected to a second link biasing member configured to bias the third link in a direction inclined with respect to the centerline of the guide rail and away from the fourth link. Thus, a kind of automatic guiding is provided.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The second support member may be moveably mounted to the guide rail and the at least one biasing member may be configured to bias the immersion tube towards the lifted position with a predetermined biasing force. Thus, a faulty operation for a user is reliably prevented as the immersion tube is biased or forced into the lifted position where it is locked and the user may not hold the immersion tube at an intermediate position when replacing a reagent vessel.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The automatic analyzer may further comprise a lever member mounted to the second support member and rotatable around a third axis parallel to the second axis, wherein the second engaging member and the lever member may be rotatable in opposite directions. Thus, an alternative mechanism for safely guiding the immersion tube into the lifted position is provided.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The second engaging member may be connected to a first gear, wherein the lever member may be connected to a second gear, wherein the first gear and the second gear may engage with one another. Thus, a reliable mechanism for pivoting the second engaging member is provided.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The automatic analyzer may further comprise a lever biasing member connected to the lever member and to the second engaging member. The lever biasing member may be configured to bias the immersion tube towards the lifted position with a predetermined biasing force. Thus, the lever member and the second engaging member may be biased into predetermined positions.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The lever biasing member may be configured to provide a biasing force to the lever member and the second engaging member in a direction of its two connection points towards one another. Thereby, the second engaging member may be biased into a position configured to lock the immersion tube in the lifted position. Thus, this kind of lock is designed in a way that it will lock the immersion tube safely in the lifted position but can be easily unlocked by the operator or user to lower the immersion tube again after the reagent vessel has been exchanged.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The automatic analyzer may further comprise a guide pulley arranged adjacent the lower end of the guide rail and configured to turn the at least one biasing member round. Thus, the characteristic of the biasing member may be flattened. Thereby, any abrupt movements of the immersion tube having an excessive acceleration may be avoided.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The at least one biasing member may be a spring. Thus, the biasing effect may be realized by a rather simple and well established constructional member which decreases the manufacturing costs.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The automatic analyzer may further comprise a sealing member arranged at the immersion tube and configured to seal an opening of the reagent vessel by engaging a rim of the opening. The sealing member may be a sealing ring. Thus, any evaporation of the reagent may be reliably prevented as the sealing member is pressed onto the rim in a gas tight manner.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The automatic analyzer may further comprise a bellows connected to the immersion tube with a first end of the bellows being fixed to the immersion tube and a second end of the bellows being moveable with respect to the immersion tube. In this respect, it has to be noted that many reagent vessels commercially available have varying outer heights and/or varying bottom thickness involving varying inner heights. In this respect, the inner height may be defined from the opening at the neck of the reagent vessel to the inner surface of the bottom of the reagent vessel which faces the opening. Thus, if the distance of the sealing member stationary fixed at the immersion tube situations to the leading end of the immersion tube is constant, situations may occur where the sealing member is pressed onto the rim defining the reagent vessel opening but the leading end of the immersion tube is spaced apart from the bottom of the reagent vessel which causes loss of reagent or the leading end of the immersion tube contacts the bottom of the reagent vessel but the sealing member is spaced apart of the rim defining the reagent vessel opening which causes a leakage of potential hazardous reagent vapor into the environment. With the provision of a bellows having only one end fixed to the immersion tube, a contact of the immersion tube and the bottom of the reagent vessel is reliably ensured increasing the amount of reagent available from the reagent vessel as well as an excessive distance from the immersion to the bottom of the reagent vessel causing an excessive loss of reagent due to a dead volume thereof will be avoided. Further, a reliable engagement of the sealing member with the rim defining the reagent vessel opening is realized. The bellows allows to adapt the effective length of the immersion tube to the inner height of the reagent vessel due to the relative movability.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The bellows may be arranged at the immersion tube at a position which is outside of the reagent vessel when the immersion tube is at its lowered position. Thus, a contact of the reagent and the bellows is avoided.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Alternatively, the bellows may be arranged at the immersion tube at a position which is inside of the reagent vessel when the immersion tube is at its lowered position. Thus, the constructional space above the reagent vessel may be decreased.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The bellows may be connected to or integrally formed with the sealing member. Thus, the sealing effect as well as the height compensation of the reagent vessel may be realized by means of a single constructional member.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The bellows may be at least partially made of a fluoropolymer, typically PTFE, or steel. Such materials prevent any leachables and extractables into the reagent.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The sealing member may comprise a ventilation orifice. Thus, a negative pressure within the reagent vessel during retrieving the reagent by means of the immersion tube is prevented.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The ventilation orifice may be provided with a filter member or the like. Such a filter member is provided in order to avoid leakage of potential hazardous vapors from the reagent and/or deterioration of the reagent caused by contamination with the incoming air.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further disclosed and proposed herein is a computer program including computer-executable instructions for performing the method or operation of the apparatus according to the present disclosure in one or more of the embodiments enclosed herein when the program is executed on a computer or computer network.

The second engaging member <b>156</b> is mounted to the second support member <b>154</b>. The at least one biasing member <b>116</b> is connected to the second support member <b>154</b>. For example, the at least one biasing member <b>116</b> is connected to the second support member <b>154</b> at a position adjacent end edge facing the lower end <b>124</b> of the guide rail <b>114</b>. The second engaging member <b>156</b> is configured to releasably lock the immersion tube holder <b>118</b> and to move the immersion tube <b>110</b> into the lifted position when engaged therewith.

The lever member <b>164</b> is connected to a second gear <b>166</b> and integrally rotatable therewith around a third axis <b>168</b>. The third axis <b>168</b> is parallel to the second axis <b>160</b>. The first gear <b>162</b> and the second gear <b>166</b> engage or mesh with one another. Thus, the second engaging member <b>156</b> and the lever member <b>164</b> are rotatable in opposite directions. Further, a lever biasing member <b>170</b> is connected to the lever member <b>164</b> at a position spaced apart from the third axis <b>168</b> and to the second engaging member <b>156</b> at a position spaced apart from the second axis <b>160</b>.

Further, the second support member <b>154</b> comprises at least one stopper member <b>171</b> configured to limit a rotational or pivotal movement of the second engagement member <b>156</b>. In the present embodiment, there are two stopper members <b>171</b>. The stopper members <b>171</b> are formed as protrusions or pins protruding from the second support member <b>154</b>. The stopper members <b>171</b> are arranged at the second support member <b>154</b> on opposite sides of the second engagement member <b>156</b>. Particularly, one stopper member <b>171</b> is located above the second engagement member <b>156</b> and the other stopper member <b>171</b> is located below the second engagement member <b>156</b> with respect to the centerline <b>128</b> of the guide rail <b>114</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, when the immersion tube <b>110</b> and the immersion tube holder <b>118</b>, respectively, are not in the lifted position, the second engagement member <b>156</b> engages the lower stopper member <b>171</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, when the immersion tube <b>110</b> and the immersion tube holder <b>118</b>, respectively, are in the lifted position, the second engagement member <b>156</b> engages the upper stopper member <b>171</b>. Thus, the stopper members <b>171</b> limit a rotational or pivotal movement of the second engagement member <b>156</b>. The position of the stopper members <b>171</b> provides that the angle between the second slot <b>174</b> of the second engaging member <b>156</b> and the centerline <b>128</b> of the guide rail <b>144</b> in the rotated position of the second engagement member <b>156</b> when engaging the second pin or roller <b>172</b> becomes too small. If this angle was too small, then the immersion tube holder <b>118</b> and the second pin or roller <b>172</b> may not be released from the second engagement member <b>156</b>. Basically, only one stopper member <b>171</b> may be present. For example, the second engagement member <b>156</b> may comprise a depression, slot or hole at least in a surface facing the second support member <b>154</b> which is engaged by a single stopper member <b>171</b> protruding from the second support member <b>154</b>.

The second slot <b>174</b> is formed at least partially inclined with respect to the centerline <b>128</b> of the guide rail <b>114</b> such that the second engaging member <b>156</b> is configured to be rotated around the second axis <b>160</b> when engaging the second pin or roller <b>172</b>. One of the walls defining the second slot <b>174</b> which faces the lower end <b>124</b> of the guide rail <b>114</b> is shorter than the opposing wall. The lever biasing member <b>170</b> is connected to the second engaging member <b>156</b> at a position located between the second axis <b>160</b> and a rear end of the second slot <b>174</b>. The lever biasing member <b>170</b> provides a biasing force to the lever member <b>164</b> and the second engaging member <b>156</b> in a direction of the two connection points towards one another. The two connection points for the lever biasing member <b>170</b> are arranged such that in the initial state of the lever biasing member <b>170</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>9</b></figref>, an imaginary line connecting the two connection points does not intersect with the second axis <b>160</b> but passes slightly below thereof.

Particularly, with the present embodiment, the sealing member <b>178</b> is moveable relative to the immersion tube <b>110</b>. The sealing member <b>178</b> may be a sealing ring as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The sealing member <b>178</b> comprises a ventilation orifice <b>184</b>. The ventilation orifice <b>184</b> may be provided with a filter member (not shown in detail) or the like in order to avoid that any vapor from the interior of the reagent vessel <b>106</b> gets out of the reagent vessel <b>106</b> and/or deterioration of the reagent caused by contamination of the reagent with the incoming air. The automatic analyzer <b>100</b> further comprises a bellows <b>186</b> connected to the immersion tube <b>110</b> with a first end <b>188</b> of the bellows <b>186</b> being fixed to the immersion tube <b>110</b> and a second end <b>190</b> of the bellows <b>186</b> being moveable with respect to the immersion tube <b>110</b>.

The bellows <b>186</b> is connected to or integrally formed with the sealing member <b>178</b>. The bellows <b>186</b> is at least partially made of a polymer, particularly fluoropolymer, or steel. For example, the bellows <b>186</b> is made of PTFE. The bellows <b>186</b> is compressible or extendible by a distance or length of about 5 to 20 mm.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the bellows <b>186</b> and the immersion tube <b>110</b>. In order to ensure a sufficient sealing force, the bellows <b>186</b> may be provided with a bellows biasing member <b>191</b> which is configured to bias the sealing member <b>178</b> into its sealing position. The provision of such a bellows biasing member <b>191</b> is particularly relevant if the bellows <b>186</b> is made of a fluoropolymer. The bellows biasing member <b>191</b> may be arranged within the bellows <b>186</b>.

Thus, the tension spring tends to compress the bellows <b>186</b> and to pull the sealing member <b>178</b> towards the first end <b>188</b> of the bellows <b>186</b>. The biasing force of the bellows biasing member is less than the biasing force of the biasing member <b>116</b>. The biasing member <b>116</b> tends to move the immersion tube <b>110</b> so as to contact an inner surface of the bottom of the reagent vessel <b>106</b>. For this reason, the immersion tube <b>110</b> may comprise one or more lateral openings at its leading end through which the reagent may be sucked or the leading end of the immersion tube <b>110</b> may comprise small spacers or filter members which avoids the openings to be blocked or obstructed by the bottom of the reagent vessel <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0140"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a perspective view of the bellows <b>186</b> and the immersion tube <b>110</b> according to a first modification.

The locking lever <b>194</b> comprises a hook <b>200</b> located adjacent a front end <b>202</b> of the locking lever <b>194</b>. The hook <b>200</b> is configured to engage the lever member <b>164</b>. The locking lever <b>194</b> comprises a protrusion <b>204</b> such as a pin which may be located in the center of the locking lever <b>194</b>. The locking device <b>192</b> further comprises a tension spring <b>206</b> which is connected to the locking lever <b>194</b> and the second support member <b>154</b>. The tension spring <b>206</b> provides a biasing force to the locking lever <b>194</b> in a direction towards the second support member <b>154</b>. The locking device <b>192</b> further comprises a stopper <b>208</b> configured to stop the lever member <b>164</b>. The locking device <b>192</b> further comprises a drawing lever <b>210</b> having a hole <b>212</b> such as an elongated or slotted hole.

Needless to say, any drive configured to move the locking lever <b>194</b> away from the lever member <b>164</b> may be applied. For example, an eccentric cam acting to a lower side of the locking lever and driven by a drive, a magnet such as an electric magnet drawing the locking lever <b>194</b> away from the lever member <b>164</b> or a rotating magnet may be applied. The locking device <b>192</b> may be modified in that the locking lever <b>194</b> does not comprise the protrusion <b>204</b> engaging the hole <b>212</b> of the drawing lever <b>210</b>. Rather, the hole <b>212</b> is a through hole or slot and the locking lever extend through the hole <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows a perspective view of the upper part of the lifting device <b>112</b> according to a modification of the present disclosure. Hereinafter, only the differences from the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>15</b></figref> will be explained and like constructional members are identified by like reference numerals. Generally, with the modified embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the upper part of the lifting device <b>112</b> is similar to the lower part but inverted. In this respect, it has to be noted that the at least one biasing member <b>116</b> does not need to be the same as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>15</b></figref> but may be connected to another part than the first support member <b>120</b>. For example, the may be two biasing members <b>116</b>, wherein one biasing member <b>116</b> is connected to the first support member <b>120</b> as well as to an intermediate member not shown in detail located stationary between the upper and lower parts of the lifting device <b>112</b> and the other biasing member <b>116</b> is connected to the second support member <b>154</b> and to the intermediate member or any other stationary intermediate position. The long arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is intended to indicate the position for the immersion tube holder <b>118</b> and the immersion tube <b>110</b> shown in the right portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>. Particularly, according to the modified embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the automatic analyzer <b>100</b> comprises a second slotted guide member <b>222</b> comprising a second guide slot <b>224</b> and being arranged adjacent to or at the upper end <b>158</b> of the guide rail <b>114</b>. The second guide slot <b>224</b> comprises a third slot portion <b>226</b> being substantially parallel to the centerline <b>128</b> of the guide rail <b>114</b> and a fourth slot portion <b>228</b> being substantially perpendicular to the centerline <b>128</b> of the guide rail <b>114</b>. The third slot portion <b>226</b> and the fourth slot portion <b>228</b> transition into one another. The automatic analyzer <b>100</b> comprises a second link assembly <b>230</b> engaging the second guide slot <b>224</b> and pivotally connected to the second engaging member <b>156</b>. The second link assembly <b>230</b> comprises a third link <b>232</b> engaging the second guide slot <b>224</b> and a fourth link <b>234</b> pivotally connected to the second engaging member <b>156</b> at a second position <b>235</b> spaced apart from the second axis <b>160</b>. The third link <b>232</b> and the fourth link <b>234</b> are pivotally connected to one another. The third link <b>232</b> is connected to a second link biasing member <b>236</b> configured to bias the third link <b>232</b> in a direction inclined with respect to the centerline <b>128</b> of the guide rail <b>114</b> and away from the fourth link <b>234</b>. The locking device <b>192</b> is also present. The hook <b>200</b> of the locking lever <b>194</b> is configured to engage the third link <b>232</b>. For example, the third link <b>232</b> comprises a depression or the like which is engageable by the hook <b>200</b>. The third link <b>232</b> engages the second guide slot <b>224</b> by means of a roller or the like.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0144">The automatic analyzer <b>100</b> may further be modified as will be explained in further detail below. The lifting device <b>112</b> may be operated by a robot or the like independent or separate from the automatic analyser <b>100</b> as it allows rather great tolerances with the operation and despite reliably allows to move into the end positions, i.e., the lowered position and the lifted position, due to the support by the biasing member <b>116</b>. Further, the lifting device <b>112</b> only requires a linear movement upwards and downwards. The robot may also realize the replacement of a reagent vessel <b>106</b>. The communication with the robot for lowering the immersion tube may be wireless such as by means of WLAN, Bluetooth, video or infrared signal after a positive check of the reagent vessel <b>106</b> from the detector <b>108</b> and its controller. Further, the automatic analyzer <b>100</b> may inform a user via a display or the like or the robot via a wireless communication such as by means of WLAN, Bluetooth, video or infrared signal to lift the immersion tube <b>110</b> and to take an empty reagent vessel <b>106</b>. The biasing member <b>116</b> and/or the lever biasing member <b>170</b> may be a spiral spring.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0145">Hereinafter, an operation of the automatic analyzer <b>100</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>13</b></figref>. The explanation of the operation starts with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> showing the reagent vessel <b>106</b> loaded into the automatic analyzer <b>100</b>. The immersion tube <b>110</b> is in the lowered position where it is inserted into the reagent vessel <b>106</b>. Further explanations of the operation are given with the assumption that the detector <b>108</b> has identified a correct reagent of the reagent vessel <b>106</b>. In order to move the immersion tube <b>110</b> into the lowered position, reference is made firstly with respect to the lower part of the lifting device <b>112</b> starting with an intermediate position between the lifted positon and the lowered position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0146">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, when the immersion tube <b>110</b> is in the intermediate position, the first support member <b>120</b> is spaced apart from the lower end <b>124</b> of the guide rail <b>114</b> at a distance of 20 to 40 mm such as 30 mm. The first engaging member <b>122</b> is oriented such that the first slot <b>132</b> extends parallel to the centerline <b>128</b> of the guide rail <b>114</b> with the opening of the first slot <b>132</b> facing the upper end <b>158</b> of the guide rail <b>114</b>. The first link <b>146</b> of the first link assembly <b>140</b> is located in the second slot portion <b>144</b> of the first slotted guide member <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0147">When the immersion tube <b>110</b> and the immersion tube holder <b>118</b> are further lowered as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the first pin or roller <b>130</b> of the immersion tube holder <b>118</b> starts to enter the first slot <b>132</b> of the first engaging member <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0148">Thereby, the first engaging member <b>122</b> is rotated or pivoted counter clockwise as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The pivotal movement of the first engaging member <b>122</b> is substantially facilitated by the user's manual movement but additionally by the weight of the immersion tube holder <b>118</b> and the first axis <b>126</b> being spaced apart from the centerline <b>128</b> of the guide rail <b>114</b>. At the same time, the first link <b>146</b> is pivoted relative to the second link <b>148</b> and moves from the second slot portion <b>144</b> into the first slot portion <b>142</b> of the first guide slot <b>138</b>. Further, the first support member <b>120</b> is automatically moved downwards to the lower end <b>124</b> of the guide rail <b>114</b> by means of the biasing force of the biasing member <b>116</b>. Thereby, the immersion tube <b>110</b> and the immersion tube holder <b>118</b> are moved into the lowered position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The biasing force provided by the biasing member <b>116</b> is adjusted such that the immersion tube holder <b>118</b> is moved without any excessive acceleration and that the sealing member <b>178</b> is pressed onto the rim <b>182</b> of the opening <b>180</b> of the reagent vessel <b>106</b> with sufficient force to prevent any leakage of evaporated reagent. Further, the bellows <b>186</b> allows to compensate any variation of the height of different reagent vessels <b>106</b>. With other words, when the immersion tube holder <b>118</b> is lowered, it is automatically coupled to the first engaging member <b>122</b> at the first support member <b>120</b> as of a predetermined position close to the lowered position which is defined by the point of engagement of the first pin or roller <b>130</b> and the first slot <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0149">When the immersion tube <b>110</b> or the immersion tube holder <b>118</b> is lifted as shown in FIG.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0150"><b>7</b>, for example because a replacement of the reagent vessel <b>106</b> is intended, the user lifts the immersion tube holder <b>118</b>. Thereby, the first support member <b>120</b> is moved upwards. Further, the first link <b>146</b> is pivoted relative to the second link <b>148</b> and moves from the first slot portion <b>142</b> into the second slot portion <b>144</b> of the first guide slot <b>138</b> which is facilitated by the first link biasing member <b>152</b>. Thereby, the first engaging member <b>122</b> is rotated or pivoted clockwise and the first link assembly <b>140</b> is preloaded.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0151">In order to move the immersion tube <b>110</b> into the lifted position, reference is made secondly with respect to the upper part of the lifting device <b>112</b> starting with the intermediate position between the lifted positon and the lowered position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0152">When further lifting the immersion tube <b>110</b> and the immersion tuber holder <b>118</b>, the immersion tube holder <b>118</b> advances the second engaging member <b>156</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, when the immersion tube holder <b>118</b> is in the intermediate position, the second slot <b>174</b> of the second engaging member <b>156</b> is oriented inclined with respect to the centerline <b>128</b> of the guide rail <b>114</b> and the opening of the second slot <b>174</b> faces downwards towards the lower end <b>124</b> of the guide rail <b>114</b>. Further, the lever member <b>164</b> is in a position being rotated counter-clockwise.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0153">When the immersion tube <b>110</b> and the immersion tube holder <b>118</b> is further lifted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the second pin or roller <b>172</b> of the immersion tube holder <b>118</b> is inserted into the second slot <b>174</b> and engages the upper wall thereof. Thereby, the second engaging member <b>156</b> is rotated or pivoted counter-clockwise. At the same time, the lever member <b>164</b> is rotated or pivoted clockwise due to the meshing of the first gear <b>162</b> and the second gear <b>166</b> which is facilitated by the biasing force of the lever biasing member <b>170</b>. Thus, the immersion tube <b>110</b> and the immersion tube holder <b>118</b> are automatically moved into the lifted position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. The biasing force of the lever biasing member <b>170</b> is adjusted such that the immersion tube <b>110</b> is moved into the lifted position without excessive acceleration so as to avoid a splattering of any reagent adhering to the immersion tube <b>110</b>. With other words, when the immersion tube holder <b>118</b> is lifted, it is automatically coupled to the second engaging member <b>156</b> at the second support member <b>154</b> as of a predetermined position close to the lifted position which is defined by the point of engagement of the second pin or roller <b>172</b> and the second slot <b>174</b>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0154">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>15</b></figref>, the immersion tube <b>110</b> is locked in the lifted position by means of the locking device <b>192</b> as the hook <b>200</b> of the locking lever <b>194</b> engages the lever member <b>164</b>. The stopper <b>208</b> for the locking lever <b>194</b> is provided in order to allow the drawing lever <b>210</b> to actuate the locking lever <b>194</b> when the immersion tube <b>110</b> is drawn into the lifted position.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0155">In the lifted position, the immersion tube <b>110</b> is retracted from the reagent vessel <b>106</b> such that the reagent vessel may be replaced by a new or other reagent vessel <b>106</b>.
