Supply chain management is a crucial process because an optimized supply chain results in lower costs and a faster production cycle. Business logistics management refers to the production and distribution process within the company, while supply chain management includes suppliers, manufacturers, logistics and transportation companies and retailers that distribute the product to the end customer. Supply chains include every business that comes in contact with a particular product, including companies that assemble and deliver parts to the manufacturer.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Factoring is a financial transaction and a type of debtor finance in which a business in the supply chain sells at a discount its accounts receivable of a buyer to a third party often referred to as a factor. A business in a supply chain often will &#x201c;factor&#x201d; receivable assets to meet present and immediate cash needs generally to support manufacturing and growth efforts. Factoring is commonly referred to as accounts receivable factoring, invoice factoring, and sometimes accounts receivable financing. But accounts receivable financing is a term most accurately used to describe this form of asset based lending against accounts receivable.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In factoring, the initial sale of a receivable by a seller in the supply chain transfers ownership of the receivable to the factor, such that the factor obtains all of the rights associated with the receivables. Accordingly, the receivable becomes the asset of the factor, and the factor obtains the right to receive the payments made by the debtor for the invoice amount and is free to pledge or exchange the receivable asset without unreasonable constraints or restrictions. Usually, the account debtor is notified of the sale of the receivable, and the factor makes all collections; however, non-notification factoring, where the seller collects the accounts sold to the factor, as agent of the factor, also occurs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Central to the success of the factoring process is the accurate exchange of reliable information as to the terms of sale of goods or services for which payment is subject to factoring, and the access to a broader market of factors in optimizing the cost of the transaction. Presently, factoring is largely a manual process in which the personal relationship between factor and seller of the goods or services drives the nature of each factored transaction and the volume of such transaction. For unfamiliar pairs of factors and sellers, trust is lacking as is the timely knowledge of factoring opportunities. Accordingly, inefficiencies remain integral to conventional supply chain factoring.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the present invention address technical deficiencies of the art in respect to supply chain financing and specifically, to the management of transaction factoring. To that end, embodiments of the present invention provide for a novel and non-obvious method for supply chain factoring utilizing shared state information stored in a distributed ledger. Embodiments of the present invention also provide for a novel and non-obvious computing device adapted to perform the foregoing method. Finally, embodiments of the present invention provide for a novel and non-obvious data processing system incorporating the foregoing device in order to perform the foregoing method.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment of the invention, a method for supply chain factoring utilizing shared state information stored in a distributed ledger includes the selection of an electronic supply chain document associated with an order for goods or services (hereinafter for the sake of textual simplicity) goods by a purchaser of the goods, for instance a purchase order or an invoice. Thereafter, the seller of the goods directs a minting of a cryptographic token. In this regard, the cryptographic token can be representative of the electronic supply chain document such that the cryptographic token encapsulates a purchase price for the order and associated order terms along with an indication of the economic rights and ownership of the goods subject to the transaction. A location is then reserved in a distributed ledger that can be remotely accessed from over a computer communications network. The cryptographic token can then be uploaded to the reserved location in a distributed ledger.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Once the cryptographic token has been uploaded to the reserved location of the distributed ledger on behalf of the seller of the goods, a factor supporting the factorization of the purchase price can access the reserved location of the distributed ledger in order to publish factoring terms at the reserved location. In particular, the factorization of the purchase price tangibly can be correlated to an assignment by the seller of the goods to the factoring agency of the cryptographic token stored in the reserved location. To the extent that the factoring terms are accepted by the seller of the goods, the seller of the goods validates writes an ascension to the factoring terms to the reserved location of the distributed ledger in connection with the published factoring terms. Finally, once the factoring terms have been satisfied upon the purchase price for the goods having been paid to the factoring agency by a purchaser of the goods and a fraction of the purchase price having been paid by the factoring agency to the seller of goods, the reserved location in the distributed ledger can be annotated to indicate the satisfaction of the factoring terms.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect of the embodiment, the reserved location during the reservation is set initially on behalf of the seller of the goods so as to permit read access without authorization to entities seeking access, and without the need for a password or key so as to read information within the electronic supply chain document. However, separate and independent from read and write access permissions, entities are neither permitted to introduce new permissions, nor change existing read permissions, nor change/introduce read and write access permissions, and the right to delete content at the specified location.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another aspect of the embodiment, the distributed ledger includes a query interface adapted to permit querying of the distributed ledger for a listing of available cryptographic tokens. Optionally, the query interface receives credit risk information in connection with the order for goods and writes the credit risk information to the reserved location in the distributed ledger. In even yet another aspect of the embodiment, the uploading of the cryptographic token is signed by a private key of the seller of the goods and the factoring terms are signed by a private key of the factoring agency.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment of the invention, a data processing system is adapted for supply chain factoring utilizing shared state information stored in a distributed ledger. The system includes a host computing platform that has one or more computers, each with memory and one or processing units including one or more processing cores. The system also includes a factorization management module having computer program instructions enabled while executing in the memory of at least one of the processing units of the host computing platform to select an electronic supply chain document associated with an order for goods by a purchaser of the goods, to mint a cryptographic token on behalf of a seller of the goods that is representative of the electronic supply chain document and encapsulating a purchase price for the order and associated order terms and to reserve a location in a distributed ledger remotely accessible from over a computer communications network and uploading the cryptographic token to the reserved location in a distributed ledger.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The program instructions subsequently publish, on behalf of a factoring agency, at the reserved location in the distributed ledger, factoring terms of the factoring agency to factor the purchase price by receiving an assignment of the cryptographic token. Then, the program instructions validate in the reserved location of the distributed ledger in connection with the published factoring terms, an ascension to the factoring terms. Finally, the program instructions annotate the reserved location in the distributed ledger to indicate satisfaction of the factoring terms upon the purchase price being paid to the factoring agency and a fraction of the purchase price being paid by the factoring agency to the seller of goods.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In even yet another embodiment of the invention, a computing device is provided which includes a non-transitory computer readable storage medium having program instructions stored therein. The instructions are executable by at least one processing core of a processing unit so as to cause the processing unit to perform a method for supply chain factoring utilizing shared state information stored in a distributed ledger. In particular, the method includes selecting an electronic supply chain document associated with an order for goods by a purchaser of the goods and minting a cryptographic token on behalf of a seller of the goods, such that the token encapsulates a purchase price for the order and associated order terms. The method additionally includes reserving a location in the ledger into which the token is uploaded and, subsequently, publishing factoring terms at the reserved location by a factoring agency supporting the factorization of the purchase price. The method even further includes validating an ascension to the factoring terms in the reserved location. Finally, the method includes annotating the reserved location to indicate satisfaction of the factoring terms upon the purchase price being paid to the factoring agency and a fraction of the purchase price being paid by the factoring agency to the seller of goods</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this way, the technical deficiencies of conventional supply chain factoring are overcome owing to trustworthiness of secured, shared state information and owing to the access to the shared ledger by many possible factoring agencies seeking opportunities to engage in factored transactions irrespective of any pre-existing personal relationship between seller of goods and factor.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Additional aspects of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The aspects of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.

In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a cryptographic token encapsulates data from an invoice memorializing a sales transaction between buyer and seller. The cryptographic token is then stored at an address in a distributed ledger. In this regard, the address at the distributed ledger incorporates a shared secret amongst different end users including a multiplicity of different factors. Consequently, one of the factors queries the distributed ledger in order to retrieve content from the cryptographic token and then writes factor terms to the address in the distributed ledger for the invoice terms of the cryptographic token. Upon the seller acceding to the factor terms, the accession of the seller to the factor terms can be written to the address of the distributed ledger. Once the invoice has been satisfied by the buyer so that the factor is paid, the completion of the factor terms are then written to the address of the distributed ledger. In this way the factored state of any invoice can be visible to each actor in the supply chain participating in supply chain factoring throughout the lifecycle of each factored invoice.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In illustration of one aspect of the embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> pictorially shows a process of supply chain factoring utilizing shared state information stored in a distributed ledger. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a seller <b>110</b> generates an invoice <b>130</b> and provides the invoice <b>130</b> to a buyer <b>120</b> of goods or services (collectively goods for the purpose of textual simplicity) from the seller <b>110</b>. A cryptographic token <b>100</b> is created for the invoice <b>130</b> including different terms of sale evident in the invoice <b>130</b> such as an amount owing from the buyer <b>120</b> to the seller <b>110</b>, a due date for payment and a mode of acceptable payment, by way of example. Optionally, the cryptographic token <b>100</b> can include one digital file or the cryptographic token <b>110</b> can be a composition of multiple different digital files wherein each of the digital file is assigned to a different factor in connection with a different portion of payment owed by the buyer <b>120</b>, or each digital file can be assigned to a different invoice <b>130</b> to the extent that multiple invoices <b>130</b> are factored by the same factor as between the same seller <b>110</b>. In any case, the cryptographic token <b>100</b> is then uploaded to an address <b>160</b>B in a distributed ledger <b>160</b> with shared state meaning that the address <b>160</b>B in the distributed ledger <b>160</b>A provides for open read and write access to all so that multiple different accessors view a contemporaneous state stored at the address <b>160</b>B of the distributed ledger <b>160</b>A.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thereafter, optionally, credit/risk data <b>115</b> for the invoice <b>130</b> is uploaded to the address <b>160</b>B through the query interface <b>150</b> such as a computed credit risk of the buyer <b>120</b> or a historical performance of payment by the buyer <b>120</b>. A factor <b>140</b> locates the cryptographic token <b>100</b> in the address <b>160</b>B of the distributed ledger <b>160</b>A by way of a query interface <b>150</b> to the distributed ledger <b>160</b>A and retrieves not only the information pertaining to the invoice <b>130</b>, but also the credit/risk data <b>115</b> for the invoice <b>130</b>. The factor <b>140</b> then uploads to the address <b>160</b>B, one or more factoring terms <b>170</b> for the invoice <b>130</b>, such as a factoring percentage and a timing of payment to the seller <b>110</b> of the fractional payment <b>180</b> due for the invoice <b>130</b> accounting for the factoring. Once the factoring terms <b>170</b> are written to the address <b>160</b>B, the seller <b>110</b> can direct the writing of an acceptance of the factoring terms <b>170</b> to the address <b>160</b>B. Optionally, the token <b>100</b> includes an expiration date beyond which the token <b>100</b> expires and is marked expired and rendered inaccessible at the address <b>160</b>B. However, absent expiration, once full payment <b>190</b> is provided to the factor <b>140</b> by the buyer <b>120</b>, the factor <b>140</b> writes to the address <b>160</b>B an indication of a satisfaction of the factoring terms <b>170</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Aspects of the process described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> can be implemented within a data processing system. In further illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> schematically shows a data processing system adapted to perform supply chain factoring utilizing shared state information stored in a distributed ledger. In the data processing system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a host computing platform <b>200</b> is provided. The host computing platform <b>200</b> includes one or more computers <b>210</b>, each with memory <b>220</b> and one or more processing units <b>230</b>. The computers <b>210</b> of the host computing platform (only a single computer shown for the purpose of illustrative simplicity) can be co-located within one another and in communication with one another over a local area network, or over a data communications bus, or the computers can be remotely disposed from one another and in communication with one another through network interface <b>260</b> over a data communications network <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Different client computers <b>280</b> are communicatively coupled to the data processing system <b>200</b>. Each client computer <b>280</b> provides a query interface <b>290</b> through which queries may be executed against addressable locations of a distributed ledger <b>270</b> from over data communications network <b>240</b>. In this regard, each of the addressable locations of the distributed ledger <b>270</b> includes a cryptographic token and different ledger entries indicative of a shared state of factoring an invoice as between a buyer, a seller and a factor of the invoice.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Notably, a computing device <b>250</b> including a non-transitory computer readable storage medium can be included with the data processing system <b>200</b> and accessed by the processing units <b>230</b> of one or more of the computers <b>210</b>. The computing device stores <b>250</b> thereon or retains therein a program module <b>300</b> that includes computer program instructions which when executed by one or more of the processing units <b>230</b>, performs a programmatically executable process for supply chain factoring utilizing shared state information stored in a distributed ledger. Specifically, the program instructions during execution generate in the memory <b>220</b> on behalf of a request of a seller accessing the module <b>300</b> through a respective query interface <b>290</b>, a cryptographic token representative of the terms of an invoice issued by the seller to a buyer. This process is known as minting a cryptographic token.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The program instructions then write the minted cryptographic token to an address in the distributed ledger <b>270</b> at which permissions are set to permit unrestricted read access and the right to add additional content thereto, but to prohibit subsequent modify and delete access to all including the creator of the cryptographic token. Subsequently, the program instructions receive from a factor through a respective query interface <b>290</b>, a request to access the cryptographic token at the address of the distributed ledger <b>270</b> and a request to write factor terms to the same address of the distributed ledger <b>270</b> such that the address has a shared state as between the seller, buyer and factor. The program instructions yet further record at the same address of the distributed ledger <b>270</b>, an accession by the seller to the factor terms.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Finally, the program instructions upon receipt of payment by the buyer to the factor, write an entry at the same address of the distributed ledger <b>270</b> indicating a satisfaction of the factor terms. In this way, potential participants to a factoring transaction of an invoice can, in an unlimited manner, remotely scan the distributed ledger for different factoring opportunities by accessing different ones of the cryptographic tokens without fear by the creator of the token (namely the seller of the goods) that any term of an offer to factor or of the invoice itself can be modified by a third party. As well, prospective factoring entities can remain assured that the meta-data encapsulated in the cryptographic token has not changed since the creation of the token.
