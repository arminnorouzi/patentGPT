In the configuration according to the related art, the maintenance work for the elevator for the vehicles is complicated, which significantly increases the burden on the management.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a building with a simple structure that is safe and highly convenient.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a complex building with a simple structure that is safe and highly convenient.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention (first invention) provides a building including one building body, the building body including a plurality of floors, on each of which a plurality of housing parts are disposed, each of the housing parts including a residential space part in which a resident resides and a housing-part parking part that enables a vehicle that the resident uses to be parked therein, characterized in that: the housing part includes two or more residential floors in the residential space part, at least one of the residential floors being provided with a resident entrance part that enables entry and exit of the resident between inside of the housing part and outside of the housing part, and a residential floor that is different from the residential floor provided with the resident entrance part being provided with the housing-part parking part which communicates with the residential space part of the housing part, and a parking entrance/exit part that enables entry and exit of the vehicle between inside of the housing-part parking part and the outside of the housing part; the building body further includes a housing part-side vehicle road part formed over a plurality of floors of the building body to enable vehicles to pass therethrough, the housing part-side vehicle road part connecting between outside of the building body and each parking entrance/exit part, and a housing part-side pedestrian road part formed over a plurality of floors of the building body to enable residents to walk thereon, the housing part-side pedestrian road part connecting between the outside of the building body and each resident entrance part; and a height of the housing part-side vehicle road part and a height of the housing part-side pedestrian road part are different from each other on one floor of the building body, and the housing part-side vehicle road part and the housing part-side pedestrian road part face an identical space at the different heights.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In such a configuration, the housing-part parking is formed in each housing part. Therefore, the resident of each housing part can go out on the vehicle that he/she owns without getting out of the housing part. Similarly, the resident can come home on the vehicle to a place that is close to the residential space also when he/she comes back from the outside. High safety can be achieved with a significantly low risk of an accident, since the housing part-side vehicle road part exclusively for vehicles and the housing part-side pedestrian road part exclusively for residents are disposed away from each other in one building body. In particular, significantly high safety can be achieved compared to the configuration in which the housing part-side vehicle road part and the housing part-side pedestrian road part are simply separated from each other by a fence but are adjacent to each other at the same height, since the housing part-side vehicle road part and the housing part-side pedestrian road part are at different heights. On the other hand, a configuration in which the housing part-side vehicle road part and the housing part-side pedestrian road part are provided in individual tunnel structures to be completely isolated from each other is proposed, in order to enhance safety. However, such a configuration gives a strong sense of closedness, and does not readily provide a sense of openness which is obtained with common detached houses. In the present invention, however, both the two road parts face an identical space while being located at different heights. Therefore, neither pedestrians nor those who use vehicles are given a sense of closedness. For example, one can feel the air at the resident entrance part and the air at the parking entrance/exit part when he/she comes home, and can obtain a sense of security and fulfill a desire to possess a residence as well. When a fire engine as an emergency vehicle extinguishes a fire in the housing part using the housing part-side vehicle road part, water can be appropriately thrown toward the residential floor on which the resident entrance part is located.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention (second invention) also provides complex building including one building body, the building body including a plurality of floors, on each of which a plurality of housing parts in which a resident resides and a commercial facility as a non-residential area are disposed, characterized by including: a commercial facility part in which the commercial facility is disposed; commercial facility part parking formed over a plurality of floors to enable a vehicle that a commercial facility user uses to be parked therein; a commercial facility part-side road part formed over a plurality of floors of the building body to enable vehicles to pass therethrough, the commercial facility part-side road part connecting between outside of the building body and the commercial facility part parking; a housing-part parking part formed in each housing part to enable a vehicle that a resident residing in each housing part uses to be parked therein; a housing part-side vehicle road part formed over a plurality of floors of the building body to enable vehicles to pass therethrough, the housing part-side vehicle road part connecting between the outside of the building body and the housing-part parking part; and a housing part-side pedestrian road part formed over a plurality of floors of the building body to enable residents to walk thereon, the housing part-side pedestrian road part connecting between the outside of the building body and a resident entrance part provided in each housing part, in which the commercial facility part-side road part and the housing part-side vehicle road part are not connected to each other in the building body to prohibit traffic of vehicles therebetween.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In such a configuration, the commercial facility part-side road part and the housing part-side motor road part are not connected to each other. Therefore, a large number of unspecified commercial facility users do not pass through the housing part-side motor road part for the housing parts, which is suitable to maintain the peace in the housing parts. A blockage of smooth passage of the vehicles of the residents can also be prevented in a situation in which the commercial facilities are congested, for example.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention (third invention) provides a complex building including one building body, the building body including a plurality of floors, on each of which a plurality of housing parts and a commercial facility as a non-residential area are disposed, each of the housing parts including a residential space part in which a resident resides and a housing-part parking part that enables a vehicle that the resident uses to be parked therein, characterized by including: a commercial facility part in which the commercial facility is disposed; commercial facility part parking formed over a plurality of floors to enable a vehicle that a commercial facility user uses to be parked therein; and a commercial facility part-side road part formed over a plurality of floors of the building body to enable vehicles to pass therethrough, the commercial facility part-side road part connecting between outside of the building body and the commercial facility part parking, in which: the housing part includes two or more residential floors in the residential space part, at least one of the residential floors being provided with a resident entrance part that enables entry and exit of the resident between inside of the housing part and outside of the housing part, and a residential floor that is different from the residential floor provided with the resident entrance part being provided with the housing-part parking part which communicates with the residential space part of the housing part, and a parking entrance/exit part that enables entry and exit of the vehicle between inside of the housing-part parking part and the outside of the housing part; the building body further includes a housing part-side vehicle road part formed over a plurality of floors of the building body to enable vehicles to pass therethrough, the housing part-side vehicle road part connecting between the outside of the building body and each parking entrance/exit part, and a housing part-side pedestrian road part formed over a plurality of floors of the building body to enable residents to walk thereon, the housing part-side pedestrian road part connecting between the outside of the building body and each resident entrance part; a height of the housing part-side vehicle road part and a height of the housing part-side pedestrian road part are different from each other on one floor of the building body, and the housing part-side vehicle road part and the housing part-side pedestrian road part face an identical space at the different heights; and the commercial facility part-side road part and the housing part-side vehicle road part are not connected to each other in the building body to prohibit traffic of vehicles therebetween.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">With such a configuration, as with the first invention, the resident can go out on the vehicle that he/she owns without getting out of the housing part, and can come home on the vehicle to a place that is close to the residential space. Significantly high safety can be achieved, since the housing part-side vehicle road part and the housing part-side pedestrian road part are at different heights. Both the two road parts face an identical space. Therefore, the residents are not given a sense of closedness, and can obtain a sense of security and fulfill a desire to possess a residence as well. Appropriate measures can advantageously be taken easily even in the case where an emergency vehicle passes.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Advantageous Effect of Invention</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention provides a simple structure that is safe and highly convenient.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0010" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a building according to example 1 with a wall part and a floor part partly omitted.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a partially enlarged vertical sectional view of the building according to example 1.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a partially enlarged lateral sectional view of the building according to example 1.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a partially enlarged vertical sectional view of a complex building according to example 2.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a partially enlarged lateral sectional view of the complex building according to example 2.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0011" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A building and a complex building according to examples of the present invention will be described in detail below.

A plurality of housing parts <b>20</b>, each of which a resident H resides, are arranged adjacent to each other on each floor. Each of the housing parts <b>20</b> may be owned or rented, for example, and the housing parts <b>20</b> in the building body <b>10</b> constitute separate residences.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Now, the internal structure of the housing part <b>20</b> will be described.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> etc., the housing part <b>20</b> has a plurality of residential floors for each floor of the building body <b>10</b>. That is, the housing part <b>20</b> is two-storied, and the residential space in the housing part <b>20</b> has a first floor and a second floor, between which one is movable through stairs that connect between the first floor and the second floor.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A resident entrance part <b>21</b> is provided on the second floor as a residential floor. The resident entrance part <b>21</b> enables the resident to enter the housing part <b>20</b> from the outside and exit from the housing part <b>20</b> to the outside. On the other hand, a service entrance part <b>22</b> is provided on the first floor as a residential floor, and a housing-part parking part <b>30</b> is disposed via the service entrance part <b>22</b>. The housing-part parking part <b>30</b> will be discussed in detail later.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further, a first-floor balcony part <b>25</b> that faces the external environment is disposed on a first-floor part of the housing part <b>20</b> so as to project outward from the building body <b>10</b>. Similarly, a second-floor balcony part <b>26</b> is disposed on a second-floor part of the housing part <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Next, the housing-part parking part <b>30</b> will be described.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the present invention, each housing part <b>20</b> is individually provided with a housing-part parking part <b>30</b> that allows a resident residing in the housing part <b>20</b> to park a vehicle C that the resident uses therein. A parking entrance/exit part <b>32</b> for entry and exit of the vehicle C is formed at each housing-part parking part <b>30</b>. The parking entrance/exit part <b>32</b> is provided with a shutter, for example, to be separated from the outside of the housing part <b>20</b> to constitute a so-called inner garage structure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The housing part <b>20</b> discussed so far has two or more floors, and is separated from adjacent houses. Therefore, the housing part <b>20</b> allows one to enjoy the atmosphere of a &#x201c;smart town&#x201d;, where he/she feels as if residing in a detached house in the building body <b>10</b> while enjoying the safety, security, and convenience of a large-scale condominium.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Now, a common part of the building body <b>10</b> will be described.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The common part of the building body <b>10</b> includes a housing part-side pedestrian road part <b>50</b> connected to the resident entrance part <b>21</b> of each housing part <b>20</b>. That is, the housing part-side pedestrian road part <b>50</b> is a road formed at the height of the second floor of the housing part <b>20</b> to enable residents H to walk thereon, and is formed over a plurality of floors of the building body <b>10</b>. That is, the housing part-side pedestrian road part <b>50</b> connects the inside of the building body <b>10</b> and the external environment, and enables easily moving to another floor when an elevating part such as an elevator (not illustrated) is provided.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The common part of the building body <b>10</b> further includes a housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b> formed to enable vehicles to pass therethrough. The housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b> is formed along the plurality of housing parts <b>20</b> on one floor, and is continuous with the housing-part parking part <b>30</b> of each housing part <b>20</b> on the first floor. Further, the housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b> is formed over a plurality of floors of the building body <b>10</b>. That is, the housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b> is provided with a vehicle connection part <b>45</b> such as a slope to enable vehicles to move to and from upper and lower floors of the building body <b>10</b>, and enables vehicles to go to and come from the outside of the building body <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">That is, the resident H who went out on a vehicle can come home by entering the building body <b>10</b> on the vehicle C, reaching his/her housing part <b>20</b> using the housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b>, and parking the vehicle C in the housing-part parking part <b>30</b> in the housing part <b>20</b>. As a matter of course, the resident H can easily go out using the housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b>. The housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b> also enables passage of emergency vehicles such as fire engines and ambulances, and enables passage of vehicles of moving companies and delivery companies.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b> on each floor is formed to allow one-way traffic only, and therefore the vehicles C can be prevented from facing each other to cause congestion in the building body <b>10</b>, and a layout that can secure a large residential space is achieved.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b> enables passage of vehicles only, and does not enable passage of pedestrians. Thus, the residents H pass using the housing part-side pedestrian road part <b>50</b> to go out on foot.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The housing part-side pedestrian road part <b>50</b> is disposed at the height corresponding to the second-floor part of the housing part <b>20</b>. Therefore, the height of the housing part-side pedestrian road part <b>50</b> is different from the height of the housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b> which is disposed at the height corresponding to the first-floor part. Thus, flow lines of the pedestrians and the vehicles do not cross each other in the building body <b>10</b>, and minor collisions etc. between the pedestrians and the vehicles can be effectively prevented in the building body <b>10</b>. On the other hand, the housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b> and the housing part-side pedestrian road part <b>50</b> face the same space on the same floor, and are not completely separated from each other. Therefore, communication can be made between the housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b> and the housing part-side pedestrian road part <b>50</b>, and an environment that provides both a sense of openness and a sense of security is achieved.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The following features may be added to the configuration discussed so far.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The resident H may have a wireless key, and unlock an entrance/exit gate to the building <b>1</b> using the wireless key when the vehicle C enters the housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b> from the outside. This improves the function of preventing crimes in the building <b>1</b>. The means for unlocking the gate may also use authentication with the number plate of the vehicle, for example, besides the wireless key. On the other hand, delivery vehicles etc. which are not used by the resident H may be enabled to enter the housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b> after passing through an inspection performed by a security guard etc. at an entrance provided separately, by way of example.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A configuration in which an automatic washing system that washes the undercarriage of vehicles is disposed on a path for entering the housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b> from the outside is proposed. This prevents contamination of the housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b>, and decreases dirt etc. that enters the housing part <b>20</b> from the housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The atmospheric environment in the building body <b>10</b> can be kept comfortable by enabling only electric vehicles (EVs) to enter and park in the building body <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Accordingly, a configuration in which a charger <b>31</b> for EVs is disposed in each housing-part parking part <b>30</b> is proposed. In the present example, two vehicles C can be parked in each housing-part parking part <b>30</b>, and therefore it is desirable that the charger <b>31</b>, which suffices for charging two vehicles, should be disposed in each housing-part parking part <b>30</b> in this case.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A configuration provided with emergency electric power supply means including a control circuit is proposed, the control circuit being configured to supply electric power to the housing part <b>20</b> from the vehicle C parked at the housing-part parking part <b>30</b> in the case where a power outage is caused in the building <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The sunlight is not likely to reach the housing-part parking part <b>30</b>, the housing part-side vehicle road part <b>40</b>, the housing part-side pedestrian road part <b>50</b>, etc. in the case where such parts are disposed deep in the building body <b>10</b>. Thus, introduction of a solar lighting system <b>60</b> that illuminates such spaces with external light using optical fibers or light guide ducts in which mirrors are disposed is proposed.
