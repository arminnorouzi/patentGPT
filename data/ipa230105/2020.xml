In particular, the present invention relates to a fuel control system and a method for a marine vessel, where a fuel consumption estimate is determined.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Related Technology</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Marine vessels, such as container ships, play an important role in transporting cargo, goods and materials around the world. These vessels may be driven by diesel or natural gas propulsion systems that consume fuel to drive one or more propellers. These propellers may be driven directly, e.g. with slow-speed reciprocating diesel engines, or via a gearbox. Diesel engines may consume marine grade diesel or heavy fuel oil.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Fuelling a marine vessel is typically performed under the supervision of a vessel operator, such as a captain or one of the vessel's crew. Fuel may be supplied to fuel tanks for a voyage, and these fuel tanks may be refilled while in port if levels are low.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Modern shipping adds extra complexity to the fuelling of marine vessels. For example, container ships may navigate through a series of destinations on a round trip around the world. Containers may be exchanged at points along a route and conditions on each leg of the round trip may vary. This makes it difficult to estimate how much fuel needs to be loaded onto the marine vessel for each leg. It is not unknown for vessels to run out of fuel. In these cases, emergency refuelling at sea may be arranged (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;replenishment at sea&#x201d;). This can be risky.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is thus a desire to improve how fuel consumption is estimated for marine vessels. In certain cases, there is a desire to improve how fuel is supplied to marine vessels.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first embodiment, there is provided a method for use with a marine vessel.

The fuel consumption estimate may help to optimally load a marine vessel to reduce fuel consumption and improve vessel efficiency, in turn reducing pollution levels. The fuel consumption estimate may also avoid emergency refuelling operations, such as refuelling at sea.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Optionally, the method comprises controlling the supply of the determined amount of fuel to the marine vessel.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Optionally, the data identifying the marine vessel comprises an indication of a class of the marine vessel, and the historical data for the plurality of marine vessels comprises indications of class for the plurality of marine vessels.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Optionally, the data identifying the voyage to be undertaken comprises an identification of a leg of a voyage, the leg of the voyage having an arrival port and a departure port, wherein the predictive model is configured to receive the identification of the leg of the voyage as input.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Optionally, the method comprises determining a distance between the arrival port and the departure port; and determining an estimated mean speed of the marine vessel for the voyage, wherein the predictive model is configured to receive the distance and the estimated mean speed as inputs.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Optionally, the predictive model is a linear model and parameters of the linear model are fitted using elastic net regularization.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Optionally, the predictive model comprises one or more of: parameters that are independent of the data identifying the marine vessel; parameters that are dependent on the data identifying the marine vessel; parameters that are independent of the data identifying the voyage to be undertaken by the marine vessel; and parameters that are dependent on the data identifying the voyage to be undertaken by the marine vessel.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Optionally, the method comprises: obtaining an initial fuel consumption estimate, wherein the predictive model is configured to receive the initial fuel consumption estimate as an input.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Optionally, the initial fuel consumption estimate is computed from data indicating how fuel consumption varies with speed of the marine vessel.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Optionally, the initial fuel consumption estimate is received as a user input.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Optionally, the marine vessel is configured to consume a plurality of fuel types, and wherein computing a fuel consumption estimate using a predictive model comprises computing fuel consumption estimates for the plurality of fuel types.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Optionally, computing fuel consumption estimates for the plurality of fuel types comprises: computing a first fuel consumption estimate for a first fuel type using a first predictive model; computing a second fuel consumption estimate for a second fuel type using a second predictive model, and determining an amount of fuel comprises determining an amount of each of the first and second fuel types that are to be supplied to the marine vessel based on the respective first and second fuel consumption estimates.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Optionally, the method comprises: obtaining an initial fuel consumption estimate for each of the first and second fuel types, wherein the first predictive model is configured to receive the initial fuel consumption estimate for the first fuel type as an input, and wherein the second predictive model is configured to receive the initial fuel consumption estimate for the second fuel type and an indication as to whether the initial fuel consumption estimate for the second fuel type is non-zero as inputs.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to another embodiment a fuel control system for a marine vessel, comprises: an interface to receive data identifying the marine vessel and data identifying a voyage to be undertaken by the marine vessel; a memory to store computer program code to implement a predictive model and parameter values for the predictive model, the parameter values resulting from an optimisation of the predictive model using historical data for a plurality of marine vessels and a plurality of voyages; a processor to retrieve the computer program code and the parameter values from the memory.

An estimate of fuel consumption may be used to control an amount of fuel that is to be supplied to the marine vessel, e.g. during a fuelling or refuelling operation. Certain examples provide estimates of fuel consumption for marine vessels that improve upon comparative approaches. Accurate estimates of fuel consumption enable optimal fuel loading of a marine vessel, e.g. the supply of enough fuel to complete the voyage but without oversupply which can affect loading and performance of the marine vessel.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Certain examples described herein enable fuel consumption estimates to be determined for different fuel types. This may allow improved supply of multiple fuel types for a voyage, where different fuel types may be suitable for different portions of a voyage. Certain examples apply a predictive model, where parameters of the predictive model may be fitted using historical data for a plurality of marine vessels and a plurality of voyages. The predictive model may comprise multiple parameters that control a computation applied to a set of inputs. The predictive model may take into account properties of a particular marine vessel and a particular voyage.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of a marine vessel <b>110</b> undergoing a refuelling operation. Although this example is described with reference to refuelling, the example may be equally applied to initial fuelling operations, e.g. for a new or refitted marine vessel. In one case, the marine vessel <b>110</b> may comprise a container ship. The marine vessel <b>110</b> may be designed to transport one or more of cargo, goods and materials from one port to another.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> the marine vessel <b>110</b> comprises a fuel control system <b>120</b>. The fuel control system <b>120</b> may comprise an electro-mechanical system installed upon the marine vessel <b>110</b> to control the supply of fuel to the marine vessel <b>110</b>. The marine vessel <b>110</b> also comprises a fuel tank <b>130</b>, an engine <b>140</b> and a propeller <b>150</b>. The fuel tank <b>130</b> is arranged to store fuel for a voyage. The fuel tank <b>130</b> is arranged to supply fuel to the engine <b>140</b> during the voyage in order to power the engine <b>140</b>. The engine <b>140</b> is configured to consume the fuel from the fuel tank <b>130</b> and rotate propeller <b>150</b> to propel the marine vessel <b>110</b> through a mass of water, such as a sea or waterway. Although a propeller <b>150</b> is used in this example, other propulsion mechanisms may alternatively be used. The engine <b>140</b> may comprise, amongst others, a diesel engine, a gas turbine or a liquefied natural gas (LNG) engine. If the marine vessel <b>110</b> comprises a container ship, the engine <b>140</b> may comprise a reciprocating diesel engine. The reciprocating diesel engine may be a two or four-stroke engine. In other examples, more than one propeller <b>150</b> may be present. In these examples, one engine may be provided per propeller, or one engine may power multiple propellers. Similarly, in other examples, more than one engine may be provided, each engine being coupled to one or more propellers. In certain cases, a backup engine may be provided as well as the main engine <b>140</b>. The fuel that is supplied to, and stored by, the fuel tank <b>130</b> may depend on the engine <b>140</b> that is used. For a diesel engine, the fuel may comprise diesel fuel or fuel oil (including &#x201c;heavy&#x201d; and &#x201c;residual&#x201d; fuel oils). For an LNG engine, the fuel may comprise liquefied natural gas. For a gas turbine, the fuel may comprise petroleum oil. Other possible fuels include liquefied hydrogen. In one case, the fuel may comprise a charge stored by a battery that is used to power an electric engine.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the marine vessel <b>110</b> docked at a refuelling station <b>160</b>. The refuelling station may be located at a port or other destination accessible to the marine vessel <b>110</b>. The refuelling station <b>160</b> comprises a bunker <b>170</b>, which is arranged to store fuel for supply to marine vessels. The bunker <b>170</b> is couplable to the fuel tank <b>130</b> of the marine vessel <b>110</b> (indicated by the dashed lines). During a refuelling operation, the bunker <b>170</b> may be coupled to the fuel tank <b>130</b> to enable fuel to be supplied from the bunker <b>170</b> to the fuel tank <b>130</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an amount of fuel that is to be supplied from the bunker <b>170</b> to the fuel tank <b>130</b> is controlled by the fuel control system <b>120</b> of the marine vessel <b>110</b>. For example, the fuel control system <b>120</b> may communicate a numeric value to the refuelling station <b>110</b>, and a refuelling mechanism forming part of the bunker <b>170</b> may measure an amount of fuel that is supplied to the fuel tank <b>130</b>, e.g. using flow measurement sensors, and stop the supply of fuel to the fuel tank <b>130</b> when an amount of supplied fuel equals the numeric value (or is at least within a threshold amount of the numeric value).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a fuel control system <b>200</b> that may be used to implement the fuel control system <b>120</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The fuel control system <b>200</b> comprises an interface <b>210</b>, a memory <b>220</b>, a processor <b>230</b>, and a fuel supply system <b>240</b>. The fuel control system <b>200</b> may be implemented as part of a control system for a marine vessel such as the marine vessel <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In one case, the fuel control system <b>200</b> may comprise an embedded computing system that is installed upon a marine vessel.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The interface <b>210</b> may comprise an internal or external interface to the fuel control system <b>200</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the interface <b>210</b> is shown as an external interface. The interface <b>210</b> may comprise a network interface that is arranged to receive data over a wired or wireless network. The interface <b>210</b> may, additionally or alternatively, comprise a user interface to receive data from a user. The data from the user may comprise data entered by the user and/or a selection of data stored in a memory, for example. If the interface <b>210</b> comprises an internal interface, it may provide an interface to a data storage device, such as a hard disk drive or solid-state memory. The interface <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is communicatively coupled to the processor <b>230</b>. The interface <b>210</b> is configured to receive data identifying a marine vessel and data identifying a voyage to be undertaken by the marine vessel. The marine vessel may be the marine vessel <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, e.g. the marine vessel in which the fuel control system <b>200</b> is installed. Although interface <b>210</b> is shown as a single interface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, it may comprise two separate interfaces that each receive one of the data identifying the marine vessel and the data identifying the voyage. For example, the data identifying the marine vessel may be received across a data interface that couples the fuel control system <b>200</b> to a data storage device of the marine vessel, and the data identifying the voyage may be selected from a list of possible voyages on a user interface.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the memory <b>220</b> stores computer program code to implement a predictive model. The predictive model may comprise a machine learning model, including, amongst others, a linear model, a non-linear model (including logistic regression models), a neural network architecture, a support vector machine, a conditional random field, a Bayesian belief network, and decision trees. The computer program code may comprise machine learning libraries defined in one or more programming languages including R, Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. The computer program code may define an out-of-the-box parameterizable model and/or may define a coupling and arrangement of lower-level components. In the present example, the memory <b>220</b> also stores parameter values for the predictive model. These may comprise, amongst others, weight values, bias values, hyperparameters, probability values, and parameters for one or more probability distributions. The parameter values may be used together with the computer program code defining the predictive model to instantiate the predictive model, i.e. to provide a particular configured instance of the predictive model. Although one memory <b>220</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in certain cases the memory <b>220</b> may comprise two separate memories, one to store the computer program code (e.g. such as an erasable read-only firmware memory) and one to store the parameter values (such as a random-access memory).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The predictive model is implemented by way of the computer program code from the memory <b>220</b> and the parameter values from the memory <b>220</b>. The processor <b>230</b> is configured to retrieve the computer program code and the parameter values from the memory <b>220</b> and to execute the computer program code to determine a fuel consumption estimate for the marine vessel and the voyage, e.g. as identified using the data received at interface <b>210</b>. The processor <b>230</b> is configured to execute the computer program code to first instantiate the predictive model using the parameter values. This may comprise, for example, loading values for weights of a linear model or values for weight and bias matrices in a neural network architecture. The parameter values result from an optimisation of the predictive model using historical data for a plurality of marine vessels and a plurality of voyages. Depending on the predictive model that is used, the optimisation may comprise a training or fitting stage, whereby the parameter values are determined by minimising a cost or loss function for data items within the historical data. The training or fitting stage is performed prior to determining a fuel consumption estimate. In one case, the training or fitting stage may be performed off-line and/or at a remote computing device, e.g. the parameter values may be retrieved over a network and loaded into the memory <b>220</b>.

For example, the data identifying the marine vessel may comprise, or be mapped to, a numeric value representing the marine vessel in a set of marine vessels (e.g. by way of an array index or the like). The data identifying the voyage may similarly comprise, or be mapped to, a numeric value representing the voyage in a set of possible voyages. In another case, the data identifying the voyage may comprise data identifying properties of the voyage or be used to retrieve these properties in a pre-processing operation. For example, properties of the voyage may comprise one or more of, amongst others, voyage distance, voyage duration, normal voyage speed, network leg (e.g. in a multi-leg trip), arrival port, and destination port. These properties may be provided as a numeric value (e.g. distance may comprise a distance value in kilometres or a network leg may be identified by an integer array index). The term &#x201c;voyage&#x201d; may refer to either a network leg or a plurality of network legs, depending on the configuration of the predictive model.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The predictive model may be configured to receive an array or N-dimensional data structure as an input. The array may comprise a multi-dimensional array. The predictive model may implement one or more functions in its application to determine a fuel consumption estimate for the marine vessel for the voyage. The predictive model may provide the fuel consumption estimate as an output. The fuel consumption estimate may be a continuous or integer value (e.g. may be a float data type in the former case) indicating an amount of fuel that the model predicts will be consumed on the voyage. The fuel consumption estimate may be provided as an amount in tonnes, litres or US gallons. This output may be stored in volatile or non-volatile memory and/or communicated to other components via a systems bus.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the fuel consumption estimate, as computed by the processor <b>230</b> applying the predictive model, is accessible to the fuel supply system <b>240</b>. The fuel supply system <b>240</b> is configured to determine an amount of fuel to be supplied to at least one fuel tank of the marine vessel based on the fuel consumption estimate. For example, the fuel supply system <b>240</b> may send data indicating the fuel consumption estimate to the refuelling station <b>160</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to arrange for an amount of fuel to be supplied from the bunker <b>170</b> to the fuel tank <b>130</b> based on the fuel consumption estimate.

If the refuelling station <b>160</b> is a legacy refuelling station, the fuel supply system <b>240</b> may provide the fuel consumption estimate via a user interface to enable manual control of the fuel supply according to the fuel consumption estimate.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In certain cases, the historical data used to optimise the predictive model may comprise data indicating recorded fuel consumption for a plurality of marine vessels for a plurality of voyages. The plurality of marine vessels may or may not include the marine vessel associated with the present fuel control system <b>200</b>. If the marine vessel associated with the present fuel control system <b>200</b> is a new or refitted vessel, then the predictive model may be constructed to ignore function terms associated with the marine vessel, e.g. in certain cases, in effect ignoring any contribution in the predictive model that is based on a particular marine vessel. In these cases, there may remain function terms that are associated with marine vessels in general that are independent of any specific marine vessel. In certain cases, data identifying a new or unseen marine vessel may be processed by the predictive model to have a casual effect on any fuel consumption estimate.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Although the fuel control system <b>200</b> is described with reference to the fuel control system <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in one case it may be implemented outside of the marine vessel <b>110</b>. For example, the fuel control system <b>200</b> may form part of a control system installed as part of the refuelling station. In yet another case, the fuel control system <b>200</b> may comprise a remotely-located control system that is configured to send data to one or more of the marine vessel <b>110</b> and the refuelling station <b>160</b> to arrange for an amount of fuel to be supplied to the marine vessel. For example, the interface <b>210</b> may receive data from the marine vessel <b>110</b> over a wireless communications link and send out a fuel consumption estimate as processed by the fuel supply system <b>240</b>. One or more of the marine vessel <b>110</b> and the refuelling station <b>160</b> may comprise a control system with a corresponding interface to receive the fuel consumption estimate and arrange for supply of an amount of fuel based on this estimate. In one case, certain components of the fuel control system <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be distributed between two or more of the marine vessel <b>110</b>, the refuelling station <b>160</b> and a remote data processing site.

By using a predictive model trained using historical data, an accurate estimate may be provided that reduces a risk of the marine vessel running out of fuel during a voyage while also avoiding supplying the marine vessel with too much fuel, which may result in a reduced loading capacity or a reduced efficiency. For example, a marine vessel having a fixed capacity may consume more fuel if it is loaded with more fuel than is needed for a voyage. Hence, fuel consumption estimates provided by the present examples may allow a marine vessel to operate more efficiently and reduce pollution and fuel consumption. By avoiding the marine vessel running out of fuel at sea, risky replenishment at sea may be avoided, increasing a safety of the vessel's crew. An accurate fuel estimate is especially useful for large container ships (e.g. up to 10,000 or more twenty-foot equivalent units&#x2014;TEU). For example, a large container ship can consume between 10,000 to 14,000 litres of heavy fuel oil per hour, where fuel for one hour can weigh between 10 and 15 tonnes (10-15&#xd7;10<sup>3 </sup>kg).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Certain examples described herein may be adapted to provide fuel consumption estimates for multiple fuel types. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> provides an example <b>300</b> that is an adaptation of the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> where the marine vessel <b>310</b> comprises a fuel control system <b>320</b> that determines a fuel consumption estimate for a first fuel type and a second fuel type. In this example, the marine vessel <b>310</b> has a fuel tank for each fuel type: a first fuel tank <b>330</b> is used to store fuel of a first type and a second fuel tank <b>335</b> is used to store fuel of a second type. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, fuels of either type may be used to supply the engine <b>340</b> to drive the propeller <b>350</b>. In other examples, there may be a separate engine for each fuel type.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a refuelling station <b>360</b> comprises a bunker for each fuel type.

In other examples, a refuelling station may only have bunkers supplying a subset of fuel types (e.g. have a bunker to supply the second fuel type but not the first fuel type). In certain other examples, a single bunker may have separated compartments for different fuel types. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the first and second bunkers <b>370</b>, <b>375</b> may be respectively coupled to the first and second fuel tanks <b>330</b>, <b>335</b>, when the marine vessel <b>310</b> is docked at the refuelling station <b>360</b> (as shown by the dashed lines). In the present example, while docked, the fuel control system <b>320</b> may communicate, e.g. via a wired or wireless communication channel, with the refuelling station <b>360</b>, including communicating with refuelling mechanisms associated with the first and second bunkers <b>370</b>, <b>375</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The fuel control system <b>320</b> may be implemented in a similar manner to the fuel control systems <b>120</b> and <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the fuel control system <b>320</b> is configured to compute fuel consumption estimates for a plurality of fuel types that include the first fuel type and the second fuel type. In one case, a common predictive model may be used for both fuel types. In this case, the common predictive model may have different parameters for each fuel type, resulting in different instantiated models for each fuel type. Alternatively, in this case, the common predictive model may implement a joint model and provide a multidimensional output representing fuel consumption estimates for multiple fuel types. In other cases, different predictive models may be used for the different fuel types, e.g. using a different neural network architecture or different model components. In both cases, a first fuel consumption estimate is generated for the first fuel type and a second fuel consumption estimate is generated for the second fuel type. The two fuel consumption estimates may be used to determine an amount of fuel for the different fuel types to supply from the respective bunkers <b>370</b>, <b>375</b> to the respective fuel tanks <b>330</b>, <b>335</b>, e.g. in a similar manner to that described for a single fuel type in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In certain cases, if two predictive models are used for each respective fuel type, an output of one of the predictive models may be used as an input to another of the predictive models. In one case, a desired proportion of each fuel type may be supplied as an input to the predictive model. This may be used as a constraint in the predictive model. In certain cases, properties of the marine vessel and/or the voyage to be undertaken may be used as inputs to one or more of the predictive models. These again may be used as constraints in the predictive models. For example, the fuel tanks <b>330</b>, <b>335</b> may be of different capacities or the different fuel types may be consumed at different rates by the engine <b>340</b> (or multiple different engines). Similarly, one fuel type may not be suitable for use on at least a portion of a voyage, e.g. a voyage may have a route via a canal such as the Suez or Panama Canal where certain fuel types may not be suitable due to the confined spaces of the location.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one case, the different fuel types may comprise fuel types that cannot be mixed, e.g. liquefied natural gas and heavy fuel oil. In other cases, the different fuel types may be mixed, e.g. different grades of heavy fuel oil, or one fuel type with additives for periodic engine maintenance and one fuel type without additives. Mixable fuel types may be mixed in a fuel tank, in a feed for an engine and/or in the engine itself. In one case, a first fuel type comprises fuel oil with a first chemical composition, e.g. a first level of sulphur, and a second fuel type comprises fuel oil with a second chemical composition, e.g. a second level of sulphur, where the first level differs from the second level.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In certain cases, applying the computations of the fuel control system <b>320</b> to provide fuel estimates across multiple voyages (or across one voyage with multiple legs), enables enough fuel of each fuel type to be supplied for the voyages.

The voyage of the example is a round trip, i.e. a marine vessel starts and ends at port A. Although the term &#x201c;port&#x201d; is used in this example, departure and/or arrival locations need not be a port in the normal sense, they may comprise an offshore rig, mooring location, stopping location and/or refuelling station, e.g. be independent of any cargo loading and unloading.

Each network leg may be considered to be a portion of a larger voyage or a voyage in itself. Each network leg L<sub>i</sub>, has an associated leg distance d<sub>i</sub>. In the present example, each network leg L<sub>i </sub>also has an estimated duration t<sub>i</sub>. The leg distance may be a port-to-port distance, e.g. between departure and arrival ports. The leg distance may comprise a geographic point-to-point distance and/or may comprise a distance of a particular route between two points. For example, if a particular network leg has to avoid certain territories or regions due to known geographical features (such as rock outcrops or islands) and/or piracy risks, the leg distance d<sub>i </sub>may be longer than a point-to-point distance. The leg distance may be provided as a numeric value indicating a distance in kilometres. In certain cases, a leg distance may be retrieved from local or remote data storage based on a network leg identifier.

There is a first marine vessel of a first vessel class VC<sub>1 </sub>and a second marine vessel of a second vessel class VC<sub>2</sub>. The marine vessel class may comprise a group of vessels or ships of a common design. A marine vessel class may be distinguished from a marine vessel type, which may indicate capacity and/or intended use. The data identifying the marine vessel may indicate one or more of a marine vessel class and type. A marine vessel class may be set by a maritime classification society and may conform to one or more standards, e.g. those defined by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). A marine vessel may be assigned a predefined number or code that identifies the class. One or more of a marine vessel class and type may be indicated by a code or an integer index for a list of predefined classes or types. The input to the predictive model and the historical data use a consistent set of classes and/or types. Using an indication of a marine vessel class and/or type enables the predictive model to model factors specific to the class and/or type. This may improve an accuracy of the fuel consumption estimate. A class and/or type may also be provided representing an &#x201c;unknown&#x201d; or &#x201c;other&#x201d; category, if a marine vessel does not relate to any pre-existing class or type.

In one case, the predictive model is a linear model and parameters of the linear model are fitted using elastic net regularization. In another case, the predictive model is a neural network architecture and parameter values are fitted using back-propagation and stochastic gradient descent. Elastic net regularization may be used to remove unimportant predictor variables, where interactions among input variables are considered.

The storage medium <b>720</b> may alternatively comprise non-volatile data storage such as a hard disk drive or solid-state memory. In one case, the processor <b>710</b> and storage medium <b>720</b> may form part of a fuel control system for a marine vessel.

This may comprise retrieving a marine vessel identifier. One or more of the data identifying a marine vessel and the data identifying a voyage to be undertaken by the marine vessel may be retrieved from the storage medium <b>720</b> or another memory. In one case, these instructions may comprise obtaining a data array comprising a tuple with [data_vessel, data_voyage]. Via instruction <b>730</b>, the processor <b>710</b> is instructed to determine a class of the marine vessel from the data identifying the marine vessel. In one case, the data identifying the marine vessel may comprise the class of the marine vessel; in another case, the data identifying the marine vessel may be used to retrieve the class of the marine vessel, e.g. using an application programming interface (API) call.

Again, in one case, the data identifying the voyage may comprise this data, or in another case this data may be retrieved or calculated using the data identifying the voyage. Via instruction <b>740</b>, the processor <b>710</b> is instructed to obtain initial fuel consumption estimates for each of a first fuel type and a second fuel type. The initial fuel consumption estimates may be based on a fuel consumption rate at the voyage speed for the marine vessel and the voyage duration. In one case, the initial fuel consumption estimates may be calculated based on data similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, where a different set of data is provided for each fuel type.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Execution of instructions <b>725</b> to <b>740</b> may result in the generation of one or more input arrays to be used for execution of later instructions.

The first predictive model in this example is a parameterised function of the initial fuel consumption estimate for the first fuel type, the class of the marine vessel, the voyage leg identifier, the voyage duration, and the voyage speed (e.g. the input array as described above). In one case, any string or number identifiers may be mapped to integer values as also described above. The first predictive model comprises a set of parameters. These parameters are optimised based on historical data for a plurality of marine vessels and a plurality of voyages. For example, values for the parameter may result from training the predictive model on the historical data. The historical data may comprise data samples with an input array of a similar form to that previously described (e.g. forming part of an array X) and a record fuel consumption for the first fuel type (e.g. y=[FC<sub>1</sub>]). Data samples may be batched for training. Training may comprise training the predictive model on a large number of data samples (e.g. at least 1000, at least 10,000 or more). In one case, during training, the first predictive model may be configured to receive a multiple dimensional array or matrix X having a size of 5 by the number of data samples (per batch) and a &#x201c;ground truth&#x201d; output vector Y having a size of 1 by the number of data samples (per batch).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Via instruction <b>745</b>, the processor <b>710</b> is instructed to apply a second predictive model to output an adjusted fuel consumption estimate for the second fuel type.

The second predictive model is a parameterised function of the initial fuel consumption estimate for the second fuel type, the class of the marine vessel, the voyage leg identifier, the voyage duration, and the voyage speed. Parameters for the second predictive model are also optimised based on the historical data. The format of the historical data may be similar to that used for the first predictive model, but with an initial fuel consumption estimate for the second fuel type and a &#x201c;ground truth&#x201d; fuel consumption measurement for the second fuel type (e.g. y=[FC<sub>2</sub>] instead of the first fuel type).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Following execution of instructions <b>745</b> and <b>750</b>, the processor <b>710</b> has access to fuel consumption estimates for the marine vessel for the voyage for each fuel type. These estimates may be for a particular network leg in a shipping route. Via instruction <b>755</b>, the processor <b>710</b> is instructed to determine an amount of fuel of the first fuel type to supply to the marine vessel based on the adjusted fuel consumption estimate for the first fuel type. In certain cases, this instruction may also comprise instructing the supply of the amount of fuel of the first fuel type. Via instruction <b>760</b>, the processor <b>710</b> is instructed to determine an amount of fuel of the second fuel type to supply to the marine vessel based on the adjusted fuel consumption estimate for the second fuel type. In certain cases, this instruction may also comprise instructing the supply of the amount of fuel of the second fuel type. Instructing the supply of an amount of fuel may comprise sending data indicating fuel amounts to a fuel supply control system. The fuel supply control system may be part of the marine vessel or external to the marine vessel. In certain cases, instructions <b>745</b> and <b>750</b> may be repeated to generate aggregate fuel consumption estimates for multiple network legs of a voyage. In this case, via instructions <b>755</b> and <b>760</b>, fuel of both fuel types may be supplied for a trip or round trip comprising multiple network legs.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Certain examples have been described featuring methods and systems that generate fuel consumption estimates for marine vessels. These examples use predictive models to compute the estimates. These predictive models may fit parameters based on historical data. The historical data may comprise performance data that is available for a fleet of vessels, e.g. over a period of months or years. The estimates may be used to appropriately supply (i.e. load) a marine vessel with fuel for a voyage over one or more network legs. These estimates may avoid top-up bunkering, e.g. additional emergency refuelling operations. They may also help to optimally load a marine vessel to reduce fuel consumption and improve vessel efficiency, in turn reducing pollution levels. The predictive models may be configured to handle vessels or voyages that have no prior historical data, e.g. following the introduction of new routes and/or new vessels, or significantly retrofitted vessels. Predictive models may comprise terms or coefficients that relate to a general contribution applied for all vessels and network legs, as well as specific contributions relating to specific vessel classes and network legs.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In tests, the fuel consumption estimates computed according to the examples described herein have significantly improved accuracy as compared to legacy fuel control systems. For example, tests indicate reductions in the average error per voyage (e.g. the root-mean squared error of actual fuel consumption minus the fuel consumption estimate) of around 25-30%, depending on fuel type.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">It should be noted that although each example has been described individually, features from each example may be combined, features of one example may be combined with features of one or more other examples.
