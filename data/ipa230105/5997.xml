In the cross section of the portion where the first spacer SPC<b>1</b> is disposed, each of the end of the division layer <b>310</b> and the end of the light blocking layer BML which is disposed adjacent to the transmission area TP may be disposed at a boundary between the transmissive area TP and the element area EP. That is, the end of the division layer <b>310</b> and the end of the light blocking layer BML which is disposed adjacent to the transmission area TP may each define the transmissive area TP.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0300">In the first area A<b>1</b> of the display panel DP according to an embodiment, the distance between the outermost conductive pattern GT-D and the end of the light blocking layer BML which is disposed adjacent to the transmission area TP may be designed to be about 5 micrometers or longer in the cross section of the portion where the first spacer SPC<b>1</b> is disposed. The portion where the first spacer SPC<b>1</b> is disposed is a portion where the organic layers, that is, the plurality of organic insulating layers <b>60</b>, <b>70</b>, and <b>80</b>, the pixel defining film PDL, and the first spacer SPC<b>1</b> are all disposed, and the first spacer SPC<b>1</b> is thicker than the second spacer SPC<b>2</b> disposed between the plurality of first pixels. Accordingly, the portion where the first spacer SPC<b>1</b> is disposed may be a portion having a greater total thickness of the organic layers than other portions. As the total thickness of the organic layers is greater, the portion where the first spacer SPC<b>1</b> is disposed may be a vulnerable portion that is likely to cause defects such as burrs to the common electrode CE in the process of forming the electrode opening CE-OP in the common electrode CE using the light blocking layer BML as a mask. More specifically, as the distance at which a laser beam is radiated during patterning of the common electrode CE becomes longer when the total thickness of the organic layers increases, the degree of deviation from a target region of the diffracted laser beam may increase, thereby possibility of occurring defects such as burrs in the common electrode CE may increase. In the display panel DP according to an embodiment of the inventive concept, as the distance between the outermost conductive pattern GT-D and the end of the light blocking layer BML which is disposed adjacent to the transmission area TP is designed to be sufficiently longer, i.e., about 5 micrometers or longer in the cross section of the portion where the first spacer SPC<b>1</b> is disposed, it is possible to prevent light from being blocked by the outermost conductive pattern GT-D and to uniformly irradiate the laser beam for patterning the common electrode that includes a laser beam directly radiated and a laser beam diffracted or reflected to the common electrode CE. Accordingly, the occurrence of defects such as burrs is prevented in the common electrode CE, and thus the components disposed on the common electrode CE may be uniformly formed, and the reliability of the display panel DP may be improved.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0301">In addition, in the first area A<b>1</b> of the display panel DP according to an embodiment, the end of the division layer <b>310</b> and the end of the light blocking layer BML which is disposed adjacent to the transmission area TP may be substantially aligned. When the end of the light blocking layer BML which is disposed adjacent to the transmission area TP protrudes more than the end of the division layer <b>310</b>, reflection may occur by the protruded light blocking layer BML when viewed from above, so that a flare defect that the protruding light blocking layer BML is brightly viewed may occur. When the end of the division layer <b>310</b> protrudes more than the end of the light blocking layer BML which is disposed adjacent to the transmission area TP, the thickness of the end of the division layer <b>310</b> formed of an organic material becomes smaller, and thus light blocking may not be performed properly, and accordingly, the boundary of the transmissive area TP may be blurred. In the display panel DP according to an embodiment of the inventive concept, as the end of the division layer <b>310</b> and the end of the light blocking layer BML which is disposed adjacent to the transmission area TP are substantially aligned, the flare defect and the defect of the blurred boundary of the transmissive area TP may be prevented, and thus, reliability of the display panel DP may be improved.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0302"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> is a schematic plan view illustrating a partial area of the display panel DP according to an embodiment of the inventive concept. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> is an enlarged plan view illustrating a partial area of the display panel DP. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>C</figref> is a schematic plan view illustrating a line connection of the light blocking layer BML according to an embodiment of the inventive concept. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> is an enlarged view of the area BB of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0303">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> together, the display panel DP may include voltage lines VL connected to the first area A<b>1</b> of the display area DP-DA, and some of the voltage lines VL may be connected to the light blocking layer BML (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).
