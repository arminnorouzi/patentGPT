In current stretchable display devices, the substrate of the flexible or elastic material is typically designed to have a stretchable structure so that a certain stretching ratio can be achieved by stretching a hollow-out region by means of island (display unit) and bridge (circuit connection unit) connection.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In current stretchable display devices, in order to protect the flexible display substrate, a backing film is typically attached under a flexible TFT backplane for protection, and the two parts are adhered together by an Optical Clear Adhesive (OCA) layer. However, in the stretchable display device based on this structure, when the display device is stretched, the deformation region and stress of the stretchable display device are mainly concentrated on the stretched edge, while the tension force and deformation inside the display device are very small, finally resulting in that the edge has excessive deformation and even is broken, while no stretching and deformation occurs inside the display screen, and thus leading to a very low stretching ratio in general. The main reason for this phenomenon is that the TFT backplane layer of the display substrate made of a PI material has the greatest elastic modulus, the backing film material has a medium elastic modulus, and the Optical Clear Adhesive (OCA) layer between the two has the smallest elastic modulus, i.e. has the highest flexibility and is most likely to be deformed. As a result, the OCA is deformed greatly in the stretched region and even rubbed, while the OCA inside the screen is not even stretched, thereby causing the problem that the patterned PI layer on the OCA layer is broken due to excessive local stress on the edge region, while no obvious stretching occurs in the interior.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided an optical adhesive layer, including:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">an edge region enclosing a hollow portion;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">a plurality of block regions distributed in the hollow portion along a first direction and a second direction;
