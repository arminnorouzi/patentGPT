These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows an example of an exhaust insulation system <b>100</b>. The system <b>100</b> is shown over a workpiece <b>102</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the workpiece <b>102</b> includes an exhaust component, although the invention is not so limited. More specifically, the workpiece <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, illustrates a section of an exhaust pipe. In selected examples, the exhaust insulation system <b>100</b> is implemented to cover a portion of an exhaust pipe to prevent adjacent components from undue heat exposure, or to reduce risk of injury to an operator, by shielding the portion of exhaust pipe. Other exhaust components that may be insulated using examples of the present invention include, but are not limited to, mufflers, manifolds, catalytic converters, etc. Although exhaust components are used as an example, insulation systems described in the present disclosure may be used to insulate any hot or cold component from unwanted external exposure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The exhaust insulation system <b>100</b> includes a base insulation layer <b>110</b>. In one example, the base insulation layer <b>110</b> includes a fiber mat insulation layer. The base insulation layer <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a fiber mat insulation layer. In one example the fiber mat insulation layer includes substantially random fiber orientations within a plane of the mat. In one example the fiber mat insulation layer includes E-glass fibers. One advantage of fiber mat insulation layers includes additional space for trapped air, which increases an insulating property of the fiber mat insulation layer. Another advantage of a fiber mat insulation layer is cost. Fiber mat insulation layers are significantly less expensive than fabric insulation, which reduces an overall cost of the system <b>100</b>. In one example using a fiber mat insulation layer as a base insulation layer <b>110</b>, a thickness dimension is controlled, and installation is simplified as described below.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one example, the fiber mat insulation layer <b>110</b> includes a glass fiber mat. Glass fiber mats have an advantage of being less expensive than ceramic fiber mats or other high temperature fiber mats. In selected examples the performance of other fiber materials provides advantages that justify the increased cost over glass fiber mats.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The fiber mat insulation layer <b>110</b> may, for example, be formed from a fiber mat such as a vitreous silicate fiber mat, a ceramic fiber mat or a high-temperature (HT) ceramic fiber mat. In one example, a combination of fiber types may be included in the fiber mat insulation layer <b>110</b>. The type of mat may be selected based on performance characteristics. The chart below illustrates thermal conductivity versus temperature for three different fiber mats. <?img id="EMI-00001" he="93.98mm" wi="147.40mm" file="US20230003334A1-20230105-P00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif" ?></p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A vitreous silicate mat does not form Crystobalite, is bio-soluble and has low irritability when handling. Crystobalite is undesirable in some circumstances due to health concerns. It is also less expensive than ceramic fiber mat and has low shot content. Shot content (the amount of non-fiber particles found in a mat) may be undesirable because non-fiber particles do not trap insulating air as effectively as fibers. Ceramic fibers are more expensive than vitreous silicate but offer insulation up to higher peak and service temperatures. In one example, ceramic fibers have a high melt temperature (&#x3e;3000&#xb0; Fahrenheit). Ceramic fiber mats can also provide low heat storage and better sound absorption than a vitreous silicate mat, making it preferred in some installation environments. Ceramic fiber mats can also be free of binder or lubricant and be immune to thermal shock.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one example, the fiber mat insulation layer includes one or more types of high temperature insulating wool fibers. Examples include, but are not limited to, alkaline earth silicate wool (AES wool), aluminum silicate wool (ASW), refractory ceramic fiber (RCF), and polycrystalline wool (PCW).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one example, the base insulation layer <b>110</b> includes a braided fiber fabric insulation layer, such as a braided glass fabric insulation layer. A braided fabric includes a number of fibers or yarns that are interwoven without yarns being twisted about one another. In one example, a braided base insulation layer <b>110</b> includes a bi-axial braided base insulation layer <b>110</b>. In one example, a braided base insulation layer <b>110</b> includes a bi-axial braided sleeve. One advantage of a braided sleeve includes the ability to conform to the workpiece <b>102</b> over a large range of diameters. For example, by axially compressing or stretching a braided sleeve, an inner diameter of the braided sleeve may vary by as much as 50 percent.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Additionally, braided sleeves are dimensionally consistent. Once a braided sleeve is installed over a workpiece <b>102</b>, and an inner diameter is tightened by stretching, there is minimal variation in a thickness of the braided sleeve. If subsequent layers of the system <b>100</b> are desired, it is easier to slide them over the base insulation layer <b>110</b> if the thickness dimension is consistent. Further, once a braided sleeve is installed, it tends to stay in place, making subsequent layers easier to install. After stretching a braided sleeve, the braided sleeve will tend to grip the workpiece, keeping the braided sleeve in place. A drawback is that a braided glass does not compress once fitted over a component, tends to cost significantly more than mat insulation and can have poorer performance in certain applications.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> further shows a polyimide layer <b>112</b> at least partially surrounding the base insulation layer <b>110</b>. In one example, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the polyimide layer <b>112</b> includes a band of polyimide wrapped spirally around the fiber mat insulation layer <b>110</b>. In one example, the process of wrapping the fiber mat insulation layer <b>110</b> at least partially compresses the fiber mat insulation layer <b>110</b>. In this way, a thickness of the fiber mat insulation layer <b>110</b> is more effectively controlled than with a bare fiber mat insulation layer <b>110</b>. For example, fiber mat insulation base layer <b>110</b> may be compressed by about 40%-60% or more, depending on the application. In one example, the fiber mat insulation layer <b>110</b> has a thickness of about 0.75 inches when placed over an exhaust component and a thickness of 0.40 inches after being compressively wrapped by the polyimide layer.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Additionally, by wrapping the fiber mat insulation layer <b>110</b>, later processing steps in forming the system <b>100</b> are facilitated because, for example, the fiber mat insulation layer <b>110</b> is held firmly in place by the polyimide layer <b>112</b> and the polyimide layer provides a smooth surface and firm base for an outer fabric layer. Although polyimide is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, other materials such as other polymers, or foil materials may also be used within the scope of the invention. Polyimide can provide advantages in certain application over foil material by, for example, moisture resistance, its ease of installation by wrapping, its resistance to automotive chemicals, and its low cost.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> further shows an outer layer <b>114</b>. In one example the outer layer <b>114</b> is impregnated with a resin. In one example, the resin includes a thermoset resin. In one example, the thermoset resin includes an epoxy resin. In one example, the thermoset resin includes a cured phenolic resin. One advantage of phenolic resin includes desirable cure conditions such as cure temperature, and storage lifetime prior to cure. Another advantage of phenolic resin includes low cost, and desirable high temperature properties after cure. A thermoset resin includes properties, in contrast to a thermoplastic resin. Thermoplastic resin (and thermoplastic polymers) are meltable, and can be cycled between a flowable state and a solid or glass like state. In contrast to thermoplastics, thermosets, once cured, cannot be melted. As a result, thermosets provide improved high temperature stability. Thermosets are not susceptible to unwanted melting under high temperature conditions.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one example, the outer layer includes glass fibers that form the fabric. In one example, the glass fibers include E-glass. In one example the outer layer <b>114</b> includes a braided glass fiber fabric. In one example the outer layer <b>114</b> includes a bi-axially braided glass fiber fabric. In one example the outer layer <b>114</b> includes a knitted glass fiber fabric. A phenolic, thermosetting resin-impregnated braid is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. The braid is made from multiple raw glass woven strands, each of the same type. Example fabric weaves that may be used for the outer fabric layer <b>114</b> are illustrated in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. Although a number of examples are listed, the invention is not so limited. Other resins and other fabric weaves and fabric materials are also within the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one example, the fabric includes basalt fibers that form the fabric. In one example, the fabric contains only basalt fibers. In one example basalt fibers include one or more of the minerals plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine. In one example, the minerals present in the basalt fibers are substantially or completely crystalline, in contrast to amorphic or glassy in microstructure. Advantages of crystalline phase, include, but are not limited to, high strength. Advantages of basalt, include, but are not limited to, low cost and high strength as compared to glass fibers. Unlike with other composites, such as glass fiber, essentially no materials are added during production of basalt fibers. The basalt is simply washed and then melted. Examples of basalt fibers that are suitable for fabrics as described include fibers between 10 and 20 &#x3bc;m in diameter. In one example, basalt fibers have a tensile strength between about 2.8 and 3.1 GPa, which is generally higher than glass fibers.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> further shows one or more retaining bands <b>116</b> located on one or more ends of an insulated portion. Although not required, retaining bands <b>116</b> may be useful to hold the system <b>100</b> in place during a cure step. Retaining bands <b>116</b> may also be useful to enclose rough edges of a layer, such as outer fabric layer <b>114</b>, and to provide an aesthetically pleasing transition from an insulated portion to an un-insulate portion.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows another example of an exhaust insulation system <b>150</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, a polyimide layer <b>152</b> is shown covering a base insulation layer (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) similar to base layers <b>110</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. As in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, example base insulation layers include fiber mat insulation, with several possible fiber types. In one example, the fiber mat insulation used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> includes a high temperature insulating fiber, such as a mat including ceramic fibers. The polyimide layer <b>152</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is black in color, in contrast to the orange-brown color of the polyimide <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. Any color of polyimide may be used for layer <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A mount <b>156</b> is shown coupled to the workpiece. As discussed in examples above, in one example, the workpiece is an exhaust pipe component, although the invention is not so limited. An outer layer <b>154</b> is further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. In one example, the outer fabric layer <b>153</b> includes a knit fabric weave. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the knit fabric weave is capable of additional stretching and contraction over features such as the mount <b>156</b>. This property is advantageous over other weaves such as a braided weave that may not be capable of the range of expansion and contraction of a knit weave as shown.

In operation <b>606</b>, the inner fiber mat insulation layer and the compression wrap is covered with an outer layer, wherein the outer layer is impregnated with a resin. In selected examples, the resin is later cured to harden the outer layer. For example, a raw glass braid outer layer is first dipped in a phenolic resin and allowed to semi-cure. The semi-cured braid is then placed over an exhaust part (already wrapped with a polyimide film over a fiber mat base layer) and thereafter given a final cure at an elevated temperature to harden the outer layer and form a composite cover for the exhaust insulation system. In some examples, after cooling, the hardened cover is secured to the exhaust part with high strength stainless steel bands on both ends.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref> illustrate an example exhaust insulation system <b>700</b> for a workpiece such as an exhaust pipe <b>710</b>. The insulation system <b>700</b> includes a base insulation layer <b>720</b> (show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>) disposed about a section of the exhaust pipe <b>710</b>. The base insulation layer <b>720</b> can, for example, be a fiber mat (e.g., insulation blanket) tape wrapped about the pipe <b>710</b>. The base insulation layer <b>720</b> can be made from the materials described with regard to the above embodiments. The insulation system <b>700</b> further includes a hard outer cover <b>730</b> formed from a knit tape <b>732</b> impregnated with a resin such as a thermosetting phenolic resin. The knit tape <b>732</b> can be impregnated with the resin as described further below. The knit tape <b>732</b> is wrapped spirally about the base insulation layer <b>720</b> and the section of the exhaust pipe <b>710</b>. Advantageously, the knit tape outer cover <b>730</b> and underlying insulation layer <b>720</b> can be substantially coextensive in length. For example, the base insulation layer <b>720</b> can extend between the ends <b>734</b> of the knit tape outer cover <b>730</b>. The exhaust insulation system <b>700</b> can further include retaining bands <b>740</b> (e.g., clamps) on the ends <b>734</b> of the knit wrap outer cover <b>730</b> to clamp the outer cover to the exhaust pipe <b>710</b>. In other embodiments, a mold can be placed over the ends of the knit tape during curing and then removed. The molds can stabilize the ends of the hard cover so that no retaining bands or clamps are needed. In some embodiments, molds can be used during curing and retaining bands can also be provided.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the illustrated exhaust insulation system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>, the knit tape outer cover <b>730</b> is disposed directly adjacent the base insulation layer <b>720</b> without an intervening layer of material. In other embodiments, the exhaust insulation system <b>700</b> can include a middle layer comprising a polyimide band wrapped spirally around the base insulation layer and disposed between the base insulation layer and the knit outer cover. The band of polyimide can compress the base insulation layer <b>720</b> against the exhaust pipe <b>710</b>. The optional polyimide band can be similar to the bands described above.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As noted above, the hard outer cover <b>730</b> can be formed from a knit tape <b>732</b> wrapped about the underlying insulation. The knit tape <b>732</b> can, for example, be formed from fiberglass or e-fiberglass, have a thickness ranging from 0.010 to 0.025 inches, and have a width ranging from 2 to 4 inches. The knit tape <b>732</b> can be a warp knitted fabric with a raschel knit, for example. In one example, the knit tape <b>732</b> is a 3 inch wide fiberglass tape having a nominal thickness of 0.023 inches or between 0.020 and 0.025 inches (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> for examples of knit tapes). The outer cover <b>730</b> can include successive turns of the knit tape <b>732</b> where, e.g., a second turn of the knit tape <b>732</b> overlaps a first, adjacent turn by an overlap amount ranging from 25% to 75% of a width of the knit tape <b>732</b>. It has been found that it can be important for the tape width, thickness, overlap amount to be within these ranges so that the outer cover <b>730</b> after curing can be sufficiently hard and durable to resist cracking, be impact resistant and be splinter resistant while at the same time being smooth. As compared to outer covers using braided fabric or knit fabric sleeves and/or braided or knit fabrics with texturized yarns, the knit tape outer cover <b>730</b> described herein can be smooth after curing and require no or minimal post-cure smoothing (e.g., deburring and/or sanding) to remove burrs and sharp fibers as can be the case with braided fabric outer layer. The knit tape <b>732</b> can also flex and stretch. This can, for example, allow the tape to lie substantially flat against the pipe, to wrap around bends and other components (e.g., tabs) on a workpiece, and to provide compression against the underlying insulation layer. The knit tape <b>732</b> can, for example, provide compression of the base insulation layer, in a similar manner as a polyimide band as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an insulation system <b>800</b> on a workpiece such as an exhaust pipe <b>810</b> having bends. The insulation system <b>800</b> can include a base insulation layer (not shown) and hard outer cover <b>830</b> made from a knit tape <b>832</b>, as discussed above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>. In some embodiments, the exhaust pipe <b>810</b> can include a bracket <b>812</b> extending outward from the pipe <b>810</b>. The bracket <b>812</b> can be welded to the pipe, for example. The use of a knit tape <b>832</b> to form the outer cover <b>830</b> facilitates the assembly of the knit tape <b>832</b> around the bracket. The insulation system <b>800</b> can further include a plate <b>850</b> disposed around the bracket and over the knit tape <b>832</b> to facilitate securing the outer cover <b>830</b> to the pipe <b>810</b>. The plate <b>850</b> can be interference fit around the bracket <b>812</b> or can be provided with tabs that can be welded to the bracket, as examples. Using knit tape to form an outer cover, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B and <b>8</b></figref> for example, allows for easier formation of the cover generally and in particular around bends and tabs of a pipe. A knit tape wrapped cover can better accommodate different diameter pipes as compared to knit or braided sleeves which are generally custom designed for specific diameter pipes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> illustrate knit tape having a width W with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> showing the knit tape <b>900</b> before being impregnated with a resin and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> showing a resin-impregnated knit tape <b>1000</b> in a semi-cured state.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a method of insulating an exhaust pipe. At block <b>1102</b>, a portion of an exhaust pipe is covered with an insulation layer having ends and defining a length between the ends. The insulation layer can, for example, be formed by wrapping an insulation blanket of a desired length about the pipe. The insulation layer can be formed from various materials as described above. In one example, the insulation is cut (e.g., plotter-cut) in a pattern to fit the exhaust pipe section. An example of insulation <b>1200</b> cut to a pattern for fitting an exhaust pipe with bends is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. The cutouts <b>1202</b> in the pattern can relieve bunching in the bends of the exhaust pipe.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">At block <b>1104</b>, a resin-impregnated knit tape can wrapped about the portion of the exhaust pipe. The knit tape can be spirally wrapped to be coextensive with the length of the insulation layer. The knit tape can for example be impregnated with a thermoset phenolic resin and wrapped about the insulating layer while in a semi-cured state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> illustrate an example knit tape <b>900</b> before (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) and after (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) being impregnated with a resin. The knit tape <b>900</b> can be wrapped directly about the insulation layer or optionally a compressive, polyimide band can be wrapped about the insulation layer prior to wrapping the knit tape.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The knit tape can be impregnated with the resin by dipping the knit tape in the resin, by purchasing pre-impregnated (prepreg) tape, or though other techniques. The knit tape includes natural gaps in its fabric and impregnating the knit tape with resin can include applying an amount of the thermoset resin so that after the heating of the knit tape (block <b>1106</b>) the cured thermoset resin covers the gaps (e.g., spans the gaps so that none of the underlying insulating layer is exposed). The amount of dry resin used can range from 100%-120% of the raw knit tape weight. Using an amount of dry resin in this range can advantageously provide a smooth, durable outer cover with a resin (when fully cured) that spans gaps in the knit tape.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">At block <b>1106</b>, the resin-impregnated knit tape can be heated to cure the thermosetting resin and form a hardened outer cover. Wrapping the knit tape can include wrapping successive turns of the knit tape with an overlap. For example, one turn of the knit tape can overlap an adjacent turn of the knit tape by an overlap amount ranging from 25% to 75% of the width of the knit tape. The knit tape can have similar width, thickness and other characteristics as the knit tape described above. As discussed above, after curing the outer cover can be sufficiently hard and durable to resist cracking, be impact resistant and be splinter resistant while at the same time being smooth. The exhaust pipe as insulated can thereafter be assembled and/or used in a high heat application without need for deburring.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The method can further include providing retainer bands such as clamps on the ends of the knit cover to secure the cover to the pipe. This can be done after curing the knit tape. The method can further include providing a mold over the ends of the knit tape and curing the knit tape with the molds in place to stabilize and secure the ends of the knit cover. The molds are then removed after curing. In this case, the final system can be used without retaining bands securing the hardened outer cover, though in other embodiments, retaining bands can be used in addition to using a mold during curing. Where the pipe includes a bracket, a plate can be provided around the bracket to facilitate securing the knit tape to the pipe. This can also be done after curing the knit tape.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">To better illustrate the method and apparatuses disclosed herein, a non-limiting list of embodiments is provided here:</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Example 1 is an exhaust insulation system for an exhaust pipe that includes a base insulation layer and an outer cover of knit tape.
