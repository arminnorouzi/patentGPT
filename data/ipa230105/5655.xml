The electronic component described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H9-007879 includes an element body, an inner conductor that is disposed in the element body, and an outer electrode that is electrically connected to the inner conductor. In the electronic component described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H9-007879, a glass layer is disposed between the element body and the outer electrode and the inner conductor is connected to the outer electrode by penetrating the glass layer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a stacked coil component, an inner conductor is generally formed of a conductive material including metals Ag and Pd. However, when the inner conductor is formed of an alloy of Ag and Pd, a manufacturing cost increases because Pd is expensive and DC resistance of a coil increases. On the other hand, when the inner conductor does not include Pd and the inner conductor is formed of Ag, DC resistance of the coil decreases but connection between the inner conductor and an outer electrode may not be satisfactory due to a Kirkendall effect.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An aspect of the invention provides a stacked coil component that can suppress an increase in DC resistance of a coil and achieve improvement in connection between the coil and an outer electrode.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A stacked coil component according to an aspect of the invention includes: an element body in which a plurality of insulator layers are stacked; a coil in which a plurality of inner conductors installed in the element body are electrically connected to each other; and an outer electrode that is disposed on an outer surface of the element body, is electrically connected to the coil, and includes at least a baked electrode layer, the inner conductor connected to the outer electrode includes a connection conductor that electrically connects the baked electrode layer to the inner conductor, the connection conductor includes a protruding portion that protrudes from the outer surface of the element body to the outer electrode, the protruding portion includes a metal having a smaller diffusion coefficient than a metal of a main component included in the baked electrode layer, and the inner conductors have a lower electric resistance value than the metal included in the protruding portion.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the stacked coil component according to the aspect of the invention, the inner conductor has a lower electric resistance value than the metal included in the protruding portion. Accordingly, it is possible to suppress an increase in DC resistance of the coil in the stacked coil component according to the aspect. The baked electrode layer of the outer electrode serves as a source of a metal which is used for the connection conductor to protrude from the end surface of the element body to the baked electrode layer and to come in contact with the baked electrode layer due to the Kirkendall effect. In the stacked coil component according to the aspect, the protruding portion of the connection conductor includes a metal which has a smaller diffusion coefficient than the metal of the main component included in the outer electrode. That is, the metal of the main component included in the baked electrode layer has a larger diffusion coefficient than the metal included in the protruding portion and diffuses more easily. Accordingly, in the stacked coil component, the protruding portion is formed by causing the metal to diffuse from the baked electrode layer to the connection conductor in a manufacturing process and causing the connection conductor to expand. In this way, since the protruding portion electrically connecting the connection conductor to the baked electrode layer is formed in the stacked coil component, it is possible to satisfactorily secure connectivity between the inner conductor and the outer electrode. As a result, in the stacked coil component, it is possible to achieve improvement in connectivity between the coil and the outer electrode.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the aspect, the metal of a main component included in the baked electrode layer is Ag, and the metal included in the protruding portion is Pd.
