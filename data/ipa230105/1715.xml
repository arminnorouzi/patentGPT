The paper drawn back into the printer is discharged from the back of the printer and kept inside the kiosk terminal. Such stored paper must be periodically removed. However, the removal work is troublesome since the paper is usually kept in a place that is hard or otherwise inconvenient to reach.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The printer may have a structure that is divided into two sections (an upper and a lower section) that can be opened/separated to give access to the inside. As an example of such a structure, an upper module laid on top of a lower module can be lifted up at its front side about a hinge or fulcrum at the back side of the modules. The printer with such a structure typically has a configuration to prohibit (lock) the open-close module movements during operation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To perform maintenance on the printer, such as coping with a paper jam, an operator carries out an operation of cancelling the lock to allow opening of the printer. However, the part that accepts or permits this unlocking operation may be provided at the back of the printer which may be difficult for an operator standing at the front of the printer to access. Such a printer requires a space to be left or otherwise provided on a side of the printer so the operator can reach a hand around to the back of the printer from the front.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, with terminal devices such as an ATM or a kiosk terminal, the total lateral dimensions are typically designed to be as narrow as possible for reasons such as minimization of the installation area. Therefore, such terminal devices tend to have little extra empty space left inside or around the terminal device. Therefore, it is difficult to provide a space on the side of built-in terminal printer where the operator can insert a hand</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows the configuration of a kiosk terminal having a built-in printer according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of the structure of a printer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example of the structure of a printer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view showing a printer in an open state.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an example of the external appearance of a member forming a container unit.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view showing a state where a paper is placed on a tray.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a state where a first lever is at a release position.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an example of the structure of a printer.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a second lock part in an enlarged manner.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a cutout part in an enlarged manner.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> explains the relationship between an interlock part and a second lock part.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An embodiment described herein is to facilitate collection of printer paper that is discharged once but then drawn back into the printer for disposal or the like.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In general, according to one embodiment, a printer includes a lower module including a paper feed unit and a printing unit that is configured to print on paper fed by the paper feed unit. An upper module of the printer is above the lower module. A back side of the upper module is supported by the lower module to permit rotational movement of a front side of the upper module upwards and downwards to come into contact with and move away from the lower module. A paper handling part is in the upper module and configured to hold the paper after printing by the printing unit. A discharge unit is provided in the upper module configured to move the paper from the paper handling part out of the upper module while keeping a hold on a rear portion of the paper to allow the paper to be drawn paper back into the upper module after an elapse of a predetermined time. A container is provided in the printer including a support member. A back side of the support member is supported to permit rotational movement of a front side of the support member upwards and downwards to come into contact with and move away from a lower part of the upper module. The container is configured to receive and store the paper drawn back into the printer by the discharge unit. The container permits printed paper(s) to be stored in a region between the support member and the lower part of the upper module</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">An example embodiment will now be described using the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows the configuration of a kiosk terminal <b>2</b> having a built-in printer <b>1</b> according to the embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the position where the operator of the kiosk terminal <b>2</b> stands is on the left side in the illustration. That is, the left side in the illustration corresponds to a position at the front of the kiosk terminal <b>2</b>. The kiosk terminal <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is being viewed from the righthand side of the kiosk terminal <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In this embodiment, the printer <b>1</b> is built into the kiosk terminal <b>2</b>. However, in other examples, printer <b>1</b> may be built in to an ATM or any other device that may utilize or require a printer function.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The kiosk terminal <b>2</b> has an operation display unit <b>4</b> on top of a vertically long box-like main body unit <b>3</b> (also referred to as a housing or a case). The operation display unit <b>4</b> is configured to accept an input operation corresponding to a display content. For example, the operation display unit <b>4</b> comprises a touch panel superimposed on the surface of a display device such as a liquid crystal panel. The main body unit <b>3</b> has the printer <b>1</b> and other peripheral devices/units such as a card reader-writer as built-in components.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The left side in the illustration is the position where the operator of the kiosk terminal <b>2</b> stands. The operation display unit <b>4</b> displays information toward the position where the operator stands. The printer <b>1</b> dispenses a printed object (e.g., a slip of paper) toward the position where the operator stands. The sides and back of such a kiosk terminal <b>2</b> are not necessarily open or accessible, except for the position where the operator stands. Therefore, the kiosk terminal <b>2</b> is configured in such a way that an operation and maintenance or the like can be performed from its front side (that is, the left side in the illustration).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The structure of the printer <b>1</b> will now be described, using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>11</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> show an example of the structure of the printer <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows printer <b>1</b> in an operating state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the printer <b>1</b> in an open state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and thus also shows the printer <b>1</b> in the open state.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the left side in the illustration is the front side (forward side) of the printer <b>1</b>. Therefore, the left-right direction in the illustration is the depth direction (front-back direction) of the printer <b>1</b>. The depth direction (direction into the page) in the illustration (direction orthogonal to the sheet surface) is the width (left-right direction) of the printer <b>1</b>. The up-down direction in the illustration is the height direction of the printer <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the printer <b>1</b> as viewed from a front oblique direction.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The printer <b>1</b> has a lower module <b>10</b>, an upper module <b>20</b>, a container unit <b>30</b>, a first lock part <b>40</b>, a second lock part <b>50</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), and an interlock part <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the lower module <b>10</b>, a paper feed unit <b>11</b>, a printing unit <b>12</b>, and a conveyor unit <b>13</b> are provided. In the upper module <b>20</b>, a loading part <b>21</b> and a discharge unit <b>22</b> are provided.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The printer <b>1</b> has a shaft <b>19</b> that extends along the width direction (left-right direction) at the back side of the upper module <b>20</b> and the lower module <b>10</b>. The shaft <b>19</b> attaches the upper module <b>20</b> in a rotationally movable manner to the lower module <b>10</b>. Thus, the upper module <b>20</b> is located on top of the lower module <b>10</b> and supported at its back side in a rotationally movable manner to the lower module <b>10</b>. The upper module <b>20</b> thus comes into contact with and moves away from the lower module <b>10</b> with the rotational movement. Near the shaft <b>19</b>, an urging member (e.g., a spring mechanism or the like) pressing the upper module <b>20</b> in the direction of lifting up the upper module <b>20</b> can be provided. The urging member is, for example, a torsion spring or the like provided around the shaft <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The paper feed unit <b>11</b> has two different paper feed paths (<b>111</b>, <b>112</b>) and feeds a paper taken in from either of the paper feed paths (<b>111</b>, <b>112</b>) to the printing unit <b>12</b>. The paper feed unit <b>11</b> feeds paper to the printing unit <b>12</b> via the first paper feed path <b>111</b>, and when paper runs out, performs a back-feed via the paper feed path <b>111</b> to draw back the paper from the printing unit <b>12</b> and then feeds paper via the second paper feed path <b>112</b>. The paper is a fan-folded paper, for example. The folded part of the fan-folded paper is contained inside a lower part of the vertically long box-like main body unit <b>3</b> or the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The printing unit <b>12</b> has a print head and a platen and prints on a paper held between the print head and the platen. A cutter for cutting the printed paper into a predetermined length is provided downstream of the printing unit <b>12</b>. The conveyor unit <b>13</b> has a substantially U-shaped conveyance path extending from the lower module <b>10</b> to the upper module <b>20</b> and conveys the printed and cut paper to the loading part <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The loading part <b>21</b> (also referred to as a paper handling part) is provided in the upper module <b>20</b> and holds the paper that has been printed by the printing unit <b>12</b> after the printing has been completed. More specifically, in this example, the loading part <b>21</b> aligns together a plurality of papers (e.g., tickets, coupons or the like) that have been printed and then cut into a predetermined length, and forms a paper bundle or stack.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The discharge unit <b>22</b> is provided in the upper module <b>20</b> and moves (discharges) the paper bundle out of the upper module <b>20</b>, while pinching (gripping) a rear part of the paper bundle. The discharge unit <b>22</b> is also capable of drawing the paper bundle back into the upper module <b>20</b> after the lapsing of a predetermined time. Thus, if the discharged paper bundle is not retrieved by a user/customer within some expected time, the discharge unit <b>22</b> returns the paper bundle to the interior of the printer <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an example of the external appearance of a member forming the container unit <b>30</b>. The container unit <b>30</b> has a tray <b>31</b>, which is a plate-like member, as a support member for supporting paper. The tray <b>31</b> is supported at its end part <b>32</b> on the back side in a rotationally movable manner to a lower part of the upper module <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and comes into contact with and moves away from the upper module <b>20</b> with the rotational movement. The container unit <b>30</b> is fixed at a position near the upper module <b>20</b> by the second lock part <b>50</b>, when the upper module <b>20</b> is at a position near the lower module <b>10</b> and the printer <b>1</b> is in the operating state.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">On the tray <b>31</b>, the paper that has been drawn back by the discharge unit <b>22</b> is stored. The container unit <b>30</b> holds the paper between the tray <b>31</b> and the upper module <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view showing a paper S on the tray <b>31</b>. At a middle part of the tray <b>31</b> in the width direction, a hole <b>33</b> that makes it easier to grasp the paper S remove the paper S is formed.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The first lock part <b>40</b> will now be described, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>7</b></figref>. The first lock part <b>40</b> fixes the upper module <b>20</b> at a position near the lower module <b>10</b> in a rotationally unmovable manner. When the fixation (lock) by the first lock part <b>40</b> is cancelled (disengaged), the upper module <b>20</b> moves in the direction away from the lower module <b>10</b> due to an urging force of the urging member provided near the shaft <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The urging member may provide at least a force large enough to avoid unintended relocking by the first lock part <b>40</b> due to a downward movement of the upper module <b>20</b> under its own weight. The urging member need not provide a force that is large enough to flip up the upper module <b>20</b> to the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> on its own. Preferably, the upper module <b>20</b> is lifted up to such an extent that the operator can recognize the cancellation (disengagement) of the lock has occurred.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A specific example of the configuration of the first lock part <b>40</b> will now be described. The first lock part <b>40</b> includes a stud <b>41</b>, which is an example of a first fixture, a first lever <b>42</b>, a shaft <b>43</b>, and an urging member <b>44</b>. The urging member <b>44</b> is a tension spring, for example. The stud <b>41</b> is provided in the lower module <b>10</b>. The shaft <b>43</b> and the first lever <b>42</b> are provided in the upper module <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The first lever <b>42</b> is attached in a rotationally movable manner to a side plate <b>25</b> of the upper module <b>20</b> by the shaft <b>43</b> along the width direction (left-right direction) of the printer <b>1</b>. With the rotational movement, the first lever <b>42</b> is movable between a holding position for holding the stud <b>41</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and a release position for releasing the stud <b>41</b> that has been held (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the state where the first lever <b>42</b> is at the release position.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The urging member <b>44</b> urges the first lever <b>42</b> in a direction going from the release position to the holding position (counterclockwise in the illustration). When the external force that places the first lever <b>42</b> at the release position against the force provide by the urging member <b>44</b> is no longer applied, the first lever <b>42</b> automatically returns to the holding position.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first lever <b>42</b> has a groove <b>421</b> and a pressed part <b>422</b>. The groove <b>421</b> has a width that is enough for the stud <b>41</b> to enter and exit. When the upper module <b>20</b> is at a position near the lower module <b>10</b>, the groove <b>421</b> catches and holds the stud <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The pressed part <b>422</b> is a part receiving a pressing force from a link lever <b>61</b> and is located on the opposite side of the groove <b>421</b> from the shaft <b>43</b>. As the pressed part <b>422</b> is pressed, the first lever <b>42</b> rotationally moves in a direction such that the stud <b>41</b> exits the groove <b>421</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The first lever <b>42</b> has at its distal end a guide slope <b>423</b> (sloped portion) for guiding the stud <b>41</b> to the groove <b>421</b>. The guide slope <b>423</b> is provided to slide on the stud <b>41</b> and thus facilitate the rotational movement of the first lever <b>42</b> when the upper module <b>20</b> moves downward from its position away from the lower module <b>10</b> to its position near the lower module <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The interlock part <b>60</b> will now be described, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an example of the structure of the printer and shows the state where the link lever <b>61</b> is removed from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The interlock part <b>60</b> has the link lever <b>61</b>, studs <b>66</b>, <b>67</b>, and an urging member <b>69</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). The urging member <b>69</b> is a tension spring, for example.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The link lever <b>61</b> is provided in the upper module <b>20</b> with its longitudinal direction laid in the depth direction of the upper module <b>20</b> and has a handle <b>62</b> protruding to the front side of the upper module <b>20</b> and a pressing part <b>63</b> at the back side. The pressing part <b>63</b> is provided at a position facing the pressed part <b>422</b> of the first lever <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Two slots <b>64</b>, <b>65</b> are formed in the link lever <b>61</b>.

Thus, the link lever <b>61</b> is slidable in the front-back direction of the upper module <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A cutout part <b>68</b> is formed between the slot <b>64</b> and the slot <b>65</b> in the link lever <b>61</b>. One end of the urging member <b>69</b> is attached to the cutout part <b>68</b>. The other end of the urging member <b>69</b> is attached to the upper module <b>20</b>. The urging member <b>69</b> connects the cutout part <b>68</b> (formed in the link lever <b>61</b>) and the upper module <b>20</b>. Thus, the link lever <b>61</b> is urged toward the front side of the upper module <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this way, the link lever <b>61</b> can reciprocate between the front side and the back side of the printer <b>1</b> and acts on the first lock part <b>40</b> and the second lock part <b>50</b> when moving to the back side in the direction indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. That is, the link lever <b>61</b> moves the first lever <b>42</b> to the release position and also moves a second lever <b>54</b> to a release position.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The action of the link lever <b>61</b> on the first lever <b>42</b> will now be described more in detail. If the handle <b>62</b> of the link lever <b>61</b> is pushed in when the upper module <b>20</b> is near the lower module <b>10</b>, the pressing part <b>63</b> in moving to the back side of the upper module <b>20</b> presses the pressed part <b>422</b>. Thus, the first lever <b>42</b> rotationally moves. The stud <b>41</b> exits the groove <b>421</b> and the stud <b>41</b> is thus released. The upper module <b>20</b> is lifted up due to the force provided by the urging member near the shaft <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The second lock part <b>50</b> will now be described, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>8</b> to <b>11</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the second lock part <b>50</b> is formed by a slide pin <b>51</b>, a guide part <b>52</b>, a cutout part <b>53</b>, the second lever <b>54</b>, a shaft <b>55</b>, and an urging member <b>58</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).

The guide part <b>52</b> is, for example, a slot formed in a lateral part of the tray <b>31</b> and having its longitudinal direction laid in the depth direction of the tray <b>31</b>. The slide pin <b>51</b> is an example of a second fixture. The slide pin <b>51</b> slides within the guide part <b>52</b> and thus can reciprocate between the front side and the back side in the depth direction of the tray <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The urging member <b>58</b> urges the slide pin <b>51</b> toward one end of its movement range, that is, causes the slide pin <b>51</b> to move to one side of the guide part <b>52</b>.

The cutout part <b>53</b> is provided at a lower end part of the side plate <b>25</b> of the upper module <b>20</b>. The cutout part <b>53</b> is an example of a holding part and can hold the slide pin <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The cutout part <b>53</b> has four sections: a slope part <b>531</b> (first sloped portion), a bend part <b>532</b> (bent portion), a slope part <b>533</b> (second sloped portion), and a terminal end part <b>534</b> (end portion) at an edge near the front side of the printer <b>1</b>. The slope part <b>531</b> faces obliquely downward to the back of the printer <b>1</b>. The slope part <b>533</b> faces obliquely upward to the back of the printer <b>1</b>. The bend part <b>532</b> couples (joins) the slope part <b>531</b> and the slope part <b>533</b> together. The bend part <b>532</b> is, for example, a rounded corner portion or the like.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The slope part <b>531</b> moves the slide pin <b>51</b> of the tray <b>31</b> supported by the support part <b>15</b> against the force provided by the urging member <b>58</b> in the course of the movement of the upper module <b>20</b> toward the lower module <b>10</b> from the open state of the printer <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The slide pin <b>51</b> moves by sliding on the slope part <b>531</b>.

When the slide pin <b>51</b> is in the terminal end part <b>534</b>, the lock by the second lock part <b>50</b> is applied (engaged). The container unit <b>30</b> is fixed at a position near the upper module <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The slope part <b>533</b> converts the force received from the slide pin <b>51</b> moving according to the urging by the urging member <b>58</b> into a force that moves the tray <b>31</b> toward the upper module <b>20</b>. Thus, the tray <b>31</b> is lifted up and the supported part <b>34</b> on the lower surface of the tray <b>31</b> moves away from the support part <b>15</b>, thus forming a gap between the supported part <b>34</b> and the support part <b>15</b>. Also, since the container unit <b>30</b> and the lower module <b>10</b> consequently do not interfere with each other, the upper module <b>20</b> can be pushed a little further down. As the upper module <b>20</b> is slightly pushed down after the gap is formed between the supported part <b>34</b> and the support part <b>15</b>, the lock by the first lock part <b>40</b> is applied. In this way, the slope part <b>533</b> is formed in such a position and shape as to guide the slide pin <b>51</b> before the upper module <b>20</b> is fixed by the first lock part <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The second lever <b>54</b> will now be described.

With the rotational movement, the second lever <b>54</b> is movable between a position that does not interfere with the slide pin <b>51</b> and a release position for releasing the slide pin <b>51</b> held by the cutout part <b>53</b>. The second lever <b>54</b> rotationally moves by having a force transmitted thereto from the interlock part <b>60</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> explains the relationship between the interlock part <b>60</b> and the second lock part <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The link lever <b>61</b> of the interlock part <b>60</b> is located, overlapping the second lever <b>54</b> of the second lock part <b>50</b> from outside in the width direction of the printer <b>1</b>. The second lever <b>54</b> has a protrusion <b>56</b> that is long in the up-down direction of the printer <b>1</b>. The protrusion <b>56</b> protrudes outward in the width direction of the printer <b>1</b>, that is, toward the link lever <b>61</b>. In the link lever <b>61</b>, a recess <b>57</b> in which the protrusion <b>56</b> is slidably fitted is formed. The link lever <b>61</b> and the second lever <b>54</b> intersect each other at the position where the protrusion <b>56</b> is fitted in the recess <b>57</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In such a structure, when the link lever <b>61</b> moves in the depth direction of the printer <b>1</b>, the recess <b>57</b> moves in the depth direction, too. Therefore, the protrusion <b>56</b> fitted in the recess <b>57</b> moves in the depth direction, too. During this movement, the protrusion <b>56</b> slides on the recess <b>57</b>. Thus, the second lever <b>54</b> rotationally moves about the shaft <b>55</b> in response to a force in the direction of the depth. Then, the second lever <b>54</b> interferes with the slide pin <b>51</b> and moves the slide pin <b>51</b> against the force provided by the urging member <b>58</b>. Also, at this time, the lock on the upper module <b>20</b> by the first lock part <b>40</b> is cancelled and the upper module <b>20</b> is urged in the opening direction. Therefore, the slide pin <b>51</b> moves from the terminal end part <b>534</b>, passes the slope part <b>533</b>, goes beyond the bend part <b>532</b>, and exits the cutout part <b>53</b>. Thus, the lock by the second lock part <b>50</b> is cancelled and the container unit <b>30</b> can be opened.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">When opening the printer <b>1</b> to perform maintenance or the like, the operator first holds the handle <b>62</b> of the link lever <b>61</b> and pushes the link lever <b>61</b> in the direction from the front towards the back of the printer <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As the link lever <b>61</b> is pushed in from the front, the pressing part <b>63</b> of the link lever <b>61</b> presses the pressed part <b>422</b> of the first lever <b>42</b>. Then, the first lever <b>42</b> rotationally moves clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The stud <b>41</b> held in the groove <b>421</b> is thus released. Then, the upper module <b>20</b> rotationally moves about the shaft <b>19</b> and is lifted up due to the urging by the urging member. Thus, the operator can recognize that the lock by the first lock part <b>40</b> is now cancelled (disengaged). Having recognized that the lock by the first lock part <b>40</b> is cancelled, the operator may then lift up the upper module <b>20</b>. Thus, with this operator lifting action the upper module <b>20</b> rotationally moves further about the shaft <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As the link lever <b>61</b> is pushed in from the front, the recess <b>57</b> of the link lever <b>61</b> moves the protrusion <b>56</b> of the second lever <b>54</b> with the movement of the link lever <b>61</b>. Thus, the second lever <b>54</b> rotationally moves and the lock by the second lock part <b>50</b> is cancelled (disengaged). The container unit <b>30</b> is thus opened or openable.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">When opening the printer <b>1</b> for the purpose of coping with a paper jam or the like, the operator generally needs to do nothing with the container unit <b>30</b> and therefore may simply manually push up the tray <b>31</b> from below to close the container unit <b>30</b> and fix the container unit <b>30</b> by the second lock part <b>50</b>. Subsequently, the operator copes with a paper jam or the like.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">A case where the operator having finished maintenance or the like returns the upper module <b>20</b> to the position near the lower module <b>10</b> will now be described. The operator first pushes down the upper module <b>20</b> against the force provided by the urging member about the shaft <b>19</b>. Thus, the upper module <b>20</b> moves downward while rotationally moving about the shaft <b>19</b>. Accordingly, the guide slope <b>423</b> (sloped portion) at the distal end of the first lever <b>42</b> slides on the stud <b>41</b>, and with this sliding, the first lever <b>42</b> rotationally moves against the force provided by the urging member <b>44</b>. Once the guide slope <b>423</b> passes the stud <b>41</b>, the stud <b>41</b> is fitted in the groove <b>421</b> and held therein. Thus, the upper module <b>20</b> reaches its completely closed position and the printer <b>1</b> becomes operable again.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the container unit <b>30</b> is opened in the above operation, the slide pin <b>51</b> in second lock part <b>50</b> enters the cutout part <b>53</b> and thus becomes locked when the upper module <b>20</b> moves down while rotating about the shaft <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In this way, in the printer <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, operating the link lever <b>61</b> enables operation of both the first lock part <b>40</b> and the second lock part <b>50</b> provided at the back side of the printer <b>1</b>. Therefore, a single operation of pushing in the link lever <b>61</b> can cancel (disengage) the fixation of the upper module <b>20</b> to the lower module <b>10</b> (making the upper module <b>20</b> rotationally movable for opening), cancel (disengage) the fixation of the container unit <b>30</b> to the upper module <b>20</b>, and open the container unit <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Also, opening and closing the upper module <b>20</b> and the lower module <b>10</b> can be performed without reaching around to the back side of the printer <b>1</b> from a side of the printer <b>1</b> or the like.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Also, the container unit <b>30</b> containing the paper drawn back by the discharge unit <b>22</b> is provided but the operation for opening the printer <b>1</b> remains similar to those in the related art even though the container unit <b>30</b> is now added to the printer <b>1</b>. Therefore, the container unit <b>30</b> can be used without impairing expected operability.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Moreover, in existing examples, the paper kept inside the kiosk terminal <b>2</b> generally needs to be collected from the back side of the printer <b>1</b>, whereas, in this embodiment, the paper drawn back by the discharge unit <b>22</b> is contained in the container unit <b>30</b> and therefore the paper can be collected from the front side of the printer <b>1</b> and this makes the collection easier.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">While some embodiments have been described, these embodiments are presented simply as examples and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.
