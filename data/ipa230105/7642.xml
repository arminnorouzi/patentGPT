TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates to, but is not limited to, the field of wireless communications and, in particular, to an information transmission method, apparatus and system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">III. BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The wireless communication technology is developing and the user requirements for communications are increasing. The higher, faster and newer communications are in demand. 5th generation (5G) mobile communication technology has already become a trend of development of the future network.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An existing Long Term Evolution (LTE) or LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) system performs data transmission based on dynamic scheduling of each sub-frame; that is, each sub-frame may transmit different control channels. However, the design of LTE/LTE-A standard control channels is single and of poor flexibility. When services to be supported have greatly different requirements on delay, reliability and the like, the system efficiency is significantly reduced. With the rise of intelligent terminals and the enrichment of wireless data application services, data users in a wireless communication system have increased substantially and data content is no longer limited to a traditional text or image. In the future, users have increasing requirements on multimedia services such as high-definition videos and mobile TVs, resulting in an explosive growth of wireless network traffic. The 5G technology is designed to tackle challenges brought by differentiated performance indicators in various application scenarios. Performance challenges in different application scenarios are different. A user experience rate, a traffic density, delay, energy efficiency and the number of connections may become challenging indicators in various scenarios. From perspectives of service requirements and challenges in main application scenarios of the mobile Internet and the Internet of Things, four main 5G technical scenarios may be summarized as: a continuous wide-area coverage scenario, a high-capacity hot-spot scenario, a low-power-consumption high-connection-density scenario and a low-delay high-reliability scenario.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Considering that the 5G technology needs to support various applications with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, the design of control channels in the existing LTE technology cannot well meet the requirement of the 5G system on design flexibility, and control channels in the related art has poor scalability and adaptability. This will seriously decrease system spectrum efficiency and increase system maintenance costs. In addition, a terminal device which supports multiple services may only determine the support situation of a current system for different services through blind detection, which greatly affects system performance, increases power consumption and control overhead of the terminal device. Moreover, the system has poor &#x201c;forward compatibility&#x201d;.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">IV.

A physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) and an enhanced physical downlink control channel (EPDCCH) are defined. Information carried in a physical control format indicator channel (PCFICH) is used for instructing the number of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols for transmitting the PDCCH in one sub-frame. A physical hybrid automatic repeat-reQuest (ARQ) indicator channel (PHICH) is used for carrying feedback information for an acknowledgement/a negative acknowledgement (ACK/NACK) of uplink transmission data. The downlink control channel employs blind detection, that is, a terminal device attempts to demodulate the downlink control channel with different aggregation levels and candidate sets in a certain search space. The search space of an existing user equipment (UE) is illustrated in Table 1 and Table 2. The search space includes candidate sets corresponding to different aggregation levels. When a UE demodulates the control channel, the UE needs to trying demodulating each candidate set until a candidate set is demodulated correctly; otherwise the UE considers that the UE has not received its own control channel.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>PDCCH search space</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="126pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Search Space S<sub>k</sub><sup>(L)</sup></entry><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Aggregation</entry><entry>Size (in</entry><entry>Number of PDCCH</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Type</entry><entry>Level: L</entry><entry>CCEs)</entry><entry>Candidates: M<sup>(L)</sup></entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>UE-specific</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>6</entry><entry>6</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>2</entry><entry>12</entry><entry>6</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>4</entry><entry>18</entry><entry>2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>8</entry><entry>16</entry><entry>2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0159" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>EPDCCH search space</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="182pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Number of EPDCCH Candidates: M<sub>p</sub><sup>(L) </sup>for Case 3</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>N<sub>RB</sub><sup>X</sup><sup><sub2>p</sub2></sup></entry><entry>L = 1</entry><entry>L = 2</entry><entry>L = 4</entry><entry>L = 8</entry><entry>L = 16</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>8</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>0</entry></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry>8</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>2</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0160" num="0157">Table 2 shows a case 3 where physical resource blocks (PRBs) of a distributed EPDCCH are centralized. In Tables 1 and 2, the PDCCH/EPDCCH is used for carrying downlink control information (DCI). The DCI includes: uplink and downlink scheduling information and uplink power control information.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0158">A downlink grant (DL grant) and an uplink grant (UL grant) are respectively used in the existing LTE system for scheduling downlink data transmission and uplink data transmission of a terminal device. The DL grant and the UL grant are collectively referred to as the DCI and carried in the PDCCH or the EPDCCH. Downlink data is carried in a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH), and uplink data is carried in a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH). In the existing LTE system, the PDCCH uses resources in the first to fourth orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols in a system bandwidth and uses a control channel element (CCE) as a basic aggregation resource granularity and uses transmit diversity as a transmission mode. The EPDCCH uses resources in some PRBs in the system bandwidth and uses an enhanced control channel element (ECCE) as the basic aggregate resource granularity and uses a centralized or distributed transmission mode. It can be seen that the design of LTE standard control channels is single and of poor flexibility. When services to be supported have greatly different requirements on delay, reliability and the like, the system efficiency is significantly reduced.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0159">In this background, it has been stated that an explosive growth occurs in wireless network traffic. It is predicted by market institutes that in the next 10 years, wireless data services will increase 500-1000 times and increase 1.6-2 times annually on average, which puts higher requirements on network capacity of a wireless communication system. For wireless network applications in 2020 and further, the mobile Internet and the Internet of Things will become a main driving force for mobile communication development. The 5G technology will meet requirements for diversified services in residential, work, leisure and transportation areas. Even in scenarios such as dense residential areas, offices, stadiums, open-air gatherings, subways, expressways, high-speed rails and wide-area coverage which are characterized by ultra-high traffic density, ultra-high connection density and ultra-high mobility, the 5G technology may also provide users with extremely good service experience such as ultra-high definition videos, virtual reality, augmented reality, cloud desktops and online games. Meanwhile, the 5G technology will penetrate into the Internet of Things and various industries and deeply integrate with industrial facilities, medical instruments and vehicles to effectively meet requirements for diversified services in vertical industries such as industry, medical treatment and transportation and achieve the &#x201c;Internet of everything&#x201d;. From perspectives of service requirements and challenges in main application scenarios of the mobile Internet and the Internet of Things, four main 5G technical scenarios may be summarized as: a continuous wide-area coverage scenario, a high-capacity hot-spot scenario, a low-power-consumption high-connection-density scenario and a low-delay high-reliability scenario.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0160">If the design scheme of control channels in the existing LTE technology is applied to the 5G system, a requirement of the 5G system on design flexibility cannot be met, and the poor scalability and adaptability of control channels in the related art cannot satisfy a design concept of &#x201c;forward compatibility&#x201d;. For example, when different types of control channels are used for different services, the design scheme of control channels in the existing LTE technology allocates resources with poor flexibility and adaptability, which will seriously decrease system spectrum efficiency and increase system maintenance costs. In addition, the terminal device which can support multiple services cannot obtain type information of control channels supported by the system and can only determine the support situation of the current system for different services through blind detection, which greatly affects system performance, increases power consumption and control overhead of the terminal device, and the system has poor &#x201c;forward compatibility&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0161">A communication node in each embodiment of the present application described below may be, for example, a based service (BS) in a wireless communication system or an evolved Node B (eNB) in an LTE system.

Moreover, frequency domain resources schedulable by any two control channels in the description information of the N control channels may be completely different, partially overlapping or completely overlapping.

That is to say, the control channel description list may be generated by the first communication node or another communication node in the 5G system. The another communication node is generally an upper network device with respect to the first communication node, for example, a device similar to a radio resource control (RRC) device in the LTL system. In a specific implementation, the first communication node or another communication node may generate the control channel description list according to service types to be currently supported by a network or a load situation of the network.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0167">In S<b>120</b>, the first communication node sends the control channel description list to a second communication node.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0168">In this embodiment, after the first communication node generates or receives the control channel description list, the first communication node may send the control channel description list to the second communication node in the network which communicates with the first communication node. The description information of the N control channels in the control channel description list is used for describing the control of channels between the first communication node and the second communication node and resources used for transmitting uplink and downlink data. That is, the second communication node may process at least one of a control channel or a data channel according to the received control channel description list. For example, after the second communication node learns which control channels are included in the description information of the N control channels, the second communication node may process a corresponding control channel and data channel according to the description information of each of the control channels.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0169">Compared with the single design of control channels in the existing LTE technology, the control channel description list in this embodiment integrates configuration content of multiple control channels, and the integrated content may be selectively integrated into the configuration content according to practical applications. For example, according to different application scenarios, different service types or QoS requirements of different service types, corresponding content is selected to be configured in the control channel description list so that the currently configured control channel description list may satisfy requirements of the communication nodes for the current service.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0170">For example, when the network needs to support three services including super mobile broadband, low-delay high-reliability machine-type communication and massive machine-type communication, it is necessary to generate a control channel description list including description information of three control channels for describing transmission periods and resources of the control channels.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0171">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the control channels may be flexibly configured according to service requirements, and the second communication node obtains a configuration situation of the control channels from the control channel description list and performs subsequent processing operations such as control channel demodulation and data demodulation.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0172">In the information transmission method in this embodiment, the first communication node generates or receives the control channel description list, and then sends the control channel description list to the second communication node which communicates with the first communication node, so that the second communication node processes at least one of the control channel and the data channel according to the control channel description list. The control channel description list includes the description information of the N control channels. In this embodiment, the control channel description list may be configured according to service requirements and meet a requirement of flexibly designing control channel configuration content, and a standard scheme of control channels in the 5G system is rationally designed.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0173">In an exemplary embodiment, on the basis of the embodiments of the present disclosure, the control channel description list in this embodiment may further include type information of M types of terminal devices, where M is a positive integer.

In an exemplary embodiment, a length of the control channel type instruction information in this embodiment is determined by the variable N, that is, the first communication node generates a signaling to notify the second communication node according to N. For example, the first communication node sends a description list of 3 control channels denoted as list 1 to list 3 and notifies the second communication node to use a description list of a first control channel. In this case, the first communication node notifies the second communication node of the above information with a signaling of 2 bits.
