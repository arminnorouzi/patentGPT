An operator introduces a treatment tool or the like into an abdominal cavity from a trocar punctured in a patient's abdomen.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since the treatment tool inserted from the trocar moves with the trocar as a fulcrum, a direction in which an end effector at a distal end of the treatment tool moves and a direction in which an operation part at a proximal end of a processing instrument moves are inverted vertically and horizontally. Therefore, an operation of moving a position of the end effector to a desired position requires skill.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An apparatus disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 9,629,689 can be attached to an operator's arm or the like, and a position and orientation of an end effector at a distal end can be controlled by movement of a user's forearm, wrist, and fingers.

The curving direction of the deflection part <b>2</b>C is inverted in the deflection direction inversion part <b>8</b>C. In addition, the curving angle of the second deflection part <b>5</b>C is twice a curving angle of the first deflection part <b>4</b>C.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Through the above operation, when the first deflection part <b>4</b>C is curved (deflected) with respect to the axis A of the tubular shaft part <b>3</b>, the second deflection part <b>5</b>C is curved (deflected) to the opposite side with respect to the axis A, and the distal end <b>10</b> of the grip part <b>1</b> substantially rooves to the proximal end side on the axis A. Note that when the wire MA or the wire <b>64</b>B is pulled toward the proximal end side, the distal end <b>10</b> of the grip part <b>1</b> may not be located on the axis A until the plurality of pieces <b>9</b> come into close contact with each other and a curved shape of the deflection part <b>2</b>C is fixed.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">According to the treatment tool <b>100</b>C of the present embodiment, it is easy to control the orientation of the grip part (end effector) <b>1</b> while holding the distal end position of the grip part (end effector) <b>1</b>. Similarly to the treatment tool <b>100</b> of the first embodiment, the treatment tool <b>100</b>C can easily hold the distal end <b>10</b> of the grip part <b>1</b> on the axis A while changing the orientation of the grip part (end effector) <b>1</b>. As compared with the treatment tool <b>100</b> of the first embodiment, the treatment tool <b>100</b>C has a simple structure because the number of rotation shafts and wires used is small.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Hereinabove, the third embodiment of the present invention has been described in detail with reference to the drawings. However, the specific configuration is not limited to this embodiment, and changes in design or the like not departing frond the gist of the present invention are also included. In addition, the components shown in the above-described embodiment and modification examples can be appropriately combined.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Modification Example 1</heading><p id="p-0101" num="0100">For example, in the above embodiment, the treatment tool <b>100</b> or the like is a gripping forceps including the grip part <b>1</b> as an end effector, but the aspect of the treatment tool is not limited to this. The treatment tool may include a high-frequency knife or the like as an end effector.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Modification Example 2</heading><p id="p-0102" num="0101">For example, in the above embodiment, the deflection parts <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C are driven by the drive wires <b>6</b>, <b>6</b>B, and <b>6</b>C, hut the aspect of the deflection part is not limited to this. The deflection part may be driven by electric power instead of a wire.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
