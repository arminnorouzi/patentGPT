In particular, direct diode lasers using a semiconductor laser element as a light source do not convert laser light and are thus highly efficient. However, semiconductor laser elements have outputs of several watts per emitter (i.e., light-emitter). On the other hand, laser light used for processing needs to have optical output ranging from hundreds of watts to several kilowatts. Thus, if laser light is used for processing, semiconductor laser elements employ an array structure including a large number of aligned emitters, for example. A semiconductor laser element with a multi-emitter structure synthesizes laser light output from emitters to obtain high-output laser light.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, in an optical apparatus using a gallium nitride (GaN)-based semiconductor laser element, low-molecular-weight siloxane present in a package that houses the GaN-based semiconductor laser element reacts with laser light to adhere onto the facet of the semiconductor laser element, which degrades the laser characteristics. To address the problem, the inside of the package of a GaN-based semiconductor laser element is sealed airtight to reduce unclearness of the facet of the semiconductor laser element.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the sizes of semiconductor laser elements with a multi-emitter structure are as 80 times the sizes of semiconductor laser elements with a single emitter structure. It takes cost to seal the former semiconductor laser elements as a whole airtight. To address the problem, disclosed (see e.g., Patent Literature (PTL 1) is a technique of reducing adhesion of dust or dirt onto the facet of a semiconductor laser element by the gas flowing inside the package that houses a semiconductor laser element.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">PTL 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-144073</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problems</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is however difficult in the technique disclosed in PTL 1 to cause gas to flow near the light-emitting surface of a semiconductor laser element, if an optical component such as a lens is opposed to the light-emitting surface of the semiconductor laser element at a distance of about 30 &#x3bc;m to about 200 &#x3bc;m.
