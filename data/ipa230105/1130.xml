In some versions, the wearable device <b>30</b> is used to treat the user's anxiety or to reduce the user's stress. This may include conditioning the user in a training mode to elicit a desired physiological response from the user, such as a lowered heart rate, a lowered skin temperature, lowered blood pressure, lowered EEG signals, lowered ECG signals, a raised blood oxygen level, combinations thereof, or the like. For example, the controller <b>66</b> may be programmed to activate the one or more haptic generators <b>46</b> in a predetermined pattern in the training mode during times of low stress and/or low anxiety. The thermal elements <b>48</b> may also be activated to raise the patient's skin temperature to a predetermined temperature in the training mode. Training sessions may be initiated during periods of rest, during periods of relaxation (e.g., during massage therapy, energy therapy, or other therapeutic treatment methods), and/or during other periods in which the user has low stress/anxiety. The controller <b>66</b> may be programmed to initiate training sessions at the same time each day and/or for the same duration (e.g., in the middle of the night during restful sleep).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">A training session may be initiated/stopped by the user or by a therapist via the user interface (e.g., via a start/stop training mode icon on the touchscreen or button). The training session may additionally, or alternatively, be initiated/stopped automatically in response to one or more physiological parameters of the user reaching, falling below, or exceeding certain thresholds. For example, the training session may be initiated automatically upon the controller <b>66</b> detecting the user's heart rate reaching or falling below a threshold (e.g., reaching or falling below 75 beats per minute, 70 beats per minute, etc.) and/or the training session may be automatically stopped upon the controller <b>66</b> detecting one or more physiological parameters of the user reaching, fall below, or exceeding certain thresholds (may be the same or different thresholds than those that initiate the training session). In some cases, the thresholds may be discrete values or ranges of values. The thresholds may be user-specific and/or set by the therapist based on typical values of the user. The wearable device <b>30</b> may also learn the thresholds in a learning mode that occurs before the training mode. In the learning mode, the wearable device <b>30</b> may monitor the user for a predetermined duration, e.g., one day, one week, etc. and may then define the thresholds based on averages (e.g., average heart rate, average blood pressure, etc.), based on low values, based on high values, based on predetermined offsets from the low values or the high values, based on look-up tables for similar users or groups of users, and the like.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The training mode may be carried out over several training sessions, such as two, three, four, five, or more training sessions. These training sessions may last a few seconds, one minute, two minutes, five minutes, or longer. Once training is complete, e.g., by measuring the total number, length, etc. of the training sessions and comparing to a training threshold, then the therapy mode is enabled for activation. The user or therapist may also manually enable the therapy mode once the user or therapist is satisfied that suitable training of the user has been completed. For example, training may require a predetermined number and duration of training sessions, e.g., training could require at least three training sessions and a total duration of training of at least three hours. Other suitable numbers of sessions and/or total durations to complete training are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref> illustrate digital/analog waveforms W<b>1</b>, W<b>2</b> output by the one or more haptic generators <b>48</b> that can be repeated over and over to be learned by the user during the periods of relaxation in the training mode. The same pattern may be repeated by one haptic generator <b>46</b>, or by two or more haptic generators <b>46</b> for the entire duration of the training session. Portions of the pattern may be generated by one haptic generator <b>46</b>, while other portions are generated by the other haptic generators <b>46</b>. These repeating patterns may be simple or complex, and generated by one or more of the haptic generators <b>46</b>. Examples of simple waveforms W<b>3</b>, W<b>4</b> being repeated are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>. In some versions, only a single haptic generator <b>46</b> is provided. In some versions, the repeating pattern is simply the haptic generator <b>46</b> being active for a first duration, at a predefined power level, and then being inactive for a second duration (the same or different than the first duration), and this pattern being repeated over and over until the training session is complete.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The controller <b>66</b> is configured to store the predetermined pattern in the memory MEM for retrieval during the training mode and later, during the therapy mode. The predetermined pattern may comprise a repeated pattern of activation and deactivation of the one or more haptic generators <b>46</b>. The repeated patterns of activation and deactivation of the one or more haptic generators <b>46</b> may mimic a breathing pattern of the user. For example, some relaxation techniques prescribe inhaling for five seconds and exhaling for five seconds to relax the user. The repeated pattern of activation and deactivation of the one or more haptic generators <b>46</b> may emulate such breathing patterns, e.g., by being active for five seconds and then inactive for five seconds. Other activation/deactivation patterns are also contemplated. In some cases, haptic output (e.g., vibrations) generated by the haptic generators <b>46</b> are consciously sensed by the user, i.e., the user can consciously feel vibrations caused by the haptic generators <b>46</b> on their skin. In some cases, the haptic output may be subtle and unable to be easily felt by the user, but nonetheless generate vibrations that can be sensed by one or more mechanoreceptors of the user.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In some versions, the waveforms may be created by the user, therapist, or by another. This can be done by recording the user, therapist, or other person with a microphone <b>64</b> on the wearable device <b>30</b>. The controller <b>66</b> records an audio track of the user from voice signals output by the user, therapist, or other person, and received by the microphone <b>64</b>, and then transforms the audio track into the output for the one or more haptic generators <b>46</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates the user creating a waveform via the microphone <b>64</b>. The waveform may also be a song selected by the user or therapist with the associated audio file (e.g., .mp3, .wav, etc.) being saved in the memory MEM of the control system <b>62</b> for playback through the one or more haptic generators <b>46</b> during the training mode. One suitable software program for creating and playing such audio files is Audacity&#xae; 2.3.2 available through www.AudacityTeam.org. Suitable haptic generators <b>46</b> and controls therefor that can be used with this software program to generate desired waveforms include those available from Boreas Technologies Inc. described above. In some versions, the same waveform may be employed for multiple users, or a unique waveform may be employed for each user. In some versions, the user may be able to select one from a plurality of possible waveforms via the user interface UI.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Once the therapy mode has been enabled, e.g., the training mode is complete, then the controller <b>66</b> is configured to provide therapy to the user in the therapy mode by activating the one or more haptic generators <b>46</b> in the same predetermined pattern used in the training mode in response to input from a therapy trigger. The thermal elements <b>48</b> may also be activated to bring the user's skin temperature to the same predetermined temperature that was used in the training mode. The therapy mode is intended to bring the user back into a relaxed state should the user experience a physiological state caused by stress and/or anxiety. The therapy mode employs the same predetermined pattern of haptic output and/or skin temperature so that one or more physiological parameters of the user change (lower or rise) to those levels that were present during training, e.g., when relaxed. In other words, since the training mode occurs during periods of relaxation, the intent of the therapy mode is to elicit a response from the user that brings them closer to the same relaxation they experienced during the training sessions.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">A therapy session may be initiated/stopped by the user or by a therapist via the user interface (e.g., via a start/stop therapy mode icon on the touchscreen or button). In this case, the therapy trigger comprises a user input device (e.g., touchscreen, sensor, button, etc.) that transmits user input to the controller <b>66</b> via the user interface UI. In some cases, the training mode start/stop icon or button automatically changes to the therapy mode start/stop icon or button once training is complete&#x2014;and the therapy mode start/stop icon or button then becomes the therapy trigger. One or more therapy triggers may activate a therapy session. Referring briefly back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, one of the therapy triggers is shown by an icon IC on the touchscreen <b>38</b> of the display unit <b>34</b>. When the icon IC is touched by the user, an input signal is sent to the controller <b>66</b> indicating that a therapy session is to be activated. Thereafter, therapy begins as set forth, for example, in one or more of the several embodiments described herein. For instance, the repeating waveform may be output by the one or more haptic generators <b>46</b> for a predetermined duration, or until the user stops the therapy session via the user interface UI. During therapy, the user's skin temperature may also be raised to a predetermined therapy temperature.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">A therapy session may additionally, or alternatively, be initiated/stopped automatically in response to one or more physiological parameters of the user reaching, falling below, or exceeding certain thresholds. In this case, the therapy trigger comprises one or more sensors selected from the optical sensors <b>54</b>, the pressure sensors <b>58</b>, temperature sensors <b>59</b>, the ECG sensors <b>60</b>, EEG sensors, blood oxygen sensors, or other suitable sensors. The one or more sensors that are monitored to trigger the therapy session may measure heart rate, blood pressure, skin temperature, ECG signals, EEG signals, blood oxygen, combinations thereof, and the like. A therapy session may be triggered automatically in response to any one or more of the user's heart rate, skin temperature, blood pressure, EEG signals, and ECG signals reaching or exceeding a threshold, the user's blood oxygen levels reaching or falling below a threshold, combinations thereof, or the like. In some versions, a therapy session may be triggered in response to one or more physiological parameters changing quickly (e.g., a 10% increase/decrease in 1 second, a 20% increase/decrease in 5 seconds, etc.). Rapid rates of change for some physiological parameters may be an indicator of acute stress or anxiety that can be treated by the therapy methods described herein. In some cases, the thresholds may be discrete values or ranges of values. For example, the therapy session may be initiated automatically upon the controller <b>66</b> detecting the user's heart rate reaching or exceeding a threshold (e.g., reaching or exceeding 100 beats per minute, reaching or exceeding 90 beats per minute, reaching or exceeding 75 beats per minute, reaching or exceeding 70 beats per minute, etc.) and/or the therapy session may be automatically stopped upon the controller <b>66</b> detecting one or more physiological parameters of the user reaching, falling below, or exceeding certain thresholds (may be the same or different thresholds than those that initiate the therapy session). For example, the therapy session may be stopped automatically upon the controller <b>66</b> detecting the user's heart rate reaching or falling below a threshold (e.g., reaching or falling below 100 beats per minute, 90 beats per minute, 75 beats per minute, 70 beats per minute, etc.).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The thresholds may be user-specific and/or set by the therapist based on typical values of the user. The wearable device <b>30</b> may also learn the thresholds in a learning mode that occurs before the training mode. In the learning mode, the wearable device <b>30</b> may monitor the user for a predetermined duration, e.g., one day, one week, etc. and may then define the thresholds based on averages (e.g., average heart rate, average blood pressure, etc.), based on low values, based on high values, based on predetermined offsets from the low values or the high values, based on look-up tables for similar users or groups of users, and the like. The therapy sessions may last a few seconds, one minute, two minutes, five minutes, or longer, depending on the user's or therapist's input, how long it takes for the user's physiological parameters to reach, fall below, or exceed the thresholds, etc. Automatic triggering of a therapy session based on one or more thresholds may also take into account movement of the user. Such movement can be detected by an accelerometer AM built into the wearable support <b>32</b> and/or the display unit <b>34</b>. The accelerometer can detect movements of the user typically associated with walking, running, biking, or other exercising, and can prevent the wearable device <b>30</b> from otherwise triggering a therapy session during such events. For instance, if the wearable device <b>30</b> is set to trigger a therapy session any time the user's heart rate exceeds 90 beats per minute, the controller <b>66</b> can be programmed to monitor movements of the user and if the user's heart rate is found to exceed 90 beats per minute, but the controller <b>66</b> determines that the user is moving in a manner consistent with exercise (high acceleration values over long duration, etc.), then the controller <b>66</b> may inhibit initiation of a therapy session until the user's heart rate falls back below the threshold and the accelerometer indicates that the user is relatively sedentary.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some versions, the wearable device <b>30</b> is programmed to provide haptic therapy and/or thermal therapy without any required training of the user, i.e., without a training mode. For example, the haptic generators <b>46</b> may simply be triggered to operate in a predetermined pattern in response to the therapy trigger being activated, i.e., via manual input or through measurements by the one or more sensors. Automatic triggering of therapy may be useful to cause the user to pause a moment when certain physiological parameters are rising or falling so that they become mindful of the situation. For example, therapy may be triggered automatically in response to any one or more of the user's heart rate, skin temperature, blood pressure, EEG signals, and ECG signals reaching or exceeding a threshold, the user's blood oxygen level reaching or falling below a threshold, combinations thereof, or the like. In some cases, such therapy may simply be automated responses to changing physiological parameters that bring the user back into a present state of mind (e.g., mindfulness) and thereafter, the user may be able to employ manual relaxation techniques (e.g., breathing techniques) to calm their body and control the levels of the physiological parameters being measured. In some cases, the haptic generators <b>46</b> may be operated with waveforms having initially high amplitudes to achieve large vibrations to get the user's attention quickly.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In some versions, the wearable device <b>30</b> is programmed to automatically enable operation of the haptic generators <b>46</b> when the wearable support <b>32</b> is attached to the display unit <b>34</b>, e.g., by virtue of the identification device ID being read by the controller <b>66</b> (e.g., via a RFID reader on the display unit <b>34</b> or via the controller <b>66</b> on the display unit <b>34</b> reading the unique identifier from non-volatile memory on the wearable support <b>32</b>). In some cases, the controller <b>66</b> may be programmed to automatically display/enable a user input device that can be actuated by the user to initiate a therapy session. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the controller <b>66</b> may be programmed to display the icon IC automatically in response to the wearable support <b>32</b> being connected to the display unit <b>34</b> by virtue of the electronic connections being made through one or more of the connectors <b>44</b> and the display unit <b>34</b> determining the identification of the wearable support <b>32</b>, i.e., that the wearable support <b>32</b> is one capable of providing such therapy.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>15</b></figref> another wearable device <b>130</b> is shown.

As a result, inflation of the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> and/or the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b> would act to increase pressure against the user's wrist.

The first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> is sized so that pressure on the wrist of the user is localized to one side of the user's wrist, while the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b> is sized to substantially surround the user's wrist, as compared to the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b>. In some versions, the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> is arranged to be in proximity to an acupressure point of the user when the wearable support <b>32</b> is worn by the user. In some versions, the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> is arranged to be in proximity to acupressure point Pericardium 6 (P6)(also known as Nei Guan) of the user when the wearable support <b>32</b> is worn by the user.

In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>15</b></figref>, the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> has an oblong shape, e.g., a length dimension greater than a width dimension, wherein the length dimension is directed to be in a direction of the user's arm so that the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> is more likely to be adjacent to the acupressure point P6 when the wrist band is worn by the user. In other words, gross location of the wrist band about the user's wrist W is likely to properly locate the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> adjacent to the acupressure point P6. In some versions, the inflatable bladder <b>84</b> may be offset from a centerline of the wrist band to reach the acupressure point P6. In some versions, such as when the wearable device is a leg band, the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> may be located to apply pressure to acupressure point ST36 (also known as Stomach 36 or Zu San Li) to release gastrointestinal discomfort. The first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> and/or the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b> may also be configured to apply pressure to other acupressure points.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The controller <b>66</b> may be programmed to actuate (inflate) the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> to provide therapy to the user by placing pressure on the acupressure point P6 in response to the therapy trigger.

Accordingly, during therapy, the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> may be inflated, while the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b> remains uninflated. In some versions, during therapy, both the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> and the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b> are inflated to predetermined pressures (same pressure or different pressures). In some versions, the controller <b>66</b> is operable to actuate the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> and/or the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b> in response to activation of the therapy trigger during a therapy session in which the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> and/or the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b> are inflated/deflated in a repeated pattern and/or to predetermined therapy pressures. In some versions, the wearable device <b>130</b> provides therapy to the user without requiring any training mode. This may be useful, for example, to apply pressure to the acupressure point P6 to treat nausea (e.g., experienced during pregnancy, sea sickness, etc.) or to treat anxiety. For example, if the user is experiencing symptoms of nausea, or expects nausea to occur at known times during the day (e.g., morning sickness), or if the user is planning to take a trip and experiences motion sickness (car, boat, plane, etc.), the user can manually trigger therapy to inflate the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> (and possibly the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b>) to apply pressure onto the acupressure point P6 (and/or other acupressure points) to treat or reduce the occurrence of nausea. Inflation of the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b>, for example, could be triggered by the user tapping the icon IC on the touch screen <b>38</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

For example, one valve <b>108</b> (e.g., a three-way solenoid valve) is connected to the first conduit <b>104</b> and the controller <b>66</b> so that the controller <b>66</b> is able to operate the valve <b>108</b> in a first state which opens fluid communication between the inflator <b>100</b> and the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> (when valve <b>110</b> is open) and a second state which opens fluid communication between the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> and atmosphere to deflate the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b>. The valve <b>110</b> may be connected to the first conduit <b>104</b> and the controller <b>66</b> so that the controller <b>66</b> can open/close fluid communication between inflator <b>100</b> and the first conduit <b>104</b>, which may be useful when separately inflating the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b> (e.g., valve <b>110</b> can be closed). A similar set of valves are also connected to the second conduit <b>106</b> and the controller <b>66</b> to control inflation/deflation of the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b>. Pressure sensors <b>58</b> are connected to the controller <b>66</b> and placed in fluid communication with the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> and the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b> to measure pressures in the bladders <b>84</b>, <b>90</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">These pressure sensors <b>58</b> may be used in conjunction with operation of the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> and/or the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b> to measure the user's blood pressure using oscillometric blood pressure measuring techniques. In some versions, only the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b> is inflated during a blood pressure measurement cycle. For example, the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b> may act as an inflatable cuff substantially surrounding the wrist W of the user with sufficient pressure to prevent blood flow in a local artery (e.g., about 20 mm Hg above systolic pressure). The pressure is then gradually released using the solenoid valve <b>108</b> (e.g., digitally controlled by the controller <b>66</b>) until blood begins to flow through the artery. More specifically, as the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b> is deflated below the user's systolic pressure, the reducing pressure exerted on the artery allows blood to flow through it and sets up a vibration in the arterial wall that can be detected by the controller <b>66</b> using the pressure sensor <b>58</b> in communication with the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b>. The pressure measured by the pressure sensor <b>58</b> at this point determines the systolic pressure (pressure readings from one or multiple pressure sensors can be averaged, or only a single pressure reading from one pressure sensor may be used). Heart rate (pulse rate) is also sensed at this time. A measurement taken when the blood flow is no longer restricted determines the diastolic pressure. More specifically, when the pressure in the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b> falls below the user's diastolic pressure, blood flows smoothly through the artery in the usual pulses, without any vibration in the arterial wall. This complete measurement cycle is controlled automatically by the controller <b>66</b>. In some versions, the signal from the pressure sensor <b>58</b> may be conditioned with an instrumentation amplifier before data conversion by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and heart rate are then calculated in the digital domain using an algorithm appropriate for the type of sensor utilized. The resulting systolic, diastolic, and heart rate measurements may be displayed on the display <b>36</b>, time-stamped, and stored in the memory MEM (e.g., non-volatile memory).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Inflation of the inflatable bladders <b>84</b>, <b>90</b> is shown in the progression of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>C</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, the inflatable bladders <b>84</b>, <b>90</b> are shown uninflated and haptic feedback (haptic output) is being provided to the user through the haptic generators <b>46</b> to alert the user that one or more of the inflatable bladders <b>84</b>, <b>90</b> is about to be inflated. Since inflation of the inflatable bladders <b>84</b>, <b>90</b> will apply pressure on the user's wrist W, it may be helpful to first alert the user of such an event. This may be useful, for example, when the user's blood pressure is being measured periodically throughout the day, such as according to a preset schedule stored in the memory MEM and executed by the controller <b>66</b> to monitor and record several blood pressure readings of the user pursuant to the schedule. Such readings may be stored for later retrieval by the user, physician, etc. and/or may be automatically transmitted via a communication link (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular) from the wearable device <b>30</b> to a network (e.g., the Internet, cloud, etc.). Accordingly, the controller <b>66</b> may be programmed to activate the one or more haptic generators <b>46</b> prior to inflating either or both of the bladders <b>84</b>, <b>90</b>. Other indications that inflation is about to occur may additionally, or alternatively, be provided, e.g., audible, visual, etc. For instance, the display <b>36</b> may provide a visual indication (symbol, text, countdown timer, etc.) that inflation is going to occur, and/or the display unit <b>34</b> may comprise one or more speakers that audibly alert the user that inflation is about to occur. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref> shows the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> being fully inflated and acting against the acupressure point P6 of the user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>C</figref> shows both the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> and the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b> being fully inflated and compressing the user's wrist W.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In some versions, the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b>, the inflator <b>100</b>, and the valve <b>108</b> and pressure sensor <b>58</b> associated with the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b> define a first blood pressure measurement unit operatively coupled to the wrist band to measure the blood pressure of the user. The optical sensors <b>54</b>, light sources <b>56</b>, pressure sensors <b>58</b>, and ECG sensors <b>60</b> define a second blood pressure measurement unit operatively coupled to the wrist band to measure the blood pressure of the user. Measuring blood pressure using optical methods may be subject to drift and require calibration, e.g., via oscillometric methods. Accordingly, by providing two blood pressure measurement units on the same wearable device (one optically-based and one oscillometrically-based), calibration can be made easy. In these versions, the controller <b>66</b> is operatively coupled to the first blood pressure measurement unit and the second blood pressure measurement unit. The controller <b>66</b> operates in a normal mode to take one or more blood pressure measurements of the user with the second blood pressure measurement unit, e.g., the optically-based blood pressure measurement unit&#x2014;which may be less intrusive to the user since it does not require inflating any inflatable bladders. The controller <b>66</b> operates in a calibration mode to take one or more blood pressure measurements with the first blood pressure measurement unit to calibrate the second blood pressure measurement unit. Such calibration may include providing an adjustment factor to the readings from the second blood pressure measurement unit. For example, blood pressure measurements may be made by the controller <b>66</b> at substantially the same time using both the first and second blood pressure measurement units with the measurements taken with the second blood pressure measurement unit being adjusted to be the same as the measurements taken with the first blood pressure measurement unit (e.g., by adjusting the systolic/diastolic pressures up/down as needed). This adjustment factor may then be used for all future measurements taken with the second blood pressure measurement unit until the next calibration event.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> and <b>17</b></figref> illustrate another wearable device <b>230</b> that is similar to the wearable device <b>130</b> and includes the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> and the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b>, but further includes a projection <b>112</b> that is attached to the first flexible layer <b>74</b> to move with inflation/deflation of the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> to localize pressure on the acupressure point P6 of the user.

In some versions, the band tensioner <b>128</b> may be controlled by the controller <b>66</b> in a cooperative manner to provide therapy to the user and/or to take measurements of one or more physiological parameters of the user. One or more of the pressure sensors <b>58</b>, strain gages SG, or other type of tension sensor connected to the controller <b>66</b> (wired or wirelessly), may be used to measure tension of the wrist band on the user's wrist to determine how much to wind/unwind the wrist band via the band tensioner <b>128</b>. See, for example, the strain gages SG shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>. When taking blood pressure measurements, it may be desirable to first tighten the wrist band on the user's wrist to a first predetermined pressure/tension before inflating the first inflatable bladder <b>84</b> and/or the second inflatable bladder <b>90</b>. Inflation may also occur before tensioning and/or simultaneously therewith. The combination of tensioning the wrist band via the band tensioner <b>128</b> and inflation of the first and/or second inflatable bladders <b>84</b>, <b>90</b> can be helpful to ensure pressure capable of shutting off blood flow in the local artery.

The projection <b>112</b> and base <b>1126</b> can be connected to the housing <b>124</b> in any suitable manner, e.g., snap-fit, press-fit, fasteners, adhesive, or the like to connect the projection <b>112</b> and/or the housing <b>124</b> to the flexible layer <b>74</b>. Variations for connecting the housing <b>124</b> and the one or more projections <b>112</b> to the wrist band are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">In the version shown, the housing <b>124</b>, and specifically the housing top <b>124</b><i>b</i>, has a first coupling interface that is shaped to releasably engage a second coupling interface of the base <b>1126</b>. The coupling interfaces may include any form of coupling elements to secure the housing <b>124</b> to the wrist band. In the version shown, the first coupling interface includes one or more first snap elements <b>1160</b> and the base <b>1126</b> includes one or more second snap elements <b>1162</b>. The snap elements <b>1160</b>, <b>1162</b> are shaped to engage one another in a snap-fit manner to releasably couple the housing <b>124</b> to the wrist band. In the version shown, the first snap elements <b>1160</b> include four detent fingers having snap-fit heads and the second snap element includes a flange of the base <b>1126</b> engageable by the four detent fingers (compare <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>39</b>A and <b>39</b>B</figref> to see the snap-fit engagement process and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b>C</figref> that shows the engagement). Additionally, or alternatively, the wrist band includes one or more hook-and-loop-type fasteners <b>1164</b> and the housing, specifically the housing top <b>124</b><i>b</i>, includes one or more hook-and-loop-type fasteners <b>1166</b> configured to releasably engage the one or more hook-and-loop-type fasteners <b>1164</b> of the wrist band when releasably coupling the housing <b>124</b> to the wrist band. The hook-and-loop-type fasteners <b>1164</b>, <b>1166</b> may be attached to the wrist band and the housing top <b>124</b><i>b</i>, respectively, by any suitable method, including being sewn, fastened, welded, adhered, etc. When the housing <b>124</b> is disengaged from the wrist band, then the wrist band remains useable for providing nausea relief to the user via the projection <b>112</b>. Thus, the releasable nature of the housing <b>124</b> provides additional flexibility in use of the wrist band.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">In the version shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>38</b>-<b>40</b></figref>, the housing <b>124</b> has a top (part of the housing top <b>124</b><i>b</i>) and an opposing bottom (part of the housing base <b>124</b><i>a</i>). The button <b>1141</b> is located on the bottom such that when the user applies force to the button <b>1141</b> to operate the haptic generator <b>46</b>, the force is directed toward the projection <b>112</b> to further press the projection <b>112</b> into the acupressure point Pericardium 6 of the user. In other words, a center of the button <b>1141</b> and a center of the projection <b>112</b> are generally aligned along an axis A<b>1</b> that passes through the acupressure point Pericardium 6 so that any pressure applied onto the button <b>1141</b> is directed through the housing <b>124</b>, through the base <b>1126</b> and the projection <b>112</b>, and to the acupressure point Pericardium 6 to further enhance the therapy to the user. In some versions, the button <b>1141</b> is smaller and located on a side of the housing base <b>124</b><i>a</i>, extending from the wall of the housing base <b>124</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>, the wrist band is reversible so that the projection <b>112</b> protrudes outwardly away from the wrist band so that the user is able to apply the projection <b>112</b> to other anatomical sites while the one or more haptic generators <b>46</b> produce vibrations through the projection <b>112</b> to the other anatomical sites. This further enhances haptic therapy that can be provided to the user by allowing the user to apply the projection <b>112</b> to other acupressure points on the user, or other locations of tension to treat those locations, e.g., via vibration massage. The user can apply such pressure by placing one or more fingers through the wrist band to engage the housing <b>124</b> and press the button <b>1141</b> and housing <b>124</b> in the direction of the projection <b>112</b>, as shown, to further apply force through the projection <b>112</b> (e.g., massage head) onto the patient's treatment area. The user can also hold/grip the housing <b>124</b> to move the housing <b>124</b> and thereby move the projection <b>112</b> in small circles to massage any areas of interest while simultaneously operating the haptic generator <b>46</b> to provide haptic therapy. In some versions, such as when the button <b>1141</b> operates a momentary contact switch, operation of the haptic generator <b>46</b> stops when the user ceases applying pressure on the button <b>1141</b> (by virtue of the spring force of the momentary contact switch opening the circuit).</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>, a waterproof (or at least water resistant) version of the housing <b>124</b> is shown. In this version, the housing <b>124</b> is generally cylindrical in shape. A seal <b>1190</b> (e.g., o-ring, gasket, etc.) is located in an annular groove in the housing base <b>124</b><i>a </i>to seal against the housing top <b>124</b><i>b </i>when the housing top <b>124</b><i>b </i>is connected to the housing base <b>124</b><i>a</i>. In this version, the button <b>1141</b> is a silicone rubber button <b>1192</b> with integrally formed gasket <b>1194</b> that is captured between the bottom of the housing base <b>124</b><i>a </i>and a printed circuit board <b>1196</b>. The button <b>1141</b> may also be centrally located on the bottom of the housing <b>124</b> and have a cylindrical shape as well, such that the housing <b>124</b> and button <b>1141</b> are disposed about the axis that passes normal to the wrist band and through the acupressure point P6 and the housing <b>124</b> and the button <b>1141</b> extend radially equidistantly from the axis. As a result, the housing <b>124</b> and the button <b>1141</b> appear to the user to be in the same position relative to the wrist band regardless of their actual orientation relative to the wrist band (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b></figref>). The gasket <b>1194</b> acts as a seal to further inhibit liquids, such as water, from intruding into the housing <b>124</b> through an opening formed in the bottom for the silicone rubber button <b>1192</b>. The printed circuit board <b>1196</b> includes spaced apart contacts <b>1198</b><i>a </i>forming part of the momentary contact switch. A moving contact <b>1198</b><i>b </i>is mounted on the silicone rubber button <b>1192</b> (e.g., via adhesive, insert molding, etc.) and moves toward and makes contact with the contacts <b>1198</b><i>a </i>when the silicone rubber button <b>1192</b> is depressed to complete the circuit operating the haptic generator <b>46</b>. The silicone rubber button <b>1192</b> includes webs/walls that are resilient to return the silicone rubber button <b>1192</b> to its normal position with the moving contact <b>1198</b><i>b </i>spaced from the contacts <b>1198</b><i>a </i>when released.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b></figref> illustrates another wearable device <b>1230</b> that comprises the wearable support <b>32</b> and a haptic generator <b>46</b>. This version is similar to the version shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>38</b>-<b>40</b></figref> except that the housing <b>124</b> is mounted to a separate strap <b>1270</b> and the separate strap <b>1270</b> is then fastened to the wrist band via one or more hook-and-loop-type fasteners, adhesive, welding, or the like. In this version, the separate strap <b>1270</b> may be releasably fastened to the wrist band to supplement the wrist band with haptic therapy, while also allowing the wrist band and the projection <b>112</b> to be separately used for nausea relief, for example. In the version shown, separate hook-and-loop-type fasteners are mounted to the wrist band and the separate strap <b>1270</b>. The separate strap <b>1270</b> may be formed of the same materials as the flexible layer <b>74</b>. The button <b>1241</b> may also be located beneath the separate strap <b>1270</b> or on one side of the separate strap <b>1270</b> opposite the housing <b>124</b>, as shown.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>44</b>A-<b>45</b></figref> illustrate a variation of the wearable device <b>1330</b> that employs a rotary actuator <b>114</b><i>a </i>to apply pressure to the acupressure point P6 of the user and/or to other treatment sites. In some versions, a linear actuator, and/or other form of actuator could be employed. The rotary actuator <b>114</b><i>a </i>is connected to the controller <b>66</b> to be activated by the controller <b>66</b>. The rotary actuator <b>114</b><i>a </i>is mounted to a rigid housing <b>124</b>. The housing <b>124</b> is attached and fixed to the first and/or second flexible layer <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> using any attachment method as previously described, or any suitable attachment method. The rotary actuator <b>114</b><i>a </i>comprises a motor <b>116</b><i>a </i>(e.g., a 3V, reversible DC motor or other suitable motor) that is mounted to the housing <b>124</b> and one or more rotationally-movable cams <b>120</b><i>a </i>connected to a drive shaft of the motor <b>116</b><i>a </i>to rotate relative to the housing <b>124</b> about axis A<b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref>, the drive shaft of the motor <b>116</b><i>a </i>is effectively a cam shaft having the one or more cams <b>120</b><i>a </i>fixed thereto to protrude into and out of the housing <b>124</b> through an opening <b>124</b><i>c </i>in the housing <b>124</b> during rotation of the drive shaft. A transmission may also be coupled to the motor <b>116</b><i>a </i>with the cam shaft being an output shaft from the transmission.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">During actuation of the rotary actuator <b>114</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b>A</figref>, each of the one or more cams <b>120</b><i>a </i>has a cammed portion <b>121</b><i>a </i>that rotates toward the acupressure point P6 or other treatment site to apply pressure. In some versions, the motor <b>116</b><i>a </i>rotates in full 360-degree rotations to rotate the one or more cams <b>120</b><i>a</i>. In some versions, the motor <b>116</b><i>a </i>oscillates back and forth without making a full rotation (e.g., rotating less than 360 degrees). The one or more cams <b>120</b><i>a </i>may be located underneath flexible material of the wearable support <b>32</b> (e.g., under flexible layer <b>74</b>) to protrude into the flexible material to apply pressure to the treatment area. The motor <b>116</b><i>a </i>may rotate from 1 to 1000 rotations per minute (RPM), from 10 to 100 rotations per minute, from 10 to 60 rotations per minute, or the like. In some versions, the wearable device <b>1330</b> further includes a haptic generator <b>46</b> to additionally provide vibrations to the one or more cams <b>120</b><i>a </i>during actuation. The haptic generator <b>46</b> may operate as previously described.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">The user interface UI of the wearable device <b>1330</b>, which is coupled to the controller <b>66</b>, may include a button <b>1341</b> of a momentary contact switch as previously described that is pressed to activate the motor <b>116</b><i>a </i>and/or the haptic generator <b>46</b>. In some versions, the user interface UI includes an on/off switch and maintains the wearable device <b>1330</b> in an active state when depressed once and then deactivates the wearable device <b>1330</b> when depressed a second time. Any suitable form of switch may be used to activate/deactivate the motor <b>116</b><i>a </i>and/or the haptic generator <b>46</b>. Heat may also be applied to the user via one or more thermal elements <b>48</b> coupled to the controller <b>66</b> that can be activated in response to input from the user (e.g., separate buttons to activate heat and possibly at different temperature settings).</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">In some versions, the controller <b>66</b> is configured to rotate the one or more cams <b>120</b><i>a </i>to a home position in response to user actuation of a home button of the user interface UI, or the controller <b>66</b> may automatically place the one or more cams <b>120</b><i>a </i>in the home position when the wearable device <b>1330</b> is deactivated. The home position is a position in which none of the cams <b>120</b><i>a </i>are protruding out of the housing <b>124</b> through the opening <b>124</b><i>c </i>in the housing <b>124</b> such that the cams <b>120</b><i>a </i>are no longer applying pressure against the user's skin. In this state, the wearable device <b>1330</b> operates as a conventional wrist band. The home position may be such that one of the cams <b>120</b><i>a </i>is directed downward in the housing <b>124</b> and may be signaled by activation of a limit switch <b>1350</b> that is coupled to the controller <b>66</b> to provide a signal to the controller <b>66</b> when the cams <b>120</b><i>a </i>are in their home position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b>B</figref>). This allows the user to actively wear the wearable device <b>1330</b> on their wrist W without any pressure being applied to their wrist W.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">In some versions, the controller <b>66</b> is configured to place one of the cams <b>120</b><i>a </i>in contact with the acupressure point P6 and keep the cam <b>120</b><i>a </i>in that treatment position (e.g., fully up position) until instructed otherwise (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b>A</figref>). This may be controlled by another button of the user interface UI that indicates nausea relief is desired&#x2014;in which case the cam <b>120</b><i>a </i>that is kept in contact with the acupressure point P6 acts to provide such relief. Another button (or the same button) may be actuated by the user to start massage therapy by causing the one or more cams <b>120</b><i>a </i>to begin rotating at their normal operational speed. The user interface UI may also provide speed control settings, such as high, medium, or low speeds, as desired by the user. One or more buttons of the user interface UI may be associated with such speed control settings (e.g., one button depressed one or more times to toggle through speed control, one button for each speed setting, etc.). The wearable device <b>1330</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>44</b>A-<b>45</b></figref> is also reversible, similar to the wearable device <b>1130</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref> and can therefore also be used to provide massage therapy to the user in a similar manner.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">The terms &#x201c;comprise&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; and &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;, &#x201c;has&#x201d;, &#x201c;have&#x201d;, and &#x201c;having&#x201d;, &#x201c;include&#x201d;, &#x201c;includes&#x201d;, and &#x201c;including&#x201d; are open-ended linking verbs.
