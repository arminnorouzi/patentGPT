One or two &#x201c;Tee&#x201d; (T) type connections are usually connected to the vessel/central part of the module to allow the supply/recovery of the other streams, depending on the direction of permeation. These modules/housings were later adapted for separation processes using liquid-liquid or gas-liquid membrane contactors, by modifying the heads and/or coupling other connections/parts to the central vessel/tube. As seen in U.S. Pat. No. 5,211,728A, which discloses a hollow fiber membrane device, comprising a hollow fiber membrane bundle with tubesheets, separable end caps, clamshell-shaped retainers for joining end caps to tubesheets, associated circumferential protectors that constrain in position the clamshell and envelope retainers that enclose the membrane bundle. It is used to separate one or more fluids from one or more other fluids in a fluid mixture, wherein the fluids have different transport rates across membranes. The fluids can be in a gaseous, vapor or liquid state. Such a patent discloses a different construction, and does not disclose the special features presented in the present invention, where it presents a compact device/piece of equipment configured for the packaging of hollow fiber type bundles. The assembly, called a module, can be used for different fluid separation processes such as liquid-liquid, liquid-gas and gas-gas. Unlike patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,211,728A, the device, simple and versatile, consists of few pieces/parts (heads and central vessel), considerably reducing the number of points susceptible to leakage. The way of attachment, whether threaded for small modules or flanged for medium-sized or industrial modules, is considerably facilitated in relation to the half-moon type clamps presented in the device of U.S. Pat. No. 5,211,728A. The heads are directly attached to the central vessel, inside which the bundle is packed/glued, thus eliminating the use of such clamps or other metallic connections/parts. The access of the fluids in the lumen of the fibers happens axially, while the access in the shell of the membranes is distributed homogeneously, radially to the bundle, compared to the U.S. Pat. No. 5,211,728A, thus eliminating/reducing the possible undesirable preferential paths inside the module. Fluid dynamics is also considerably favored.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent PI0512225-2B1 presents a device used in a particular application of immersed type such as membrane bioreactors, for example. This type of process is applied for treatment/separation of liquid medium in a permeation mode with &#x201c;negative&#x201d; pressure from the external part to the internal part of the hollow fibers. The head is specially configured for this type of application. It presents a central access to a pressurized gaseous medium responsible for the injection of air bubbles into the internal part of the bundle that allows the reduction of scaling along the fibers. This device does not have a closed pressure vessel. The attachment head located at the base of the bundle is not designed to be used in other separation processes such as membrane contactors, for example.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Document US2003024868A1 presents a spiral-type module typically used in the seawater desalination process, for example, also known as reverse osmosis. The module configuration presents flat polymeric membranes rolled up and attached in a perforated central tube used as a permeate collector. This configuration cannot be applied to contactors with membranes type modules as described in the present invention. This type of module is preferably used/suitable for separation processes of liquid streams that are already pre-treated or with a low content of suspended particles/solids. Fluid dynamics is not particularly favored in this type of module.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to solve such problems, the present invention was developed, by designing a vessel with a compact configuration to facilitate the packaging of hollow fiber type membranes, allowing the vessel to be removed/reused several times. The set of this piece of equipment (vessel, heads) does not have other connections (type &#x201c;Tee&#x201d;&#x2014;T), thus reducing the points susceptible to leakage. This piece of equipment is designed to withstand pressures up to 200 bar (20 MPa). The connections of the different lines/streams are made directly on the side of the heads, longitudinally to the vessel body, thus reducing the physical space of the piece of equipment within the system. This piece of equipment presents two easily scalable configurations. The configuration of the cavity and the access holes for the external part of the membranes (shell) consequently reduces the radial mechanical impact of the stream (in particular in the case of a liquid) on the bundle of the hollow fibers. The adhesion of the membranes to the vessel body is performed by gluing in a specially designed region with a surface with specific roughness to control the adhesion force.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention addresses to a device/piece of equipment that allows the packaging of polymeric hollow fiber/capillary type membranes used in membrane separation processes.
