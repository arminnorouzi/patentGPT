One portion is called conduction loss, which means a loss caused by a copper foil. The other is dielectric loss, which means a loss caused by a dielectric layer. Generally, the signal loss is related to dielectric constant D<sub>k </sub>and dielectric loss factor D<sub>f </sub>of the material of the dielectric layer. In order to reduce the signal loss, a dielectric material with low dielectric constant and low dielectric loss factor is needed.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Liquid crystal polymer (LCP) and Teflon are common dielectric materials. Due to the relatively low dielectric constant and dielectric loss factor, they are widely used in the dielectric layer of the printed circuit board. However, such materials are expensive and the available amounts are limited, which is not conducive to a batch production of the circuit boards. Moreover, such materials still have a certain dielectric constant and a certain dielectric loss factor. When requirements for the control of signal loss are high, such materials cannot meet the demand for further reducing the signal loss.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To overcome the above shortcomings, a circuit board and a manufacturing method of the circuit board are needed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a manufacturing method of a circuit board, including a manufacturing method of a circuit board, including:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0006">providing a first double-sided copper laminate, wherein the first double-sided copper laminate includes a dielectric layer, and a first copper foil layer and a copper plating layer formed on two surfaces of the dielectric layer, the dielectric layer defines a groove passing through the dielectric layer, the first copper foil layer is disposed on a side of the groove to form a bottom wall of the groove, the dielectric layer further forms a sidewall where the groove is defined, the sidewall is connected to the bottom wall, the copper plating layer includes a first copper plating portion on the bottom wall and the sidewall, and a second copper plating portion besides the first copper plating portion;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0007">providing a double-sided circuit substrate, wherein the double-sided circuit substrate includes a base layer and two first wiring layers formed on two surfaces of the base layer, each of the two first wiring layers includes a signal line, a region of the base layer not covered by the signal line defines two conductive paste blocks, the two conductive paste blocks are disposed on two sides of the signal line;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0008">stacking a first double-sided copper laminate on each of two sides of the double-sided circuit substrate, causing the signal line to be received in the groove, to obtain an intermediate body;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0009">pressing the intermediate body, causing the two conductive paste blocks to electrically connect to the second copper plating portions on the two sides of the base layer, wherein the second copper plating portion forms a ground line, the first copper plating portion forms a shielding layer, the shielding layer and the ground line on each of the two sides of the base layer and the two conductive paste blocks cooperatively form a closed shielding sleeve, the signal wire is disposed within the shielding sleeve; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0010">etching the first copper foil layer of each first double-sided copper laminate to obtain a second conductive circuit layer, thereby obtaining the circuit board.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0007" num="0011">The present disclosure further provides a circuit board, including:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0012">a double-sided circuit substrate, wherein the double-sided circuit substrate includes a base layer and two first wiring layers formed on two surfaces of the base layer, each of the two first wiring layers includes a signal line, two conductive paste blocks are disposed in a region of the base layer not covered by the signal line, the two conductive paste blocks are disposed on two sides of the signal line; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0013">a copper plating layer, a dielectric layer, and a second wiring layer formed in that order on each of the two first wiring layers, wherein the dielectric layer defines a groove passing through the dielectric layer, the first copper foil layer is disposed on a side of the groove to form a bottom wall of the groove, the dielectric layer further forms a sidewall where the groove is defined, the sidewall is connected to the bottom wall, the copper plating layer includes a first copper plating portion on the bottom wall and the sidewall, and a second copper plating portion besides the first copper plating portion;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0014">wherein the two conductive paste blocks are electrically connected to the second copper plating portions on the two sides of the base layer, wherein the second copper plating portion forms a ground line, the first copper plating portion forms a shielding layer, the shielding layer and the ground line on each of the two sides of the base layer and the two conductive paste blocks cooperatively forming a closed shielding sleeve, the signal wire is disposed within the shielding sleeve.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0015">In the present disclosure, the copper plating layer on the bottom wall and the sidewall forms the shielding layer.
