Patients suffering from diabetes mellitus can experience complications including loss of consciousness, cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Diabetics are generally required to monitor their glucose levels to ensure that they are being maintained within a clinically safe range, and may also use this information to determine if and/or when insulin is needed to reduce glucose levels in their bodies or when additional glucose is needed to raise the level of glucose in their bodies.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Growing clinical data demonstrates a strong correlation between the frequency of glucose monitoring and glycemic control. Despite such correlation, many individuals diagnosed with a diabetic condition do not monitor their glucose levels as frequently as they should due to a combination of factors including inconvenience, testing discretion, pain associated with glucose testing and cost.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, for diabetics that require the administration of insulin, glucose levels are typically measured by performing a blood glucose measurement with a test strip or by using a glucose sensor inserted into the body. Maintaining multiple and separate devices, however, for purposes of monitoring analyte levels and administering medication can be burdensome to the patient. In addition, a lack of interoperability between different devices used by diabetics can create further inconvenience, e.g., where the medication delivery device, reader device and sensor device are each manufactured by a different party. For instance, requiring the patient to manually input information from one device to another can be cumbersome and prone to human error.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For these and other reasons, needs exist for an integrated analyte data reader and medication delivery device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Provided herein are example embodiments of systems, devices and methods for the integration of an analyte reader and medication delivery device. Generally, an integrated analyte data reader and medication delivery device can be provided to an individual for the monitoring of one or more analyte levels of the individual, as well as the administering of medication such as insulin. The integrated analyte data reader and medication delivery device can have a small form factor, such as that of an insulin pen. In addition, the integrated analyte data reader and medication delivery device can communicate wirelessly with a sensor control device, also having a small form factor, that is worn on the individual's body. The sensor control device can include an in vivo analyte sensor for measuring an analyte level (or multiple analyte levels) in a subject, and can be configured such that at least a portion of the sensor is in contact with a bodily fluid of the subject. The sensor control device can also include communications circuitry for wirelessly transmitting data to the integrated analyte reader and medication delivery device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other systems, devices, methods, features and advantages of the subject matter described herein will be or will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description.

In many embodiments, the sensor control device can include an analyte sensor configured so that at least a portion of the sensor is, or can be, positioned in the body of a user to obtain information about at least one analyte of the body, such as glucose, in a bodily fluid (e.g., subcutaneously within the interstitial fluid (&#x201c;ISF&#x201d;) or blood, within the dermal fluid of the dermal layer, or otherwise). In some embodiments, for example, the sensor is configured to measure a glucose level. Additionally, the detection of other analytes is within the scope of the present disclosure, and can include, for example, ketones, lactate, oxygen, hemoglobin A1C, acetyl choline, amylase, bilirubin, cholesterol, chorionic gonadotropin, creatine kinase (e.g., CK-MB), creatine, DNA, fructosamine, glutamine, growth hormones, hormones, peroxide, prostate-specific antigen, prothrombin, RNA, thyroid stimulating hormone, troponin and others. The embodiments disclosed herein can also be used with in vivo analyte monitoring systems that incorporate in vitro capability, as well as purely in vitro or ex vivo analyte monitoring systems, including systems that are entirely non-invasive.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Furthermore, for each and every embodiment of a method disclosed herein, systems and devices capable of performing each of those embodiments are covered within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, embodiments of integrated analyte data reader and medication delivery devices are disclosed, and these devices can have one or more antenna for wireless communications, non-transitory memories (e.g., for storing instructions and data), power sources, communication circuits, transmitters, receivers, processors and/or controllers (e.g., for executing instructions stored in memory) that can perform any and all method steps, or facilitate the execution of any and all method steps.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">These embodiments and others described herein represent improvements in the field of computer-based analyte monitoring and medication delivery systems. For example, in some prior systems, analyte values would need to be transcribed into a separate device for dose calculation or for retrospective analysis. The embodiments disclosed herein can eliminate the need for multiple devices and therefore reduce the chance of transcription error. As another advantage, transferring glucose values to an integrated analyte reader and medication delivery device places the information where the focus needs to be&#x2014;on the device where the resulting dose is to be delivered. Furthermore, the embodiments disclosed herein reduce the need to carry multiple devices (e.g., a separate reader or smartphone), particularly where a sensor capable of wireless communications is used, and thus increases convenience to the patient. Other improvements and advantages are provided, and will be apparent to those of skill in the art.

Antenna <b>229</b> can be embedded or printed upon a flexible sheet or film that is wound, wrapped, or curled one or more times around cap <b>236</b>. In some embodiments, antenna <b>229</b> can be coupled to a hinge <b>243</b> disposed on an outer surface of cap <b>236</b>, around which antenna <b>229</b> can pivot from an undeployed state to an extended or deployed state.

In each of the embodiments described herein, an accelerometer can be disposed within cap <b>236</b> of integrated device <b>260</b>. The accelerometer can be coupled to the electronics, e.g., processor, memory, analog-to-digital converter, etc., within integrated device <b>260</b>.

In this manner, in those embodiments that include an accelerometer, integrated device <b>260</b> need not have a button or switch for activating the NFC scan function prior to scanning sensor control device <b>102</b> (or other device). Furthermore, because accelerometers consume relatively little power, i.e., typically less than a hundred microwatts, they can always be on and able to sense the swipe gesture, yet consume significantly less power than a system driving the NFC antenna to scan for the sensor control device.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Example Embodiments of Adverse Condition Protection Features</heading><p id="p-0064" num="0061">Integrated device <b>260</b> can also store instructions, executable by processor <b>222</b>, that operate to mitigate the risk of a harmful medication injection when an adverse condition is present in the subject. For example, the injection of insulin when a user has a low glucose level (e.g., below 55 mg/dL) can be particularly dangerous because it can cause a diabetic person to fall into a coma. Therefore, it is desirable for integrated device <b>260</b> to include one or more adverse condition protection features to warn the user in various ways that injecting insulin is dangerous when an adverse condition is present, or to prevent the insulin injection itself. These adverse condition protection features, which are described in further detail below, can include requiring one or more sensor control device scans before injection, displaying a warning indicator, preventing the removal of the insulin pen cap, inhibiting the depressing of the injection button, or any of the other features or combinations of features, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">In some example embodiments, integrated device <b>260</b> can store instructions in memory, executable by processor <b>222</b>, that cause an indication to be output to the user that a sensor control device scan should be performed before injecting insulin. This feature can be initiated by sensing that cap <b>236</b> has been removed without having scanned the sensor control device <b>102</b>, for example, within a predetermined time interval. In some embodiments, the removal of cap <b>236</b> can be detected, for example, by an accelerometer disposed in cap <b>236</b>, and configured to detect the movement of cap <b>236</b> in a particular direction relative to integrated device <b>260</b>. In other embodiments, the removal of cap <b>236</b> can be detected by a light sensor positioned on an area of the integrated device <b>260</b> that is covered by cap <b>236</b> when in place on device <b>260</b>. In other embodiments, the removal of cap <b>236</b> can be detected by a magnetic switch (such as a reed switch). In other embodiments, removal can be detected by a mechanical-electrical switch, such as a switch biased towards an extended position and held in a depressed position by cap <b>236</b>, where removal of cap <b>236</b> causes the switch to extend and trip the circuit (e.g., by closing or opening the circuit). Other methods of cap removal detection are contemplated and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. Upon sensing this condition, the user could be warned audibly, visually, haptically (e.g., with a vibration) or with another indicator.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063">Similarly, when the sensor control device is scanned, and an adverse condition is detected, e.g., the value is below a predetermined recommended low glucose threshold, a warning indicator can be visually illuminated on a prominent location of the integrated device <b>260</b>.

In some embodiments, for example, the lock-out mechanism can be a latch that is activated on device <b>260</b> to secure cap <b>236</b> to the main body of device <b>260</b>, or otherwise prevent exposure of the introducer. The electronics and/or mechanism for the latch can be housed within cap <b>236</b> or the opposite portion (e.g., main body) of device <b>260</b>. The latch can secure cap <b>236</b> to device <b>260</b> for a predetermined amount of time, during which time the user can be sufficiently warned that injecting insulin may be dangerous. According to some embodiments, a mechanical manual override can be optionally provided. In another embodiment, the lock-out mechanism can inhibit the operation of the injection button on device <b>260</b>, so that insulin cannot be injected. Again, the lock-out mechanism can be configured to persist for a predetermined amount of time, to persist until a scan is performed to confirm an absence of an adverse condition, and/or to include a manual override mechanism.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref> are perspective cutaway views of an example embodiment of an adverse condition protection feature having a lock-out mechanism, such as the aforementioned latch.
