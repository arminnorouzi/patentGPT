This system, although having some minor flaws, greatly increases the flow of customers through the store and allows the store to reduce their daily staff.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One (1) of the drawbacks to a self-check-out lane is at the end, when the items that have been purchased must be bagged. Often times, the bags are plastic and the come either interwoven or crimped together, where a pulling force on an outermost bag is the way to separate that bag from the stack. Plastic bags are notorious for static cling and the electrostatic attraction between two (2) adjacent plastic bags is another force that must be overcome when separating the bags. The present invention addresses this problem by providing a user the ability to easily carry a device that helps to separate a single bag from the stack when it is time to place their items in the bag.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The principles of the present invention provide for a bag separator has a first end portion which is adapted to contact an individual bag during a separation process, a center portion which has a first side, a second side, a first end and a second end, a second end portion which is adapted to be supported by a support structure&#x2014;the second end portion is an extended portion of the second end of the center portion, a post which extends from the first end portion, and a notch which is disposed on a midpoint of the second end portion&#x2014;the notch of the second end portion accepts the post from the first end portion.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The center portion may include a plurality of rounded corners. The center portion may include a plurality of anti-snag corners. The first side and the second side of the center portion may each include a perimeter border disposed therearound. A first logo may reside on the first side of the center portion. The first logo may serve as a gripping element when the bag separator is in use. A second logo may reside on the second side of the center portion. The second logo may serve as a gripping element when the bag separator is in use. The center portion may be 0.188 in. in thickness at the first end of the center portion to facilitate grasping the bag separator. The center portion may be 0.188 in. in thickness at the second end of the center portion to facilitate grasping the bag separator. The center portion may be generally rectangular shaped.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The second end portion may include a pair of angled walls, a first angled wall that extends minimally outward at a rearward angle from the first side of the center portion, and a second angled wall that extends minimally outward at the rearward angle from the second side of the center portion. A plurality of flanged sections may extend rearwardly from a plurality of distal edges of the angled walls and the angled walls and the flanged section have a width coextensive with the center portion and the flanged section are oriented in a plane parallel with the center portion. An aperture may be disposed on each of the flanged sections that are aligned with each other to enable the bag separator to be suspended from the support structure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A proximal end of the post may be permanently affixed to the notch. The proximal end of the post may be removably attached to the notch. The post may be coextensive with the width of the second end portion when inserted within the notch. The post may be cylindrical shaped that extends outwardly away from the center portion. A pommel may be disposed on a distal end of the post. A rubber cover may be removably attached on the first end portion covers the pommel and a part of the post.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The advantages and features of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following more detailed description and claims taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like elements are identified with like symbols, and in which:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a top perspective view of the bag separator, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a top perspective view of the bag separator with the cover feature installed, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a bottom perspective view of the bag separator, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a side elevation view of the bag separator with the cover feature installed, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a top plan view of the bag separator with the cover feature installed, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view of the cover feature, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a front elevation view of the bag separator with the cover feature installed, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a rear elevation view of the bag separator with the cover feature installed, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention; and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an environmental view of the bag separator in an exemplary method of use, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTIVE KEY</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><b>5</b> bag separator</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><b>10</b><i>a </i>first end portion</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><b>10</b><i>b </i>center portion</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><b>10</b><i>c </i>second end portion</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><b>11</b> top side</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><b>12</b> bottom side</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><b>13</b><i>a </i>first logo</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><b>13</b><i>b </i>second logo</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><b>14</b> pommel</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><b>15</b> post</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><b>16</b> flanged section</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><b>17</b> aperture</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><b>18</b> angled wall</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><b>19</b> notch</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><b>20</b> cover</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><b>21</b> opening</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><b>30</b> user</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><b>40</b> stack of bags</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><b>41</b> individual bag</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><b>50</b> checkout line</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><b>51</b> bagging area</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The best mode for carrying out the invention is presented in terms of its preferred embodiment, herein depicted within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>9</b></figref>.
