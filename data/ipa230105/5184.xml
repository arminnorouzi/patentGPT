Stains emphasize nuclei of white blood cells (WBCs) and therefore enable classification of WBCs into various types. However, staining can have several disadvantages. Variability in the stains and associated techniques, operator variability and significant laboratory costs arising from stain handling are some of the drawbacks associated with the methods existing in the art. As staining is an indispensable process for various biological analyses such as blood smears, clinical pathologists prefer stain based imaging as a clinically approved practice.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Several image processing algorithms have been proposed for standardization of staining techniques. Computational imaging methods such as digital holography microscopy have been proposed as stain-free imaging methods based on use of phase information. Phase contrast microscopy also has been widely used to study samples containing transparent components with varying refractive indices. Optical phase shifts occur primarily due to the thickness and refractive index of the sample. However, it is not easy to decouple the contribution of refractive index from the contribution of phase shift, due to thickness/height of the sample. Traditional microscopic images captured by cameras only contain amplitude information. Therefore, there is no way of obtaining phase information efficiently without appropriate hardware components associated with the microscope. Such computational imaging techniques are also expensive and involve several moving parts which may be prone to damage. Therefore, there exists a need for an efficient way of virtually staining microscopic slides which makes use of phase information associated with the components on the microscopic slide.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A method of generating a chromatically modified image of one or more components on a microscopic slide is disclosed.

The imaging module <b>300</b> includes a light source <b>302</b> coupled to a processor <b>301</b>. The light source <b>302</b> may be a multi-wavelength light source, i.e. capable of emitting light of varying wavelengths. In an embodiment, the light source <b>302</b> is configured to emit light of at least three different wavelength ranges. The wavelength ranges of the light source <b>302</b> may be, for example, between 400 nm and 420 nm; 440 nm and 480 nm; and 520 nm and 650 nm. In an embodiment, the light emitted 307 from the light source <b>302</b> passes through a microscopic slide <b>303</b> which includes one or more components to be imaged. The microscopic slide <b>303</b> may be, for example, a blood smear including a plurality of RBCs and WBCs. In an embodiment, the microscopic slide <b>303</b> may also be a pathology slide, for example, in case of a tissue biopsy. The imaging module <b>300</b> further includes an objective lens <b>304</b> to visualize and magnify the one or more components on the microscopic slide <b>303</b>. The light <b>307</b> from the light source <b>302</b> radiates on to the microscopic slide <b>303</b>. In an embodiment, the imaging module <b>300</b> may additionally include a tube lens <b>305</b>. The tube lens <b>305</b> is used in microscopes to enable creation of real images from intermediate images placed at infinity. Therefore, tube lens <b>305</b> enable visualization of infinity corrected images. The imaging module <b>300</b> may also include an imaging capturing module <b>306</b>. The image capturing module <b>306</b> may include imaging lenses and an imaging sensor, configured to capture an image of the illuminated microscopic slide <b>303</b>. The imaging sensor may be, for example a charge-coupled device (CCD) or a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS). In an embodiment, the image capturing module <b>306</b> is also configured to transfer the captured image to the server <b>101</b> for further processing. In another embodiment, the image capturing module <b>306</b> is an exemplary embodiment of the input unit <b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In an embodiment, the imaging module <b>300</b> is a Fourier ptychography microscope. Fourier ptychography is a computational imaging technique where phase information associated with the one or more components on the microscopic slide <b>303</b> can be computationally derived. Phase information is a representation of refractive index changes observed when light <b>307</b> passes through the one or more components on the microscopic slide <b>303</b>. Phase information of the one or more components can be used to differentiate areas of enhanced density or refractive index on the slide <b>303</b>, such as nuclei of WBCs. Red blood cells (RBCs) and WBCs have unique phase profiles owing to the morphological differences between the cells. Such differences in phase information can be used to identify cell features such as nuclei of WBCs. In an embodiment, the Fourier ptychography microscope <b>300</b> may also be used to obtain chemical composition and morphological characteristics of the one or more components on the microscopic slide <b>303</b>, simultaneously. Such chemical composition may be, for example, hemoglobin. Such chemical composition and morphological characteristics may be derived, for example, based on phase value associated with the one or more components present on the microscopic slide <b>303</b>. In an embodiment, the morphological characteristics include morphological dimensions such as height and thickness of the cells. Morphological characteristics may also include morphological classification associated with the one or more components. In pathological slides, morphological characteristics may include determination of whether one or more cells are malignant or benign.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a flowchart of an embodiment of a method <b>400</b> of generating a chromatically modified image of one or more components on a microscopic slide.

Such imaging module <b>300</b> may be, for example, a Fourier ptychography microscope. Traditional microscopic images captured by cameras may include only amplitude information. However, in Fourier ptychography microscopy, phase information can be derived computationally from one or more images of the same one or more components on the microscopic slide, illuminated at varying illumination angles. Such computational derivation of phase information may be performed using Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm. The phase image obtained from the algorithm enables calculation of key clinical hematological parameters such as hemoglobin concentration and mean corpuscular volume from cell thickness/height. A relationship between phase shift (&#x394;&#x3d5;), concentration (C) and height (h) with a spatial dependence in a two-dimensional (x, y) plane is depicted below:</p><p id="p-0032" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x394;&#x3d5;(<i>x,y</i>;&#x3bb;)=<i>k</i><sub>0</sub>[&#x3b2;(&#x3bb;)<i>C</i>(<i>x,y</i>)+&#x394;<i>n</i><sub>ws</sub>(&#x3bb;)]<i>h</i>(<i>x,y</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0033" num="0000">where &#x3bb; is wavelength of light, &#x394;n<sub>ws </sub>is refractive index difference between water and surrounding media, and &#x3b2; is the rate of change (mg/l) of the refractive index versus protein concentration. Fourier ptychography provides several unique technical advantages over traditional microscopy. Fourier ptychography enables a wide field of view with high resolution using a low magnification/resolution lens or objective lens. The hardware components of Fourier ptychography microscope are simple and mainly require an illumination source which can illuminate at multiple angles. Additionally, Fourier ptychography enables obtaining phase images at multiple wavelengths computationally using image reconstruction algorithms such as Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm. The phase difference between RBCs and WBCs based on the cell constituents and size may be exploited to generate a chromatically modified image of the one or more components on the microscopic slide. In an embodiment, the image of the one or more components on the microscopic slide may be obtained using the image capturing module <b>306</b> of the imaging module <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0031">The method <b>400</b> further includes a step <b>402</b> of processing the image to identify one or more components on the microscopic slide. Processing of the image enables differentiating between the one or more components on the microscopic slide. In an embodiment, such identification of one or more components in the image may be performed by application of one or more thresholds to the obtained image. The method steps associated with processing the image are elaborated in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. At step <b>403</b> of the method <b>400</b>, at least one part of the one or more components identified from the image are segmented. Such at least one part of the one or more components may be, for example, of clinical relevance. Such at least one part of the one or more components may include, for example, nuclei of the WBCs. The shape of the nuclei in WBCs enables identification of different types of WBCs. Therefore, segmentation of such nuclei for further processing may be essential. In an embodiment, segmentation of such at least one part of the one or more components on the microscopic slide may be performed using methods well known to a person skilled in the art. The method <b>400</b> further includes a step <b>404</b> of chromatically modifying the at least one part of the one or more components that is segmented at step <b>403</b>. Chromatic modification of the at least one part enables efficient identification of such at least one part amidst the one or more components on the microscopic slide. Chromatic modification enables creation of an effect of staining that is clinically performed by staining experts to visualize one or more components on a microscopic slide. In the present embodiment, the chromatic modification of the at least one part of the one or more components on the microscopic slide is performed computationally and therefore, the requirement of manual staining of such microscopic slide is avoided. The method steps elaborating the process of chromatic modification of the at least one part of the one or more components is provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0032">At step <b>405</b>, the chromatically modified image of the at least one part of the one or more components on the microscopic slide is overlaid with the image obtained from the imaging module <b>300</b> at step <b>401</b>. The chromatically modified image is overlaid such that the chromatically modified at least one part of the one or more components is positioned exactly over the unmodified at least one part of the one or more components in the image obtained at step <b>401</b>. In an embodiment, the overlaying of images may be performed, for example, using coordinate mapping and/or pixel mapping of the images. Advantageously, overlaying the chromatically modified at least one part of the one or more components enables generation of a chromatically modified image of the one or more components on the microscopic slide. Therefore, chromatic modification of the at least part of the one or more components enables creation of a staining effect on the one or more components on the microscopic slide. Therefore, manual effort of staining the slides is avoided. This enables efficient and uniform staining of the components on the microscopic slide, thereby making the process of analyzing such microscopic slides simpler and faster. Additionally, manual effort in staining the microscopic slides is reduced and variability in stains is eliminated. Furthermore, the method is cost effective in that the laboratory infrastructure and man power is efficiently managed.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a flowchart of a method <b>500</b> of processing the obtained image to identify one or more components. At step <b>501</b>, a first threshold associated with the one or more components in the image is identified. The first threshold may be, for example, size of the one or more components in the image. WBCs are bigger in size in comparison to RBCs. Therefore, the first threshold is set such that the WBCs are separated out from the RBCs efficiently. The size of the one or more components may be determined, for example, based on the area or circumference of the components in the image. Such determination may be based on the pixel intensity values associated with cellular boundaries of the one or more components in the image. At step <b>502</b>, the one or more components in the image are sorted based on the first threshold. Sorting of the one or more components in the image enables separation of the one or more components based on the size of the one or more components. At step <b>503</b>, a second threshold associated with the at least one part of the one or more components is identified. Such second threshold may be, for example, a contrast value associated with the at least one part of the one or more components. Alternatively, phase information associated with the at least one part of the one or more components may be used as a second threshold. In an embodiment, if the at least one part of the one or more components is a nuclei of the WBCs, such nuclei may have a higher contrast value in comparison to surrounding media. Therefore, the second threshold enables efficient identification of the at least one part of the one or more components in the image. At step <b>504</b>, the at least one part of the one or more components in the image is identified based on the second threshold. Such identification is performed based on the contrast values associated with the at least one part of the one or more components in the image. Advantageously, the method enables accurate identification of components in the image which are of clinical relevance. The method further enables uniform chromatic modification of the identified components in the image.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a flowchart of a method <b>600</b> of chromatically modifying the at least one part of the one or more components in the image, according to an embodiment. At step <b>601</b>, pixel intensity values associated with the segmented one or more components is identified. In an embodiment, the segmented one or more components may have an associated contrast value. Such contrast value may be dependent on the density of such one or more components or of the parts of the one or more components. Therefore, the nucleus of a WBC may have a higher associated contrast value in comparison to other constituents of the WBC. Therefore, the pixel intensity value associated with such nucleus is greater in comparison to the other constituents of the WBC. At step <b>602</b>, a determination is made if the pixel intensity value associated with the segmented one or more components is higher than a defined pixel intensity value. Such defined pixel intensity value may be a threshold based on which at least one part of the segmented one or more components is identified. Such at least one part of the segmented one or more components may be the nucleus of the WBC. At step <b>603</b>, if the pixel intensity value is greater than the defined pixel intensity value, the colour associated with the corresponding pixel is modified to a colour of interest. This enables chromatic modification of the one or more components in the image. Chromatic modification enables efficient determination of the one or more components of clinical relevance. If the pixel intensity value is lesser than the defined pixel intensity value, the original pixel intensity value is maintained at step <b>604</b>. In an embodiment, the colour for chromatic modification may be chosen such that the colour resembles a clinically stained microscopic slide. In a further embodiment, image processing algorithms well known in the art may be used to generate a chromatically modified image that is photorealistic and more emphasized in colour scheme. Additionally, amplitude information may also be used to make the chromatically modified image more realistic.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of chromatically modified image of one or more components on a microscopic slide.
