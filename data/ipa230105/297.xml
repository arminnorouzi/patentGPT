More particularly, the invention pertains to a dust collection system joint fitting.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wood working and similar activities that involve cutting, scraping, grinding, and/or polishing can produce large amounts of dust that may create health and safety issues. These problems can be avoided by using a dust collection system consisting of collection ducts and fittings, blowers, pre-separators, dust collection and filtration equipment. The typical woodshop uses a variety of saws, sanders, grinders, and other dust producing tools, and each of these is connected to a hose or conduit of a diameter appropriate to the tool and the amount of dust it creates. Circular saws, band saws, and routers may create a significant amount of dust and debris while scrapers produce a small amount and sanders may produce some intermediate amount. Because woodshop operations may involve using one or several tools at the same time, there has been an issue regarding how to connect all the tools to a single central dust collector in a way that does not impair dust separation for any of the tools. Dust is an environmental hazard in other industries as well, including grinding and polishing of stone or concrete.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Dust collection systems for wood dust and other types of dust, typically have a duct system that consists of a main trunk duct with one or more branch ducts that connect to the dust making machines or operations. There are a variety types of systems available for use by do-it-your-selfers [DIYs], commercial users, and industrial users. Sheet metal ducts are often used. Such systems typically consist of a snap lock or a spiral sheet metal pipe held together with sheet metal screws and duct tape. Another system called a quick-fit (&#x201c;QF&#x201d;) system uses laser welded sheet metal pipe with rolled flanges formed on both ends. A band clamp with a &#x201c;V&#x201d; section profile clamps together opposing faces forming an airtight joint that is easy to assemble and disassemble. In addition, various types of vacuum or low-pressure hoses may be used as well as standard PVC pipe of the type often used in plumbing.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A suction and airflow volume mismatch can occur when tools are connected to and disconnected from the dust collection trunk. It is important to maintain an optimum combination of vacuum (or negative pressure) in the dust collection system and to maintain sufficient air flow to collect the dust from the various tools that may be connected at a given time.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Airflow can be closed in a branch duct with a gate that typically requires turning a set screw to bear down on the gate and lock the gate in place. Operators frequently forget to tighten the screw sufficiently, which allows the gate to slip and be sucked closed by the air flowing through the valve, thus causing undesired airflow and/or system malfunction.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A dust collection system blast gate valve is disclosed that provides a self-braking blast gate adjustable to control vacuum pressure and air flow.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with an embodiment, a blast gate valve for a dust collection system includes a gate housing, a blast gate, and a magnetic brake element.

In the closed position, the blast gate obstructs more cross-sectional area of the flow passage than the blast gate obstructs in the open position.

For example, the gate housing <b>202</b> can be rotationally molded static conductive high-density polyethylene, injection molded plastic, stamped metal, or cast metal. The flow passage <b>204</b> has an inlet <b>206</b> and an outlet <b>207</b>. Air can flow through the gate housing <b>202</b> from the inlet <b>206</b> to the outlet <b>207</b>, or alternatively from the outlet <b>207</b> to the inlet <b>206</b>.

A stop element <b>211</b> can be attached to the blast gate <b>208</b> to limit the degree to which the blast gate <b>208</b> can open. The stop element can be or can include a pin, such as a PEM stud or a formed member.

The pocket <b>212</b> can be formed as a cavity within a single piece constituting the gate housing <b>202</b>, or the pocket <b>212</b> can be formed between a first housing portion <b>214</b> and a second housing portion <b>216</b>, wherein the first housing portion <b>214</b> and the second housing portion <b>216</b> are fastened together. The first housing portion <b>214</b> and the second housing portion <b>216</b> can be fastened together by conventional means, such as by screws or bolts, which would allow the first housing portion <b>214</b> to be separated from and reattached to the second housing portion <b>216</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, bolts <b>215</b> and nuts <b>217</b> are shown. In the illustrated embodiment, the first housing portion <b>214</b> has platforms <b>218</b> located around a periphery of the pocket <b>212</b> outside the pocket <b>212</b> where the blast gate <b>208</b> is positioned, such that bolts through the platforms do not interfere with the blast gate <b>208</b> or its movement between the closed position and the open position. The platforms <b>218</b> are raised above an interior pocket-defining surface <b>220</b> of the first housing portion <b>214</b>, the interior pocket-defining surface <b>220</b> defining the pocket <b>212</b>.

In such embodiments, there can be a clearance fit of the blast gate <b>208</b> within the pocket <b>212</b>. The pocket <b>212</b> includes a slot opening <b>223</b> sufficiently wide and tall to allow the blast gate <b>208</b> to be moved between the open position and the closed position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Alternatively, the height of the pocket <b>212</b> can be configured such that when the blast gate <b>208</b> slides between the open position and the closed position, the blast gate <b>208</b> simultaneously slides against the interior pocket-defining surface <b>220</b> of the first housing portion <b>214</b> and the interior pocket-defining surface <b>222</b> of the second housing portion <b>216</b>. In such embodiments, the level of frictional force facilitates retention of the blast gate <b>208</b> in any position between the open position and the closed position, but the level is low enough to allow easy manual movement of the blast gate <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">To facilitate retention of the blast gate <b>208</b> in any desired position after manual adjustment, the joint fitting <b>200</b> includes a magnetic brake element <b>230</b> to oppose sliding movement of the blast gate <b>208</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the magnetic brake element <b>230</b> on the gate housing <b>202</b>.

The sleeve can have an end flange <b>242</b> with a broader surface area or greater diameter than those of the magnet <b>232</b> to help guide the blast gate <b>208</b> past the magnet <b>232</b> during manually forced movement of the blast gate <b>208</b> and/or to provide a better surface for facilitating sliding friction against the blast gate <b>208</b>. The end flange <b>242</b> can be closer to the blast gate <b>208</b> than the magnet <b>232</b>, or in other words, can extend beyond the end <b>240</b> of the magnet <b>232</b> toward the first housing portion <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The joint fitting <b>200</b> is well suited for use with high pressure systems like the Oneida Air Systems&#xae; (Reg.
