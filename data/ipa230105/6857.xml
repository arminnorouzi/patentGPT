In some examples, a thermostat can control different devices depending on the outside temperature, temperature inside the building, the time of day, and other factors.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, this disclosure relates to a controller for controlling a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The controller for an HVAC system may be a thermostat or any other suitable hardware device for controlling and monitoring the operations of the HVAC system. The controller may include user interface devices for receiving user input and for displaying information regarding the HVAC system or information regarding environmental conditions as determined by the HVAC system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The controller may be able to determine whether users of the controller are physical proximate to the controller and may adjust the visual presentation of the information based on its determination of whether users of the controller are physical proximate to the controller. When the controller determines that no users are physically proximate to the controller, the controller may change its visual presentation of information displayed at the display of the controller to increase the legibility of information displayed at the display of the controller for users that are not physically proximate the controller. For example, the controller may increase the text size of the information displayed at the display.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The controller may be able to determine whether users of the controller are physical proximate to the controller without the use of a proximity sensor or other similar sensors. Instead, the controller may determine an elapsed time since the most recent user interaction with the controller. If the controller determines that the elapsed time since the most recent user interaction with the controller reaches or exceeds a specified timeout period, the controller may correspondingly determine that no users are physically proximate to the controller, and may accordingly change its visual presentation of information displayed at the display of the controller to increase the legibility of information displayed at the display of the controller for users that are not physically proximate the controller, such as by increasing the text size of the information displayed at the display.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one example, the disclosure is directed to a method for controlling a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system for a building.

The method further includes determining, by the controller without use of a proximity sensor while the controller is in the first state and based at least in part on whether an elapsed time since a most recent indication of user input received at a user input device of the controller exceeds a timeout period, that no users are physically proximate to the controller. The method further includes in response to determining that no users are physically proximate to the controller: transitioning the controller from the first state to a second state, and outputting, by the controller, a second user interface at the display device of the controller, wherein the second user interface comprises second information that is displayed by the display device at a second output size that is larger than the first output size.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another example, the disclosure is directed to a controller device for a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in a building.

The controller of a HVAC system, such as a thermostat, a smart thermostat, or any other hardware device for controlling and/or monitoring the HVAC system may include a display that displays any of a variety of information that the controller may receive from any suitable sources, such as via sensors of the HVAC system of a building, through a network (e.g., the Internet), and the like. For example, the controller may display information regarding the air temperature, energy usage, water usage, home security system status, and the like that are associated with the environment of the HVAC system, such the building for which the HVAC system controls the internal climate conditions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A controller typically includes a display that is relatively small in size, such as a rectangular display that is less than 4 inches on the diagonal or a circular display that has a diameter of less than 4 inches. As such, human perception limitations may potentially require a user to be physically proximate (e.g., within about three feet or less) to the controller in order for the information displayed by the display of the controller to be legible to the user.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Certain American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards recommend 20-22 minutes of a visual angle subtended on the retina of a user viewing a display in order for the user to be able to legibly read information displayed by the display of a controller. However, if a user is not physically proximate to the display of a controller, a small display, such as described above, of a controller may subtend a visual angle of only 6 minutes to a user that is 10 feet away from the display.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A controller for controlling a HVAC system may typically be mounted to a wall of a building. In order for a user to physically interact with the controller in order to, for example, control the HVAC system, such as adjusting the heating or air conditioning functions of the HVAC system in order to increase or decrease the ambient temperature of the building, the user may move himself or herself, such as by walking towards the controller, so that the user is physically proximate the controller.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">While the user is physically proximate to the controller and physically interacting with the controller, the controller may output information for display at the display of the controller that is legible to the user. Because the user is physically proximate to the controller (e.g., about three feet or less away from the controller), the information displayed at the display of the controller may be designed to be legible to the physically proximate user. For example, the information displayed by the display may be relatively dense (e.g., there may be a relatively large amount of information displayed at the display) and may be displayed at a relatively small font size (e.g., 12 point, 14 points, 18 points, and the like).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Once the user has finished its interactions with the physical controls of the controller, the user may move (e.g., walk) away from the controller so that the user is no longer physically proximate to (e.g., within three feet of) the controller. However, the information displayed by the display that is legible to the physically proximate user may no longer be legible to the user when the user is no longer physically proximate to the controller.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">To overcome such potential issues for a controller to display information that is legible to a user that is not physically proximate to the controller, the controller may dynamically change the visual appearance of the information displayed by the display of the controller based on the viewing distance of the user that is independent of user intervention. That is, the controller may dynamically change the visual appearance of the information displayed by the display of the controller without receiving explicit user input at the user input devices of the controller in order to cause the controller to change the visual appearance of the information displayed by the display. To change the visual appearance of the information displayed by the display, the controller may increase the size of the information displayed by the display (e.g., increase the font size of the information displayed by the display), increase the contrast of information displayed by the display, animate the information displayed by the display, reduce the information density of the information displayed by the display (e.g., display fewer pieces of information) or otherwise alter the visual appearance of the information displayed by the display to increase the legibility of such information to a user that is not physically proximate to the controller.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">To that end, in some examples, a controller may include a proximity sensor, such as a passive infrared sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, a motion sensor, cameras and the like, that is able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact, that the controller may use to detect whether any users are physically proximate the controller. For example, a controller may use a proximity sensor to determine whether any users are physically proximate of the sensor or to otherwise determine the physical distance of users from the controller. A controller may therefore use a proximity sensor to determine the distance of users from the controller in order to determine whether to alter the visual appearance of the information displayed by the display of controller to increase the legibility of such information to users that are not physically proximate to the controller.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">While some controllers of HVAC systems may include proximity sensors, other controllers of HVAC systems may not include proximity sensors. For example, inclusion of a proximity sensor may add to the costs of a controller and may prevent a controller for an HVAC system from meeting a certain price point. Thus, it may potentially be desirable for such controllers without proximity sensors to still be able to determine that users are not physically proximate to the controllers, so that such controllers can dynamically alter the visual appearance of the information displayed by the display, in order to increase the legibility of the information displayed by the display of the controllers for users that are not physically proximate to the controllers.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, a controller of an HVAC system may be able to determine when no users are physically proximate to the controller without use of a proximity sensor. Instead, the controller may determine whether the elapsed time after the most recent user interaction with the controller reaches or exceeds a specified timeout period, such as 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 45 seconds, and the like. The most recent user interaction with the controller may be a most recent physical interaction with the physical controller, such as a physical interaction via a button, dial, a touch-sensitive input device, or other physical components of the controller. This is opposed to user interaction with the controller via, e.g., use of a mobile computing device (e.g., a smart phone) that communicates with the controller over a network, such as the Internet, an intranet, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and the like, that may not require physical interaction with the controller. When the elapsed time after the most recent user interaction with the controller reaches or exceeds a specified timeout period, the controller may determine that no users are physically proximate to the controller.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">When the elapsed time after the most recent user interaction with the controller reaches or exceeds a specified timeout period, the controller may determine that no users are physically proximate to the controller. Accordingly, the controller may correspondingly dynamically change the appearance of the information displayed by the display, such as by increasing the size of the information displayed by the display, increasing the contrast of the information displayed by the display, or otherwise visually emphasizing the information displayed by the display, to increase the legibility of information displayed by the display of the controller to users that are across the room from the controller or are otherwise are not physically proximate to the controller.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As such, aspects of the present disclosure describe a controller of an HVAC system that is able to determine whether users are physically proximate to the controller without use of any proximity sensors. Such a controller may be able to provide capabilities similar to that of controllers that contain proximity sensors at a lower price and with fewer hardware components, thereby fulfilling general usability and accessibility needs within the constraints of pricing and hardware restrictions. By utilizing a time-based technique as opposed to a proximity sensing technique to determine whether users are physically proximate to the controller, the techniques described herein enables a controller of an HVAC system to progressively disclose legible information across a variety of user types and abilities.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example HVAC system <b>50</b> in a building <b>102</b>, in accordance with one or more techniques described herein.

Although this disclosure describes HVAC controller <b>20</b> (and controllers shown in other figures) as controlling HVAC component <b>106</b> and determining whether an actual configuration includes an irregularity, external computing device <b>123</b> may also be configured to perform these functions.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">HVAC component <b>106</b> may provide heated air (and/or cooled air) via the ductwork throughout the building <b>102</b>.
