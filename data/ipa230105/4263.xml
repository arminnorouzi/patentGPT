Touch-sensitive display <b>112</b> is sometimes called a &#x201c;touch screen&#x201d; for convenience and is sometimes known as or called a &#x201c;touch-sensitive display system.&#x201d; Device <b>100</b> includes memory <b>102</b> (which optionally includes one or more computer-readable storage mediums), memory controller <b>122</b>, one or more processing units (CPUs) <b>120</b>, peripherals interface <b>118</b>, RF circuitry <b>108</b>, audio circuitry <b>110</b>, speaker <b>111</b>, microphone <b>113</b>, input/output (I/O) subsystem <b>106</b>, other input control devices <b>116</b>, and external port <b>124</b>. Device <b>100</b> optionally includes one or more optical sensors <b>164</b>. Device <b>100</b> optionally includes one or more contact intensity sensors <b>165</b> for detecting intensity of contacts on device <b>100</b> (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> of device <b>100</b>). Device <b>100</b> optionally includes one or more tactile output generators <b>167</b> for generating tactile outputs on device <b>100</b> (e.g., generating tactile outputs on a touch-sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> of device <b>100</b> or touchpad <b>355</b> of device <b>300</b>). These components optionally communicate over one or more communication buses or signal lines <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As used in the specification and claims, the term &#x201c;intensity&#x201d; of a contact on a touch-sensitive surface refers to the force or pressure (force per unit area) of a contact (e.g., a finger contact) on the touch-sensitive surface, or to a substitute (proxy) for the force or pressure of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface. The intensity of a contact has a range of values that includes at least four distinct values and more typically includes hundreds of distinct values (e.g., at least 256). Intensity of a contact is, optionally, determined (or measured) using various approaches and various sensors or combinations of sensors. For example, one or more force sensors underneath or adjacent to the touch-sensitive surface are, optionally, used to measure force at various points on the touch-sensitive surface. In some implementations, force measurements from multiple force sensors are combined (e.g., a weighted average) to determine an estimated force of a contact. Similarly, a pressure-sensitive tip of a stylus is, optionally, used to determine a pressure of the stylus on the touch-sensitive surface. Alternatively, the size of the contact area detected on the touch-sensitive surface and/or changes thereto, the capacitance of the touch-sensitive surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto, and/or the resistance of the touch-sensitive surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto are, optionally, used as a substitute for the force or pressure of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface. In some implementations, the substitute measurements for contact force or pressure are used directly to determine whether an intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is described in units corresponding to the substitute measurements). In some implementations, the substitute measurements for contact force or pressure are converted to an estimated force or pressure, and the estimated force or pressure is used to determine whether an intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is a pressure threshold measured in units of pressure). Using the intensity of a contact as an attribute of a user input allows for user access to additional device functionality that is, in some circumstances, otherwise not be accessible by the user on a reduced-size device with limited real estate for displaying affordances (e.g., on a touch-sensitive display) and/or receiving user input (e.g., via a touch-sensitive display, a touch-sensitive surface, or a physical/mechanical control such as a knob or a button).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As used in the specification and claims, the term &#x201c;tactile output&#x201d; refers to physical displacement of a device relative to a previous position of the device, physical displacement of a component (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface) of a device relative to another component (e.g., housing) of the device, or displacement of the component relative to a center of mass of the device that will be detected by a user with the user's sense of touch. For example, in situations where the device or the component of the device is in contact with a surface of a user that is sensitive to touch (e.g., a finger, palm, or other part of a user's hand), the tactile output generated by the physical displacement will be interpreted by the user as a tactile sensation corresponding to a perceived change in physical characteristics of the device or the component of the device. For example, movement of a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch-sensitive display or trackpad) is, optionally, interpreted by the user as a &#x201c;down click&#x201d; or &#x201c;up click&#x201d; of a physical actuator button. In some cases, a user will feel a tactile sensation such as an &#x201c;down click&#x201d; or &#x201c;up click&#x201d; even when there is no movement of a physical actuator button associated with the touch-sensitive surface that is physically pressed (e.g., displaced) by the user's movements. As another example, movement of the touch-sensitive surface is, optionally, interpreted or sensed by the user as &#x201c;roughness&#x201d; of the touch-sensitive surface, even when there is no change in smoothness of the touch-sensitive surface. While such interpretations of touch by a user will be subject to the individualized sensory perceptions of the user, there are many sensory perceptions of touch that are common to a large majority of users. Thus, when a tactile output is described as corresponding to a particular sensory perception of a user (e.g., an &#x201c;up click,&#x201d; a &#x201c;down click,&#x201d; &#x201c;roughness&#x201d;), unless otherwise stated, the generated tactile output corresponds to physical displacement of the device or a component thereof that will generate the described sensory perception for a typical (or average) user.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">It should be appreciated that device <b>100</b> is only one example of a portable multifunction device, and that device <b>100</b> optionally has more or fewer components than shown, optionally combines two or more components, or optionally has a different configuration or arrangement of the components.

External port <b>124</b> (e.g., Universal Serial Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly to other devices or indirectly over a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.). In some embodiments, the external port is a multi-pin (e.g., 30-pin) connector that is the same as, or similar to and/or compatible with, the 30-pin connector used on iPod&#xae; (trademark of Apple Inc.) devices.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Contact/motion module <b>130</b> optionally detects contact with touch screen <b>112</b> (in conjunction with display controller <b>156</b>) and other touch-sensitive devices (e.g., a touchpad or physical click wheel). Contact/motion module <b>130</b> includes various software components for performing various operations related to detection of contact, such as determining if contact has occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining an intensity of the contact (e.g., the force or pressure of the contact or a substitute for the force or pressure of the contact), determining if there is movement of the contact and tracking the movement across the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., detecting one or more finger-dragging events), and determining if the contact has ceased (e.g., detecting a finger-up event or a break in contact). Contact/motion module <b>130</b> receives contact data from the touch-sensitive surface. Determining movement of the point of contact, which is represented by a series of contact data, optionally includes determining speed (magnitude), velocity (magnitude and direction), and/or an acceleration (a change in magnitude and/or direction) of the point of contact. These operations are, optionally, applied to single contacts (e.g., one finger contacts) or to multiple simultaneous contacts (e.g., &#x201c;multitouch&#x201d;/multiple finger contacts). In some embodiments, contact/motion module <b>130</b> and display controller <b>156</b> detect contact on a touchpad.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, contact/motion module <b>130</b> uses a set of one or more intensity thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a user (e.g., to determine whether a user has &#x201c;clicked&#x201d; on an icon). In some embodiments, at least a subset of the intensity thresholds are determined in accordance with software parameters (e.g., the intensity thresholds are not determined by the activation thresholds of particular physical actuators and can be adjusted without changing the physical hardware of device <b>100</b>). For example, a mouse &#x201c;click&#x201d; threshold of a trackpad or touch screen display can be set to any of a large range of predefined threshold values without changing the trackpad or touch screen display hardware. Additionally, in some implementations, a user of the device is provided with software settings for adjusting one or more of the set of intensity thresholds (e.g., by adjusting individual intensity thresholds and/or by adjusting a plurality of intensity thresholds at once with a system-level click &#x201c;intensity&#x201d; parameter).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Contact/motion module <b>130</b> optionally detects a gesture input by a user. Different gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns (e.g., different motions, timings, and/or intensities of detected contacts). Thus, a gesture is, optionally, detected by detecting a particular contact pattern. For example, detecting a finger tap gesture includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting a finger-up (liftoff) event at the same position (or substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g., at the position of an icon). As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the touch-sensitive surface includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or more finger-dragging events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger-up (liftoff) event.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Graphics module <b>132</b> includes various known software components for rendering and displaying graphics on touch screen <b>112</b> or other display, including components for changing the visual impact (e.g., brightness, transparency, saturation, contrast, or other visual property) of graphics that are displayed.

In some embodiments, device/global internal state <b>157</b> is used by event sorter <b>170</b> to determine which application(s) is (are) currently active, and application internal state <b>192</b> is used by event sorter <b>170</b> to determine application views <b>191</b> to which to deliver event information.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0125">In some embodiments, application internal state <b>192</b> includes additional information, such as one or more of: resume information to be used when application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b> resumes execution, user interface state information that indicates information being displayed or that is ready for display by application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b>, a state queue for enabling the user to go back to a prior state or view of application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b>, and a redo/undo queue of previous actions taken by the user.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0126">Event monitor <b>171</b> receives event information from peripherals interface <b>118</b>. Event information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user touch on touch-sensitive display <b>112</b>, as part of a multi-touch gesture). Peripherals interface <b>118</b> transmits information it receives from I/O subsystem <b>106</b> or a sensor, such as proximity sensor <b>166</b>, accelerometer(s) <b>168</b>, and/or microphone <b>113</b> (through audio circuitry <b>110</b>). Information that peripherals interface <b>118</b> receives from I/O subsystem <b>106</b> includes information from touch-sensitive display <b>112</b> or a touch-sensitive surface.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0127">In some embodiments, event monitor <b>171</b> sends requests to the peripherals interface <b>118</b> at predetermined intervals. In response, peripherals interface <b>118</b> transmits event information. In other embodiments, peripherals interface <b>118</b> transmits event information only when there is a significant event (e.g., receiving an input above a predetermined noise threshold and/or for more than a predetermined duration).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0128">In some embodiments, event sorter <b>170</b> also includes a hit view determination module <b>172</b> and/or an active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0129">Hit view determination module <b>172</b> provides software procedures for determining where a sub-event has taken place within one or more views when touch-sensitive display <b>112</b> displays more than one view. Views are made up of controls and other elements that a user can see on the display.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0130">Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a set of views, sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in which information is displayed and touch-based gestures occur. The application views (of a respective application) in which a touch is detected optionally correspond to programmatic levels within a programmatic or view hierarchy of the application. For example, the lowest level view in which a touch is detected is, optionally, called the hit view, and the set of events that are recognized as proper inputs are, optionally, determined based, at least in part, on the hit view of the initial touch that begins a touch-based gesture.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0131">Hit view determination module <b>172</b> receives information related to sub-events of a touch-based gesture. When an application has multiple views organized in a hierarchy, hit view determination module <b>172</b> identifies a hit view as the lowest view in the hierarchy which should handle the sub-event. In most circumstances, the hit view is the lowest level view in which an initiating sub-event occurs (e.g., the first sub-event in the sequence of sub-events that form an event or potential event). Once the hit view is identified by the hit view determination module <b>172</b>, the hit view typically receives all sub-events related to the same touch or input source for which it was identified as the hit view.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0132">Active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b> determines which view or views within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In some embodiments, active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b> determines that only the hit view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b> determines that all views that include the physical location of a sub-event are actively involved views, and therefore determines that all actively involved views should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, even if touch sub-events were entirely confined to the area associated with one particular view, views higher in the hierarchy would still remain as actively involved views.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0133">Event dispatcher module <b>174</b> dispatches the event information to an event recognizer (e.g., event recognizer <b>180</b>). In embodiments including active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b>, event dispatcher module <b>174</b> delivers the event information to an event recognizer determined by active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b>. In some embodiments, event dispatcher module <b>174</b> stores in an event queue the event information, which is retrieved by a respective event receiver <b>182</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0134">In some embodiments, operating system <b>126</b> includes event sorter <b>170</b>. Alternatively, application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b> includes event sorter <b>170</b>. In yet other embodiments, event sorter <b>170</b> is a stand-alone module, or a part of another module stored in memory <b>102</b>, such as contact/motion module <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0135">In some embodiments, application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b> includes a plurality of event handlers <b>190</b> and one or more application views <b>191</b>, each of which includes instructions for handling touch events that occur within a respective view of the application's user interface. Each application view <b>191</b> of the application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b> includes one or more event recognizers <b>180</b>. Typically, a respective application view <b>191</b> includes a plurality of event recognizers <b>180</b>. In other embodiments, one or more of event recognizers <b>180</b> are part of a separate module, such as a user interface kit (not shown) or a higher level object from which application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b> inherits methods and other properties.

Event handler <b>190</b> optionally utilizes or calls data updater <b>176</b>, object updater <b>177</b>, or GUI updater <b>178</b> to update the application internal state <b>192</b>. Alternatively, one or more of the application views <b>191</b> include one or more respective event handlers <b>190</b>. Also, in some embodiments, one or more of data updater <b>176</b>, object updater <b>177</b>, and GUI updater <b>178</b> are included in a respective application view <b>191</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0136">A respective event recognizer <b>180</b> receives event information (e.g., event data <b>179</b>) from event sorter <b>170</b> and identifies an event from the event information. Event recognizer <b>180</b> includes event receiver <b>182</b> and event comparator <b>184</b>. In some embodiments, event recognizer <b>180</b> also includes at least a subset of: metadata <b>183</b>, and event delivery instructions <b>188</b> (which optionally include sub-event delivery instructions).</p><p id="p-0119" num="0137">Event receiver <b>182</b> receives event information from event sorter <b>170</b>. The event information includes information about a sub-event, for example, a touch or a touch movement. Depending on the sub-event, the event information also includes additional information, such as location of the sub-event. When the sub-event concerns motion of a touch, the event information optionally also includes speed and direction of the sub-event. In some embodiments, events include rotation of the device from one orientation to another (e.g., from a portrait orientation to a landscape orientation, or vice versa), and the event information includes corresponding information about the current orientation (also called device attitude) of the device.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0138">Event comparator <b>184</b> compares the event information to predefined event or sub-event definitions and, based on the comparison, determines an event or sub-event, or determines or updates the state of an event or sub-event. In some embodiments, event comparator <b>184</b> includes event definitions <b>186</b>. Event definitions <b>186</b> contain definitions of events (e.g., predefined sequences of sub-events), for example, event <b>1</b> (<b>187</b>-<b>1</b>), event <b>2</b> (<b>187</b>-<b>2</b>), and others. In some embodiments, sub-events in an event (<b>187</b>) include, for example, touch begin, touch end, touch movement, touch cancellation, and multiple touching. In one example, the definition for event <b>1</b> (<b>187</b>-<b>1</b>) is a double tap on a displayed object. The double tap, for example, comprises a first touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a first liftoff (touch end) for a predetermined phase, a second touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, and a second liftoff (touch end) for a predetermined phase. In another example, the definition for event <b>2</b> (<b>187</b>-<b>2</b>) is a dragging on a displayed object. The dragging, for example, comprises a touch (or contact) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a movement of the touch across touch-sensitive display <b>112</b>, and liftoff of the touch (touch end). In some embodiments, the event also includes information for one or more associated event handlers <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0139">In some embodiments, event definition <b>187</b> includes a definition of an event for a respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator <b>184</b> performs a hit test to determine which user-interface object is associated with a sub-event. For example, in an application view in which three user-interface objects are displayed on touch-sensitive display <b>112</b>, when a touch is detected on touch-sensitive display <b>112</b>, event comparator <b>184</b> performs a hit test to determine which of the three user-interface objects is associated with the touch (sub-event). If each displayed object is associated with a respective event handler <b>190</b>, the event comparator uses the result of the hit test to determine which event handler <b>190</b> should be activated. For example, event comparator <b>184</b> selects an event handler associated with the sub-event and the object triggering the hit test.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0140">In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event (<b>187</b>) also includes delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has been determined whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to the event recognizer's event type.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0141">When a respective event recognizer <b>180</b> determines that the series of sub-events do not match any of the events in event definitions <b>186</b>, the respective event recognizer <b>180</b> enters an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state, after which it disregards subsequent sub-events of the touch-based gesture. In this situation, other event recognizers, if any, that remain active for the hit view continue to track and process sub-events of an ongoing touch-based gesture.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0142">In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer <b>180</b> includes metadata <b>183</b> with configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the event delivery system should perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event recognizers. In some embodiments, metadata <b>183</b> includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how event recognizers interact, or are enabled to interact, with one another. In some embodiments, metadata <b>183</b> includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate whether sub-events are delivered to varying levels in the view or programmatic hierarchy.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0143">In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer <b>180</b> activates event handler <b>190</b> associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of an event are recognized. In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer <b>180</b> delivers event information associated with the event to event handler <b>190</b>. Activating an event handler <b>190</b> is distinct from sending (and deferred sending) sub-events to a respective hit view. In some embodiments, event recognizer <b>180</b> throws a flag associated with the recognized event, and event handler <b>190</b> associated with the flag catches the flag and performs a predefined process.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0144">In some embodiments, event delivery instructions <b>188</b> include sub-event delivery instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without activating an event handler. Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event information to event handlers associated with the series of sub-events or to actively involved views. Event handlers associated with the series of sub-events or with actively involved views receive the event information and perform a predetermined process.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0145">In some embodiments, data updater <b>176</b> creates and updates data used in application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b>. For example, data updater <b>176</b> updates the telephone number used in contacts module <b>137</b>, or stores a video file used in video player module. In some embodiments, object updater <b>177</b> creates and updates objects used in application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b>. For example, object updater <b>177</b> creates a new user-interface object or updates the position of a user-interface object. GUI updater <b>178</b> updates the GUI. For example, GUI updater <b>178</b> prepares display information and sends it to graphics module <b>132</b> for display on a touch-sensitive display.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0146">In some embodiments, event handler(s) <b>190</b> includes or has access to data updater <b>176</b>, object updater <b>177</b>, and GUI updater <b>178</b>. In some embodiments, data updater <b>176</b>, object updater <b>177</b>, and GUI updater <b>178</b> are included in a single module of a respective application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b> or application view <b>191</b>.

For example, an image (e.g., icon), a button, and text (e.g., hyperlink) each optionally constitute an affordance.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0188">As used herein, the term &#x201c;focus selector&#x201d; refers to an input element that indicates a current part of a user interface with which a user is interacting. In some implementations that include a cursor or other location marker, the cursor acts as a &#x201c;focus selector&#x201d; so that when an input (e.g., a press input) is detected on a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touchpad <b>355</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> or touch-sensitive surface <b>451</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>) while the cursor is over a particular user interface element (e.g., a button, window, slider, or other user interface element), the particular user interface element is adjusted in accordance with the detected input. In some implementations that include a touch screen display (e.g., touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> or touch screen <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>) that enables direct interaction with user interface elements on the touch screen display, a detected contact on the touch screen acts as a &#x201c;focus selector&#x201d; so that when an input (e.g., a press input by the contact) is detected on the touch screen display at a location of a particular user interface element (e.g., a button, window, slider, or other user interface element), the particular user interface element is adjusted in accordance with the detected input. In some implementations, focus is moved from one region of a user interface to another region of the user interface without corresponding movement of a cursor or movement of a contact on a touch screen display (e.g., by using a tab key or arrow keys to move focus from one button to another button); in these implementations, the focus selector moves in accordance with movement of focus between different regions of the user interface. Without regard to the specific form taken by the focus selector, the focus selector is generally the user interface element (or contact on a touch screen display) that is controlled by the user so as to communicate the user's intended interaction with the user interface (e.g., by indicating, to the device, the element of the user interface with which the user is intending to interact). For example, the location of a focus selector (e.g., a cursor, a contact, or a selection box) over a respective button while a press input is detected on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touchpad or touch screen) will indicate that the user is intending to activate the respective button (as opposed to other user interface elements shown on a display of the device).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0189">As used in the specification and claims, the term &#x201c;characteristic intensity&#x201d; of a contact refers to a characteristic of the contact based on one or more intensities of the contact. In some embodiments, the characteristic intensity is based on multiple intensity samples. The characteristic intensity is, optionally, based on a predefined number of intensity samples, or a set of intensity samples collected during a predetermined time period (e.g., 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 seconds) relative to a predefined event (e.g., after detecting the contact, prior to detecting liftoff of the contact, before or after detecting a start of movement of the contact, prior to detecting an end of the contact, before or after detecting an increase in intensity of the contact, and/or before or after detecting a decrease in intensity of the contact). A characteristic intensity of a contact is, optionally, based on one or more of: a maximum value of the intensities of the contact, a mean value of the intensities of the contact, an average value of the intensities of the contact, a top 10 percentile value of the intensities of the contact, a value at the half maximum of the intensities of the contact, a value at the 90 percent maximum of the intensities of the contact, or the like. In some embodiments, the duration of the contact is used in determining the characteristic intensity (e.g., when the characteristic intensity is an average of the intensity of the contact over time). In some embodiments, the characteristic intensity is compared to a set of one or more intensity thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a user. For example, the set of one or more intensity thresholds optionally includes a first intensity threshold and a second intensity threshold. In this example, a contact with a characteristic intensity that does not exceed the first threshold results in a first operation, a contact with a characteristic intensity that exceeds the first intensity threshold and does not exceed the second intensity threshold results in a second operation, and a contact with a characteristic intensity that exceeds the second threshold results in a third operation. In some embodiments, a comparison between the characteristic intensity and one or more thresholds is used to determine whether or not to perform one or more operations (e.g., whether to perform a respective operation or forgo performing the respective operation), rather than being used to determine whether to perform a first operation or a second operation.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0190"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> illustrates detecting a plurality of contacts <b>552</b>A-<b>552</b>E on touch-sensitive display screen <b>504</b> with a plurality of intensity sensors <b>524</b>A-<b>524</b>D. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> additionally includes intensity diagrams that show the current intensity measurements of the intensity sensors <b>524</b>A-<b>524</b>D relative to units of intensity. In this example, the intensity measurements of intensity sensors <b>524</b>A and <b>524</b>D are each 9 units of intensity, and the intensity measurements of intensity sensors <b>524</b>B and <b>524</b>C are each 7 units of intensity. In some implementations, an aggregate intensity is the sum of the intensity measurements of the plurality of intensity sensors <b>524</b>A-<b>524</b>D, which in this example is 32 intensity units. In some embodiments, each contact is assigned a respective intensity that is a portion of the aggregate intensity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref> illustrates assigning the aggregate intensity to contacts <b>552</b>A-<b>552</b>E based on their distance from the center of force <b>554</b>. In this example, each of contacts <b>552</b>A, <b>552</b>B, and <b>552</b>E are assigned an intensity of contact of 8 intensity units of the aggregate intensity, and each of contacts <b>552</b>C and <b>552</b>D are assigned an intensity of contact of 4 intensity units of the aggregate intensity. More generally, in some implementations, each contact j is assigned a respective intensity Ij that is a portion of the aggregate intensity, A, in accordance with a predefined mathematical function, Ij=A&#xb7;(Dj/&#x3a3;Di), where Dj is the distance of the respective contact j to the center of force, and &#x3a3;Di is the sum of the distances of all the respective contacts (e.g., i=1 to last) to the center of force. The operations described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C-<b>5</b>D</figref> can be performed using an electronic device similar or identical to device <b>100</b>, <b>300</b>, or <b>500</b>. In some embodiments, a characteristic intensity of a contact is based on one or more intensities of the contact. In some embodiments, the intensity sensors are used to determine a single characteristic intensity (e.g., a single characteristic intensity of a single contact). It should be noted that the intensity diagrams are not part of a displayed user interface, but are included in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C-<b>5</b>D</figref> to aid the reader.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0191">In some embodiments, a portion of a gesture is identified for purposes of determining a characteristic intensity. For example, a touch-sensitive surface optionally receives a continuous swipe contact transitioning from a start location and reaching an end location, at which point the intensity of the contact increases. In this example, the characteristic intensity of the contact at the end location is, optionally, based on only a portion of the continuous swipe contact, and not the entire swipe contact (e.g., only the portion of the swipe contact at the end location). In some embodiments, a smoothing algorithm is, optionally, applied to the intensities of the swipe contact prior to determining the characteristic intensity of the contact. For example, the smoothing algorithm optionally includes one or more of: an unweighted sliding-average smoothing algorithm, a triangular smoothing algorithm, a median filter smoothing algorithm, and/or an exponential smoothing algorithm. In some circumstances, these smoothing algorithms eliminate narrow spikes or dips in the intensities of the swipe contact for purposes of determining a characteristic intensity.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0192">The intensity of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface is, optionally, characterized relative to one or more intensity thresholds, such as a contact-detection intensity threshold, a light press intensity threshold, a deep press intensity threshold, and/or one or more other intensity thresholds. In some embodiments, the light press intensity threshold corresponds to an intensity at which the device will perform operations typically associated with clicking a button of a physical mouse or a trackpad. In some embodiments, the deep press intensity threshold corresponds to an intensity at which the device will perform operations that are different from operations typically associated with clicking a button of a physical mouse or a trackpad. In some embodiments, when a contact is detected with a characteristic intensity below the light press intensity threshold (e.g., and above a nominal contact-detection intensity threshold below which the contact is no longer detected), the device will move a focus selector in accordance with movement of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface without performing an operation associated with the light press intensity threshold or the deep press intensity threshold. Generally, unless otherwise stated, these intensity thresholds are consistent between different sets of user interface figures.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0193">An increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity below the light press intensity threshold to an intensity between the light press intensity threshold and the deep press intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;light press&#x201d; input. An increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity below the deep press intensity threshold to an intensity above the deep press intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;deep press&#x201d; input. An increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity below the contact-detection intensity threshold to an intensity between the contact-detection intensity threshold and the light press intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as detecting the contact on the touch-surface. A decrease of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity above the contact-detection intensity threshold to an intensity below the contact-detection intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as detecting liftoff of the contact from the touch-surface. In some embodiments, the contact-detection intensity threshold is zero. In some embodiments, the contact-detection intensity threshold is greater than zero.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0194">In some embodiments described herein, one or more operations are performed in response to detecting a gesture that includes a respective press input or in response to detecting the respective press input performed with a respective contact (or a plurality of contacts), where the respective press input is detected based at least in part on detecting an increase in intensity of the contact (or plurality of contacts) above a press-input intensity threshold.

The device determines that the intensity of contact <b>562</b> peaked above the deep press intensity threshold (e.g., &#x201c;IT<sub>D</sub>&#x201d;). Contact <b>562</b> is maintained on touch-sensitive surface <b>560</b>. In response to the detection of the gesture, and in accordance with contact <b>562</b> having an intensity that goes above the deep press intensity threshold (e.g., &#x201c;IT<sub>D</sub>&#x201d;) during the gesture, reduced-scale representations <b>578</b>A-<b>578</b>C (e.g., thumbnails) of recently opened documents for App 2 are displayed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>F-<b>5</b>H</figref>. In some embodiments, the intensity, which is compared to the one or more intensity thresholds, is the characteristic intensity of a contact.

For example, representation <b>578</b>A is initially displayed in proximity of application icon <b>572</b>B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref>. As the animation proceeds, representation <b>578</b>A moves upward and representation <b>578</b>B is displayed in proximity of application icon <b>572</b>B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>G</figref>.

Thus, in some embodiments, the press input includes an increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press-input intensity threshold and a subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold that corresponds to the press-input intensity threshold, and the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold (e.g., an &#x201c;up stroke&#x201d; of the respective press input). Similarly, in some embodiments, the press input is detected only when the device detects an increase in intensity of the contact from an intensity at or below the hysteresis intensity threshold to an intensity at or above the press-input intensity threshold and, optionally, a subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact to an intensity at or below the hysteresis intensity, and the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the press input (e.g., the increase in intensity of the contact or the decrease in intensity of the contact, depending on the circumstances).</p><p id="p-0158" num="0198">For ease of explanation, the descriptions of operations performed in response to a press input associated with a press-input intensity threshold or in response to a gesture including the press input are, optionally, triggered in response to detecting either: an increase in intensity of a contact above the press-input intensity threshold, an increase in intensity of a contact from an intensity below the hysteresis intensity threshold to an intensity above the press-input intensity threshold, a decrease in intensity of the contact below the press-input intensity threshold, and/or a decrease in intensity of the contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold corresponding to the press-input intensity threshold. Additionally, in examples where an operation is described as being performed in response to detecting a decrease in intensity of a contact below the press-input intensity threshold, the operation is, optionally, performed in response to detecting a decrease in intensity of the contact below a hysteresis intensity threshold corresponding to, and lower than, the press-input intensity threshold.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0199">Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces (&#x201c;U&#x201d;) and associated processes that are implemented on an electronic device, such as portable multifunction device <b>100</b>, device <b>300</b>, or device <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0200"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>AF</figref> illustrate exemplary user interfaces for managing a communication session, in accordance with some embodiments.

Displaying changes in the visual indicator based on volume (or frequency) allows the user to visually see whether the participant is streaming live audio and a relative volume of the live audio, rather than requiring the user to turn on speakers or wear a headset. Providing improved visual feedback to the user enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to provide proper inputs and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device) which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0256">In accordance with some embodiments, while in the communication session and not displaying a keyboard on the display, the electronic device detects a first gesture (e.g., a swipe-up gesture on a touch-sensitive surface of the device). In response to detecting the first gesture, the electronic device displays (e.g., by sliding into view from a bottom portion of the display) a keyboard (e.g., for entering text messages in the communication session).</p><p id="p-0217" num="0257">In accordance with some embodiments, further in response to detecting the first gesture, the electronic device transitions display of one or more avatars of one or more participants of the communication session by concurrently: reducing sizes of the displayed one or more avatars of the one or more participants, changing shapes of the displayed avatars (e.g., from rectangular to circular) of the one or more participants, and changing locations (e.g., from a n-by-n grid (where n is not 1) to a 1-by-n grid (where n is not 1)) of the displayed avatars of the one or more participants. In some examples, one or more of the reducing of size, changing of shape, and changing of location effects occur while one or more of the effects do not occur, in response to detecting the first gesture. In some examples, in accordance with receiving a live media stream including live video from a participant, the respective avatar of the participant includes at least a portion of the received live video.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0258">In accordance with some embodiments, subsequent to transitioning display of one or more avatars of one or more participants in response to the first gesture, the electronic device detects a second gesture (e.g., <b>656</b><i>c</i>, a swipe-down gesture on a touch-sensitive surface of the device, different from the first gesture). In response to detecting the second gesture (e.g., <b>656</b><i>c</i>), the electronic device transitions display of the one or more avatars (e.g., <b>668</b><i>a</i>, <b>670</b><i>a</i>, <b>672</b><i>a</i>) of the one or more participants by concurrently: enlarging sizes of the displayed one or more avatars of the one or more participants, changing shapes of the displayed avatars (e.g., from circular to rectangular) of the one or more participants, and changing locations (e.g., from a 1-by-n grid (where n is not 1) to an n-by-n grid (where n is not 1)) of the displayed avatars of the one or more participants. In some examples, one or more of the enlarging of size, changing of shape, and changing of location effects occur while one or more of the effects do not occur, in response to detecting the second gesture. In some examples, in accordance with receiving a live media stream including live video from a participant, the respective avatar of the participant includes at least a portion of the received live video. Automatically enlarging and rearranging the one or more avatars when space is available (e.g., when the keyboard is not displayed) provides the user with a better view of live video streams being received from other participants. Reducing the number of inputs needed to perform an operation enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0259">In accordance with some embodiments, the electronic device detects a third gesture (e.g., <b>604</b><i>m</i>, a tap gesture) at a location corresponding to a displayed avatar of a participant of the communication session. In response to detecting the third gesture (e.g., <b>604</b><i>m</i>), the electronic device enlarges the respective avatar of the participant. In some examples, in accordance with receiving a live media stream including live video from a participant, the respective avatar of the participant includes at least a portion of the received live video. In some examples, the respective avatar of the participant is made full screen. In some examples, in response to detecting the third gesture, avatars of other participants cease to be displayed.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0260">In accordance with some embodiments, the electronic device detects a user input (e.g., <b>604</b><i>k</i>) for enabling captions. In response to detecting the user input (e.g., <b>604</b><i>k</i>) for enabling captions, the electronic device displays captions (e.g., <b>620</b><i>c</i>) of audio feeds of one or more participants of the communication session. In some examples, the device detects a user input for disabling captions and, in response, ceases to display captions of audio feeds of participants of the communication session. In some examples, the audio feed of the participants are played concurrently with the display of the captions. In some examples, the audio feed is transcribed by the electronic device to produce the captions. In some examples, the captions are received by the electronic device for display. In some examples, other participants of the communication session can cause captions to be displayed (or cease to be displayed) on the electronic device during the communication session. For example, captions (e.g., <b>620</b><i>c</i>) are helpful to enable the user of the electronic device to participant in the communication session when the user is in a quiet environment, such as in a library. In some examples, the user input for enabling captions corresponds to a particular participant and the device enables captions for that participants without changing the captioning status of other participants.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0261">In accordance with some embodiments, in response to receiving user input (e.g., <b>604</b><i>h</i>) activating one of the first affordance (e.g., <b>612</b><i>a</i>) and the second affordance (e.g., <b>612</b><i>b</i>), the electronic device initiates display of a countdown (e.g., <b>614</b>) for initiating the live streaming session. Transmitting the audio or video in the live media stream to the one or more participants (other than the user of the electronic device) of the communication session occurs subsequent to (and in response to) completion of the displayed countdown (e.g., the countdown starting at 10 and the transmitting starting with the countdown starts at <b>0</b>). Displaying a countdown before beginning to stream provides the user with feedback about when the live media streaming will begin and allows the user to prepare for live media streaming. Providing improved visual feedback to the user enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to provide proper inputs and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device) which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0262">Note that details of the processes described above with respect to method <b>700</b> (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A-B</figref>) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the methods described below.

In accordance with some embodiments, transmitting the outgoing live media stream of the second type (e.g., audio+video) includes: transmitting images detected using the one or more camera sensors, and transmitting audio detected using the one or more microphones. Thus, live media streams include capturing live audio/video from the electronic device's environment and transmitting them to other participants.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0272">In accordance with some embodiments, while transmitting live video, the electronic device displays, on the display, the live video (e.g., <b>624</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>R</figref>).

Displaying the live video that is being transmitted provides the user with feedback about the content of the video that is being transmitted. This enables the user to more easily adjust a camera that is being used to capture the live video. Providing improved visual feedback to the user enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to provide proper inputs and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device) which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0273">In accordance with some embodiments, the one or more cameras includes a plurality of cameras including a first camera and a second camera.

Further while detecting and displaying the first images, the electronic device detects activation (e.g., <b>604</b><i>l</i>) of the affordance (e.g., <b>624</b><i>c</i>) for switching cameras. In response to detecting activation (e.g., <b>604</b><i>l</i>) of the affordance (e.g., <b>624</b><i>c</i>) for switching cameras, the electronic device detects, using the second camera and without using the first camera, second images. Further in response to detecting activation (e.g., <b>604</b><i>l</i>) of the affordance (e.g., <b>624</b><i>c</i>) for switching cameras, the electronic device transmits the second images to one or more participants of the communication session (and optionally displays the second images on the display without transmitting the first images or displaying the first images on the display). Thus, the electronic device displays an affordance for switching cameras. When activated, the electronic device changes the source of video transmitted to participants of the communication session and changes the source of video displayed on the display. A single input that changes both the source of video transmitted and the source of video displayed reduces the number of inputs needed to provide the operations.

Such personal information data can include demographic data, location-based data, telephone numbers, email addresses, twitter IDs, home addresses, or any other identifying or personal information.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0297">The present disclosure recognizes that the use of such personal information data, in the present technology, can be used to the benefit of users. For example, the personal information data can be used to connect users for video calls. Further, other uses for personal information data that benefit the user are also contemplated by the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0298">The present disclosure contemplates that the entities responsible for the collection, analysis, disclosure, transfer, storage, or other use of such personal information data will comply with well-established privacy policies and/or privacy practices. In particular, such entities should implement and consistently use privacy policies and practices that are generally recognized as meeting or exceeding industry or governmental requirements for maintaining personal information data private and secure. Such policies should be easily accessible by users, and should be updated as the collection and/or use of data changes. Personal information from users should be collected for legitimate and reasonable uses of the entity and not shared or sold outside of those legitimate uses. Further, such collection/sharing should occur after receiving the informed consent of the users. Additionally, such entities should consider taking any needed steps for safeguarding and securing access to such personal information data and ensuring that others with access to the personal information data adhere to their privacy policies and procedures. Further, such entities can subject themselves to evaluation by third parties to certify their adherence to widely accepted privacy policies and practices. In addition, policies and practices should be adapted for the particular types of personal information data being collected and/or accessed and adapted to applicable laws and standards, including jurisdiction-specific considerations. For instance, in the US, collection of or access to certain health data may be governed by federal and/or state laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); whereas health data in other countries may be subject to other regulations and policies and should be handled accordingly. Hence different privacy practices should be maintained for different personal data types in each country.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0299">Despite the foregoing, the present disclosure also contemplates embodiments in which users selectively block the use of, or access to, personal information data. That is, the present disclosure contemplates that hardware and/or software elements can be provided to prevent or block access to such personal information data. For example, in the case of video conference services, the present technology can be configured to allow users to select to &#x201c;opt in&#x201d; or &#x201c;opt out&#x201d; of participation in the collection of personal information data during registration for services or anytime thereafter. In another example, users can select not to provide location information for services. In yet another example, users can select to not provide precise location information, but permit the transfer of location zone information.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0300">Moreover, it is the intent of the present disclosure that personal information data should be managed and handled in a way to minimize risks of unintentional or unauthorized access or use. Risk can be minimized by limiting the collection of data and deleting data once it is no longer needed. In addition, and when applicable, including in certain health related applications, data de-identification can be used to protect a user's privacy. De-identification may be facilitated, when appropriate, by removing specific identifiers (e.g., date of birth, etc.), controlling the amount or specificity of data stored (e.g., collecting location data a city level rather than at an address level), controlling how data is stored (e.g., aggregating data across users), and/or other methods.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0301">Therefore, although the present disclosure broadly covers use of personal information data to implement one or more various disclosed embodiments, the present disclosure also contemplates that the various embodiments can also be implemented without the need for accessing such personal information data. That is, the various embodiments of the present technology are not rendered inoperable due to the lack of all or a portion of such personal information data. For example, content can be selected and delivered to users by inferring preferences based on non-personal information data or a bare minimum amount of personal information, such as the content being requested by the device associated with a user, other non-personal information available to the content delivery services, or publically available information.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
