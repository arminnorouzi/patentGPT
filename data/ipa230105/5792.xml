id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of removing a substrate from III-nitride based semiconductor layers with a cleaving technique. A growth restrict mask is formed on or above a substrate, and one or more III-nitride based semiconductor layers are grown on or above the substrate using the growth restrict mask. The III-nitride based semiconductor layers are bonded to a support substrate or film, and the III-nitride based semiconductor layers are removed from the substrate using a cleaving technique on a surface of the substrate. Stress may be applied to the III-nitride based semiconductor layers, due to differences in thermal expansion between the III-nitride substrate and the support substrate or film bonded to the III-nitride based semiconductor layers, before the III-nitride based semiconductor layers are removed from the substrate. Once removed, the substrate can be recycled, resulting in cost savings for device fabrication.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000"

Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This invention relates to a method of removing a III-nitride based substrate from III-nitride based semiconductor layers with a cleaving technique.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Many device manufacturers have used free-standing bulk GaN substrates to produce laser diodes (LDs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for lighting, optical storage, and other purposes. GaN substrates are attractive in that it is easy to obtain high-quality III-nitride based semiconductor layers having low defect densities by homo-epitaxial growth on GaN substrates.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, GaN substrates, which are typically produced using hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE), are very expensive. Moreover, nonpolar and semipolar GaN substrates are more expensive than polar (c-plane) GaN substrates. For example, 2-inch polar GaN substrates cost about $1,000/wafer, while 2-inch nonpolar or semipolar GaN substrates cost about $10,000/wafer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As a result, researchers have investigated removing III-nitride based semiconductor layers from GaN substrates after the device is manufactured. Such a technique would result in a GaN substrate that can be recycled, which would provide a very cheap and high quality GaN substrate for customers.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is easy to remove epitaxial layers from a foreign substrate, such as sapphire/GaN, Si/GaN, etc., at a hetero-interface using laser ablation or other techniques. However, GaN substrates and III-nitride based semiconductor layers lack a hetero-interface, which makes it difficult to remove the III-nitride based semiconductor layers from GaN substrates.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Consequently, there is a need for a technique that removes III-nitride based semiconductor layers from III-nitride based substrates or layers in an easy manner.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one previous technique, a GaN layer is spalled by a stressor layer of metal under tensile strain. See, e.g., Applied Physics Express 6 (2013) 112301 and U.S. Pat. No. 8,450,184, both of which are incorporated by reference herein. Specifically, this technique uses spalling in the middle of the GaN layer.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, surface morphology on a spalling plane is rough and this technique cannot be controlled at the spalling position. Moreover, this removal method may damage the semiconductor layers due to excess bending in the layer that is being removed, which may result in cracks in unintended directions. Thus, it is necessary to reduce any such damage and surface roughness.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another conventional technique is the use of photoelectrochemical (PEC) etching of sacrificial layers to remove device structures from GaN substrates, but this takes a long time and involves several complicated processes. Moreover, the yield from these processes have not reached industry expectations.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Thus, there is a need in the art for improved methods of removing III-nitride based substrates from III-nitride based semiconductor layers, especially where GaN thin films are grown on GaN substrates. The present invention satisfies this need.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">To overcome the limitations in the prior art described above, and to overcome other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding this specification, the present invention discloses a method of removing a III-nitride substrate from III-nitride based semiconductor layers with a cleaving technique. The method uses epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) of the III-nitride based semiconductor layers on a growth restrict mask or layer, the application of stress to the III-nitride based semiconductor layers due to differences in thermal expansion between the III-nitride substrate and a support substrate or film contacted to the III-nitride based semiconductor layers, as well as cleaving of the III-nitride based semiconductor layers from a cleaving point on a nonpolar (m-plane) growth surface on the III-nitride based substrate. Once removed, the III-nitride based substrates can be recycled, resulting in cost savings for device fabrication. The method provides advantages in the fabrication of both laser diodes and light-emitting diodes: easy removal of the III-nitride based substrates, little damage to the III-nitride based semiconductor layers, smooth cleaving surfaces, and short processing time.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of

embodiment, reference is made to a specific embodiment in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The present invention discloses a method for removing a III-nitride based substrate from epitaxially-grown III-nitride based semiconductor layers using a foreign or hetero-substrate as a support substrate, and specifically, a method of removing a III-nitride based substrate from III-nitride based semiconductor layers with a cleaving technique, so that the III-nitride based substrate can be recycled.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As long as it enables growth of a III-nitride layer through a growth restrict mask, any III-nitride based substrate, such as GaN, may be used. In alternative embodiments, a foreign or hetero-substrate, such as sapphire (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), SiC, LiAlO<sub>2</sub>, Si, etc., may be substituted for the III-nitride based substrate.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The III-nitride based semiconductor layers and the III-nitride based substrate refer to any composition or material related to (B, Al, Ga, In)N semiconductors having the formula B<sub>w</sub>Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N where 0&#x2264;w&#x2264;1, 0&#x2264;x&#x2264;1, 0&#x2264;y&#x2264;1, 0&#x2264;z&#x2264;1, and w+x+y+z=1. Further, compositions and materials within the scope of the invention may further include quantities of dopants and/or other impurity materials and/or other inclusional materials such as Mg, Si, O, C, H, etc.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Island-like III-nitride based semiconductor layers are epitaxially grown on the III-nitride based substrate at an opening area and/or through an intermediate layer at the opening area. The quality of the III-nitride based semiconductor layers is extremely high, and a device comprised of the III-nitride based semiconductor layers is of extremely high quality. However, it is hard to separate the III-nitride based semiconductor layers from the III-nitride based substrate.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It has been discovered that the III-nitride based semiconductor layers can be removed from the III-nitride based substrate very easily using a cleaving technique at a cleaving point on a surface of the III-nitride based substrate.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">One technique is to use a growth restrict mask, which is a dielectric film or refractory metal, such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiN, HfO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MgF, AlN, etc., in this substrate removal technique. It is possible to use a multi-layer structure selected from the above materials, such as Si<sub>2</sub>/AlN, AlN/SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>/SiN, SiN/SiO<sub>2</sub>. The interface between the growth restrict mask and any subsequent III-nitride based semiconductor layers grown by ELO on the mask has a weak bonding strength.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The bonding area between the III-nitride based semiconductor layers and the III-nitride based substrate is controlled so that it is less than the device size. Thus, it is easy to remove the layers from the substrate.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, the island-like III-nitride based semiconductor layers do not coalesce with each other, and internal strain is released. This is to avoid any occurrences of cracks.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, these methods use characteristics of cleaving at an m-plane, which is the easiest plane among GaN planes to cleave. In alternative embodiments, other planes of the substrate may be used.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">This method also determines the cleaving point to use at the start of the cleaving technique. In one embodiment, the cleaving point is at an edge of the growth restrict mask on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">This method also dissolves the mask using a hydrofluoric acid (HF), buffered HF (BHF), or another etchant, before removing the substrate. Thereafter, the III-nitride based semiconductor layers are bonded to a support substrate using a low temperature melted metal and/or solder, wherein the metal is later dissolved by an etchant.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">It is possible to use support substrates which have a thermal expansion different from the III-nitride based substrate. Both substrates are then heated after bonding. Stress is applied to the III-nitride based semiconductor layers, which are bonded to the support substrate, due to the differences in thermal expansion between the substrates.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">If a film is used to remove the III-nitride based semiconductor layers from the substrate, the film is not always bonded to the III-nitride based semiconductor layers. The removal can be achieved by at least contacting the film with the semiconductor layers. The film may be a polymer film, which has already been commercialized for dicing. Using the film, the removal process can be performed repeatedly. In other words, even if the semiconductor layers cannot be removed in one step, this step can be performed several times. Many other removal methods are not repeatable.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">This stress is applied at the cleaving point between the III-nitride based semiconductor layers and the III-nitride based substrate. The cleaving starts from one side of the cleaving point, which is at an edge of the growth restrict mask, and proceeds to the opposite side of cleaving point.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The chip size, which is the width of the island-like III-nitride based semiconductor layers, generally is wider than the cleaving length along the cleaving surface. As a result, less force or pressure can be used to remove the semiconductor layers. This avoids degradation of the device and reduction in yields.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The cleaving technique uses a trigger to start the cleaving technique. The trigger may be the stress resulting from the differences in thermal expansion, but other triggers may be used as well. For example, mechanical force, such as ultra-sonic waves, can be used as the trigger for the cleaving technique.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">If mechanical forces are used, removal of the III-nitride based substrate is achieved quickly and with very weak stress due to cleaving of the m-plane. Furthermore, the cleaving point may be a wedge shape, which simplifies the cleaving. The shape of the cleaving point is important to achieve a high yield.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Moreover, when the III-nitride based semiconductor layers are removed from the substrate, force can be applied using the differences of the thermal expansion between the film or support substrate and the semiconductor layers. This has the following advantages: 1) the force is applied uniformly; and 2) the strength and speed of the force can be controlled by changing the temperature. Thus, this method can be easily adopted for mass production.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Another aspect that must be considered when using the cleavability to remove the semiconductor layers from the substrate is how to apply the impact uniformly and adequately to the semiconductor layers. Even if the cleave length is wide, a device removed utilizing the cleavability of the GaN crystal needs the impact to start cleaving. It is effective to utilize the differences of the thermal expansion coefficient, so that the force can be applied uniformly to the semiconductor epilayer. If polymer films are used, the differences in the thermal expansion coefficient between the polymer film and the semiconductor layer are large, which makes the force strong.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Another way to use polymer films is that the polymer films can be expanded in one direction in order to remove the semiconductor layer without temperature change. Expanding the polymer films can apply the impact to the cleaving point.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Using these methods, device layers can be easily removed from the III-nitride based substrates and wafers, including wafers of large size, e.g., over 2 inches. For devices needing AlGaN layers, this is very useful, especially in the case of high Al content layers.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Generally, the present invention describes a III-nitride based semiconductor device and a method for manufacturing the III-nitride based semiconductor device.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a first embodiment, the method comprises the steps of: forming a growth restrict mask with a plurality of opening areas directly or indirectly upon a substrate, wherein the substrate is a III-nitride based semiconductor; growing a plurality of island-like III-nitride based semiconductor layers upon the substrate using the growth restrict mask, such that the growth extends in a direction parallel to the opening areas of the growth restrict mask, wherein each of the island-like III-nitride based semiconductor layers form a device; depositing p-electrodes on an exposed surface of the devices; bonding the p-electrodes of the devices to a support substrate or contacting the p-electrode to a film; at least partially dissolving the growth restrict mask using a wet etching technique; separating the III-nitride based substrate from the devices using thermal expansion and a cleaving technique; depositing n-electrodes on a surface of the devices exposed by the cleaving; and separating the devices by dividing the support substrate.

Thus, it is easy to peel the island-like III-nitride based semiconductor layers <b>109</b> from the GaN-based substrate <b>101</b> using the support substrate <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Another technique is to dip the structure into a solvent for wet etching to remove the substrate <b>101</b>. In one embodiment, the growth restrict mask <b>102</b> is SiO<sub>2</sub>, which is dissolved using BHF, HF, or another etchant, before removing the GaN-based substrate <b>101</b>. The merit of this technique is that there is no mechanical damage when the substrate <b>101</b> is removed (very gently), and a wide area of SiO<sub>2 </sub>is dissolved by the solvent very easily and quickly.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Thereafter, the structure is heated to separate the support substrate <b>201</b> and devices <b>110</b> from the III-nitride based substrate <b>101</b>.

However, it is not necessary that the island-like III-nitride based semiconductor layers be separated.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0267">Also, as the growth restrict mask and the III-nitride based semiconductor layer are not bonded chemically, the stress in the III-nitride based semiconductor layer can be relaxed by a slide caused at the interface between the growth restrict mask and the III-nitride based semiconductor layer.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0268">Also, the existence of gaps between each of the island-like III-nitride based semiconductor layers results in the substrate having rows of a plurality of island-like III-nitride based semiconductor layers, which has flexibility, and therefore, it is easily deformed when external force is applied and can be bended.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0269">Therefore, even if there occurs a slight warpage, curvature, or deformation in the substrate, this can be easily corrected by a small external force, to avoid the occurrence of cracks. As a result, the handling of substrates by vacuum chucking is possible, which makes the manufacturing process of the semiconductor devices more easily carried out.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0270">As explained, island-like III-nitride based semiconductor layers made of high quality semiconductor crystal can be grown by suppressing the curvature of the substrate, and further, even when the III-nitride based semiconductor layer is very thick, the occurrences of cracks, etc., can be suppressed, and thereby a large area semiconductor device can be easily realized.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0271">Finally, the present invention may be used to fabricate different opto-electronic device structures, such as a light-emitting diode (LED), laser diode (LD), Schottky barrier diode (SBD), or metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistor (MOSFET). The present invention may also be used to fabricate other opto-electronic devices, such as micro-LEDs, vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs), edge-emitting laser diodes (EELDs), and solar cells.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Conclusion</heading><p id="p-0258" num="0272">This concludes the description of the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
