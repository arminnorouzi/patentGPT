As another example, server <b>101</b> (and/or user device <b>102</b>) may transmit one or more electronic documents (e.g., a customs clearance form) to a government agent (e.g., the customs agency of the destination country) such that the government agent may receive the document before the package arrives at the customs agency to expediate the clearance process.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart of an exemplary process <b>700</b> for generating an electronic document, consistent with some embodiments of the present disclosure. While the description of process <b>700</b> are provided in connection with server <b>101</b>, one having ordinary skill in art would understand that one or more steps of process <b>700</b> may be performed by another component of system <b>100</b> (e.g., user device <b>102</b>, third-party device <b>103</b>, etc.). For example, user device <b>102</b> may populate one or more fields of the one or more electronic documents based on a response to an inquiry received by user device <b>102</b>. It is also contemplated that one or more of the steps of process <b>700</b> may be performed by any of server <b>101</b>, user device <b>102</b>, or third-party device <b>103</b>, and one or more of the other steps may be performed by a different one of server <b>101</b>, user device <b>102</b>, or third-party device <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">At step <b>701</b>, server <b>101</b> may be configured to cause a display of a user device to present a user interface. The user interface may include an inquiry (e.g., request for information) related to an item to be shipped. For example, server <b>101</b> may provide a webpage accessible by user device <b>102</b> via network <b>104</b>. The webpage may include a user interface that can be presented in a display associated with user device <b>102</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, server <b>101</b> may be configured to present graphical user interface <b>300</b> to user device <b>102</b>, which may include one or more questions related to an item to be shipped. By way of example, graphical user interface <b>300</b> may include three questions in area <b>310</b> related to a thermometer to be shipped (e.g., &#x201c;What type of thermometer are you shipping?&#x201d;, &#x201c;What is the primary material this thermometer is made from?&#x201d;, &#x201c;What is the intended use of this thermometer?&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, the inquiry presented in the user interface may include one or more of: a question related to the item (e.g., a product size, a product weight, a product material, a product grade, etc.), a question related to the sender (e.g., the identity of the sender, the shipping address, the shipping zip code, the contact information, etc.), a question related to the recipient (e.g., the destination address, the destination country, the identity of the recipient, the contact information, etc.), and a question related to the shipping payment (e.g., the identity of the paying party (e.g., the sender or the recipient being responsible for the shipping payment), the payment method, etc.).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">At step <b>702</b>, server <b>101</b> may be configured to receive, via the user interface, a response to the inquiry. For example, the user may enter information in response to the questions via an input device (e.g., input device <b>205</b>) associated with user device <b>102</b> via graphical user interface <b>300</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The information may be received by server <b>101</b> (and/or user device <b>102</b>). By way of example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, server <b>101</b> (and/or user device <b>102</b>) may be configured to receive the response (e.g., &#x201c;Digital,&#x201d; &#x201c;Other,&#x201d; &#x201c;Clinical/Medical&#x201d;) from the user via graphical user interface <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">At step <b>703</b>, server <b>101</b> may be configured to analyze the response to identify one or more electronic documents for shipping the item. For example, server <b>101</b> may employ a rule-based model for identifying one or more electronic documents based on the received response. Alternatively or additionally, server <b>101</b> may identify one or more electronic documents based on the received response using a machine-learning algorithm or a neural network for identifying electronic documents for shipping an item similar to the item to be shipped in this order.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, server <b>101</b> may also be configured to obtain one or more identified electronic documents (e.g., a blank electronic document) from a local storage device (e.g., storage device <b>203</b>) and/or database <b>105</b> via network <b>104</b>. Alternatively or additionally, server <b>101</b> (and/or user device <b>102</b>) may request one or more identified electronic documents from the user and/or a third-party. By way of example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> (which is a schematic representation of an exemplary graphical user interface <b>410</b>), server <b>101</b> may present graphical user interface <b>410</b> listing three electronic documents to be provided in connection with the shipping of the item, including, for example, a commercial invoice, a United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) statement, and a destination control statement.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">At step <b>704</b>, server <b>101</b> may be configured to cause the user interface to present the one or more electronic documents (or a portion of an electronic document). For example, server <b>101</b> may cause the user interface to present an electronic document that is obtained from a document database. In some embodiments, server <b>101</b> (and/or user device <b>102</b>) may present various options for the user to provide one or more identified documents. For example, server <b>101</b> (and/or user device <b>102</b>) may present a few options in graphical user interface <b>410</b> for the user to provide a certificate of conformity, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. By way of example, graphical user interface <b>410</b> may present a first option to fill in the information needed to complete the certificate of conformity by starting from shipping details, a second option of using a document stored in a document library (which may be stored in a local storage associated with user device <b>102</b> and/or server <b>101</b>, or a remote database such as database <b>105</b>), a third option for requesting the document from a third-party (e.g., the recipient of the package), and a fourth option of uploading the document.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The user may select one of the options for complete the document via graphical user interface <b>410</b>. For example, the user may select the second option of using a document stored in a document library via graphical user interface <b>420</b>, which may lead server <b>101</b> (and/or user device <b>102</b>) to present a user interface including one or more documents stored in a document library. For example, server <b>101</b> (and/or user device <b>102</b>) may present an exemplary graphical user interface <b>420</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> for the user to browse and/or operate one or more electronic documents. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, graphical user interface <b>420</b> may include information related to one or more electronic documents, such as the document name, the document type, the country involved in the document, the source of the document, the date of the document, etc. The user may click one of the documents via graphical user interface <b>420</b> to view additional information of the document. By way of example, the user may select one of the documents, namely, 2018_Certificate_Conformity via graphical user interface <b>420</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>, server <b>101</b> (and/or user device <b>102</b>) may also be configured to present an overlaid window <b>430</b> showing at least a portion of the selected document. The user may also select the document via graphical user interface <b>420</b> (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>) as the certificate of conformity for the present shipping order. Server <b>101</b> (and/or user device <b>102</b>) may further be configured to check the certificate of conformity and present an indication in graphical user interface <b>420</b> that the document is completed, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref>. In some embodiments, graphical user interface <b>420</b> may enable the user to modify, update, and/or replace one or more documents.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">At step <b>705</b>, server <b>101</b> may be configured to populate one or more fields of the one or more electronic documents based on the response to the at least one question. For example, as described elsewhere in this disclosure, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, graphical user interface <b>300</b> may present one or more questions related to the item to be shipped. Server <b>101</b> may receive the response to the one or more questions via graphical user interface <b>300</b> (e.g., &#x201c;Digital,&#x201d; &#x201c;Other,&#x201d; &#x201c;Clinical/Medical&#x201d; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Server <b>101</b> may also obtain an electronic document (e.g., a document template of a certificate of conformity) and populate one or more fields of the electronic document related to the type of the thermometer, the primary material of the thermometer, and/or the intended use of the thermometer (e.g., filling &#x201c;digital,&#x201d; &#x201c;other,&#x201d; &#x201c;clinical/medical&#x201d; into the relevant fields of the electronic document). Alternatively or additionally, server <b>101</b> may obtain other information related to the send, the recipient, and/or the item and populate one or more fields of an electronic document based on the obtained information. For example, server <b>101</b> may obtain data associated with the user (e.g., the sender) from a customer profile stored in a local storage device and/or database <b>105</b>. Server <b>101</b> may also populate one or more fields of one or more electronic documents based on the data associated with the user. Alternatively or additionally, server <b>101</b> may populate one or more fields of an electronic document to be completed based on the information extracted from a sample or template document. For example, server <b>101</b> may obtain a stored sample or template electronic document (e.g., one or more template documents illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>). Server <b>101</b> may also extract information from the sample electronic document and populate one or more relevant fields of the electronic document to be completed using the extract information.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, server <b>101</b> may present one or populated one or more fields to the user. By way of example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, server <b>101</b> may present graphical user interface <b>500</b> showing the populated fields of a USMCA statement according to the response received from the user (and/or other information). In some embodiments, server <b>101</b> may also highlight one or more fields that need the user's attention. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, graphical user interface <b>500</b> may highlight the EXAMPLE REQUIRED FIELD to be completed. Graphical user interface <b>500</b> may also provide an option for the user to flag the field if the user does not know the information, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, server <b>101</b> (and/or user device <b>102</b>) may provide an option to the user to coordinate with a third-party to fill in one or more fields of an electronic document. For example, server <b>101</b> (and/or user device <b>102</b>) may determine one or more fields of an electronic document to be filled and present graphical user interface <b>500</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref> for requesting relevant information from a third-party. By way of example, graphical user interface <b>500</b> may include information to be requested (e.g., &#x201c;Example Required Field,&#x201d; &#x201c;Short Required Field,&#x201d; &#x201c;Consignee Tax ID No.,&#x201d; &#x201c;Consignee Tax ID Type&#x201d;) from a third-party. In some embodiments, server <b>101</b> (and/or user device <b>102</b>) may also automatically fill in the contact information of the party from which the information is to be requested (e.g., the contact's name, a telephone number, an email address, etc.) if such information is available. Alternatively or additionally, Graphical user interface <b>500</b> may include one or more contact fields for the user to fill in and/or modify the contact information. Server <b>101</b> (and/or user device <b>102</b>) may also generate a request message (e.g., an email, a text message, etc.) requesting the information and transmit the request message to the third-party. The third-party may respond to the request message and provide the requested information via, for example, third-party device <b>103</b>. For example, the third-party may transmit a reply message to server <b>101</b> (and/or user device <b>102</b>), which may include the requested information, in response to the received request message via third-party device <b>103</b>. Alternatively or additionally, the third-party may go to a webpage associated with server <b>101</b> based on a link included in the received message and provide the requested information via the webpage.
