CART cells are generally made from patient-derived T-lymphocytes, which are re-engineered in the laboratory to express a tumor antigen-recognizing chimeric receptor together with costimulatory molecules. CART cells are then expanded in vitro and infused back to the patients for tumor targeting and attacking.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Since the development of the first generation of CAR-T in 1989, CAR-T-based cancer immunotherapy has made significant progress. In August 2017, Novartis' CAR-T cell Kymriah was approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States for treatment of relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in patients aged up to 25 years, becoming the world's first autologous cell therapy and marking a milestone in the development history of the CAR-T cell therapy. Two months later, Yescarta, the second CAR-T therapy developed by Kite Pharma Company (acquired by Gilead), was also approved for marketing. It was the first CART therapy approved for the treatment of specific types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although the first-generation CD3&#x3b6; chain-based CART cells exhibit anti-tumor cytotoxicity by T cell activation, the lack of costimulatory signal, the poor in vivopersistence, and limited secretion of cytokines dampened the long-term anti-tumorefficacy. The second-generation CAR incorporates intracellular domain of a costimulatory signal molecules (CD28 or 4-1BB) on the basis of the first-generation CAR, providing two signals for T cell activation. The co-stimulation of B7/CD28 or 4-1BBL/CD137 in the intracellular signal causes continuous proliferation of T lymphocytes, elevated secretion of IL-2 and IFN-&#x3b3;, resulting in increased in vivo persistence as well as enhanced anti-tumor efficacy [Dotti G. et al. CD28 costimulation improves expansion and persistence of chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells in lymphoma patients. J Clin Invest, 2011, 121(5): 1822-1826.]. Based on the second-generation CAR, the third-generation CAR further incorporates an additional intracellular domain of costimulatory signal molecule, for example a secondary signal molecule 4-1 BB fused between costimulatory domain CD28 and an ITAM signal chain. The third-generation CAR-engineered T cells exhibit better effector function and in vivo persistence. Different from the previous three generations, the fourth generation is additionally engineered to secrete a transgenic cytokine like IL-12 on the basis of the second generation, also known as T cells redirected for antigen-unrestricted cytokine-initiated killing (TRUCKs for short). TRUCKs not only enhance T cell activation, but also attract and activate innate immune cells, thereby destroying antigen-negative cancer cells. TRUCKs may also be used for therapy of viral infections, metabolic diseases, autoimmune diseases and the like.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The CART cells that are disclosed so far all contain an artificially introduced CD3-mediated first signal. From the second-generation CAR to the fourth-generation CAR, two signals required for T cell activation are combined, thereby bypassing the obstacle that T cells are unable to activate due to the lack of second signal such as B7 on tumor cells, greatly enhancing T cell activation, proliferation, killing ability, and therapeutic efficacy. However, increased costimulatory signals in CAR may reduce the threshold required for effector cell activation, leading to the activation of genetically modified T lymphocyteseven in conditions of a low level of antigens or even without antigen triggering, which could result in the release of high-level cytokines (cytokine storm). In order to solve the risk, researchers introduce suicide systems such as HSV-TK or CD20-Rituximab into the CAR-modified T cells as a break to avoid excessive proliferation of T cells. However, the &#x201c;waterfall&#x201d; effect triggered by the off-target activation of CART cells is so fast that these suicide systems may not be able to work in time. Although the scheme of reducing the infusion dosage of CART cells reduced the risk to a certain extent, it also leads to a decline in therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, there is an urgent need in the field to optimize the components of the CAR system to improve the clinical safety of CAR-mediated adoptive cell therapy for tumors.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is generally acknowledged that T cell activation requires the stimulation of two signals, namely two signals related to T cell activation. Among them, the TCR-CD3 complex on the surface of T cells binds to the antigen peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule to provide the first signal of T cell activation, while the costimulatory molecule (such as CD28) on the surface of T cells binds to its corresponding ligand (such as B7), providing the second signal for T cell activation, which is essential for T cell proliferation and survival. Other costimulatory molecules such as 4-1 BB, OX40, GITR, CD40, ICOS, CD152 (CTLA4), CD223(LAG3), CD273(PD-L2), CD274(PD-L1), NKG2C, NKG2D, SLAMF7, and B7-H3 are also considered to have similar functions to that of CD28. The prevailing view that the loss or decreased expression of the first signal stimulation source (such as MHC) molecules on tumor cells may not effectively provide signals required for T cell activation, resulting in the inability of T cells to effectively activate and proliferate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Tumor marker recognizing TCR-CD3 complexes naturally occurring on the surface of tumor infiltrating T cells would provide natural primary signal (signal 1) for T cell activation, while these T cells cannot always exert killing activity efficiently due to the immunosuppressive microenvironment within tumor tissues. These tumor-recognizing T cells are also found in peripheral blood. Current CARs of CART cells all contain artificially introduced first signal molecules such as scFv-CD3zeta, and the artificially introduced costimulatory molecule signal domains such as scFv-4-1 BB-CD3zeta or scFv-CD28. These tumor markers recognizing CART cells are activated by the first and the second signal, thereby exerting efficient killing activity, meanwhile, the proliferation and survival of the CART cells will further exert the killing activity. However, this mechanism may also cause CART to kill other normal cells expressing the same marker.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is found by the inventors that: when T cells from peripheral blood of healthy donors are artificially incorporated with CAR containing a costimulatory signal conduction domain (4-1 BB) while without a first signal conduction domain (CD3zeta), these signal 1 lacking CART cells could secret T cell activating factors such as IL-2 and IFN-&#x3b3; upon co-incubation with tumor cells in vitro, which further support the proliferation and survival of CART cells, indicating that the costimulatory signal of CART cells are activated. In a further experiment with CART cells harboring inducible cytokines expression element, not only secrete cell activating factors like IL-2 and IFN-&#x3b3;, but also the inducible cytokines were detected in the supernatant. It is inferred that tumor recognition molecules on CAR may activate the costimulatory signal after binding to the tumor antigen, namely the activation of the CART costimulatory signal may be independent of the existence of the first signal.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">T cells in peripheral blood from cancer patients contain a small population of T cells that naturally recognize tumor antigens, some of which are derived from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). It is further found by the inventors that, when the peripheral blood T cells are artificially engineered with CAR containing the costimulatory signal conduction domain while without the artificially introduced first signal conduction domain, the natural TCR-CD3 complex on the surface of the TIL-derived CART cells specifically recognizes tumor cells (specificity and safety), meanwhile, tumor recognition molecules on CAR could also bind to tumor cells, leading to activation of downstream engineered costimulatory signals, which produce efficient tumor killing and maintain the proliferation and survival of CART cells (effectiveness) in cooperation with the first signal. This design effectively solves the problem of hyperactivation with traditional CART cells (all containing the first signal of T cell activation, namely all or part of the signal domain of CD3, such as CD3zeta, and tumor recognition molecules carried by CAR, such as scFv) to normal tissues which express low levels of tumor related antigen due to the persistence of the first signal and the second signal. In addition to that, although most circulating CART cells that do not recognize the tumor antigens do not possess the first signal required for T cell activation, the tumor recognition molecules carried on its CAR bind to the tumor cells and thus activate the artificially incorporated costimulatory signal. When activated, these CART cells secrete T cell activating factors such as IL-2 and IFN-r which maintain the proliferation and survival of CART cells and further induce the expression of downstream secretory polypeptides (such as aPD-L1 scfv), which could further exert immunomodulatory functions (such as breaking immune tolerance).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, CART cells of the present disclosure have very important clinical application values: 1) As a delivery carrier that specifically targeting the tumor antigens, CART cells expressed secretory polypeptides to exert immune modulation in the tumor microenvironment; and 2) They effectively solves the overactive immune response of traditional CART cells (all containing the first signal of T cell activation, namely all or part of the signal domain of CD3, such as CD3zeta, and tumor recognition molecules carried by CAR, such as scFv) to normal tissues which express low level of tumor related antigens due to the persistence of the first signal and the second signal.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides the application of CAR-modified T cells in preparing drugs for cancer treatment.
