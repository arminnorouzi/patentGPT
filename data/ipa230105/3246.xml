Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, management of a suitable state of attachment regarding attachment objects that are attached to structural objects by bolts and nuts is primarily performed by visual inspection, and loosening of fastened bolts and nuts is visually confirmed. Inspection using match marks is performed, in order to perform this visual inspection easily and reliably. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref>, in a structure in which an attachment object <b>200</b> is fit over a bolt <b>201</b> passed through a structural object, nuts <b>203</b> and <b>204</b> of a locking double-nut arrangement are screwed onto the bolt <b>201</b> over a washer <b>202</b>, thereby attaching the attachment object <b>200</b>, and after confirmation of a suitable fastening state, match marks <b>200</b><i>m</i>, <b>202</b><i>m</i>, <b>203</b><i>m</i>, and <b>204</b><i>m </i>are applied to corresponding positions on the attachment object <b>200</b>, the washer <b>202</b>, and the nuts <b>203</b> and <b>204</b>. Thereafter, at when performing inspection, whether the positions of the match mark <b>200</b><i>m </i>of the attachment object <b>200</b>, the match mark <b>202</b><i>m </i>of the washer <b>202</b>, and the match marks <b>203</b><i>m </i>and <b>204</b><i>m </i>of the nuts <b>203</b> and <b>204</b> are matching at corresponding positions by up-close visual inspection, thus confirming whether or not there is any loosening of the nut fastening. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> illustrates a case of a suitable state in which there is no loosening of the nut fastening, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> illustrates a case of an unsuitable state in which a nut is loose.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also, there are methods for inspection at high places where close-up visual observation cannot be performed, such as attaching a camera to an extensible pole member and taking images to perform inspection, such as in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2017-181785, or attaching a camera to a flying object such as a drone and taking images, and receiving and confirming the taken images, such as in Japanese Patent No. 6619863.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, up-close visual inspection of the state of nut fastenings, inspection by taking images using a pole or flying object, or the like, requires a great amount of manpower and long inspection time, which is problematic in that inspection costs are high. Further, inspection methods such as close-up visual confirmation and confirmation of taken image by human eye incur risks of overlooking unsuitable states. Also, analyzing taken images using image analysis software to inspect suitable and unsuitable states necessitates using extremely expensive image analysis software, which is problematic in that inspection costs markedly rise. Accordingly, there is demand for a system by which suitable states and unsuitable states of attachment of attachment objects can be accurately comprehended, and inspection work can be performed in a short time at low costs.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides a management system for an attachment state of an attachment object, in which suitable states and unsuitable states of attachment of attachment objects can be accurately comprehended, and inspection work can be performed in a short time at low costs.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a management system for an attachment state of an attachment object according to the present invention, a sensor that is capable of detecting a value equivalent to stress of stress that is being loaded, or a predetermined value from which the value equivalent to stress can be calculated, a washer storage unit that stores identification information of a sensing washer, and a washer control unit that transmits the value equivalent to stress and the identification information of the sensing washer via a communication unit, are provided in the sensing washer that is interposed between a bolt and a nut that attach an attachment object to a structural object. A management processing device acquires the value equivalent to stress and the identification information of the sensing washer that are transmitted from the sensing washer, and presents the value equivalent to stress of the sensing washer having the identification information, or a stress value corresponding thereto, as relational information with respect to a reference value stored in a storage unit.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, presenting relational information of the value equivalent to stress of the stress by which the sensing washer is loaded and the reference value for the stress value enables suitable states and unsuitable states of nut fastening corresponding to the sensing washer to be accurately comprehended. Thus, suitable states and unsuitable states of attachment of the attachment object that is attached by the bolt and the nut can be accurately comprehended. Also, the management processing device acquires the value equivalent to stress and the identification information of the sensing washer that are transmitted from the sensing washer, and presents relational information, which enables the value equivalent to stress and the identification information of the sensing washer that are transmitted from the sensing washer to be received while traveling in an automobile in which the management processing device or the reader is loaded for example, and so forth, and inspection work can be performed in a short time at low costs. Also, transmitting the value equivalent to stress and the identification information of the sensing washer from the sensing washer via the communication unit enables application to high places and places in service for traffic, and accordingly the safety of inspection work of the attachment state of attachment objects can be improved. Also, the present management system can be used not only at the time of inspection work for the attachment state of attachment objects, but for installation completion testing immediately following attachment of the attachment object. Also, the work of applying conventional match marks can be done away with, and the amount of labor in the installation work to perform attachment of the attachment object suitably can be reduced. Also, the present management system can be applied to attachment objects already attached to structural objects by bolts and nuts via ordinary washers, by replacing the ordinary washers with the sensing washer. Also, in a case of the management processing device performing processing of acquiring the value equivalent to stress and the identification information of the sensing washer transmitted from the sensing washer, and storing the value equivalent to stress or a stress value corresponding thereto of the sensing washer having the identification information, in a storage unit periodically with predetermined intervals therebetween, quantitative values equivalent to stress or stress values corresponding to the sensing washer of this identification information can be automatically accumulated as a periodic inspection record, for example.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the management system for an attachment state of an attachment object according to the present invention, the management processing device compares the value equivalent to stress or the stress value corresponding thereto with the reference value, presents suitability information of a nut fastening corresponding to the sensing washer having the identification information as the relational information in a case in which the reference value is exceeded, and presents unsuitability information of a nut fastening corresponding to the sensing washer having the identification information as the relational information in a case of being no greater than the reference value.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, by presenting suitability information of nut fastening regarding a sensing washer having the identification information, suitability and unsuitability of the attachment state of the attachment object can be accurately and reliably comprehended, regardless of the level of skill of the manager.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the management system for an attachment state of an attachment object according to the present invention, the management processing device presents the value equivalent to stress or the stress value corresponding thereto with the reference value at the same time, as the relational information.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, by presenting the value equivalent to stress corresponding to the sensing washer having this identification information or the stress value corresponding thereto with the reference value at the same time, as the relational information, the manager can speedily and accurately recognize information relating to the attachment state of the attachment object, such as for example, the state of the nut fastening, whether maintenance of the attachment state of the attachment object is necessary or unnecessary at the current point in time, when the time at which maintenance of the attachment state of the attachment object is predicted to be necessary, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the management system for an attachment state of an attachment object according to the present invention, the sensing washer includes a strain element that is loaded with stress, and a strain sensor that is equivalent to the sensor and that is fixed to the strain element, and the washer control unit transmits a resistance value sensed by the strain sensor in accordance with deformation of the strain element, as the value equivalent to stress.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, the resistance value can be easily acquired as the value equivalent to stress of the sensing washer interposed between the bolt and the nut, and transmitted from the sensing washer.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the management system for an attachment state of an attachment object according to the present invention, the communication unit of the sensing washer is accommodated in a casing that is insulating, the sensing washer has a strain element that is made of metal and that is loaded with stress, and the communication unit is placed distanced from the strain element made of metal.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Accordingly, accommodating communication unit of the sensing washer in casing that is insulating can do away with attenuation of communication signals occurring in a case in which the casing is electroconductive, such as being made of metal or the like, and good communication performance can be secured. Also, placing the communication unit of the sensing washer so as to be distanced from the strain element that is made of metal can do away with attenuation of communication signals occurring in a case in which the strain element that is electroconductive and communication unit are in close proximity, and good communication performance can be secured.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the management system for an attachment state of an attachment object according to the preset invention, the casing of the sensing washer accommodating the washer storage unit and the washer control unit is provided at a position that is laterally deviated and flaring from the nut.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Accordingly, by providing the casing of the sensing washer so as to be laterally deviated and flaring from the nut, interference between the sensing washer and a nut screwed to an adjacent bolt attaching the attachment object, for example, can be prevented while securing accommodation space for the washer storage unit and the washer control unit in the sensing washer. Also, forming the casing of the sensing washer so as to be laterally deviated and flaring from the strain element, rather than reducing the size, enables the sensing washer to be manufactured at lower costs, and also facilitates visual comprehension that the sensing washer and the sensor are disposed at the nut fastening site.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the management system for an attachment state of an attachment object according to the present invention, electric power necessary for operations of the washer control unit of the sensing washer is supplied by wireless power transfer from a reader that transmits the value equivalent to stress and the identification information of the sensing washer that are transmitted from the sensing washer to the management processing device, or from the management processing device.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Accordingly, disposing a battery at the sensing washer side becomes unnecessary, and reduced size of the form of the sensing washer, reduced costs, and long life, can be realized.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an overall configuration of a management system for an attachment state of an attachment object in an embodiment according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a sensing washer, a bolt, and a nut that are used in the management system for an attachment state of an attachment object according to the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a perspective view illustrating an example of the sensing washer that is used in the management system for an attachment state of an attachment object according to the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a perspective view illustrating an example of the sensing washer that is used in the management system for an attachment state of an attachment object according to the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a partial perspective view illustrating a state in which an attachment object is attached to a structural object by the sensing washer, the bolt, and the nut that are used in the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an explanatory diagram for describing communication performed during inspection in the management system for an attachment state of an attachment object according to the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart showing a flow of attachment, periodic inspection, and maintenance work, of the attachment object, performed using the management system for an attachment state of an attachment object according to the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a conceptual explanatory diagram of inspection record data accumulated using the management system for an attachment state of an attachment object according to the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an explanatory diagram of an example of applying the management system for an attachment state of an attachment object according to the embodiment to an anchor bolt;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> is a diagram illustrating a case of a suitable state in which there is no looseness in a nut fastening in inspection using conventional match marks;

In this case, electric power necessary for operations of the washer control unit <b>31</b> of the sensing washer <b>30</b> may be supplied by wireless power transfer by the management processing device having the structure and functions of the reader <b>20</b>, thereby performing communication with the sensing washer <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Also, although the sensor module <b>36</b> is made up of the RF tag <b>37</b> and the sensing unit <b>38</b> in the above embodiment, a configuration made be made in which the RFID communication control circuit <b>42</b> of the RF tag <b>37</b> is connected to the strain sensor <b>33</b>, the RFID communication control circuit <b>42</b> that follows a predetermined control program acquires the identification information of the sensing washer <b>30</b> and a resistance value corresponding to the value equivalent to stress of the strain sensor <b>33</b> at the time of communication and wireless power transfer with the reader <b>20</b>, and transmits the identification information of the sensing washer <b>30</b> and the resistance value corresponding to the value equivalent to stress that are acquired to the reader <b>20</b> via the RFID communication unit <b>41</b>, in other words, a configuration in which the sensor module <b>36</b> is made up of the RF tag <b>37</b> alone.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Also, the form in which the casing <b>35</b> is provided at a position that is laterally deviated and flaring from the nut <b>70</b> is not limited to the racetrack-like form laterally deviated as to the fastening direction in the above example, and may be formed as appropriate. For example, a form in which the casing <b>35</b> has a fan-like form, and an arc side of the fan form is laterally deviated and flares to the outer side is also suitable. Note that the casing according to the present invention is not limited to a form provided at a position that is laterally flared, and a casing of a form that is annularly formed concentrically on an outer circumference of the strain element <b>34</b>, for example, may be used. Also, although a configuration is made in the above example in which the sensing washer <b>30</b> is disposed in place of an ordinary washer, both the sensing washer <b>30</b> and an ordinary washer may be interposed between the bolt <b>60</b> or <b>60</b><i>a </i>and the nut <b>70</b> or the like.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Also, in the above embodiment, the sensor module <b>36</b> is made up of the RF tag <b>37</b> and the sensing unit <b>38</b> of a passive type with no battery disposed in the sensing washer <b>30</b>, but a configuration may be made in which an active-type sensor module with a battery in the sensing washer <b>30</b> is provided, and the reader or the management processing device according to the present invention receives the identification information of the sensing washer <b>30</b> and the value equivalent to stress from the active-type sensor module by wireless communication.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The present invention can be used when inspecting the attachment state of attachment objects attached by bolts and nuts to structural objects, for example.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
