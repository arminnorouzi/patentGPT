The description sets forth the features of the present disclosure in connection with the illustrated embodiments. It is to be understood, however, that the same or equivalent functions and structures may be accomplished by different embodiments that are also intended to be encompassed within the scope of the disclosure. As denoted elsewhere herein, like element numbers are intended to indicate like elements or features.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in some embodiments, a camera system for determining the locations of one or more objects <b>105</b> includes a first laser <b>110</b> (e.g., a steerable laser or &#x201c;laser scanner&#x201d;) and a camera <b>115</b>, which includes a lens <b>120</b> and an array of photodetectors <b>125</b>. The array of photodetectors <b>125</b> may be arranged in rows and columns forming a rectangle, of which one column is illustrated.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In operation, the first laser <b>110</b> may be scanned, e.g., (i) swept horizontally across the field (e.g., the field of view of the camera <b>115</b>) if the laser projects a vertical line, or (ii) scanned in a two-dimensional pattern (e.g., a raster scan, or another scan pattern that covers the field of view of the camera <b>115</b>). When light reflects from an object <b>105</b> and into the camera <b>115</b>, the system may use triangulation to measure distance to the object. For example, the system may infer the distance to the object <b>105</b> from disparity information (e.g., from the angle between the direction of the outgoing laser beam and the direction of the reflected light received by the camera <b>115</b>). This angle may approach zero as the distance to an object <b>105</b> approaches infinity. The rate of change of the angle with distance to the object <b>105</b> may decrease with increasing distance to the object, and as a result the accuracy of the measurement may degrade significantly when the distance to the object is relatively large, e.g., greater than <b>10</b> times the lateral separation between the first laser <b>110</b> and the camera <b>115</b> or greater than <b>100</b> times the lateral separation between the first laser <b>110</b> and the camera <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the accuracy of distance measurements for distant objects may be improved by combining a direct time of flight distance measuring capability with the triangulation capability illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. In some embodiments, a second laser <b>130</b>, which may be a flash laser (capable of producing a flash of light with a rise time or fall time that is sufficiently short for accurate timing, e.g., a rise time or a fall time of between 0.01 ns and 100.0 ns). For example, if the photodetectors <b>125</b> are suitable for detecting the beginning (e.g., the rise) of the reflected pulse, then the difference between the time of the beginning of the transmitted pulse and the beginning of the receipt of the reflected pulse may be measured, and the distance to the object <b>105</b> from which the pulse reflected may be calculated by multiplying one-half of the time difference by the speed of light. In some embodiments a single laser, capable both of providing continuous illumination for performing a scan, and of producing a flash with a short rise time, is used both to measure distance using triangulation and to measure distance using a direct time of flight measurement. A system, such as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, which includes a camera and a system for measuring the distance to an object <b>105</b>, may be capable of measuring the position of the object in three dimensions, by measuring the direction to the object <b>105</b> from the position to which its image is projected, by the lens <b>120</b>, on the array of photodetectors <b>125</b>, and by measuring the object's distance from the camera system, e.g., using one or more of the methods described herein. As used herein, a &#x201c;direct&#x201d; time of flight measurement is one that measures the round-trip time of a pulse, as distinct from a system that, e.g., emits sinusoidally modulated light and compares the phase of the transmitted light with the phase of the light received after reflection from an object.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A system with both capabilities, a capability to measure distance using triangulation and a capability to measure distance using a direct time of flight measurement may operate as follows. The system may first perform a scan to measure the distance to each of one or more objects <b>105</b> in the field of view of the camera <b>115</b>. For objects <b>105</b><i>a </i>that are relatively close to the camera system, the accuracy of the distance measurement using triangulation may be acceptable. For objects <b>105</b><i>b </i>that are relatively distant from the camera system, however, the accuracy of the distance measurement using triangulation may be poor, although it may be sufficient for the camera system to be able to determine that the objects are too distant for triangulation to achieve acceptable accuracy. As such, the camera system may perform a follow-up measurement, using the direct time of flight measurement, when the distance measurement using triangulation indicates that the object is more distant than a threshold distance (with the threshold distance being, e.g., 10 times the lateral separation between the first laser <b>110</b> and the camera <b>115</b> or 100 vtimes the lateral separation between the first laser <b>110</b> and the camera <b>115</b>).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">To perform such a direct time of flight measurement, the second laser <b>130</b> may be aimed at the object <b>105</b> for which the direct time of flight measurement is to be performed (e.g., it may be aimed into a region of interest (ROI) in which the object is, according to the first measurement), the second laser may illuminate the object <b>105</b> with a flash, and the round-trip time of flight may be measured. The direct time of flight measurement for each such object may be time-gated (or, equivalently, range-gated), based on the distance measurement using triangulation, to reject ambient light more efficiently. Moreover, in some embodiments, only the pixel or pixels into which the light from the second laser is expected to reflect is or are enabled for the direct time of flight measurement. Such a pixel may be, e.g., (i) the same pixel that detected the reflection, of the light from the first laser, from the object during the scan, if the first laser and the second laser are co-located, or (ii) the pixel onto which the light is expected to be reflected from the second laser, based on the positions of the lasers and the camera, and the position of the object as calculated by the triangulation-based measurement.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a block diagram for a portion of a camera system having both triangulation capability and a direct time of flight distance measuring capability, in some embodiments. The camera <b>115</b> includes a pixel array <b>205</b>, each pixel of which includes a photodetector (of the array of photodetectors <b>125</b>) and a pixel circuit (each of which includes a first (e.g., fine) time-measuring circuit), as discussed in further detail below. The rows of the pixel array <b>205</b> are selected and reset by a row driver <b>210</b>, in turn controlled by a row decoder <b>215</b>. The row decoder receives a binary row-select signal and in response turns on a row select line, of a plurality of such lines (one for each row of the pixel array <b>205</b>) connected to the row driver <b>210</b>. The row driver includes an array of drive circuits, each connected to a respective row of the pixel array <b>205</b>, and configured to turn on switching transistors in the pixel circuits of the row, as discussed in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">An array of second (e.g., coarse) time-measuring circuits <b>220</b> (one for each of the columns of the pixel array <b>205</b>) is connected to the columns of the pixel array <b>205</b>. When the camera system is operating in scanning mode and a pixel in a currently selected row detects light reflected from an object <b>105</b>, the coarse time-measuring circuit connected to the column containing the pixel may be employed to infer, from the time at which an object was illuminated, what the direction of the beam from the first laser <b>110</b> (the direction of which is a known function of time) was when the light detected by the pixel was emitted by the first laser <b>110</b>. The triangulation algorithm may then employ (i) the direction of the beam when the light was emitted and (ii) the direction from which light is imaged onto the pixel, to estimate the distance to the object. A column decoder <b>225</b> may be employed to read out the contents of the coarse time-measuring circuits <b>220</b>, and of the fine time-measuring circuits in the pixel circuits, one at a time.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A bias generator <b>230</b> may generate bias voltages or currents employed by the pixel array <b>205</b>, a phase-locked loop <b>235</b> may generate a system clock for use by the digital circuits in the camera system, and a digital block <b>240</b> (which may be, or may be connected to, a processing circuit (discussed in further detail below)) may generate various digital control signals employed by the camera system. The components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be on a single die or on two dies, stacked one on top of the other. In a stacking design, only the photodiodes and a limited number of transistors in pixel may be on the top die, and the remainder of the circuitry may be on the bottom die. In a single die design, each pixel circuit may be immediately adjacent to the photodetector <b>125</b> to which it is connected.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a pixel <b>300</b> of the pixel array <b>205</b> (the pixel including a photodetector <b>305</b> and a pixel circuit) connected to a column readout circuit <b>310</b>. The photodetector <b>305</b> may be a single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) or an avalanche photodiode (APD). The pixel circuit includes an enable switch <b>315</b> (which may be used for time-gating the circuit, based on the distance measurement performed by triangulation), and a sensing circuit <b>320</b> (which may include an amplifier for amplifying the signal from the photodetector <b>305</b>, and a comparator for converting the signal to a digital pulse). The pixel circuit may further include a fine time-measuring circuit <b>325</b> (e.g., (i) a time to digital converter (TDC) or (ii) a time to charge converter (TCC) connected to an analog to digital converter). The output of the fine time-measuring circuit <b>325</b> may be a digital number, which may be stored in a register (MEM) <b>330</b>, to be read out later, through a second row select transistor <b>335</b> (RSEL2), by a sense amplifier <b>340</b> in the column readout circuit <b>310</b>. The signal from the sensing circuit <b>320</b> (which may be a short pulse) may be connected to a pulse-lengthening circuit <b>345</b> (which may be constructed using a latch) and fed to a column readout conductor <b>350</b> through a first row select transistor <b>355</b> (RSEL<b>1</b>). The gates of the first row select transistor <b>355</b> second row select transistor <b>335</b> may be driven by the row driver <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) The pulse-lengthening circuit <b>345</b> may lengthen the pulse sufficiently to be reliably transmitted to the coarse time-measuring circuit <b>360</b> in the presence of potentially significant loading by the column readout conductor <b>350</b>. In some embodiments, the fine time-measuring circuit <b>325</b>, instead of being connected directly to the output of the sensing circuit <b>320</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, is connected to the output of the pulse-lengthening circuit <b>345</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As mentioned above, the fine time-measuring circuit <b>325</b> may include a time to digital converter (TDC). The time to digital converter may include a counter configured to count clock cycles (e.g., cycles of the system clock) between a start trigger and an end trigger. For example, the system may send, to the time to digital converter, a start trigger when the second laser <b>130</b> emits a flash, and the sensing circuit <b>320</b> may send, to the time to digital converter, an end trigger, e.g., a pulse corresponding to light reflected from the object being detected. In other embodiments, the pulse corresponding to light reflected from the object being detected may be used as the start trigger, and a stop trigger (e.g., generated by the digital block <b>240</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>)) may be produced by the system clock a fixed amount of time after the emission of the flash by the second laser <b>130</b>. In the latter embodiment, the count stored in the register <b>330</b>, by the time to digital converter, when it receives the end trigger, may be proportional to the difference between (i) the amount of time between the emission of the flash by the second laser <b>130</b> and generation of the stop trigger and (ii) the round-trip travel time of the flash. The latter embodiment may consume less power than the former, e.g., in a case in which multiple flashes of the second laser <b>130</b> are used and most of the flashes do not result in a detection in the pixel, because when no detection occurs, the counter of the time to digital converter does not run.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A time to charge converter may be a circuit which (i) charges a capacitor with a constant current beginning when a start trigger is received and which (ii) then samples the voltage on the capacitor when an end trigger is received. The sampled voltage is then converted to digital form using an analog to digital converter. The constant current may be produced by a current mirror, the reference arm of which is based on the current flowing into a capacitor to which is a applied a voltage ramp, i.e., a linearly varying voltage, which may be generated by the bias generator <b>230</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The coarse time-measuring circuit <b>360</b> may have a precision of 100 ns, and the fine time-measuring circuit <b>325</b> may have a precision of 10 ns.
