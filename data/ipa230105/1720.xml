INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a printing apparatus, a printing method, and a storage

id="p-0003" num="0002">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-138494 discloses a technique in which, for ejected ink, a printing apparatus that ejects a reaction liquid that reacts with the ink obtains the displacement amount of the ejection position of the reaction liquid relative to the ejection position of the ink. In the technique disclosed in this Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-138494, as test patterns for obtaining the above-mentioned displacement amount, multiple patterns having different displacement amounts of the ejection position of the reaction liquid are used for patterns in which bleeding occurs if two inks are brought into contact on the print medium.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">By the way, in a printing apparatus that ejects a reaction liquid together with ink, in order to suppress the reaction liquid and the ink from contacting each other in the apparatus, the ejection head in which the ejection ports for ejecting the reaction liquid are formed and the ejection head in which the ejection ports for ejecting the ink are formed are configured separately, for example. Further, these ejection heads are arranged so as to be distant from each other. In this case, as compared with an integrated ejection head in which the ejection ports for ejecting the reaction liquid and the ejection ports for ejecting the ink are formed, the position accuracy between the ejection ports for the reaction liquid and the ejection ports for the ink is reduced due to the manufacturing tolerance or the like. In consideration of such position accuracy, for the test patterns for obtaining the above-described displacement amount, it was necessary to increase the patterns having different displacement amounts of the ejection position of the reaction liquid for the ejection amounts of ink.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention has

If printing is started, the printing apparatus <b>10</b> moves the head unit <b>24</b> to the printing start position and conveys the print medium P with the conveyance part to a position where printing can be performed with the head unit <b>24</b>. Next, based on print data, a printing operation of ejecting ink while moving (scanning with) the head unit <b>24</b> in the +X direction (or &#x2212;X direction) is performed, and, if the printing operation is completed, a conveyance operation of conveying the print medium P by a predetermined amount with the conveyance part is performed.

The ink containing the resin fine particles has a characteristic of improving scratch resistance (fixability). Therefore, it is desirable that the temperature of the heat application is equal to or higher than the minimum film forming temperature of the resin fine particles, and it is necessary to evaporate most of the liquid components such as the water-soluble organic solvent in the ink during the heat application.

Therefore, in the area <b>1804</b>, the bleeding areas occur at the boundary between the printing areas with the Y ink and the printing areas with the K ink, and, in the area <b>1802</b>, bleeding areas do not occur at the boundary.

Thereafter, while conveying the print medium P in the &#x2212;Y direction, the optical characteristics (optical reflectivity) of the areas <b>1802</b> and <b>1804</b> are measured by the optical sensor <b>200</b> at an interval of 2400 dpi, for example. Note that the measurement result is stored in a storage area together with the measurement position.

In the present embodiment, while scanning in the +X direction, the reaction liquid is ejected to the half area on the upstream side of the +Y direction in the detection pattern <b>1500</b>, and, further, the K ink and Y ink are ejected to the entire area of the detection pattern <b>1500</b>. Thus, if the ejection position of the reaction liquid is displaced in the Y direction, the boundary between the area <b>1802</b> and the area <b>1804</b> is also displaced in the Y direction according to the displacement. Therefore, in S<b>1706</b>, the boundary between the area <b>1802</b> and the area <b>1804</b> is obtained as the comparison position, based on the optical characteristics of the detection pattern <b>1500</b>.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">The measurement result of the detection pattern <b>1500</b> in S<b>1704</b> is as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>.

Then, as the overlap of the detection spot <b>310</b> with the area <b>1802</b> increases due to the movement of the print medium P in the &#x2212;Y direction, the optical reflectivity increases due to the influence of the area <b>1802</b>. Further, if the entire detection spot <b>310</b> enters the area <b>1802</b> due to the further movement of the print medium P in the &#x2212;Y direction, the above-described bleeding areas disappear and the characteristics of the Y ink appear, so that the optical reflectivity becomes constant at a high value. Therefore, it can be seen that the boundary between the area <b>1802</b> and the area <b>1804</b> has optical reflectivity of the intermediate value between the optical reflectivity at the time where the entire detection spot <b>310</b> is located in the area <b>1802</b> and the optical reflectivity at the time where the entire detection spot <b>310</b> is located in the area <b>1804</b>.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">Therefore, in S<b>1706</b>, first, the optical reflectivity of the measurement positions <b>1806</b> which are set in advance on the area <b>1804</b> side are obtained, and the average value R9 of the obtained optical reflectivity is obtained.

Although various publicly-known inks can be used as the two colors of inks, it is preferable to use two colors of inks having a predetermined amount or more of difference in optical characteristics.

Note that, as the fourth pattern <b>78</b> or the like, in a case where the pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is used, the size of each grid changes according to the absorbency of the print medium.
