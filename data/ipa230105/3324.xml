Previous manifolds can be manufactured using standard machining techniques and include standard fluid fittings and active flow regulators (e.g., actuators and valves) to control the flow characteristics of the fluid flowing through the manifold. Some fluid manifold applications require the fluid manifold be implemented in very small spaces, which is difficult to accomplish with previous fluid manifolds including standard fittings and active flow regulators. As such, a fluid manifold is desired that fits and operates in very small spaces while allowing for passive flow control to achieve the desired flow characteristics.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to one aspect of the disclosure, a low-profile fluid manifold is disclosed.

The first fluid input orifice includes a first internal threadless seal. The first and second fluid output orifices include a second and third internal threadless seal, respectively. The first fluid input line connects the first fluid input orifice to the fluid reservoir. The first fluid output line connects the fluid reservoir to the first fluid output orifice.
