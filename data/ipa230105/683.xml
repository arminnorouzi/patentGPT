The information may include directional information, such as the localization of a sound source for an individual with hearing disabilities.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An integral part of human sensory capability is the ability to localize sound sources. For example, the ability to localize sound sources allows for improved communication and increased safety. Communication may be improved, for example, by distinguishing sound sources by their location and by using location information to turn toward a person who is talking. Safety may be enhanced, for example, by localization in that an approaching hazard, such as an approaching car or animal, may be located before it becomes an imminent danger.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The human auditory system's ability to localize sound is believed to be based on several aspects of how sound reaches the left and right ears of the listener. Among these aspects are interaural time differences (ITD), interaural phase differences (IPD), and interaural level differences (ILD). The way in which a listener's head, shoulders, and ears filter sounds in a location and frequency dependent manner is referred to as the head-related transfer function (HRTF). The ability of a listener to localize sound by interpreting the HRTF is believed to be a learned response.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are several situations where humans may suffer from reduced localization capability or completely lose their ability to localize sound sources. One such situation is complete loss of hearing in both ears. In such individuals, no sounds can be heard, and thus no unaided localization can occur.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another situation is Single-Sided Deafness (SSD), where an individual suffers from complete hearing loss in one ear while retaining some level of hearing in the other ear. These individuals generally are unable to locate the source direction of a sound without some auxiliary information. Such auxiliary information may include visual cues and/or listening during physical movement. For example, a person with SSD may move around and make sound source estimations based on the strength of the sound being heard while in various locations or while facing various directions. However, such localization requires the sound source to occur over a substantial amount of time to enable the listener to move around. Individuals suffering from unilateral hearing loss (where one ear has some level of hearing loss, while the other ear is normal), may suffer from similar localization deficiencies as individuals with SSD.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Individuals suffering from bilateral hearing loss (where both ears have some level of hearing loss), may also have difficulty in localizing sound sources as compared to people with normal hearing.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, hearing aid users may have poorer ability to localize sound sources when wearing their hearing aids than without their hearing aids. Hearing aids typically reproduce sound such that the wearer perceives sound sources to be localized inside the head, and as such localization capabilities may be reduced or eliminated.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">When the ability to localize sound sources is reduced or lost, individuals may experience greater cognitive loading during conversation, particularly when the conversation is among more than two people. Furthermore, such individuals may be slower to react to environmental dangers as compared to individuals with normal localization capabilities. Moreover, individuals with reduced localization capabilities may find some social activities, such as sports or group activities, more difficult.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the following description, the invention is set forth in the context of apparatuses and methods for providing information to a user through tactile input to the user. Embodiments of tactile interface systems include systems to deliver location information, status information, and/or other information to a user through tactile output. The information may be delivered to a user through tactile outputs proximate to one or both ears of the user.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The user may, for example, be an individual who suffers from reduced sound source localization capabilities due to some hearing loss. The user may, for example, be an individual who wears hearing aids in both ears and suffers from reduced localization capabilities while wearing the hearing aids. In another example, the user may be a wearer of a crossover hearing aid system who may benefit from a tactile alert when a fault occurs with the crossover hearing aid system. In yet another example, the user may be an individual wearing headphones and/or a virtual reality head set where sound localization information may enhance the experience, such as playing computer games or watching immersive media. The user may be any other person who may benefit from receiving information, including directional information, through tactile input.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, a direction indication system includes a first unit configured to be worn at a first ear of a user and a second unit configured to be worn at a second ear of the user. The first unit includes a first tactile output device configured to deliver a tactile output to the first ear and a first communication module. The second unit includes a second tactile output device configured to deliver a tactile output to the second ear and a second communication module. The communication modules are configured to communicate with each other and/or other devices. The system further includes a processor configured to cause tactile output from at least one of the first and second tactile output devices indicative of a direction relative to the user.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one aspect, the first and second units may be configured to be worn behind the ear of a user. In another aspect, the first and second units may be configured to be worn in the ear canal of a user. The communication modules may communicate wirelessly and/or they may be interconnected with wiring.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The tactile outputs may be vibration generating devices. In an aspect, a tactile output at a left ear of the user may indicate a direction to the left side of the head of the user, and a tactile output at a right ear of the user may indicate a direction to the right side of the head of the user. In an aspect, simultaneous tactile outputs at both the left ear and the right ear indicate a direction behind the head of the user.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Frequencies of the tactile outputs may be independent of the frequency of any sound proximate to the direction indication system. In an aspect, the frequency of the tactile outputs may be a function of the elevation of the direction to be indicated relative to the head of the user.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an aspect, the first unit further comprises a third tactile output device, and the second unit further comprises a fourth tactile output device, and the direction indication system is operable to communicate a three-dimensional direction to the user wearing the direction indication system through tactile outputs.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another embodiment, a directional information communication system includes a first unit configured to be worn at a first ear of a user and a second unit configured to be worn at a second ear of the user. The first unit includes a first tactile output device and the second unit includes a second tactile output device. The directional information communication system further includes a processor configured to cause tactile output from at least one of the first and second tactile output devices according to directional information received by the directional information communication system.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The directional information communication system is operable to communicate directional information to a user wearing the directional information communication system by causing the first and second tactile output devices to produce tactile output that correspond to the directional information received by the directional information communication system.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another embodiment, an audio source localization aid system includes a first unit and a second unit. The first and second units are configured to be worn at the ears of a user. The first unit includes a first microphone, a first tactile output device, and a first communication module. The second unit includes a second microphone, a second tactile output device, and a second communication module. The communication modules are configured to communicate with each other. The audio source localization aid system further includes a processor configured to determine source location information of sound received by the audio source localization aid system based on sound received by the first and second microphones. The processor is also configured to cause tactile output from at least one of the first and second tactile output devices according to the determined source location information. In this regard, the audio source localization aid system is operable to communicate source location information to a user wearing the audio source localization aid system by causing the first and second tactile output devices to produce tactile output that correspond to the direction of sound received by the audio source localization aid system.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an aspect, the audio source localization aid system may be configured for a user with unilateral hearing loss where the second unit transmits to the first unit a data stream representative of sound received by the second microphone and the first unit produces an audio stream according to the data stream.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another aspect, the first and/or second units may be hearing aids capable of producing amplified audio streams.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another aspect, the audio source localization aid system includes a third microphone and is able to localize sounds based on sound received by the first, second, and third microphones. In a variation of the current aspect, the audio source localization aid system further includes a fourth microphone and is able to localize sounds based on sound received by the first, second, third, and fourth microphones.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a variation, the frequency of the tactile output from the tactile output devices may be independent of the frequency of sound received by the audio source localization aid system. In a variation, the frequency of the tactile output devices may be a function of the elevation of the source location relative to the head of the user.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another embodiment, a crossover hearing aid system includes a first unit and a second unit. The first unit includes a microphone, an audio output device, a tactile output device, and a communication module. The second unit includes a microphone, a tactile output device, and a communication module. The crossover hearing aid system further includes a processor configured to determine source location information of sound received by the hearing aid system based on sound received by the first and second units and to cause tactile output from at least one of the first and second units according to determined source location information. Furthermore, the second unit is operable to transmit a data stream to the first unit that is representative of sound received by the second unit, and the first unit is operable to produce an audio stream according to the data stream.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another embodiment, a hearing aid system includes a first hearing aid unit and a second hearing aid unit. The first hearing aid unit includes a microphone, an audio output device, a tactile output device, and a communication module. The second hearing aid unit includes a microphone, an audio output device, a tactile output device, and a communication module. The hearing aid system further includes a processor configured to determine source location information of sound received by the hearing aid system based on sound received by the first and second hearing aid units. The processor is also configured to cause tactile output from at least one of the first and second hearing aid units according to the determined source location information. The frequencies of the outputs of the tactile output devices may be independent from the frequency of sound received by the hearing aid system.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another embodiment, a hearing aid system includes a first unit that includes an audio output device and a first communication module, and a second unit that includes a microphone, a tactile output device, and a second communication module. The communication modules are configured to communicate with each other. The hearing aid system is configured to produce a tactile output by the tactile output device upon the second unit losing communication with the first unit. The hearing aid system may be a crossover hearing aid system.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another embodiment, headphones include a first unit configured to be worn at a first ear of a user and a second unit configured to be worn at a second ear of the user. The first unit includes a first tactile output device configured to deliver a tactile output to the first ear, and a first speaker configured to deliver a first audio stream. The second unit includes a second tactile output device configured to deliver a tactile output to the second ear. Such headphones may be used, for example, in conjunction with a video game system to provide directional information through tactile outputs. Such headphones may benefit users with SSD and/or users that have difficulty localizing sounds. In a variation, the second unit may include a second speaker configured to deliver a second audio stream. The headphones may be configured such that the first audio stream is the same as the second audio stream, thus the headphones may operate in a mono mode. Alternatively, the headphones may operate in a stereo mode. In another variation, the headphones may further include a processor configured to cause tactile output from at least one of the first and second tactile output devices indicative of a direction relative to the user. In another variation, the processor may be configured to determine the tactile outputs to be produced based on an audio stream provided to the headphones.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another embodiment, a video game system includes a video game console, a first unit configured to be worn at a first ear of a user, a second unit configured to be worn at a second ear of the user, and a processor. The first unit includes a first tactile output device configured to deliver a tactile output to the first ear. The second unit includes a second tactile output device configured to deliver a tactile output to the second ear. The processor is configured to cause tactile output from at least one of the first and second tactile output devices indicative of a direction relative to the user. Such a system may benefit users with SSD and/or users that have difficulty localizing sounds. This may be achieved by producing tactile outputs simultaneously with particular sounds to indicate a direction associated with those particular sounds. In this regard, a user with SSD may hear particular sounds and also receive information as to the location of the source of those particular sounds, enabling them to receive similar information as a normal hearing user playing in a stereo environment. In a variation, the first unit may include a first speaker configured to deliver a first audio stream, and/or the second unit may include a second speaker configured to deliver a second audio stream. The video game system may be configured such that the first audio stream is the same as the second audio stream, thus the video game system may operate in a mono mode. Alternatively, the video game system may operate in a stereo mode.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another embodiment, a method for transmitting directional information to a user includes wearing a first unit proximate to the right ear of a user and a second unit proximate to the left ear of the user, then obtaining a direction to be communicated to the user, and then producing a tactile output at at least one of the first unit and the second unit that is representative of the direction to be communicated to the user.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In another embodiment, a method for transmitting sound location information to a user includes receiving an audio event at a first microphone of a first unit being worn by the user proximate to a first ear of the user; receiving the audio event at a second microphone of a second unit being worn by the user proximate to a second ear of the user; calculating a direction of a source of the audio event based on the receiving at the first microphone and the receiving at the second microphone; and producing a tactile output at at least one of the first unit and the second unit that is representative of the calculated direction of the source of the audio event.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a variation, the current method for transmitting sound location information to a user may include receiving an audio stream by the first unit; transmitting data representative of the audio stream from the first unit to the second unit; and producing an audio output by the second unit according to the transmitted data.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an illustration of an embodiment of a directional indication system <b>100</b>. The directional indication system <b>100</b> is operable to indicate a direction to a user. The direction indicated may, for example, correspond to the direction of a sound source relative to the directional indication system <b>100</b>. In such a scenario, the directional indication system <b>100</b> may inform the user of the direction from which a sound is originating. Such an embodiment may be helpful to a user who does not have the ability to localize sound sources, such as an individual who has SSD, unilateral hearing loss, bilateral hearing loss, or is completely deaf.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The direction indicated may, in another example, correspond to the direction of an element in a virtual reality simulation. The directional indication may be part of a game. Such a game may be used to help a user learn to interpret the tactile outputs as directional indications. In another example of the indicated direction being an element in a virtual reality simulation, the indicated direction may be used to indicate the direction from which an attack originated in a video game.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The direction indicated may, in yet another example, correspond to the direction of a teammate, thus allowing team members to know each other's positions without audible communications. Such an embodiment may be useful in military scenarios. In still other embodiments, the directional indication system <b>100</b> may indicate the direction of a target to be achieved or a hazard to be avoided.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The directional indication system <b>100</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, comprises a left unit <b>101</b> and a right unit <b>102</b>. The left and right units <b>101</b>,<b>102</b> may be shaped and include features such that the left and right units <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> may be worn behind the left and right ears, respectively, of a user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a user <b>200</b> wearing the left and right units <b>101</b>,<b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the left and right units <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> may be shaped such that they are capable of being worn behind the ears of a user. In the illustrated embodiment, the left unit <b>101</b> includes a thick portion <b>103</b> that may house functional elements of the directional indication system <b>100</b> discussed below. The left unit <b>101</b> also includes a curved portion <b>104</b> that is shaped such that it can wrap around the top of the ear to secure the left unit <b>101</b> to the user. The right unit <b>102</b> is similarly shaped such that it can be worn behind the right ear.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Other configurations and related methods of attaching devices to the ear of a user known to those skilled in the art may be incorporated in the directional indication system <b>100</b>. For example, a clip capable of attaching to a portion of an ear may be used to secure the left and right units <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> to the ears of a user. In another example, the left and right units <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> may be secured to the ears by portions of the left and right units <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> fitting inside portions of the ears such as proximate to the triangular fossa and/or within the ear canals. Such portions may be custom molded for an individual's ears. In yet another example, the left and right units <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> may be attached to a user's ears in the same fashion as pierced earrings are typically attached. Other examples include attachment to eyeglasses, or configured similar to headphones. Indeed, any appropriate method of attaching devices to and/or positioning devices near the ears of users may be incorporated in the left and right units <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of the directional indication system <b>100</b> depicting internal components of the left and right units <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>. The left unit <b>101</b> includes a tactile output device <b>301</b> and the right unit <b>102</b> includes a tactile output device <b>302</b>. The tactile output devices <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> are capable of independently producing a tactile output that a user wearing the left and right units <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> can feel proximate to the user's left and right ears, respectively.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The tactile output devices <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> may be positioned such that the tactile outputs produced are felt on the pinnae of the user. For example, the tactile output devices <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> may be positioned to stimulate the pinnae of the ears of the user, such as behind the ears and facing the pinnae of the user. The pinna is an advantageous location since it is generally a sensitive area which may enable a user to quickly feel stimulation from the tactile output devices <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The tactile output devices <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> may be any appropriate device for producing a physical sensation felt by a user. For example, the tactile output devices <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> may be vibration devices of any appropriate type, such as eccentric rotating mass vibration motors, linear resonant actuators, moving coil transducers, piezoelectric transducers or any combination thereof. The vibration created by each of the tactile output devices <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> may be of any appropriate frequency. The vibrational frequency created by each of the tactile output devices <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> may be selected based upon the ability of a user to consciously or unconsciously interpret the vibrations as an indication of direction. The vibrational frequency may also be selected based upon the comfort of a user. In particular, the vibrational frequency may be between about 100 Hz and 300 Hz to produce a vibration that will feel smooth to the user. The frequency of the output of the tactile output devices <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> may be user adjustable. Such adjustments may be made through, for example, a wireless interface.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The sensations delivered to a user wearing the directional indication system <b>100</b> by the tactile output devices <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> may be used to communicate a direction to the user. The indicated direction is relative to the head of the user wearing the directional indication system <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a chart <b>400</b> showing how the sensations delivered to the head <b>401</b> (viewed from above) of a user by the tactile output devices <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> may be interpreted by the user as indicating a particular direction in the transverse plane of the head <b>401</b> of the user. The pairs of numbers positioned about the head <b>401</b> indicate the power output (in percentage of maximum set output) for the left tactile output device <b>301</b> and the right tactile output device <b>302</b>, respectively, for that particular direction.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">For example, to indicate a direction to the left of the head <b>401</b>, the left tactile output device <b>301</b> would output a vibration at 100% of its maximum set output while the right tactile output device <b>302</b> would output no vibration (i.e., 0%). This situation is represented by the &#x201c;100-0&#x201d; positioned to the left of the head <b>401</b>. In another example, to indicate a direction to the right of the head <b>401</b>, the left tactile output device <b>301</b> would output a vibration at 0% of its maximum set output while the right tactile output device <b>302</b> would output a vibration at 100% of its maximum set output value. This situation is represented by the &#x201c;0-100&#x201d; positioned to the right of the head <b>401</b>. In this regard, the directional indication system <b>100</b> may be used to indicate a left or right direction to the user, and the indicated direction will be relative to the head <b>401</b> of the user.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In an additional example, to indicate a direction directly behind the head <b>401</b>, both the left tactile output device <b>301</b> and the right tactile output device <b>302</b> would output a vibration at 100% of their maximum set output. Accordingly, when both the left tactile output device <b>301</b> and the right tactile output device <b>302</b> output a vibration at 100% of their maximum set output, the user knows that the system is indicating a direction directly behind the head <b>401</b> of the user. This situation is represented by the &#x201c;100-100&#x201d; positioned directly behind head <b>401</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the directional indication system <b>100</b> does not output a vibration from either the left tactile output device <b>301</b> or the right tactile output device <b>302</b> if a source of direction to the directional indication system <b>100</b> indicates a direction directly in front of the head <b>401</b> of the user.

For example, in an application where the directional indication system <b>100</b> is being used to indicate a direction of a source of a sound to a person with reduced sound localization capabilities (e.g., an individual with SSD), the individual may be aware of the sound through their hearing, and a lack of output from the directional indication system <b>100</b> may be interpreted as that sound having a source directly in front of the head <b>401</b> of the user.

Similarly, a direction to be indicated of 225 degrees will result in left tactile output device <b>301</b> having an output of 100% and the right tactile output device <b>302</b> having an output of 50%. These scenarios are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0105">It is noted that the formulas described with relation to the outputs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> are exemplary and may be modified as appropriate. A feature of the formulas is that every degree of direction around the head <b>401</b> of the user is indicated by a unique combination of tactile outputs from the left tactile output device <b>301</b> and the right tactile output device <b>302</b>. Such fine definition may allow a user to determine with high accuracy the direction indicated by the directional indication system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0106">It is further noted that the vibration power is discussed in terms of percentage of maximum set output value. This value represents the highest power level of vibration that the tactile output devices <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> will produce during normal operation. However, this is not necessarily the highest output power that the tactile output devices <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> are capable of producing. For example, the maximum set output value may be set at a value that represents 50% of the maximum power that the tactile output devices <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> are capable of producing. This 50% level would then represent the highest level of output that would be produced during operation by the tactile outputs <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, and therefore would represent 100% of the maximum set output value.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0107">The maximum set output value may be adjustable, for example by an audiologist or the user. This may be beneficial to the user. For example, as a user learns to interpret the tactile outputs of the directional indication system <b>100</b>, the user may find that he or she is able to understand and interpret indicated direction at a lower maximum set output than originally configured. By lowering the maximum set output, the directional indication system <b>100</b> may be able to operate for a longer period of time before needing a recharge or battery replacement. Also, the directional indication system <b>100</b> may feel less obtrusive and more holistic at a lower maximum set output.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0108">In an alternate embodiment illustrated in a chart <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the directional indication system <b>100</b> may be configured such that it produces a signal to the user to indicate a direction directly in front of the head <b>501</b> of the user. As shown, when both the left tactile output device <b>301</b> and the right tactile output device <b>302</b> output a vibration at 5% of their maximum set output, this indicates a direction directly in front <b>502</b> of the user (0 degrees). Such a configuration may be beneficial since in certain applications, the user may not otherwise be aware of what is happening directly in front of their head <b>401</b>. For example, in an application where the directional indication system <b>100</b> is being used to indicate a direction of a source of a sound to a user who is completely deaf, if the user's eyes are closed, the user may not be aware of another person directly in front of them trying to get their attention verbally. In such a situation, if the other person calls out to the user, information that a sound source is directly in front of the head <b>501</b> of the user may be provided to the directional indication system <b>100</b>, which may in response cause both the left tactile output device <b>301</b> and the right tactile output device <b>302</b> to output a vibration at 5%, thereby alerting the user that something is in front of them. The user may then open their eyes, see the other person, and start communicating via sign language. In this regard, deaf people may beneficially be informed of the direction of sound sources to help them in communication and increase their awareness of their environment.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0109">Such a configuration may produce vibration output according to the following formulas, where D is the direction (expressed in degrees) to be indicated to the user with 0 degrees directly in front of the head <b>501</b>, 90 degrees to the right, 180 degrees behind, and 270 degrees to the left.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0110">Left tactile output device <b>301</b> output:<ul id="ul0017" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0017-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0018" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0018-0001" num="0111">Left tactile output device <b>301</b> percentage of maximum output=LO</li>        <li id="ul0018-0002" num="0112">Direction indicated in degrees=D</li>        <li id="ul0018-0003" num="0113">For angles from 0 to 90 degrees</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0109" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>LO=5<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?><ul id="ul0019" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0019-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0020" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0020-0001" num="0114">For angles from 90 to 180 degrees</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0110" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>LO=5+((<i>D</i>&#x2212;90)/90)*95<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?><ul id="ul0021" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0021-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0022" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0022-0001" num="0115">For angles from 180 to 270 degrees</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0111" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>LO=100<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?><ul id="ul0023" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0023-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0024" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0024-0001" num="0116">For angles from 270 to 360 degrees</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0112" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>LO=5+((360<i>&#x2212;D</i>)/90)*95<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0113" num="0117">Right tactile output device <b>302</b> output:<ul id="ul0025" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0025-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0026" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0026-0001" num="0118">Right tactile output device <b>302</b> percentage of maximum output=RO</li>        <li id="ul0026-0002" num="0119">Direction indicated in degrees=D</li>        <li id="ul0026-0003" num="0120">For angles from 0 to 90 degrees</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0114" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>RO=5+(<i>D/</i>90)*95<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?><ul id="ul0027" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0027-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0028" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0028-0001" num="0121">For angles from 90 to 180 degrees</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0115" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>RO=100<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?><ul id="ul0029" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0029-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0030" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0030-0001" num="0122">For angles from 180 to 270 degrees</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0116" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>RO=5+((270<i>&#x2212;D</i>)/90)*95<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?><ul id="ul0031" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0031-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0032" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0032-0001" num="0123">For angles from 270 to 360 degrees</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0117" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>RO=5&#x2003;&#x2003; Equation Set 2<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0118" num="0000">Thus, according to the above formulas, a direction to be indicated of 45 degrees will result in left tactile output device <b>301</b> having an output of 5% and the right tactile output device <b>302</b> having an output of 52.5%.

In this regard, for example, if a low level sound directly behind the user were to trigger tactile outputs of 10% maximum set output, it may be hard for the user to distinguish such an output from a high level sound directly in front of the user that triggers tactile outputs of 5% of maximum set output.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0125">The configurations illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> show directional outputs that are continuously variable across the full 360 degrees.

This typically results in most hearing aids being susceptible to damage from moisture. In contrast, the left and right units <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> may be sealed such that they are dustproof and/or waterproof. As such, they may be worn in environments that are typically problematic for hearing aids such as while swimming or working in dusty environments.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0132">As discussed earlier, the left and right units <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> may be worn proximate to the left and right ears of a user. Such positioning has advantages. As noted above, the pinnae are particularly sensitive to tactile stimulation which may help users to quickly recognize the input and to better distinguish various levels of power output needed to discern the indicated direction as compared to stimulating other parts of the user. Additionally, positioning the left and right units <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> proximate to the left and right ears, respectively, of a user is advantageous since the indicated direction will be relative to the head of the user in the same way that sound localization for a normal-hearing person is determined relative to the head. In this regard, the indicated directions being relative to the head of the user simulates the natural way that humans localize sound and therefore may make the directional indication system <b>100</b> easier to use and understand.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0133">Returning to the block diagram of the directional indication system <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the left unit <b>101</b> further includes a communication module <b>303</b> and a power source <b>305</b>, and the right unit <b>102</b> further includes a communication module <b>304</b> and a power source <b>306</b>.

The directional indication system <b>900</b> is a wired version of the directional indication system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Indeed, all of the discussion above pertaining to how the directional indication system <b>100</b> may indicate to a user an indicated direction is also applicable to the directional indication system <b>900</b>. In this regard, the directional indication system <b>900</b> has a left unit <b>901</b> and a right unit <b>902</b>. These left and right units <b>901</b>, <b>902</b> may be configured to be worn by a user in any appropriate fashion including similar to how the directional indication system <b>100</b> may be configured.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0139">The directional indication system <b>900</b> may include wiring <b>905</b> that is connected to both the left unit <b>901</b> and the right unit <b>902</b>. The wiring <b>905</b> may facilitate delivering power to, and/or controlling, a tactile output device <b>903</b> within the left unit <b>901</b> and a tactile output device <b>904</b> within the right unit <b>902</b>. Accordingly, the communications modules <b>303</b>, <b>304</b>, power sources <b>305</b>, <b>306</b>, and processors <b>307</b>, <b>308</b> of the directional indication system <b>100</b> may not be located within the left and right units <b>901</b>, <b>902</b>. The wiring <b>905</b> of the directional indication system <b>900</b> may be configured such that the tactile output devices <b>903</b>, <b>904</b> may be remotely connected to a source of power and/or control.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0140">For example, a remote control module <b>906</b> may be interconnected to the left and right units <b>901</b>, <b>902</b> via the wiring <b>905</b>. The remote control module <b>906</b> may include a power source <b>907</b> and processor <b>908</b> capable of controlling the tactile output devices <b>903</b>, <b>904</b> similarly to how the tactile output devices <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> are controlled in the directional indication system <b>100</b> previously described.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0141">The remote control module <b>906</b> may be sized and configured to fit into a pocket or hang around the neck of a user. Any other appropriate way for a user to carry the remote control module <b>906</b> may be employed. The remote control module <b>906</b> may generate an indicated direction or it may receive an indicated direction from an external support. The remote control module <b>906</b> may include a communication module <b>909</b> through which it may receive indicated directions and/or other appropriate information.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0142">In an exemplary configuration of the directional indication system <b>900</b>, the directional indication system <b>900</b> may be configured similar to outside the ear headphones (which include two portions configured to fit over or against the outside of the ears of the user with an interconnecting portion that interconnects the two portions and enables the headphones to be secured to the user's head) with wiring <b>905</b> placed along the interconnecting portion of the. In such a configuration, the remote control module <b>906</b> may be positioned as previously described or it may be interconnected to any appropriate portion of the headphones which interconnects the ear pieces.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0143">The directional indication systems <b>100</b>, <b>900</b> may provide directional indications to users for any appropriate reason. For example, a completely deaf person may wear and use one of the directional indication systems <b>100</b>, <b>900</b> to provide information regarding sounds in their environment. In such a scenario, the directional indication system <b>100</b>, <b>900</b> may be coupled to a sound direction determination system. The directional indication systems <b>100</b>, <b>900</b> may receive directional information regarding detected sounds and indicate to the deaf person a direction of a source of a sound in real-time or near real-time. Such information may be used to alert the deaf person as to the direction of a sound. In response the deaf person may turn toward the sound source and then may be able to determine the source of the sound and respond accordingly. For example, a person may call out to a completely deaf person and the directional indication system worn by the deaf person may indicate a direction to the deaf person, the deaf person may turn toward the sound and see the person who called out to them, and then engage in communication with the other person, such a through sign language. Other examples of sound sources a deaf person may wish to be aware of include alarm clocks, ringing phones, moving cars, car horns, falling objects, people or pets in distress, teachers, and teammates in sports. These examples represent a small fraction of the types of sounds that may be beneficial and/or desirable for a completely deaf person to be alerted to.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0144">The directional indication systems <b>100</b>, <b>900</b> may be interfaced with other systems to provide specific alerts. For example, directional indication systems <b>100</b>, <b>900</b> may provide a unique tactile output as a notification that a doorbell has been activated or that an incoming communication on a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) has arrived. The unique tactile output may, for example, be a short vibration repeated three times in quick succession. This special signal may be used to alert the user of the specific event.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0145">In another example of an application, the directional indication systems <b>100</b>, <b>900</b> may be used by people who have some degree of hearing, but have reduced or no sound localization capabilities. For example, people who have SSD may also lack the ability to localize sound based solely on the sound they are hearing. That is, they cannot localize sounds in the same way that a normal hearing listener would localize sounds. When normal hearing listeners localize sound sources, they often rely on the interaural cues to determine the direction of the source of the sound. Since SSD individuals lack hearing in one ear, they also lack any interaural clues and thus lack normal localization abilities.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0146">Accordingly, a SSD person may use the directional indication systems <b>100</b>, <b>900</b>, again interconnected to a sound direction determination system, to provide sound localization capabilities. In such an application, the SSD person may be capable of hearing sounds and may not use hearing aids, but may desire to have better localization capabilities. The directional indication systems <b>100</b>, <b>900</b> may be used to provide real-time directional indications of environmental sounds. Alternately, the SSD person may were hearing aids, such as a crossover hearing aid system. A crossover hearing aid system is a hearing aid system that detects sounds at the deaf ear, transmits information regarding the detected sounds to a hearing aid at the functioning ear of the SSD person, and then plays sounds based on the detected sounds into the functioning ear of the SSD person. The sounds played may, for example, be filtered to make certain sounds such as speech more prominent and/or easier to understand. Thus for a person with SSD, their ability to hear sounds coming from their side corresponding to their deaf ear is enhanced with a crossover hearing aid system. The directional indication systems <b>100</b>, <b>900</b> may be worn with a crossover hearing aid system or may be incorporated into a crossover hearing aid system to help provide sound localization.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0147">People who have some degree of hearing loss in one or both ears and wear hearing aids may suffer from reduced sound localization capabilities depending on the individual and level of boosting needed. Hearing aids typically amplify sounds, however, oftentimes, hearing aid users perceive the amplified sounds as being produced in their ears as opposed to the 3 dimensional space surrounding them. This may result in diminished sound localization capabilities. The directional indication systems <b>100</b>, <b>900</b> may be worn with a typical amplifying hearing aid system or may be incorporated into such a system to help provide and/or enhance sound localization.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0148">The directional indication systems <b>100</b>, <b>900</b> may be used in situations where the communication of directional information through audible or visual means may be undesirable. Furthermore, by using tactile output to indicate direction, a user's available visual and/or audible bandwidths (i.e., the total amount of information they are capable of receiving) may not be diminished.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0149">The directional indication systems <b>100</b>, <b>900</b> may be incorporated into virtual reality systems. The direction indicated may, for example, correspond to the direction of an element in a virtual reality simulation, such as the direction from which a gunshot originated in a video game. In this regard, instead of the typical left/right distinction of such systems use (due to their having speakers positioned at the user's ears similar to typical headphones), a virtual reality system with an incorporated directional indication system <b>100</b>, <b>900</b> may be capable of indicating a more precise direction.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0150">The direction indicated by directional indication systems <b>100</b>, <b>900</b> may, in yet another example, correspond to the direction of a teammate, thus allowing team members to know each other's positions without audible communications. Such an embodiment may be useful in law enforcement and/or military scenarios where audible or visual communications may reveal a tactical position or where audible or visual communications may interfere with such a person's awareness of their environment.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0151">In still other embodiments, the directional indication systems <b>100</b>, <b>900</b> may indicate the direction of a target to be achieved or a hazard to be avoided. Such systems may help individuals navigate without taking up such an individual's available visual and/or audible bandwidths. For example, such systems may help blind people navigate while not taking up their audible bandwidth. Such navigation may be localized, such as within a building, or it may be larger, such as within a neighborhood or city. In such a system, the directional indication system <b>100</b>, <b>900</b> may be interconnected to a navigation system, such as a GPS system or cell phone network.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an illustration of an embodiment of a three-dimensional directional indication system <b>1000</b>. The three-dimensional directional indication system <b>1000</b> may operate similarly to the directional indication systems <b>100</b>, <b>900</b> discussed above and may also be used in similar applications as described above. However, the three-dimensional directional indication system <b>1000</b> is operable to indicate a three-dimensional direction to a user, i.e., the three-dimensional directional indication system <b>1000</b> may be operable to indicate the directions within the transverse plane of the head of the user as described above with respect to the directional indication systems <b>100</b>, <b>900</b>, and also indicate inclination or declination relative to the transverse plane. Thus, the three-dimensional directional indication system <b>1000</b> may indicate any direction relative to the head of a user.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0153">The direction indicated may, for example, correspond to the direction of a sound source relative to the three-dimensional directional indication system <b>1000</b>.

Such an embodiment may be helpful to a user who does not have the ability to localize sound sources, such as an individual who has SSD, unilateral hearing loss, bilateral hearing loss or is completely deaf.

What constitutes a triggering event may be pre-programmed into the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> and/or may be definable by, for example, an audio technician, audiologist and/or a user. The audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may detect and respond to several different types of triggering events, including simultaneous triggering events.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0200">In a first example of a triggering event, a triggering event may be any sound detected by the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> where the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> is able to determine a direction of (i.e., localize) the source of the sound. Such a determination may, for example, be whether the sound source is to the left or to the right of a user, or the determination may be more precise, such as a vector along which the sound source is located. The detected and localized sound may be the only sound detected and localized by the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b>, or it may be one of two or more sounds simultaneously detected and localized by the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b>. Where two or more sounds are simultaneously detected and localized, the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may select one of the detected and localized sounds and produce a tactile output to indicate the direction of the source of the selected sound to the user. Such a selection may, for example, be based on the volume of the simultaneously detected and localized sound. In another example, the selection may be based on the type of sound: for example, if only one of the simultaneously detected and localized sounds is speech, the speech may be the sound selected by the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b>.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0201">Alternatively, the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may select all of the simultaneously detected and localized sounds or any subset thereof and alternately produce tactile outputs for each of the selected sounds. For example, if first and second sounds are simultaneously detected and localized by the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b>, the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may alternate between producing tactile output indicating the direction of the source of the first sound and producing a tactile output indicating the direction of the source of the second sound. The duration of time that each sound is indicated may be selected such that the user is able to comprehend each direction being indicated. The duration may be adjustable by, for example, the user or an audiologist.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0202">In a second example of a triggering event, a triggering event may be any sound detected that is over a predetermined decibel level. That is, whenever the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> detects a sound that is over the predetermined decibel level, the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> reacts by outputting tactile sensations to indicate to the user the direction from which the sound originated. The audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may continue to output tactile sensations indicating source direction as long as the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> detects the sound over the predetermined decibel level. Therefore, for example, if a siren were to emit a high decibel sound, the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may output tactile sensations for as long as the decibel level of the siren remains above the predetermined level sensed at the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b>.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0203">Alternatively, the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may only output tactile sensations for a predetermined amount of time after the initial sensing of the sound that is over the predetermined decibel level. Therefore, for example, if a siren were to emit a high decibel sound, the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may output tactile sensations indicating source direction for a predetermined amount of time (for example, 1 second) and then stop outputting the tactile sensations after the predetermined amount of time has passed. Such an alert scheme may be beneficial in that once the user has been alerted to the direction of the sound, the user may no longer need the tactile outputs and stopping the tactile outputs has the benefits of freeing up the tactile output devices <b>1901</b>, <b>1903</b> for delivery of additional localization information (e.g., such as a second siren) and/or saving battery life by limiting the duration of the tactile outputs.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0204">In general, if the position of the sound source moves relative to the head of the user (due to the user moving his head and/or due to the sound source moving), the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may change or resume the tactile outputs to indicate the new direction of the source of the sound relative to the user's head.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0205">In a third example of a triggering event, a triggering event may be any sound detected that is over a predetermined decibel level above the ambient or background level of sound at a particular time. That is, whenever the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> detects a sound that is over the predetermined decibel level above the ambient level of sound at a particular time, the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> reacts by outputting tactile sensations to indicate to the user the direction from which the sound that is over the predetermined decibel level above the ambient level originated.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0206">The audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may continue to output tactile sensations indicating source direction as long as the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> detects the sound over the predetermined decibel level. Therefore, for example, if the user were in a quiet room and another person said something to the user at a normal conversational level, the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may output tactile sensations indicating direction in response to detecting the other person's speech if the speech is at a decibel level that is over the predetermined decibel level above the ambient noise level. In another example, if the user were in a relatively noisy room (e.g., a factory floor), the other person may need to raise their voice significantly such that their voice exceeds the requisite predetermined decibel level above the ambient noise level, in order to trigger the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> outputting tactile sensations to indicate the direction of the other person's speech and thereby getting the user's attention. In the present example, as in the first example, the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may output tactile sensations for as long as the triggering event is occurring, or it may only output tactile sensations for a predetermined amount of time after the initial triggering event.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0207">In a fourth example of a triggering event, a triggering event may be a new sound relative to recent sounds detected by the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b>. For example, if a user is in an environment, such as a gathering, where there are many people talking simultaneously, and then a different type of sound occurs, such as a door squeaking as it is opened or a plate of food hitting the floor, the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may treat the different type of sound as a triggering event and alert the user to the direction of the source of the different type of sound. The different type of sound may be treated as a triggering event even though its decibel level may be at or below the ambient noise level.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0208">In a fifth example of a triggering event, a triggering event may be a particular type of sound. For example, if the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> detects speech, it may output tactile sensations indicating the direction of the speech. The audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may output tactile sensations for as long as the speech is occurring, or it may only output tactile sensations for a predetermined amount of time after the speech source direction is initially indicated. The audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may indicate a sound source direction every instance where a distinct speech source direction is attainable. For example, if a user is talking to several people in a group, the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may indicate direction each time a single speaker is discernable.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0209">Other types of sounds may be treated as triggering events. For example, sirens, the sounds of vehicles running and/or moving, buzzers, bells, alarms, and/or any other appropriate sound may be programmed into the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> as a triggering event.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0210">In a sixth example of a triggering event, a triggering event may be particular elements of speech. That is, the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may be programmed to recognize particular words and then output tactile sensations to indicate to the user the direction from which the particular words originated. For example, the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may be programmed to recognize the user's name and/or words generally used to get someone's attention, such as &#x201c;Hey&#x201d;, &#x201c;Look out&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Head's up&#x201d;, and then output tactile sensations indicating the direction of the triggering words.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0211">In a seventh example of a triggering event, a triggering event may be programmed by the user. That is, the user may indicate to the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> that a particular sound event is an event which the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> should indicate a source direction. For example, a user who is a basketball player may select the sound of a bouncing basketball as a sound which should be considered a triggering event by the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b>, thus enabling the user to track the position of the bouncing ball.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0212">In an eighth example of a triggering event, a triggering event may the loudest sound detected by the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b>. That is, the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> may output tactile sensations to indicate to the user the direction from which the loudest sound currently detected by the audio source localization and indication system <b>1800</b> originated.

Relatedly, the audio source localization and indication systems <b>1800</b>, <b>2000</b>, <b>2100</b> may be beneficial to users even if their ability to localize sound is relatively coarse. For example, if an embodiment of the audio source localization and indication system <b>2000</b> is configured to determine sound source direction within +/&#x2212;45 degrees, such a system would be beneficial to a user. Such accuracy would be beneficial since it would give a general indication to the user of the direction of the sound source, and the user may then respond by turning toward the sound source and then using visual clues to determine a more precise direction of the sound source. As human vision generally has a binocular field of view of about 120 degrees in the transverse and sagittal planes, a sound source direction accuracy of +/&#x2212;45 degrees may allow the user to quickly locate the sound source. Sound source direction accuracies better than +/&#x2212;45 degrees may be more beneficial in aiding sound source direction determination. In general, sound source direction accuracies may be balanced against other considerations, such as the speed at which the sound source direction is determined (e.g., processor load), power consumption, and/or system costs.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0241">The audio source localization and indication systems <b>1800</b>, <b>2000</b>, <b>2100</b> may be wireless systems configured as described above.

As previously noted, the crossover hearing aid system is a hearing aid system that detects sounds at the deaf ear of a person with SSD, transmits information regarding the detected sounds to a hearing aid at the functioning ear of the SSD person, and then plays sounds based on the detected sounds into the functioning ear of the SSD person. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> is a block diagram of the crossover hearing aid system <b>3200</b>. The crossover hearing aid system <b>3200</b> is configured for a person who is deaf in the left ear. An opposite configuration may be used for an individual deaf in the right ear. Accordingly, a left unit <b>3201</b> includes a microphone <b>3301</b> for detecting sound at the left ear and a communication module <b>3303</b> for transmitting information regarding the detected sound to a right unit <b>3202</b>. The left unit <b>3201</b> further includes a power source <b>3305</b> and a processor <b>3307</b>.

The loss of communication may be due to the power source <b>3305</b> of the left unit <b>3201</b> being depleted (such as a drained battery) below a predetermined level. The loss of communication may be due to the left unit <b>3201</b> being out of communication range, possibly due to it falling off of the user or the user removing the left unit <b>3201</b>. The alert produced by the right unit <b>3202</b> may be in the form of a specific audible tone that the user may recognize as an alert.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0264">In traditional crossover hearing aid systems, if the unit for the hearing ear experiences a depleted battery or falls off of the user, there is no way for the unit for the deaf ear to alert the user of the fault. This may be particularly problematic when the unit for the hearing ear falls off the user, since any delay between the unit for the hearing ear falling off and the user recognizing that it has fallen off may greatly increase the chances of losing the unit for the hearing ear. It is particularly important for active people and children to quickly recognize that the unit for the hearing ear has fallen off since significant distances or movement may occur between the time the unit for the hearing ear falls off and the user notices that the unit for the hearing ear has fallen off. The user may not immediately recognize that the unit for the hearing ear has fallen off for many reasons, such as an extremely noisy environment, an extremely quiet environment, or where the system was particularly tuned to boost speech and no speech was present.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0265">In the crossover hearing aid system <b>3200</b>, the left unit <b>3202</b> may alert the user when a fault condition exists by causing the tactile output device <b>3309</b> to produce a tactile sensation at the left ear of the user. Thus, if the right unit <b>3202</b> were to fall off of the user, the left unit <b>3201</b> may immediately alert the user, allowing the user to immediately look for the right unit <b>3202</b>.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0266">The tactile output device <b>3309</b> may be any appropriate device for producing a physical sensation felt by a user. For example, the tactile output device <b>3309</b> may be a vibration device of any appropriate type, such as an eccentric rotating mass vibration motor, a linear resonant actuator, a moving coil transducer, or a piezoelectric transducer. The vibration created by the tactile output device <b>3309</b> may be of any appropriate frequency.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0267">In an embodiment, the tactile output device <b>3309</b> may be a speaker capable of outputting sound at a level such that it produces a tactile sensation that can immediately be detected by the user. For example, a low frequency, high decibel sound produced by the tactile output device <b>3309</b> may be felt by the user despite it being transmitted to the deaf ear. Such a low frequency, high decibel sound may be heard by the hearing ear of the user due to the sound being transmitted to the hearing ear through bone conduction. By making the sound produced a distinct signal, such as producing the sound at regular intervals, the user may immediately recognize the sound as the crossover hearing aid system <b>3200</b> signaling a fault situation.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0268">To be able to signal when the right unit <b>3202</b> loses communication with the left unit <b>3201</b>, the left unit <b>3201</b> may be in regular communication with the right unit <b>3202</b>. This communication may be in the form of a signal being transmitted from the communication module <b>3304</b> of the right unit <b>3202</b> to the communication module <b>3303</b> of the left unit <b>3201</b> at regular intervals, and a lack of receiving the signal by the left unit <b>3201</b> may be interpreted as a fault.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0269">As noted, the crossover hearing aid system <b>3200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> is configured for a person who is deaf in the left ear. A configuration for a person who is deaf in the right ear would be similar with the internal components and functions of the left <b>3201</b> and right <b>3202</b> switched.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0270">The function and associated components described with reference to the crossover hearing aid system <b>3200</b> alerting a user when the unit for the hearing ear has fallen off may be incorporated into any appropriate system discussed herein. For example, the left and right units <b>101</b>,<b>102</b> of the directional indication system <b>100</b>, may be in contact with each other and when they lose contact (for example, due to out of communication range or battery depletion), they may each produce a tactile sensation alerting the user to the fault, or in the case where one of the power sources is depleted below a predetermined level, the other unit may produce a tactile sensation alerting the user to the fault.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0271">The systems described above that include microphones may be configured to detect and indicate direction of sounds outside the normal hearing range of humans. For example, the systems may be configured to detect and indicate direction of a 30 kHz tone. In this regard, directional information may be communicated to a wearer of the system without anyone but the wearer being aware of the communication. Such a feature may be used, for example, by a child user who is separated from their parent in a crowded area. The parent may activate an intermittent 30 kHz tone and the system worn by the child may in response indicate the direction of the source of the tone, leading the child back to the parent.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0272">The systems described above may, where appropriate, be incorporated into headphones <b>3400</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref> that are configured to deliver audio and tactile information to a user. Such headphones <b>3400</b> may be of any appropriate configuration, such as the headphones <b>3400</b> shown including a first portion <b>3401</b> and a second portion <b>3402</b> configured to fit over or against the ears of the user with an interconnecting portion <b>3403</b> that interconnects the first <b>3401</b> and second <b>3402</b> portions and enables the headphones <b>3400</b> to be secured to the user's head. The first portion <b>3401</b> includes a first tactile output device <b>3404</b> configured to deliver a tactile output to the first ear. The second portion <b>3402</b> includes a second tactile output device <b>3405</b> configured to deliver a tactile output to the second ear. The first portion <b>3401</b> may further include a first speaker <b>3406</b> and/or the second portion <b>3402</b> may further include a second speaker <b>3407</b>. Additional tactile outputs may also be included. Other known headphone configurations may be used, such as headphones including two portions that may be partially inserted in the ears (often referred to as earbuds) which may also include members to help secure the partially inserted portions to the user's ears. Such headphones <b>3400</b> may be configured to deliver audio information and include one of the described directional indication systems <b>100</b>, <b>900</b>. The audio may be stereo or the audio may be mono (i.e., where the same audio information is delivered to each of the portions configured to fit over, against, or in the ears of the user). Headphones <b>3400</b> using stereo may, for example, be used by a user with normal hearing who seeks a more immersive experience that may be delivered through use of the tactile output devices <b>3404</b>, <b>3405</b>. Headphones <b>3400</b> using mono may, for example, be worn by a user with SSD, thereby delivering the full audio information to the user's hearing ear while delivering directional information through the tactile output devices <b>3404</b>, <b>3405</b> proximate to both ears. Alternatively, headphones <b>3400</b> using mono may be configured to only deliver the audio to one ear of the user (i.e., the hearing ear for a user with SSD).</p><p id="p-0276" num="0273">The headphones <b>3400</b> may further include a processor <b>3408</b>, configured to cause tactile output from at least one of the first <b>3404</b> and second <b>3405</b> tactile output devices indicative of a direction relative to the user. The processor <b>3408</b> may be configured to determine the tactile outputs to be produced based on an audio stream provided to the headphones <b>3400</b>. In this regard, the processor <b>3408</b> may be operable to receive a stereo audio stream, analyze the stream to determine which sounds are to be accompanied by tactile outputs, and cause the determined tactile outputs to be produced by the first <b>3404</b> and second <b>3405</b> tactile output devices. Thus the headphones <b>3400</b> may be a standalone system that when provided a stereo audio stream may be capable of producing tactile outputs indicative of the direction of stereo elements within the audio stream.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0274">Such a system incorporated into headphones may be incorporated into video gaming systems.
