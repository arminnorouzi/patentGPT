The present invention relates furthermore to communication devices and a communication system supporting the methods.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Increasing use of mobile voice and data communications may require a more efficient utilisation of the available radio frequency resources. For increasing data transmission performance and reliability, the so-called multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) technology may be used in wireless radio telecommunication systems for transmitting information between the devices, for example between a base station and a user equipment. The user equipment may comprise mobile devices like mobile phones, mobile computers, tablet computers or wearable devices, and stationary devices like personal computers or cash registers. In systems using MIMO technologies the devices may use multiple send and receive antennas. For example, the base station as well as the user equipment may each comprise multiple send and receive antennas. The MIMO technology forms the basis for coding techniques which use the temporal as well as the spatial dimension for transmitting information. The enhanced coding provided in MIMO systems may increase the spectral and energy efficiency of the wireless communication.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The spatial dimension may be used by spatial multiplexing. The spatial multiplexing is a transmission technique in MIMO communications to transmit independent and separately encoded data signals, so-called streams, from each of the multiple transmit antennas or a combination thereof. Therefore, the spatial dimension is reused or multiplexed more than one time.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The so-called full dimensional MIMO (FDMIMO) refers to a technology that arranges the signals transmitted to antennas in the form of beams that are able to power multiple receivers in three dimensions. For example, a base station may comprise a large number of active antenna elements in a two-dimensional grid and the use of the FDMIMO technology enables a support of many spatially separated users on the same time/frequency resource blocks simultaneously. This may reduce interference from overlapping transmissions to other receivers and increases the power of the signal. The beams may form virtual sectors which may be static or dynamic in view of the base station. The large number of antennas of the base station allows radio energy to be spatially focused in transmissions as well as a directional sensitive reception which improves spectral efficiency and radiated energy efficiency. In order to adapt the transmit signal at each individual antenna of the base station in accordance with the currently active receiving user equipment, a base station logic may need information about radio channel properties between the user equipment and the antennas of the base station. Vice versa, in order to adapt the transmit signal at each individual antenna of the user equipment, a user equipment logic may need information about the radio channel properties between the base station and the antennas of the user equipment. For this purpose, a so-called channel sounding may be performed to determine the radio channel properties between the user equipment and the base station. The channel sounding may comprise transmitting predefined pilot signals which may allow the base station and the user equipment to set their configuration antenna parameters for transmitting signals so as to focus radio energy or for receiving radio signals from a certain direction.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the operational frequency increases and consequently the wavelength decreases, the antenna aperture becomes small and therefore multiple antennas may be utilised to increase the received power. In particular in case of high transmission frequencies of for example 30 GHz or more and multiple antennas having small apertures, the reception sensitivity may significantly depend on polarization of the transmitted radio-frequency signals. However, in particular when the user equipment is a movable device, the polarization of the antennas of the user equipment may vary with respect to the antenna arrangement of the base station.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In evolving standards, for example in 3GPP RAN1 Release 15, is defined that the base station broadcasts beam shaped synchronisation signals (so-called SS-bursts). Different SS-bursts targeting different directions or polarizations are distributed both in time and frequency domain such that each beam is occurring at each sub-band over time. The user equipment may listen for the SS-bursts and may use the received signal to calibrate frequency and timing. The user equipment may scan or adjust its receive beam in order to find the direction that is associated with the strongest SS-burst. However, the polarization of the SS-burst signal may not be optimal for the user equipment depending on the current arrangement of the antennas of the user equipment. For improving the receive beam adjustment of the user equipment, the base station may repeat each SS-burst signal with an orthogonal polarization. However, as the user equipment may receive also SS-burst signals transmitted in other sectors, for example neighbouring sectors or due to reflections, it may be difficult for the user equipment to find the strongest beam and optimize the receive beam polarization.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the above, there is a need in the art for methods and devices which address at least some of the above shortcomings of conventional MIMO systems. In particular, there is a need in the art for improving operation of devices in a wireless communication system to reduce the power losses of wireless communications due to polarization misalignments.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present invention, this object is achieved by the features of the independent claims. The dependent claims define embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, a method for operating a communication device is provided. The communication device may be operated in a wireless communication system and may have an antenna arrangement configured to adjust the polarization of radio frequency signals to be transmitted via the antenna arrangement. For example, the communication device may comprise a base station or an access point of the wireless communication system. According to the method, configuration data indicating a first polarization of a first radio frequency signal and a second polarization of a second radio frequency signal are transmitted. Furthermore, the first radio frequency signal is transmitted using the first polarization, and the second radio frequency signal is transmitted using the second polarization.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first radio frequency signal may comprise a first synchronisation signal, and the second radio frequency signal may comprise a second synchronisation signal. In particular, the first and second radio-frequency signals may comprise shaped synchronisation signals, so-called SS-bursts, or pilot signals for synchronising devices operated in the communication system and for analysing a communication channel between devices operated in the communication system, for example by channel sounding. The configuration data may be transmitted using a broadcast channel. Likewise, the first radio frequency signal and the second radio frequency signal may be transmitted using a broadcast channel. The first polarization and the second polarization may be different. In particular, the first polarization and the second polarization may be orthogonal to each other.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Based on the configuration data indicating the first polarization and the second polarization, a receiving communication device (for example a user equipment) which receives the first and second radio-frequency signals may adjust its receiver configurations to optimize the received power and antenna gain, and may additionally request from the transmitting communication device (for example a base station) to use a certain polarization for future transmissions, in particular transmissions of payload data. By transmitting the configuration data indicating the first polarization of the first radio frequency signal and the second polarization of the second radio frequency signal, the information that polarized radio-frequency signals will be transmitted is shared between the transmitting communication device and the receiving communication device such that the receiving communication device may initiate optimization of its receiver configurations based on the subsequently received first and second radio frequency signals.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an embodiment, the configuration data includes a first identifier uniquely identifying the first radio frequency signal and a second identifier uniquely identifying the second radio frequency signal. The first and second identifiers may enable the receiving communication device to reliably identify the first and second radio frequency signals. In particular in sectorized transmissions, the receiving communication device may receive radio frequency signals which are not intended for the receiving communication device, for example due to reflections. Based on the first and second identifiers consideration of such radio-frequency signals, which are not intended for the receiving communication device, may be avoided.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">For example, the configuration data may comprise an association definition identifying the first and second radio frequency signals and/or that the first and second radio frequency signals are associated to each other. Further the configuration data may indicate that the first radio frequency signal and the second radio frequency signal differ in their corresponding first and second polarization only.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another exemplary embodiment, the configuration data indicates a first directionality of the first radio frequency signal and a second directionality of the second radio frequency signal. The first radio frequency signal is transmitted using the first polarization and the first directionality, and the second radio frequency signal is transmitted using the second polarization and the second directionality. The first and second directionality may be the same directionality. In other words, the first and second radio frequency signal may have the same angular properties. The configuration data may indicate the first directionality and the second directionality with respect to a beam sweep including multiple beams of multiple directionalities, for example in a sectorized full dimension MIMO system. Based on the directionality information, a receiving communication device may reliably identify the first and second radio frequency signals and radio frequency signals, which are identified based on the directionality to be not intended for the receiving communication device, may be ignored by the receiving communication device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another embodiment, a request for the configuration data is received and the configuration data is transmitted upon receiving the request. The request for the configuration data may be received at the transmitting communication device, for example at a base station, from a receiving communication device, for example a user equipment. The user equipment may transmit the request for example upon detecting a movement of the user equipment which may influence the receive characteristics of the user equipment, or upon a deterioration of the communication between the user equipment and the base station.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a further embodiment, the configuration data comprises selector information indicating the first polarization and the second polarization based on a predefined mapping between a plurality of radio frequency signals and a plurality of polarizations. The predefined mapping, for example in the form of a table or software, may be provided in the transmitting communication device, for example a base station, as well as in the receiving communication device, for example a user equipment. By realising the configuration data as selector information, the configuration data may be more compact compared to detailed information concerning the first and second polarizations of the first and second radio-frequency signals. Therefore, the amount of data to be transmitted for transmitting the configuration data may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the present invention, a further method for operating a communication device is provided. The communication device may be operated in a wireless communication system and may comprise for example a user equipment, in particular a mobile user equipment, like a mobile telephone, a mobile computer, a tablet computer, a wearable device or a mobile accessory. A wearable device or a mobile accessory may comprise a wearable computer, also known as body born computer or simply wearable, which is a miniature electronic device that may be worn by a user under, with or on top of clothing. According to the method, configuration data indicating a first polarization of a first radio frequency signal and a second polarization of a second radio frequency signal is received. Furthermore, at least one of the first radio frequency signal and the second radio frequency signal is received, and a combined power of the at least one of the first radio frequency signal and the second radio frequency signal is determined based on the configuration data.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, the first radio frequency signal may comprise a first synchronisation signal, and the second radio frequency signal may comprise a second synchronisation signal. In another example, the first radio frequency signal and the second radio frequency signal may each comprise a pilot signal for channel sounding a communication channel between a further communication device, for example a base station or an access point of the wireless communication system, and the receiving communication device, for example a user equipment. The configuration data may indicate that the first polarization is orthogonal with respect to the second polarization. The communication device may comprise an antenna arrangement for receiving the configuration data, the first radio frequency signal and the second radio frequency signal. The antenna arrangement may comprise a plurality of antennas. The combined power of the first and second received radio frequency signals may be optimized for example by configuring received parameters of the antenna arrangement of the communication device. For example, the combined power may comprise a function of the first radio frequency signal, the second radio frequency signal and combining information, which may comprise for example phase information and weighing information used when combining the first and second radio frequency signals. For optimizing the combined power, the combining information may be varied. In other words, the radio frequency signals having different polarizations are received at the communication device and then a preferred polarization for the current receiving situation of the communication device is determined. Receive parameters of the communication device may be adapted accordingly. The preferred polarization may be communicated to a sending communication device, for example a base station or an access point of the wireless communication system, and the sending communication device may adapt its polarization settings when transmitting subsequent payload data. Thus, transmission power may be efficiently used.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to an embodiment, the configuration data includes a first identifier uniquely identifying the first radio frequency signal, and a second identifier uniquely identifying the second radio frequency signal. The first and second identifiers may enable the communication device to reliably identify the first and second radio frequency signals. For example, in sectorized transmissions, the communication device may receive radio frequency signals which are not intended for the communication device, for example due to reflections in street canyons. Based on the first and second identifiers the communication device may ignore such radio-frequency signals, which are not intended for the communication device, from consideration based on the first and second identifiers.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to an embodiment, a request for configuration data is transmitted. The request for configuration data may be transmitted from the communication device to another communication device, for example a base station, of the wireless communication system. The communication device may transmit the request for example upon detecting a movement of the communication device which may influence the receive characteristics of the communication device with respect to the polarization of the received radio frequency signals. Thus, readjustment of the receive configuration at the communication device and possibly readjustment of the transmit configuration at the other communication device may be initiated by transmitting the request.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to another embodiment, the configuration data comprises selector information indicating the first polarization and the second polarization based on a predefined mapping between a plurality of radio frequency signals and a plurality of polarizations. The predefined mapping, for example a table indicating associations between radio frequency signals and assigned polarizations, may be provided in the communication device, for example a user equipment, as well as in another communication device, for example a base station of the wireless communication system. The selector information may be more compact compared to detailed information explicitly indicating the first and second polarizations of the first and second radio frequency signals. Thus, the amount of data to be transmitted as the configuration data may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a further aspect of the present invention, a communication device is provided. The communication device may be operated in a wireless communication system, for example as a base station or an access point. The communication device comprises an antenna arrangement and a logic coupled to the antenna arrangement. The antenna arrangement may be configured to adjust the polarization of a radio frequency signal to be transmitted via the antenna arrangement. The logic is configured to transmit, via the antenna arrangement, configuration data indicating a first polarization of a first radio frequency signal and a second polarization of a second radio frequency signal. The logic is furthermore configured to transmit, via the antenna arrangement, the first radio frequency signal using the first polarization and the second radio frequency signal using the second polarization. The first polarization and the second polarization may be different, for example the first polarization may be orthogonal to the second polarization. The communication device may be configured to perform the above-described method and the embodiments thereof as the transmitting communication device, for example as a base station.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to another aspect of the present invention, a communication device is provided.

The first polarization and the second polarization may be different, for example the first polarization may be orthogonal to the second polarization. Furthermore, the logic may be configured to optimize the combined power by varying combining information relating to the first and second radio frequency signals. In particular, the combined power may be a function of the first and second radio frequency signals and the combining information. The power of each of the first and second radio frequency signals may be represented by complex values. By varying the combining information, the combined power may be optimized, for example such that the combined power becomes maximal by weighing and phase shifting the magnitudes (absolute values) of the powers of the first and second radio frequency signals. The communication device may be configured to perform the above-described method, for example as a user equipment.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Finally, according to the present invention, a wireless communication system is provided comprising the above-described communication devices, for example at least one acting as the transmitting communication device, for example a base station or an access point of the wireless communication system, and at least one acting as the receiving communication device, for example a user equipment.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although specific features described in the above summary and the following detailed description are described in connection with specific embodiments and aspects of the present invention, it should be understood that the features of the exemplary embodiments and aspects may be combined with each other unless specifically noted otherwise.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows schematically a wireless communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a flowchart comprising method steps according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows schematically an algorithm for optimizing a combined power of received radio frequency signals and an antenna gain according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the following, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in more detail.

For example, the first radio frequency signal <b>301</b> may be transmitted directed or shaped by beamforming to the user equipment <b>30</b>. Thus, another communication between the base station <b>20</b> and the user equipment <b>40</b> may not be disturbed by the transmission of the first radio frequency signal <b>301</b>.

In particular, radio frequency signals in other sectors, for example the radio frequency signals <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> directed in sector <b>50</b> intended for user equipment device <b>40</b>, are allocated in different time-frequency resources, which may (unintentionally) reach user equipment device <b>30</b> due to reflections, may be reliably distinguished from the radio-frequency signals <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> in sector <b>51</b> intended for user equipment device <b>30</b>.

The optimal polarization may vary when the user equipment <b>20</b> changes its orientation or the properties of the radio channel between the base station <b>20</b> and the user equipment <b>30</b> varies. Therefore, the user equipment <b>30</b> may transmit in step <b>109</b> a request <b>305</b> for the configuration data.

Thus, the transmit polarization used by the base station <b>20</b> may be kept up-to-date with respect to the current orientation of the user equipment <b>30</b> and the properties of the radio channel.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows details concerning the optimization of the combined power and the antenna gain of steps <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> mentioned above. In the following description, it is assumed that the first radio frequency signal <b>301</b> has a horizontal polarization and the second radio frequency signal <b>302</b> has a vertical polarization. However, other polarizations may be used as long as the polarization of the first radio frequency signal <b>301</b> is different, in particular orthogonal, from the polarization of the second radio frequency signal <b>302</b>. Furthermore, in the following exemplary explanation, the user equipment <b>30</b> is assumed to have two antennas. Nevertheless, the method described in the following may support any number of antennas at the user equipment.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">First, the optimization of the combined power will be described (step <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The combined power is abbreviated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> by CP. As an input, the received radio frequency signals <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> with the horizontal and vertical polarization are used. The first radio frequency signal <b>301</b> with the horizontal polarization received at the first antenna <b>32</b> of the user equipment <b>30</b> is indicated by H<b>1</b>. The second radio frequency signal <b>302</b> having the vertical polarization and which is received at the first antenna <b>32</b> is indicated by V<b>1</b>. The first radio frequency signal <b>301</b> with the horizontal polarization which is received at the second antenna <b>33</b> of the user equipment <b>30</b> is indicated by H<b>2</b>, and the second radio frequency signal <b>302</b> with the vertical polarization received at the second antenna <b>33</b> is indicated by V<b>2</b>. The following processing of the received signals H<b>1</b>, V<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b> and V<b>2</b> may be performed in the logic <b>31</b>. Absolute values of the received signals H<b>1</b> and H<b>2</b> are phase shifted by a phase information &#x3c6;. It is to be noticed that the same phase information &#x3c6; is used for phase shifting the signals H<b>1</b> and H<b>2</b>. In case more than two antennas are used for receiving the horizontally polarized radio frequency signal, the same phase information &#x3c6; is used for all these signals. Next, the phase shifted signal H<b>1</b> is weighted by a weighting information &#x3b1;<sup>2</sup>, and the signal V<b>1</b> is weighted by a complementary weighting information (1&#x2212;&#x3b1;<sup>2</sup>). The same weighting is performed for absolute values of the signals H<b>2</b>, V<b>2</b> received at the second antenna, that means that the phase shifted signal H<b>2</b> is weighted with weighting information &#x3b1;, and the signal V<b>2</b> is weighted with the weighting information (1&#x2212;&#x3b1;)<sup>2</sup>. In case of more than two antennas each pair of vertical and horizontal signals is weighted as described above with the same weighting information. Then, for each antenna the resulting horizontal and vertical powers are added (see reference signs <b>401</b> and <b>402</b>). Finally, the combined power CP is the sum of the powers determined for each antenna. Thus, the combined power CP is a function of the radio frequency signals received at the antennas <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> of the user equipment <b>30</b> and the phase information &#x3c6; and the weighting information &#x3b1;. The following formula shows this in detail:</p><p id="p-0055" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>CP=<i>f</i>((|<i>H</i>1|+|<i>H</i>2|)<i>e</i><sup>j&#x3c6;</sup>&#x3b1;<sup>2</sup>+(|<i>V</i>1|+|<i>V</i>2|)(1&#x2212;&#x3b1;)<sup>2</sup>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">For optimizing the combined power CP, the phase information &#x3c6; and the weighting information &#x3b1; may be varied. In particular, a so-called maximum ratio combining technique may be applied to vary these parameters &#x3c6; and a for obtaining an optimized combined power CP. The above-mentioned combining information comprises the phase information &#x3c6; and the weighting information &#x3b1;, which may be used by the base station logic <b>21</b> to configure its transmission parameters of the antenna arrangement <b>22</b> such that payload data signals <b>304</b> may be transmitted having a polarization which leads to an optimized communication at low power with high signal-to-noise ratio.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">For optimizing the antenna gain Popt (step <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), a further maximum ratio combining technique may be applied based on the optimized receive power <b>401</b>, <b>402</b> for each antenna. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, each antenna power <b>401</b>, <b>402</b>, which comprises for each antenna the optimized combined powers of the horizontally and vertically polarized radio frequency signals, is weighted with a corresponding weighting information and phase shifted with a corresponding phase information. The weighting information is individual for each antenna. The weighting may be based on weighting factors for adding the signal levels. Therefore, the sum of the weighting factors over all antennas may be normalised to one. As the powers are added to optimize the antenna gain Popt, the weighting information may comprise the squared weighting factors. In case of only two antennas, the weighting factors may be &#x3b3; and (1&#x2212;&#x3b3;) and consequently, the weighting information is &#x3b3;<sup>2 </sup>and (1&#x2212;&#x3b3;)<sup>2 </sup>as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In case of more than two antennas, different weighting factors may be used, wherein the sum is also one. The optimized antenna powers <b>401</b> and <b>402</b> are each weighted by their corresponding weighting information and phase shifted by their corresponding phase information and finally added resulting in the optimized received power Popt.

For example, the user equipment <b>30</b> may use the polarization association information when it selects a beam in a link setup procedure. The preferred polarization may be communicated to the base station <b>20</b>, directly or indirectly by the selection of an associated resource, which then transmits subsequent payload data <b>304</b> using this preferred polarization. Under the assumption that a payload signal with the optimal polarization is received, the user equipment <b>30</b> may combine the signals from its antennas to optimize the antenna gain. Due to the optimization of the polarization of the transmitted radio-frequency signals, communication quality may be enhanced such that a higher signal-to-noise ratio may be achieved even at lower power levels. Therefore, the above-described method may be in particular advantageous in connection with very high frequencies, for example above 30 GHz, in particular for example at 80 GHz, which may lead to the use of array antennas and increased directivity. Which in turn makes it important to select the optimal beam for whatever polarization.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">Although in the above description, the configuration data is transmitted from the base station to the user equipment, the same method may be performed in the reverse direction depending on the capabilities of the involved devices. For example, a user equipment having a correspondingly configured antenna arrangement, may also transmit configuration data indicating a first polarization of a first radio frequency signal and a second polarization of a second radio frequency signal, transmit the first radio frequency signal using the first polarization, and transmit the second radio frequency signal using the second polarization. Likewise, the base station may receive configuration data indicating a first polarization of a first radio frequency signal and a second polarization of a second radio frequency signal, receive at least one of the first radio frequency signal and the second radio frequency signal, and determine a combined power of the at least one of the first radio frequency signal and the second radio frequency signal based on the configuration data.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
