In the event that one or more of the incorporated literature and similar materials defines a term in a manner that contradicts the definition of that term in this application, this application controls.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The advent of native chemical ligation and its related techniques has revolutionized the protein and peptide chemistry field. Groundbreaking applications include the synthesis of a large variety of proteins such as histones, kinases, and RAS proteins with posttranslational modifications for driving basic research advances and the production of many proteins or enzymes for therapeutic and biotechnological purposes.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">For instance, proteins with a functionalized C-terminus are key to the synthesis of larger proteins by ligation but are difficult to generate. The native chemical ligation concept was first developed by Dawson et al. in 1994 (<i>Science </i>266, 776-779 (1994)), in which one protein or peptide with a C-terminal thioester and the other with a N-terminal cysteine selectively undergo thiol-thioester exchange and then S-to-N acyl transfer to form a larger protein or peptide (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Given that a protein with a N-terminal cysteine can be recombinantly produced, the development of the concept made it feasible to synthesize large proteins with a functionalized N-terminus.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">To expand the synthetic scope of native chemical ligation, a related technique termed expressed protein ligation in which a recombinant C-terminal intein fusion is used to generate a protein thioester was also developed for the synthesis of proteins with a functionalized C-terminus (<i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>95, 6705-6710 (1998)). Another notable related technique is peptide hydrazide ligation that uses nitrous acid or acetyl acetone to convert a chemically stable peptide hydrazide to a peptide acyl azide or a peptide acyl pyrazole and then a peptide thioester for further native chemical ligation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) (<i>Angew Chem Int Ed Engl </i>50, 7645-7649 (2011), <i>Angew Chem Int Ed Engl </i>57, 11634-11639 (2018)).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Although developed extensively, further technological improvement in protein ligation is still in great demand due to numerous limitations associated with existing ligation techniques. For instance, the production of a protein thioester using the intein fusion approach is not guaranteed for a lot of proteins. The stringent requirement for intein catalysis to generate a protein thioester prevents the processing of many fusion proteins that are expressed insolubly and hard to fold.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, the C-terminal residue of a targeted protein that is immediate to the intein N-terminus also significantly impacts the protein splicing efficiency, which leads to low splicing efficiency for residues such as proline at this site. The purification of an intein fusion also requires significant caution for avoiding premature hydrolysis.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A split intein may be used to prevent premature hydrolysis. However, such processes add more procedural complexity. Therefore, a need exists for a more facile method to functionalize a protein at its C-terminus for protein ligation that requires no enzymatic catalysis, can be broadly applied, and maintains high efficiency in different protein C-terminal sequence contexts. Various embodiments of the present disclosure address the aforementioned need.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the present disclosure pertains to methods of conjugating a molecule to a polypeptide.

In a more specific embodiment, nucleophilic moieties on molecules react with a 1-acyl-2-iminothiazolidine intermediate derived from modified thiols in order to replace 2-iminothiazolidine in a nucleophilic acyl substitution and thereby result in the conjugation of the molecule to the polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Applications and Advantages</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The methods of the present disclosure provide numerous advantages and applications.

In some embodiments, the methods of the present disclosure require no enzymatic catalysis. In some embodiments, the methods of the present disclosure can be utilized to conjugate structurally constrained protein regions to molecules.

For instance, in some embodiments, the methods of the present disclosure can be used to generate many protein-based reagents, such as ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins with C-terminal modifications. In some embodiments, the methods of the present disclosure can be used to synthesize many commercial therapeutic peptides that have a C-terminal amide, such as exenatide, human calcitonic, salmon calcitonin, eufuvirtide, bivalirudin, teriparatide, thymosin alpha, liraglutide, lixisenatide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, taspoglutide, histone H2A, RNAse H, pexiganan, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Reference will now be made to more specific embodiments of the present disclosure and experimental results that provide support for such embodiments. However, Applicants note that the disclosure below is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter in any way.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example 1. Activated Cysteine-Directed Protein Ligation</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this Example, Applicants utilized a small molecule to cyanylate a cysteine in a recombinant protein. The experimental results demonstrate that cysteine's N-side amide bond was directly activated in mild aqueous conditions to undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution with a number of amines including hydrazine that can be used for further protein ligation. Applicants demonstrated the versatility of this activated cysteine-directed protein ligation technique with the successful synthesis of ubiquitin conjugates, ubiquitin-like protein conjugates, histone H2A with a posttranslational modification, RNAse H that actively hydrolyzed RNA, and exenatide that is a commercial therapeutic peptide.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Applicants developed the method in this Example based on an industrial chemical process known as leather tanning by cyanides. Cyanide salts that reduce disulfide bonds in proteins were used in the early 20<sup>th </sup>century to treat animal hides and wools. During the process, a cyanide covalently attaches to a protein cysteine to form a thiocyanato group that undergoes reversible intramolecular addition with the cysteine N-amide to generate a 1-acyl-2-iminothiazolidine intermediate. The amide bond in this intermediate is significantly weakened in comparison to a regular protein amide and therefore slowly hydrolyzes to split the protein (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The aforementioned reaction was utilized to map protein sequences and replace cyanide salts with other cyanylating reagents such as 2-nitro-5-thiocyanatobenzoic acid (NTCB) that transfers the cyano group directly to a reduced protein cysteine for avoiding the formation of highly toxic cyanide wastes. Applicants reasoned that a strongly nucleophilic amine provided in the reaction mixture might undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution with the 1-acyl-2-iminothiazolidine intermediate to replace 2-iminothiazolidine and therefore the hydrolysis process might be effectively curbed and a new protein ligation technique might be developed.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Applicants named the aforementioned novel technique as activated cysteine-directed protein ligation. Since this ligation is chemically based, Applicants expected it to be highly controllable, selective, and versatile such as functioning for proteins both soluble and insoluble and undertaking in both native and denatured conditions. To demonstrate the feasibility of this new ligation, Applicants synthesized Ac-Xxx-Cys-NH<sub>2 </sub>dipeptides in which the Xxx identity varied between seven native amino acids including proline and carried out their reactions with equivalent amounts of NTCB and then ligation with propargylamine in a 1:1 DMF/H<sub>2</sub>O solvent. Applicants' results showed that all dipeptides reacted with propargylamine to form desired products with varied yields (Table 1).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Yields of dipeptide ligation with propargylamine.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Ligation</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Peptide</entry><entry>Amount (g)</entry><entry>products</entry><entry>Amount (g)</entry><entry>Yield (%)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Gly-Cys-OMe</entry><entry>0.6</entry><entry>Gly-Pa</entry><entry>0.12</entry><entry>56.6</entry></row><row><entry>Ala-Cys-OMe</entry><entry>0.6</entry><entry>Ala-Pa</entry><entry>0.11</entry><entry>48.6</entry></row><row><entry>Leu-Cys-OMe</entry><entry>2.0</entry><entry>Leu-Pa</entry><entry>0.7</entry><entry>87.5</entry></row><row><entry>Phe-Cys-OMe</entry><entry>1.8</entry><entry>Phe-Pa</entry><entry>0.65</entry><entry>88.3</entry></row><row><entry>Trp-Cys-OMe</entry><entry>2.5</entry><entry>Trp-Pa</entry><entry>0.8</entry><entry>78.4</entry></row><row><entry>Asp-Cys-OMe</entry><entry>0.9</entry><entry>Asp-Pa</entry><entry>0.05</entry><entry>13.8</entry></row><row><entry>Pro-Cys-OMe</entry><entry>2.0</entry><entry>Pro-Pa</entry><entry>0.16</entry><entry>25.4</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">Encouraged by Applicants' small molecule results, Applicants went on to test this new ligation technique with recombinant proteins. Ubiquitin (Ub) is natively devoid of cysteine. Applicants chose Ub as a model protein for demonstration. Applicants produced recombinant native Ub and Ub with both a G76C mutation and a C-terminal 6&#xd7;His tag (Ub-G76C-6H) in <i>E. coli </i>and purified them to homogeneity. Applicants then ligated Ub-G76C-6H with a number of amine-containing molecules, including both L- and D-amino acids (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) by adding 5 mM NTCB and a 50-1000 mM amine simultaneously to a 2 mg/mL Ub-G76C-6H solution at pH 9 for an overnight incubation at 37&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">Applicants selected seven L-amino acids for reactions to represent amino acids in different chemical categories and also different sizes. For all tested compounds including proline that has a secondary amine and two D-amino acids, Applicants obtained ligation products with high yields. After using Ni<sup>2+</sup> charged resins to simply remove unreacted intermediates, Applicants analyzed all twelve ligation products and the two original Ub and Ub-G76C-6H proteins by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis. For all analyzed proteins, their deconvoluted ESI-MS spectra displayed clearly observable monoisotopic peaks.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">Since there is no commercial software for calculating protein monoisotopic peaks, Applicants wrote a Python script to calculate all theoretical monoisotopic masses and their relative intensities for all proteins and compared them to the determined ESI-MS spectra. Applicants' results showed that determined monoisotopic masses for all proteins agreed very well with their theoretic values in terms of both molecular weight and intensity. Hydrolysis products were either non-detectable or at very low levels. To simplify the comparison, Applicants wrote another Python script to integrate deconvoluted monoisotopic peaks and then calculate the average molecular weights and intensities for all detected protein species in a particular spectrum. The final results are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">For all determined average molecular weights, the peaks matched their theoretical values with a deviation of &#xb1;0.3 Da. For all twelve ligation products, Applicants detected very few minor peaks in their ESI-MS spectra indicating that all reactions were very selective. One ligation product Ub-G76G is native Ub itself. Its ESI-MS spectrum in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> matched that of recombinantly expressed native Ub in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. So far, Applicants' data demonstrated that activated cysteine-directed protein ligation on a recombinant protein works exactly according to what Applicants proposed and this reaction is effective for amines that are primary, secondary, hydrazine, and amino acids with different configurations, characteristics, and sizes.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">The ligation with hydrazine was done in both native and denatured conditions. The results from two conditions showed minimal differences. Ubiquitin natively has a G75 residue that has the lowest steric hindrance among all amino acids. In Ub-G76C-6H, the glycine immediately N-terminal to G76C might have permitted easy processing of the ligation. Other residues that have different chemical properties and/or are sterically hindered might impede the ligation. To resolve this concern, Applicants mutated G75 in Ub-G76C-6H to six other residues that are large in size, charged, and/or having a secondary amine, recombinantly expressed them, analyzed them with ESI-MS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>), and then reacted them in a one-pot fashion with NTCB and hydrazine.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">Applicants chose hydrazine in their demonstration since its ligation products are protein hydrazides that can be coupled further with peptide hydrazide ligation for making even larger proteins. All reactions progressed well and their reaction products displayed average molecular weights matching well to their theoretic values (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>), demonstrating that the residue immediately N-terminal to the targeted cysteine has little detrimental effect on the ligation process.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">Putting a cysteine residue right after Ub G76 led to similar ligation results with hydrazine (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>D and <b>3</b>E</figref>) and with allylamine, propargylamine, and glycine. Ub has a flexible C-terminus that may facilitate the ligation. To show that the ligation may work in a more structurally constrained environment, Applicants introduced a cysteine mutation at K48 and K63, two residues in the globular region of Ub and used the two afforded Ub mutants to undergo activated cysteine-directed protein ligation with hydrazine. ESI-MS of reaction mixtures showed successful formation of two desired protein hydrazides indicating that the ligation works well in a structurally constrained protein region. Ligation both in a structurally constrained protein region and under a denatured condition is something that the traditional intein method cannot perform well. Collectively, Applicants' data strongly demonstrates the versatility of the activated cysteine-directed protein ligation technique.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">In eukaryotic cells, Ub and Ub-like proteins (Ubls) can be posttranslationally attached to proteins for their functional regulation. It has been shown that replacing the C-terminal glycine in Ub, SUMO1-3, NEEDS, and ISG15 with propargylamine using either the intein based approach or total synthesis afforded optimal probes to bind covalently to cysteine proteases that catalytically remove Ub or Ubls from their conjugated proteins in cells.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">To recapitulate these results and demonstrate the broad application scope of Applicants' activated cysteine-directed protein ligation, Applicants recombinantly expressed Ub, SUMO1-4, NEDD8, ISG15, GABARAP, GABARAPL2, UFM1, URM1, and MNSF&#x3b2; (FLAG-Ub/Ubl-GxC-6H: x denotes the terminal glycine position) that all contained a C-terminal Gly-to-Cys mutation and were also fused with a N-terminal FLAG tag and a C-terminal 6&#xd7;His tag, purified them to homogeneity, and then carried out their ligation with propargylamine in the presence of NTCB.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">ISG15, SUMO1-4, and MNSF&#x3b2; natively contain a cysteine residue. This cysteine was mutated to alanine or serine to avoid non-targeted ligation at its location. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated high ligation yields. ESI-MS analysis of all 12 products indicated their successful and efficient synthesis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). In comparison to both intein based and total synthesis approach, Applicants' method for the synthesis of these propargylamine conjugates is much simpler and easier to control. To reproduce literature results, Applicants then used synthesized Ub-propargylamine conjugate, FLAG-Ub-G76 Pa, to react with seven known cysteine deubiquitinases and observed efficient covalent adduct formation for all tested enzymes by both SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blotting (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">Applicants also performed similar tests for 7 Ubl-propargylamine conjugates and observed their covalent binding to a number of cysteine proteases as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. Some cysteine proteases such as SENP1 have only been vaguely confirmed in previous work to deconjugate corresponding Ubls such as SUMO4 shown in the gel. Given that all synthesized FLAG-Ub/Ubl-propargylamine conjugates, of which five are synthesized for the first time, can be used as activity-based probes to profile the proteome of Ub and Ubl proteases in different tissues and cells, Applicants' method that readily makes these probes available and can be performed in almost any biology lab will, in no doubt, promote their adoption for advancing Ub and Ubl biology studies. Ub and Ubls conjugated directly to 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) at their C-terminus are useful fluorogenic substrates of Ub and Ubl proteases.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">Applicants have demonstrated the synthesis of four Ub/Ubl-AMC conjugates, Ub-AMC and FLAG-SUMO1-3-AMC by Applicants' activated cysteine-directed protein ligation of their corresponding recombinantly produced Ub-G76C-6H and FLAG-SUMO1-3-GxC-6H proteins to Gly-AMC (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). Applicants' ESI-MS analysis of all four products confirmed their successful synthesis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>) and the following activity assays showed that they served as active substrates for cysteine proteases UCHL1 and SENP1, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>). Overall, Applicants' combined data of Ub and Ubl related synthesis establish the broad scope of the activated cysteine-directed protein ligation technique.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">Histone H2A can undergo posttranslational acetylation at its terminal lysine, K129. The functional investigation of this acetylation such as how it influences the structure and dynamics of the nucleosome will require the synthesis of the corresponding acetyl-histone, H2AK129ac. Applicants chose to synthesize H2AK129ac to demonstrate that their method can be applied to the synthesis of histones with C-terminal modifications. Applicants first recombinantly produced H2A-K129C-6H, a H2A protein with a K129C mutation and a C-terminal 6&#xd7;His tag and then ligated it to N<sup>&#x3b5;</sup>-acetyl-lysine with the assistance of NTCB.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">The ESI-MS spectrum of the reaction product showed the formation of H2AK129ac (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>). Applicants folded successfully H2AK129ac into a dimer with H2B and subsequently into a nucleosome (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>), making it possible to study effects of H2AK129ac on the nucleosome structure and functions.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">For all ligation reactions that Applicants performed thus far in this Example, they involved small molecules with only one amino group for avoiding side product formation. For ligation with larger molecules that have more than one amino group, one can couple Applicants' ligation method with peptide hydrazide ligation to resolve nonspecificity issues.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">To demonstrate this prospect, Applicants recombinantly produced a <i>B. halodurans </i>RNase H region with a C-terminal Cys-6&#xd7;His tag (RNH<sub>59-196</sub>-K190C-6H). Its ligation with hydrazine in the presence of NTCB led to the synthesis of RNH<sub>59-189</sub>-Ha, a protein hydrazide that Applicants processed further to undergo peptide hydrazide ligation with a 7-mer peptide, NH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CADYGRK-OH to afford a ligated product RNH<sub>59-196</sub>-K190C. ESI-MS analysis showed the successful synthesis of both RNH<sub>59-189</sub>-Ha and RNH<sub>59-196</sub>-K190C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>). Similar to what has been found in previous peptide hydrazide ligation reactions, Applicants also detected a minor hydrolysis product at 15074.6 Da. The ligated product RNH<sub>59-196</sub>-K190C was catalytically active to hydrolyze an RNA substrate as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>. However, RNH<sub>59-189</sub>-Ha was completely inactive toward this substrate. Applicants' data related to the synthesis of RNase H demonstrated that the activated cysteine-directed protein ligation can couple to peptide hydrazide ligation for ligation with large peptides or even protein fragments.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">In summary, Applicants have developed an activated cysteine-directed protein ligation technique that uses a cyanylating reagent to directly activate a cysteine in a recombinant protein for ligation with amine-containing small molecules and large peptide or protein fragments when coupling with peptide hydrazide ligation. The technique requires no enzymatic catalysis and is controllable, versatile, specific, and very simple to process. It can be broadly applied to synthesize a large variety of proteins with unique functionalities for advanced applications in both basic and applied research. One potential industrial application of the technique is to synthesize therapeutic peptides.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">Applicants have shown that the technique can be used to efficiently synthesize exenatide, a 39-mer anti-diabetic peptide that has a C-terminal amide and is therefore hard to generate using the recombinant expression approach. By expressing a 6&#xd7;His-SUMO-exenatide-S39C-SA-Strep fusion that can be largely produced in <i>E. coli </i>followed by the treatment with SUMO protease and then processing it by activated cysteine-directed ligation with L-serinamide, Applicants showed that exenatide can be easily procured.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">Similar applications to synthesize other therapeutic peptides or proteins are anticipated. Applicants' ligation technique requires the activation of cysteine, one of the two lowest occurring amino acids in proteins. Non-targeted cysteines need to be mutated. For proteins with essential cysteines, one possible solution for using Applicants' technique is to couple it with the noncanonical amino acid mutagenesis technique. Photocaged cysteines have been genetically incorporated into proteins by amber suppression. The incorporation of a photocaged cysteine to essential cysteine sites in a protein followed by activated cysteine-directed protein ligation and then decaging to release protected essential cysteines will allow the processing of proteins with non-targeted cysteines.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can, using the description herein, utilize the present disclosure to its fullest extent.
