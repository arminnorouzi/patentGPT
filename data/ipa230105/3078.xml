This is especially true when the building is located in an area that provides for desirable views. One area of a building where windows are generally not found is in a corner space. Even where large windows or sliding doors are placed adjacent to a corner space, the corner itself generally includes 2 vertical posts and solid in-fill to carry the load of the structure above it.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure is directed towards overcoming one or more of the problems identified above and/or providing advantages over prior windows, assemblies, and methods.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The inventive subject matter provides a corner window lite assembly for installation on a portion of a building, for example, a corner. The assembly can comprise a window lite that comprises a first lite portion and a second lite portion that form a first angle between 45-135 degrees, for example, about 90 degrees. The window lite can comprise a single lite piece (e.g., a single piece of glass and/or transparent plastic), or multiple lite pieces (e.g., multiple pieces of glass and/or transparent plastic) coupled together, for example, via a silicone caulking or other sealant. The assembly further comprises a frame structure that frames the window lite.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The inventive subject matter also provides a corner window lite assembly comprising a curved window lite having an outer perimeter, and a frame structure that frames the window and includes a window lite mounting flange assembly that attaches to substantially all of the outer perimeter of the curved window lite.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The frame structures for the angled and/or curved window lite may comprise a header saddle including a first saddle portion and a second saddle portion that form a second angle between 45-135 degrees, for example, about 90 degrees, a base plate including a first base portion and a second portion that form a third angle between 45-135 degrees, for example, about 90 degrees, a first vertical post that extends between the first saddle portion and the first base portion, and a second vertical post that extends between the second saddle portion and the second base portion.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some contemplated aspects, the frame structure comprises a window lite mounting flange assembly having a first flange assembly portion coupled to the header saddle, a second flange assembly portion coupled to the base plate, a third flange assembly portion coupled to the first vertical post, and a fourth flange assembly portion coupled to the second vertical post. A set of back plates may be provided that couple to the first and second saddle portions via a set of fasteners (e.g., bolt receivers and bolts). The window lite mounting flanges and assemblies may be simple or compound.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The inventive subject matter also provides methods for retrofitting a corner window lite assembly into a portion of an existing building or placing it into a structure when newly built. The corner lite assembly can comprise a frame structure that frames and/or is configured to frame an angled and/or curved window lite. The window lite may comprise a single window, or can comprise two or more windows that couple together to form the angled or curved window lite. For example, the two or more windows can be sealed together at the window juncture with a high performance silicone caulking that does not substantially affect a view. Steps of contemplated methods may comprise, for example, sandwiching a first header of a building structure between a first header saddle portion and a back plate, fastening the first header, back plate and first header saddle portions together via a set of bolts, sandwiching a second header of a building structure between a second header saddle portion and a second back plate, wherein the second header extends at an angle of between 45-135 degrees (e.g., 90 degrees) from the first header, fastening the second header, second back plate and second header saddle portions together via a second set of bolts, and fastening the base plate to one or more sills and/or flooring components of a building structure and/or slab beneath the building structure via one or more fasteners.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The frame structure and/or the corner window lite assembly can advantageously be sized, dimensioned and configured to carry a load of the portion of the building above and/or around which it is installed, for example, a corner portion of a building having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or even more floors. For example, the frame structure and/or assembly can be standardized to carry the weight of one, two, or even several posts that are each at least 2 inches&#xd7;4 inches&#xd7;6 feet, or be structurally rated to carry any conventional load that may be desired. Viewed from another perspective, the corner window lite assembly of the inventive subject matter can be retrofitted into a building corner while leaving the horizontal structural load members (e.g., header) in place, and replacing the vertical corner posts with the new assembly. Such retrofitting advantageously creates a structurally sound and economical installation of a corner window lite. The assembly may additionally or alternatively be installed in a new construction where the structural lite assembly can be placed in lieu of the conventionally framed corner.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other advantages and benefits of the disclosed system and methods will be apparent to one of ordinary skill with a review of the following detailed description.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The details of embodiments of the present disclosure, both as to their structure and operation, can be gleaned in part by study of the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like parts, and in which:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a front view of a first embodiment of a window lite assembly of the inventive subject matter;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates a rear view of the window lite assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the window lite assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> installed on a corner portion of a building;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates an interior of a room before a remodel; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates the interior of the room in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> after a remodel including installation of a window lite assembly of the inventive subject matter;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of a window lite assembly having back plates for, among other things, an open corner not having headers that extends to the corner;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of a window lite assembly having back plates for, among other things, a corner having headers or header extensions that extend to the corner;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a portion of a window lite assembly for, among other things, an open corner not having headers that extends to the corner;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a portion of a window lite assembly for, among other things, a corner having headers or header extensions that extend to the corner;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the top and bottom of a window lite assembly; and</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the sides of another window lite assembly.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The detailed description, in connection with the accompanying drawings, is intended as a description of various embodiments and is not intended to represent the only embodiments in which the disclosure may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the embodiments. However, it will be apparent that those skilled in the art will be able to understand the disclosure without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in simplified form for brevity of description. Some of the surfaces have been left out or exaggerated for clarity and ease of explanation.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The inventive subject matter provides corner and/or curved window lite assemblies, and allows for the installation of the assembly at a structural component of an existing or new building that has a solid non-transparent and non-translucent corner. For example, the assembly may be installed in a corner between two adjacent windows and/or doors (e.g., sliding glass doors). A typical building corner having two windows and/or door units placed on either side has two opposing posts that support the beam or header over the adjacent existing windows and/or doors. The space between the adjacent windows and/or doors (e.g., the corner) is solid and filled to carry the load above it. Advantageously, such a building corner can be retrofitted with an assembly of the inventive subject matter to increase the view area and create a more open effect from the interior of the building to the exterior. Installation of the assembly can have the effect of creating a continuous window lite from the two adjacent window or door installations.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, the term &#x201c;building&#x201d; should be interpreted broadly to include any structure (preferably wood-framed) with walls, including for example, a house, an apartment complex, an apartment unit, a condominium, a store, a factory, a commercial building, and/or an office space.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate an embodiment of a corner window lite assembly <b>100</b> of the inventive subject matter. Assembly <b>100</b> comprises a frame structure <b>110</b> and a window lite <b>120</b>. Frame structure <b>110</b> may be integral with window lite receiving flange assembly <b>170</b>, and be made of a metal (such as aluminum and/or steel) and/or other suitable material(s) to carry, or assist in carrying, the load of the building structure where assembly <b>100</b> will be installed (e.g., carry load of the load-bearing structure assembly <b>100</b> is replacing). This new frame and window lite assembly <b>100</b> replaces the wood framed vertical load members (typically 4&#xd7;4 posts), and may be installed to introduce a corner lite at a previously solid filled corner.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Frame structure <b>110</b> comprises a header saddle <b>160</b>, which is sized and dimensioned to couple with a header of the building structure. Header saddle <b>160</b> comprises a first portion <b>160</b>A, a second portion <b>160</b>B, a third portion <b>160</b>C, a fourth portion <b>160</b>D, and one or more sets of bolt receivers <b>165</b> for fastening to the header and/or a back plate as further described below. An angle A is formed by first and second portions <b>160</b>A and <b>160</b>B, an angle B is formed between first and third portions <b>160</b>A and <b>160</b>C, and an angle C is formed between third and fourth portions <b>160</b>C and <b>160</b>D. Angle A may be, for example, between 10-175 degrees (e.g., between 45-135 degrees, between 70-110 degrees, about 90 degrees). Similarly, angle B may be any suitable angle, but will generally be about 90 degrees as most headers form about a 90 degree angle. Angle C may also be, for example, between 10-175 degrees (e.g., between 45-135 degrees, between 70-110 degrees, about 90 degrees). As used herein, the terms &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; and &#x201c;about&#x201d; should be interpreted to mean within 10%. Thus, the term &#x201c;about 90 degrees&#x201d; should be interpreted to mean 81-99 degrees, inclusive. It is also contemplated that in some embodiments, the header saddle may be linear, and/or may be curved.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Frame structure <b>110</b> further comprises one or more vertical posts <b>150</b> and a bottom plate <b>130</b>. Vertical posts <b>150</b> extend between header saddle <b>160</b> and a bottom plate <b>130</b>, and are in some embodiments metal vertical posts <b>150</b> that are each affixed to a metal header saddle <b>160</b> and a metal bottom plate <b>130</b>. Bottom plate <b>130</b> includes a first portion <b>130</b>A and a second portion <b>130</b>B, which may form an angle D. Angle D may be any suitable angle, for example, between 10-175 degrees (e.g., between 45-135 degrees, between 70-110 degrees, about 90 degrees). Often, but not always, portions <b>160</b>C and <b>160</b>D will be parallel to portion <b>130</b>A and <b>130</b>B, respectively, and angle C and angle D will be the same or substantially the same. In the embodiment shown, the combination of header saddle <b>160</b>, vertical posts <b>150</b> and bottom plate <b>130</b> forms a frame around the perimeter of window lite <b>120</b>. Window lite <b>120</b> is a glass or other transparent and/or translucent material that allows a person inside the building to see out, and is coupled to one or more window lite receiving flange assembly portions that make up window lite receiving flange assembly <b>170</b> that extend from the header saddle <b>160</b>, vertical posts <b>150</b>, and/or bottom plate <b>130</b>. The flange assembly(ies) <b>170</b> can have any suitable height, width, and thickness, and can comprise a single piece or multiple pieces and/or portions (e.g., 4 separate portions with each portion having between 2-50, between 2-10, between 2-5 pieces that join together as further described below).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is contemplated that the frame structure can be of any suitable height and width, for example, based on the solid filled-in portion of the building the assembly will replace. The frame structure may have a height of between 1 and 50 feet, between 3 and 25 feet, between 5 and 25 feet, between 5 and 10 feet, or any other suitable height. The frame structure may have a width of between 3 inches and 10 feet, between 3 inches and 5 feet, between 5 inches and 4 feet, between 1 and 3 feet, or any other suitable width. The frame structure may also have any suitable height to width ratio, including for example between 1:20 and 20:1, between 1:10 and 10:1, between 1:5 and 5:1, between 2:1 and 20:1, between 2:1 and 10:1, at least 2:1, at least 3:1, at least 4:1, at least 5:1, at least 8:1, or any other suitable ratio. The height of the frame structure can be considered a vertical height between an uppermost portion of the header saddle and a bottommost portion of the bottom (base) plate. The width of the frame structure can be considered a horizontal line between outermost portions of the vertical posts (or header saddle where the header saddle extends past the vertical posts).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some contemplated embodiments, the frame structure <b>110</b> can be made of a single piece of metal or other material. In other embodiments, the frame structure <b>110</b> can comprise separate pieces that are assembled together.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The window lite may also be of any suitable height and width, for example, to have about the same height as adjacent windows and/or window portions of sliding doors. The window lite (which may comprise one or more transparent and/or translucent pieces) may have a height of between 1 and 50 feet, between 3 and 25 feet, between 5 and 25 feet, between 5 and 10 feet, or any other suitable height. The window lite may have a width of between 3 inches and 10 feet, between 3 inches and 5 feet, between 5 inches and 4 feet, between 1 and 3 feet, or any other suitable width.

Given the appeal of having a corner lite between two existing windows or doors that are on each side of a building corner, the new assembly is a low cost and elegant way that increases the view and light at what was once a solid (non-transparent and non-translucent) corner keeping intact the horizontal structural components (e.g., headers and slab and/or sills) of the building which are expensive to alter to get a similar effect. The assembly can give the effect of creating a continuous window lite from the two adjacent window or door installations; increasing the view area and creating an open effect from the interior of the building to the exterior. The new assembly can replace existing structural elements engineered to carry the appropriate building loads.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For ease of installation, it may be desirable to have an existing structure with a post support present over and/or under each adjacent window and/or door (e.g., one or more horizontal headers and/or one or more sills).
