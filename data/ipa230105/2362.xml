end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Epoxy resins, also known as polyepoxides, represent one of the main commercial classes of resins used for the production of thermoset polymers. The conversion of the epoxy resin into a thermoset polymer is carried out by means of a step known as a curing or hardening reaction, responsible for the transformation of low molecular weight monomers into a three-dimensional macromolecular network. This transformation is promoted by the use of crosslinking agents, also known as hardeners or curing agents, which form an extended and typically irreversible network. Crosslinked epoxy resins typically demonstrate very high mechanical properties, excellent chemical resistance and dielectric properties, and as a result are useful in applications such as high performance coatings, engineering and aerospace.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">While epoxy resins based on the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (BPA), also known as DGEBA or BADGE, are frequently used, BPA has been recognized as an endocrine disruptor and reprotoxic substance. The ability of BPA to leach from these resins under certain temperature and pH conditions has led to significant safety concerns and efforts to develop alternative BPA-free epoxy resins.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furan derivatives, more specifically furandicarboxylic acids (FDCA) and furandimethanols (FDME) can be produced from bio-based sources, such as different sugar sources, and even by fermentative routes. FDCA can be found in different isomeric forms: the 2,3, 2,4- and 2,5-isomers, although only the latter has been proposed as a starting point for a BPA-free epoxy resin. Studies exploring the singularities of 2,3- and 2,4-FDCA isomers are scarce due to the absence of competitive production routes to obtain these chemicals, although . Thiyagarajan et al. (ACS Sustainable Chem. Eng. 2019, 7, 22, 18505-18516) describes the synthesis and properties of polyesters obtained by combining 2,4- and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acids with ethylene glycol, 1,3-propandiol, or 1,4-butanediol.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Production of 2,4-FDCA from renewable sources using a direct fermentation process as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2020/0277639 can change this scenario and provide the 2,4-FDCA isomer with low environmental impact and higher cost competitiveness.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is therefore a need for improved epoxy resins, preferably having increased bio-based content, that can be used to provide thermoset polymers with chemical, thermal and mechanical properties suitable to replace DGEBA resins in applications including coatings, composites, engineering applications, adhesives, construction and electronics.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure provides a diglycidyl ether or ester having a composition according to Formula 1:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="18.71mm" wi="73.41mm" file="US20230002363A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">wherein X is selected from the group consisting of CH<sub>2 </sub>and CO, wherein when X is CH<sub>2</sub>, Y is selected from the group consisting of CH<sub>2 </sub>and CO, and wherein when X is CO, Y is CH<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">In an embodiment, the diglycidyl ester has a composition according to Formula 2:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="23.37mm" wi="73.41mm" file="US20230002363A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">In an embodiment, the diglycidyl ether has a composition according to Formula 3:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="18.71mm" wi="73.41mm" file="US20230002363A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0015" num="0011">In an embodiment, the diglycidyl ester has a composition according to Formula 4:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-C00004" he="21.34mm" wi="73.41mm" file="US20230002363A1-20230105-C00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0017" num="0012">The present disclosure also provides a method of making a diglycidyl ester, the method comprising: reacting 2,4-FDCA with an allyl halide to form an ester having a composition according to Formula 2a:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-C00005" he="19.98mm" wi="72.98mm" file="US20230002363A1-20230105-C00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0019" num="0000">and; epoxidizing the ester to form the diglycidyl ester having a composition according to Formula 2:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-C00006" he="23.37mm" wi="73.41mm" file="US20230002363A1-20230105-C00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0021" num="0013">In an embodiment, the 2,4-FDCA is from renewable sources.

These formulations advantageously provide high mechanical properties, high thermal resistance, controlled exothermicity and improved biogenic carbon when compared to typical bisphenol A resins. Further, these formulations are suitable for curing at lower temperatures when compared to typical bisphenol A resins, leading to less energy intensive processes and therefore more environmentally friendly thermoset polymers. Moreover, cured epoxy resins produced with the inventive diglycidyl ethers and esters provide higher tenacity than otherwise equivalent cured epoxy resins produced with BPA-based diglycidyl ethers or esters. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that these improved properties result from  the unique structural features attributed to the replacement of BPA by FDCA or FDME in the core moiety of the molecule. The disclosure herein advantageously provides one skilled in the art with the ability to overcome one of the most commonly observed limitations of BPA-based epoxides, which is the low tenacity and high brittleness that can negatively impact the final use of thermoset parts produced with such epoxy resins.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Diglycidyl Ethers and Esters</heading><p id="p-0058" num="0041">The diglycidyl ethers and esters disclosed herein include diglycidyl ethers and esters of 2,4-furandicarboxylic acid (2,4-FDCA) and 2,4-furandimethanol (2,4-FDME).
