Specifically, psilocybin is considered a 5-hydroxytryptaminergic (serotonergic) psychedelic, as distinguished from other tryptamines such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT), ergolines such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and phenethylamines such as mescaline. Psilocybin was first isolated from psilocybe mushrooms and later synthesized in a laboratory.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are several common diseases, disorders, and conditions for which no adequate treatment, therapies or cure exist, including:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0004">Anxiety Disorders: Anxiety disorders are a class of psychiatric disorders that involve extreme fear or worry. Oftentimes, anxiety disorders interfere with daily activities, such as job performance, school work, and relationships. Anxiety disorders have a variety of causes, including changes in the brain, environmental stress, and genetics. Examples of anxiety disorders include acute stress disorder, anxiety due to a medical condition, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, panic attack, a phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, substance-induced anxiety disorder, and selective mutism.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0005">Headache Disorders: Headache disorders are characterized by recurrent headaches and are among the most common disorders of the nervous system.

In some embodiments, a pre-administration psychological support session may be held on the same day as and prior to psilocybin administration.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0250">In some embodiments, the subject may participate in one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or eight pre-administration psychological support sessions. In some embodiments, the subject may participate in at least two pre-administration psychological support sessions. In some embodiments, the subject may participate in at least three pre-administration psychological support sessions. In some embodiments, the subject may participate in pre-administration psychological support sessions at least once per week, for at least two or three weeks prior to the psilocybin session. In some embodiments, the subject may additionally participate in a pre-administration psychological support session the day before the psilocybin session.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0251">The pre-administration psychological support sessions may be individual sessions, wherein a subject meets one-on-one with a therapist. In some embodiments, the psychological support sessions may be group sessions, wherein more than one subject meets with a single therapist, or more than one therapist. In some embodiments, one or more of the subject's family members or friends may be present at the pre-administration psychological support session(s).</p><p id="p-0248" num="0252">In some embodiments, the goals of the pre-administration session may include (i) establishing therapeutic alliance between subject and therapist; (ii) answering the subject's questions and addressing any concerns; and/or (iii) demonstrating and practicing the skills of self-directed inquiry and experiential processing. In some embodiments, the pre-administration psychological support sessions focus on discussion of possible psilocybin effects, and/or preparing subjects for the dosing session by practicing relevant therapeutic techniques to reduce avoidance and anxiety, eliciting relevant therapeutic goals, building rapport, and/or establishing therapeutic alliance. During the psychological support session, skills of self-directed inquiry and experiential processing may be demonstrated and/or practiced.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0253">In some embodiments, breathing exercises meant to promote calm and/or ease anxiety may be demonstrated and/or practiced. In some embodiments, the breathing exercise comprise instructing the subject to focus on their breath and/or sensations associated with the breath throughout the body. For example the subject may be instructed to breathe in for a count of four, to hold their breath for a moment, and then to breathe out for a count of eight. In some embodiments, the therapist and subject may discuss the most helpful ways to support in case of emotional distress during the psilocybin session. In some embodiments, the subject is given access (e.g., online access) to materials concerning the safety and mechanism of action of psilocybin.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0254">In some embodiments, the pre-administration psychological support sessions will serve to establish a therapeutic goal for the psilocybin session. In some embodiments, the subject suggests the therapeutic goal for herself or himself. In some embodiments, the therapist suggests the therapeutic goal to the subject. In some embodiments, the subject is reminded of the therapeutic goal during the pre-administration psychological support session.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0255">In some embodiments, the therapists are trained to counsel the subject before, during, and/or after the psilocybin sessions. In some embodiments, the therapist will have mental health training. In some embodiments, the therapist will be a clinical psychologist, a psychiatrist, a social worker, a doctor or a nurse. In some embodiments, the therapist will meet the following criteria:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0256">Demonstrate independent clinical experience with direct subject care in areas that require counselling and psychotherapeutic skills;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0257">Current unrestricted professional license and/or good professional standing with no history of suspension, professional misconduct or disciplinary actions; and/or</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0258">High level of openness to learning new approaches and receiving feedback.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><heading id="h-0018" level="2">Psychological Support During Psilocybin Sessions</heading><p id="p-0252" num="0259">During the treatment session, the subject may be supervised by one or more trained therapists. The therapist supervising the subject during the psilocybin session may be the same therapist from the subject's pre-administration psychological support session(s), or may be a different therapist. The therapist(s) may provide psychological support to the subject as necessary. As used herein, the term &#x201c;psychological support&#x201d; refers to any measure(s) taken by the therapist during the subject's psilocybin session to ensure the safety of the subject and maximize the clinical effectiveness of the psilocybin session. For example, the psychological support may be anything done by the therapist to (1) to ensure psychological safety of the subject; (2) to allow the subject's subjective experience to unfold naturally within the boundaries of the therapeutic intention set at the preparation; (3) to maintain participant's attention and awareness on the experience of the present moment thus allowing exposure and processing of the challenging emotional states and personal memories; and/or (4) to generate insights and solutions for the resolution of challenging personal situations, conflicts and traumatic experiences. In some embodiments, support can be in the form of therapeutic touch, verbal reassurance, guided imagery and/or relaxation or breathing exercises. In some embodiments, the support may comprise reminders, encouragement, or active guiding. Typically, only one technique is applied at a time to allow for minimal intervention and interference with the subject's unique process.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0260">In some embodiments, the main therapeutic goals of the therapist during the psilocybin session are to (i) minimize extreme anxiety, and (ii) provide appropriate support that enables the skills and processes of self-directed inquiry and experiential processing. In some embodiments, the therapist demonstrates genuine presence, patience, curiosity, and/or openness during the psilocybin session. &#x201c;Presence&#x201d; refers to being totally available and present with the subject during all stages of the psilocybin session, and exuding calmness at all times. &#x201c;Curiosity&#x201d; refers to interest and willingness to understand the subject's experience, without making assumptions. &#x201c;Patience&#x201d; means that the therapist facilitates the participant taking as much time as needed to explore their experiences without controlling the natural urge to help or direct the experience. &#x201c;Openness&#x201d; is the ability of the therapist to remain cognitively and experientially open, including a capacity to be curious about how the subject's mind may uniquely choreograph the unfolding content of a session. This includes welcoming all emotions and expressions that might occur.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0261">In some embodiments, the psychological support may comprise curious questioning. In this technique, brief, but detailed, questioning of subjects is used to help the subjects shift and sustain their attention towards different levels of cognition and emotions (&#x201c;How does that make you feel?&#x201d;) Due to the applicability across a range of mental states and within various settings, the technique of curious questioning can typically be used safely and consistently during the psilocybin session, regardless of the quality or intensity of the experience of each subject.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0262">In some embodiments, the level of psychological support will vary during the various stages of the subject's psilocybin experience (e.g., the initial stage, the early stage, the peak stage, and the late stage). In some embodiments, the type of psychological support will vary during the various stages of the subject's psilocybin experience (e.g., the initial stage, the early stage, the peak stage, and the late stage). Because non-dual, ego-dissolution or &#x201c;unitive&#x201d; experiences have been shown to positively correlate with the magnitude and durability of the clinical response, the therapist will, in some embodiments, attend to such states with particular care.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0263">In some embodiments, a subject may experience of a compromised sense of self during the subject's psilocybin experience. In some embodiments, this is interpreted from a psychoanalytic perspective as a disruption of ego-boundaries, which results in a blurring of the distinction between self-representation and object-representation, and precludes the synthesis of self-representations into a coherent whole. In some embodiments, non-dual, ego-dissolution or &#x201c;unitive&#x201d; experiences refer to an altered state of consciousness in which there is a reduction in the self-referential awareness that defines normal waking consciousness, resulting in a compromised sense of &#x201c;self&#x201d; and instead only a undivided background awareness, often characterised by a sense of unity or &#x201c;oneness&#x201d; that exceeds sensory or cognitive apprehension. In some embodiments, a non-dual experience is state of consciousness in which the subject-object dichotomy in normal waking consciousness is substituted for a unified background awareness that is centreless and undivided. In some embodiments, an ego dissolution experience is a spontaneously occurring state of consciousness where there is a reduction in the self-referential awareness that defines normal waking consciousness, resulting in a compromised sense of &#x201c;self&#x201d;. In some embodiments, a unitive experience is an experience characterised by a sense of unity or &#x201c;oneness&#x201d; that exceeds sensory or cognitive apprehension.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0264">At the initial and early stage of the psilocybin session, psychological support may be used to reduce severe and/or prolonged anxiety. Anxiety prior to or during the onset of psilocybin effects is not uncommon, and the therapists may be specially trained to recognize and actively manage subjects through such periods of anxiety until the subject is comfortable enough to continue on their own. In some embodiments, therapists validate the subject's feelings of anxiety without providing interpretations of perceptual disturbances or guiding subjects towards a particular image or memory, other than encouraging them to stay relaxed and open to the emergent experiences. For example, in some embodiments, the therapist may help alleviate anxiety using a grounding exercise. In such an exercise, the subject may be encouraged to pay attention to the sounds around them or to sensations on their skin when touching the bed/couch, ground, or other objects.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0265">At the initial and early stage of the psilocybin session, the therapist may encourage the subject to lie down, practice relaxation and breathing exercises, and/or listen to calming music. In some embodiments, the therapist may remind the subject of the intention for the treatment session. For example, the therapist may ask the subject &#x201c;What does feeling better or recovery feel like?&#x201d; or any number of similar questions. Such reminders prior to the onset of or at the onset of psilocybin effects provide an implicit direction for the subjective experience during the psilocybin session. In some embodiments, the therapist may remind the subject that their primary task during this session is to simply collect new and interesting experiences which can then be discussed with the therapist after the session. The therapist may remind the participant of the purpose of the psilocybin therapy and the role of experiential processing, namely allowing the participant to be open and curious to whatever arises and encountering thoughts and feelings previously unknown to them. In some embodiments, the therapist emphasizes that this process inherently requires letting go and a willing passivity to the psychedelic experience.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0266">During the acute onset of action, the subject might experience perceptual changes in visual, auditory or olfactory modes, and a range of unusual physical sensations. These experiences could be anxiety-provoking. In some embodiments, the therapist may practice reassuring &#x201c;arm holding&#x201d;. This is where, upon the subject's request, a therapist will place his or her hand on the subject's wrist, arm, hand, or shoulder, as a way of helping the subject feel secure during this phase. This exercise may have been previously practiced during the pre-administration psychological support session.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0267">In some embodiments, the therapist may encourage the subject to put on an eye mask, such as a Mindfold eyeshade. In some embodiments, the therapist encourages the subject to put on the eye mask before, during, or after the onset of the psilocybin's effects.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0268">In some embodiments, the therapist may encourage the subject to put on headphones and listen to music. In some embodiments, the headphones reduce outside noise (e.g., &#x201c;noise-cancelling&#x201d; headphones). In some embodiments, the music is calming music such as instrumental (e.g., classical) music. In some embodiments, the music comprises nature sounds and/or the sound of moving water (e.g., ocean sounds). In some embodiments, the music comprises isochronic tones. In some embodiments, the music comprises moments of silence. In some embodiments, the music is emotionally evocative. In some embodiments, the music comprises a playlist which mirrors the pharmacodynamics of a typical high-dose psilocybin session: the initial stage, the early stage, the peak stage, and the late stage. In some embodiments, listening to music helps the subject to focus on their internal experience.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0269">In case of prolonged anxiety or distress, therapists may, in some embodiments, actively guide participants through such experiences without interpreting or judging the experiences or giving advice. Once participants are comfortable, the therapist may encourage them to again engage in introspection.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0270">During the peak and late stages of the psilocybin session, the therapist may encourage subjects to face and explore their experience, including the challenging ones. Therapists may direct subjects to participate self-directed inquiry and experiential processing to develop a different perspective on their personal challenges and conflicts, and to generate their own solutions. Such self-generated insights are not only therapeutic because of the emotional resolution, but also empowering to subjects.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0271">As used herein, the term &#x201c;self-directed inquiry&#x201d; refers to directing attention to internal states. Subjects are encouraged to be curious about experiences in the present moment, including foreground and background thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations. During the preparation and integration stages, this inquiry might mean asking specific and detailed questions to help direct attention to internal states. However, during the period of drug action, inquiry might simply mean an attitude of openness to inner experiences.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0272">As used herein, &#x201c;experiential processing&#x201d; refers to a participant's ability to maintain full attention on the experiences that come into awareness through self-directed enquiry. This includes a willingness and ability to be with and/or move &#x2018;in and through&#x2019; even uncomfortable or challenging thoughts, feelings, sensations or emotions, until discomfort is diminished or resolved.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0273">In some embodiments, the therapist will employ a transdiagnostic therapy. In some embodiments, the transdiagnostic therapy is a Method of Levels (MOL) therapy. In still further embodiments, the MOL therapy comprises Self-Directed Enquiry and Experiential Processing. Typically, MOL uses brief, but detailed, curious questioning to help subjects shift and sustain their attention towards different levels of cognition and emotions (Carey, 2006; Carey, Mansell &#x26; Tai, 2015). The emphasis within MOL is on identifying and working with a subject's underlying distress as opposed to just their symptoms. Such MOL related methods and techniques can include: (1) Self-directed enquiry&#x2014;directing attention to internal states. Participants are encouraged to be curious about experiences in the present moment, including foreground and background thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations; during the preparation and integration stages, such enquiry can mean asking specific and detailed questions to help direct attention to internal states, although for some embodiments, during the period of drug action, enquiry can refer to an attitude of openness to inner experiences; and (2) Experiential processing&#x2014;sustained focus on the experience; refers to a participant's ability to maintain full attention on the experiences that come into awareness through self-directed enquiry. This includes a willingness and ability to be with and/or move &#x2018;in and through&#x2019; even uncomfortable or challenging thoughts, feelings, sensations or emotions, until discomfort is diminished or resolved.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0274">In some embodiments, the psychological support comprises mindfulness-based therapy or CBT cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In some embodiments, the psychological support is informed by a functional theory of human behavior called Perceptual Control Theory.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0275">Occasionally, the subject will try to avoid emerging experiences or distract him/herself while trying to regain cognitive control over the unusual state of their mind. Such distractions may take different forms. For example, the subject might want to engage in a conversation or prematurely describe in detail their experience, visions or insights. When this occurs, the therapist may aim to remain as silent as possible, thereby enabling the subject and his/her inner experience to direct the course of the psilocybin session. In some embodiments, the therapist may use active listening skills paired with prompts to encourage the subject to continue focusing attention on present experiences, particularly if the participant engages the therapist in conversation. In another example, a subject might ask to go to the bathroom or have a drink of water. The sudden and urgent character of such requests might suggest that they are really trying to avoid emerging material. In such cases, the therapist may encourage the subject to stay with the experience by simply redirecting their attention. For example, the therapist may say something like, &#x201c;We will take a bathroom break at the end of this piece of music&#x201d; or &#x201c;I will get you water in a little while. Why don't you put the eye shades back on and relax for a few minutes?&#x201d; If the subject is trying to avoid a difficult experience, they might listen to the suggestion and relax.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0276">In some embodiments, spontaneous movement such as shaking, stretching or dancing while engaging with the experience is accepted and often encouraged, unless the movement seems to be a way to distract oneself from the experience. In some embodiments, if the subject continues to move around a lot, reminders to periodically return to a lying down position and to actively focus inwards may be provided.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0277">The therapist is not required to understand, support or even have an opinion about the nature or content of the subject's experiences, but the therapist may validate them and convey openness toward the subject's own view of them without dismissing or pathologizing any experience based on its unusual content. These experiences may provide the subject with a perspective that goes beyond identification with their personal narrative. In some embodiments, the therapist will validate one or more of the subject's experiences. In some embodiments, validation of the experiences simply means acknowledging the courage of opening up to the experience and the possibility that any experience will serve the intention of the session.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0278">In some embodiments, a therapist provides psychological support for approximately 4-8 hours immediately after administration of the psilocybin. In some embodiments, the therapist uses guided imagery and/or breathing exercises to calm the subject and/or focus the subject's attention. In some embodiments, the therapist holds the hand, arm, or shoulder of the subject. In some embodiments, the therapist counsels the subject to do one or more of the following: (1) to accept feelings of anxiety, (2) to allow the experience to unfold naturally, (3) to avoid psychologically resisting the experience, (4) to relax, and/or (5) to explore the subject's own mental space.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0279">In some embodiments, the therapist avoids initiating conversation with the subject, but responds if the subject initiates conversation. Typically, active intervention is kept to a minimum during the treatment experience. In some embodiments, the subject is encouraged to explore their own mental space, and simple guided imagery may be used to assist relaxation. &#x201c;Guided imagery&#x201d; refers to an exercise wherein the subject is asked to imagine a scene (e.g., &#x201c;Invite a scene, perhaps a landscape, and tell me where you find yourself&#x201d;; &#x201c;Imagine a place that feels safe to you.&#x201d;)</p><heading id="h-0019" level="2">Post-Administration Psychological Support Session</heading><p id="p-0273" num="0280">In some embodiments, subjects may be encouraged to engage in post-administration integration sessions with their therapist. Integration is a process that involves processing, or embodying, a psychedelic experience within a therapeutic context. The process initially begins by the subject verbalising and reflecting upon any experience from the psilocybin session, and discussing it openly with their therapist. Successful integration of a psilocybin experience accommodates for emotional changes and comprises of translating experiences into new insights, perspectives, and subsequently new behaviors that can be used to benefit the subject's quality of life. New perspectives might in turn influence the participant's current knowledge or values and lead to new ways of relating to cognitions, emotions, behaviors and physical experiences.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0281">In some embodiments, the goals and supportive methods used by the therapist throughout integration sessions should remain consistent, regardless of the intensity or content of the subjective experience explored by the subject. That said, the methods of support used by the therapist should accommodate for the full range of experiences a subject might have faced.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0282">The integration process is not one that should be limited to the sessions with the therapist, and is a process that will likely continue to unfold beyond the visits in clinic. The therapist might encourage the participant to use methods such as spending time in nature, exercise, or creative expression to help facilitate the process further. The subject might also be encouraged to discuss experiences with their friends, family, and/or support network. The role of the integration sessions is not to cover and work on every experience, but to empower the participant by building their capacity to experientially process information safely. This enables the participant to continue self-directed integration, even outside of study visits.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0283">In some embodiments, the subject participates in at least one psychological support session after administration of the psilocybin (&#x201c;post-administration psychological support session&#x201d;). In some embodiments, a post-administration psychological support session may be held on the same day as the psilocybin session, after the effects of the psilocybin have substantially worn off. In some embodiments, a post-administration psychological support session may be held the day after the psilocybin session. In some embodiments, a post-administration psychological support session may be held two days after the psilocybin session. In some embodiments, a post-administration psychological support session may be held three days after the psilocybin session. In some embodiments, a post-administration psychological support session may be held about one week after the psilocybin session. In some embodiments, a post-administration psychological support session may be held about two weeks after the psilocybin session. In some embodiments, a post-administration psychological support session may be held about one month after the psilocybin session. In some embodiments, a post-administration psychological support session may be held about three months after the psilocybin session. In some embodiments, a post-administration psychological support session may be held about six months after the psilocybin session. In some embodiments, a post-administration psychological support session may be held about twelve months after the psilocybin session.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0284">In some embodiments, the subject may participate in one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or eight post-administration psychological support sessions. In some embodiments, the subject may participate in at least two, or at least three post-administration psychological support sessions.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0285">The post-administration psychological support sessions may be individual sessions, wherein a subject meets one-on-one with a therapist. In some embodiments, the psychological support sessions may be group sessions, wherein more than one subject meets with a single therapist, or more than one therapist. In some embodiments, one or more of the subject's family members or friends may be present at the post-administration psychological support session(s).</p><p id="p-0279" num="0286">In some embodiments, the post-administration psychological support session may focus on integration of the psilocybin experience. Integration may involve processing a psychedelic experience in a therapeutic context. Integration may comprise psychological and somatic processing of the experience and a successful assimilation of insights into the subject's life for the purpose of growth, healing and/or well-being. During an integration session, a subject may be encouraged to talk about and reflect upon their experiences during the psilocybin session. In some embodiments, integration may comprise an external expression of the psilocybin experience, such as choice of words, tone of voice, gestures, and/or particular physical activities (yoga, exercise, bodywork, etc.) In some embodiments, integration comprises creatively expressing any insights or experiences gained during a psilocybin experience, for example through poetry, art, music/singing, dance, writing or drawing.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0287">In some embodiments, the subject may be encouraged to reflect on both the thoughts and the feelings that he or she underwent during the psilocybin session, as well as to express those ideas and emotions into a concrete form that can serve as a tool for continuing to remember and integrate those lessons into the future. In some embodiments, the subject may be encouraged to acknowledge and connect with the range of the emotional cognitive and physical experiences of the psilocybin session, and relate them to current experiences in their life situation. This may be accomplished, for example, by discussing them initially with their therapist, and perhaps later with their family, friends, and support circle. Integration helps accommodate changes in emotional states as new insights are generated and integrated. When further explored through oscillating attention between foreground and background thoughts and emotions, such insights may lead to natural and effortless changes in perspectives or behaviors. In some embodiments, the integration process is not limited to initial integration meetings with the therapist, but continues to unfold spontaneously through a participant's own processing and actions in everyday life.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0288">In the case of a low-intensity experience, the integration process might focus on the mental content that emerged during the hours of relaxation and introspection. This might also include reactions to what might have been an unremarkable experience, such as feeling of disappointment, anger, relief etc.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="2">Psychological Support Provided Remotely</heading><p id="p-0282" num="0289">In some embodiments, psychological support may be provided remotely to a subject. For example, a therapist providing psychological support may not be in the same room, the same building, or in the same facility as a subject. Remote psychological support may be provided, for example by telephone (i.e., by voice call), by video call or video conference, by text, or by email.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0290">In some embodiments, a pre-administration therapy session is conducted remotely.

Binge-eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder and is characterised by the uncontrolled consumption of large volumes of food over a short time-period, causing psychological distress. To meet diagnosis, these episodes must be recurrent, occur on average at least once a week for three months, and involve three of the following: consuming food faster than normal; consuming food until uncomfortably full; consuming large amounts of food when not hungry; consuming food alone due to embarrassment; feeling disgusted, depressed, or guilty after eating a large amount of food. Compensatory behaviour associated with bulimia nervosa should not be involved, and binging should not occur during an episode of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa.</p><p id="p-0376" num="0391">Many factors have been associated with the cause of BED. High levels of depressive symptoms, body dissatisfaction, poor family cohesion, and low self-esteem are significant predictors of binge eating behaviours.</p><p id="p-0377" num="0392">The global pooled prevalence of BED is estimated as 0.9%. The prevalence is higher in women (1.4%) than in men (0.4%). An online survey of 22,397 adults with BED in the US found that only 3.2% reported receiving support from a healthcare provider.</p><p id="p-0378" num="0393">The WHO mental health survey found lifetime prevalence estimates of BED to be 1.4% with median age of onset in the late teens to early 20's.

In some embodiments, the adverse events are classified as mild, moderate, or serious. A mild AE does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject's normal level of functioning. A moderate AE produces some impairment of functioning, but is not hazardous to the subject's health. A severe AE produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a definite hazard to the subject's health. Non-limiting examples of adverse events include euphoric mood, Euphoric mood, Dissociative disorder, Hallucination, Psychotic disorder, Cognitive disorder, Disturbance in attention, Mood alterations, impaired psychomotor skills, inappropriate affect, overdose, intentional product misuse. Serious adverse events include death, life-threatening events, insubject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, Persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received psilocybin. An event is life threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction that if it had occurred in a more serious form might have caused death. For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening even though drug-induced hepatitis can be fatal. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization, may be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Such events include, but are not limited to: intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in subject hospitalization, and development of drug dependency or drug abuse.</p><p id="p-0429" num="0443">In some embodiments, treating according to the methods of the disclosure results in an improvement in an eating disorder compared to pre-treatment of about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, or about 100%, according to any one of the diary assessments, assessments by a clinical or caregiver, or clinical scales, described herein.</p><p id="p-0430" num="0444">In some embodiments, after treating according to the methods of the disclosure, the subject in need thereof has a decreased eating disorder examination short form (EDE-QS) score compared to prior to said treating.

Headache disorders are among the most common disorders of the nervous system. Headache disorders include migraine, tension-type headache, cluster headache, and chronic daily headache syndrome.</p><p id="p-0437" num="0451">In some embodiments, a method for treating cluster headaches in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of psilocybin or an active metabolite thereof is disclosed herein. In some embodiments, at least one sign or symptom of cluster headache is improved following administration of psilocybin or a metabolite thereof. In some embodiments, the sign or symptom of cluster headache is measured according to a diary assessment, a physical or psychological assessment by clinician, an imaging test, or a neurological examination.</p><p id="p-0438" num="0452">Cluster headache is a primary headache disorder and belongs to the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. The definition of cluster headaches is a unilateral headache with at least one autonomic symptom ipsilateral to the headache. Attacks are characterized by severe unilateral pain predominantly in the first division of the trigeminal nerve&#x2014;the fifth cranial nerve whose primary function is to provide sensory and motor innervation to the face. Attacks are also associated with prominent unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms and subjects often experience agitation and restlessness during attacks.</p><p id="p-0439" num="0453">In some embodiments, a subject with cluster headaches has cluster headache attacks that last from 15 to 180 minutes and occur up to eight times a day. They usually occur at approximately the same time each day and often occur at night. In some embodiments, the cluster headaches are episodic. Episodic cluster headaches (ECH) are experienced by 85-90% of subjects and are when subjects experience daily attacks for weeks to months and then have remission for months to years. Subjects often have one to two episodes a year and these are often in spring or autumn. In some embodiments, the cluster headaches are chronic cluster headaches (CCH). An individual that has CCH experiences attacks lasting more than a year without remission, or remission that lasts less than a month. CCH is experienced by 15-20% of subjects that experience cluster headaches.</p><p id="p-0440" num="0454">Approximately 0.1&#xb0; A of the population suffer from cluster headaches. The disorder has historically been considered to have a male preponderance with a high male-to-female ratio, which differs between ECH and CCH. This ratio is highest in subjects where the age of onset is between 20 to 49 years old; 7.2:1 in ECH and 11.0:1 in CCH. The ratio is lowest when the age of onset is after 50; 2.3:1 in ECH and 0.6:1 in CCH. These ratios were determined by observations of 554 cluster headache patients examined between 1963 and 1997. The authors suggested that these ratios could be related to sex hormone regulation and environmental factors. Recent studies have reported a decreasing male predominance with a ratio of 2:1.</p><p id="p-0441" num="0455">In some embodiments, a subject with cluster headaches also experiences nausea and/or vomiting.

In some embodiments, no other treatment is administered to the subject to treat the disease, disorder, or condition after administration of the psilocybin.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="2">Safety and Efficacy of Psilocybin</heading><p id="p-0492" num="0505">The present disclosure also relates to the safety and efficacy of the use of psilocybin as disclosed herein. The following is a non-exhaustive list of tests that can be used to determine the effects of psilocybin, and in particular the psilocybin formulations as disclosed herein administered as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0493" num="0506">In some embodiments, the Spatial Working Memory (SWM) test is utilized to evaluate the safety and efficacy of psilocybin as disclosed herein. SWM requires retention and manipulation of visuospatial information. Study subjects are required to find the blue tokens in the on-screen &#x2018;boxes&#x2019;. Boxes are searched by touching them to determine whether they contain a token. Once a token has been located it is &#x2018;stacked&#x2019; in a column on the right of the screen. Study subjects then search for further tokens until they have all been located. The remaining tokens will thereafter only be found in boxes that have not so far yielded a token. Study subjects are explicitly told this is the case and it they revisit a box in which a token has been found they commit a &#x2018;between error&#x2019;, the usual primary metric for this test. Occasions on which the subject revisits a box in the same search are scored as a &#x2018;within&#x2019; error. Many study subjects will adopt a search strategy via which they systematically search the array of boxes. This is also scored by the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery system and yields a &#x2018;strategy&#x2019; score. SWM performance is impaired by damage to the prefrontal cortex, especially the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Similarly, in neuroimaging studies in healthy volunteers, SWM performance is associated with activations in the dorsolateral and mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. This test takes approximately 4 min to complete.</p><p id="p-0494" num="0507">In some embodiments, the efficacy of psilocybin is evaluated using the spatial working memory between errors (SWMBE) score. In some embodiments, after treating according to the methods of the disclosure, a subject's SWMBE score decreases by between about 5% and about 100%, for example, about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, or about 100%, or more, compared to prior to treatment.</p><p id="p-0495" num="0508">In some embodiments, the efficacy of psilocybin is evaluated using the spatial working memory strategy (SWMS) score. In some embodiments, after treating according to the methods of the disclosure, a subject's SWMS score decreases by between about 5% and about 100%, for example, about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, or about 100%, or more, compared to prior to treatment.</p><p id="p-0496" num="0509">In some embodiments, the Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP) test is utilized to evaluate the safety and efficacy of psilocybin. The RVP is a measure of sustained attention outputting measures of response accuracy, target sensitivity and reaction times. In this test, the study subject is required to monitor a stream of digits from 2 to 9 for specific sequences (e.g., 3-5-7) and to acknowledge detection of the sequence by touching the on-screen response button as quickly as possible after presentation of the third digit. Digits are presented pseudorandomly to create the possibility of &#x2018;false alarm&#x2019; responses in which the first 2 digits of a sequence are not followed by a true target, e.g., when 3 is followed by a 5, but not then by a 7. In order to complete the task successfully study subjects must sustain attention to the white box in which the digits appear. Performance on this task is measured by the speed of response to the presentation of the final digit of a target, as well as the study subject's ability to detect specified sequences. This test takes approximately 7 min to complete. In some embodiments, performance on the Rapid Visual Information Processing test is reported using a RVP A Prime (RPVA) score. Higher scores RVPA scores indicated better performance. In some embodiments, after treating according to the methods of the disclosure, a subject's RVPA score increases by between about 5% and about 300%, for example, about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, about 100%, about 110%, about 120%, about 130%, about 140%, about 150%, about 160%, about 170%, about 180%, about 190%, about 200%, about 210%, about 220%, about 230%, about 240%, about 250%, about 260%, about 270%, about 280%, about 290%, or about 300%, or more, compared to prior to treatment.</p><p id="p-0497" num="0510">In some embodiments, the Paired Associates Learning (PAL) test is utilized to evaluate safety and/or efficacy of psilocybin. The PAL task is a measure of visuo-spatial memory in which study subjects are required to remember locations at which visual stimuli are located. Boxes are displayed on the screen and are &#x201c;opened&#x201d; in a randomized order. One or more of them will contain a pattern. The patterns are then displayed in the middle of the screen, one at a time and the subject must select the box in which the pattern was originally located. If the subject makes an error, the boxes are opened in sequence again to remind the subject of the locations of the patterns. Increased difficulty levels can be used to test high-functioning, healthy individuals. The primary metric for this test is the number of errors made. This test takes approximately 8 min to complete. Successful performance of the PAL test is dependent on functional integrity of the temporal lobe, particularly the entorhinal cortex. In some embodiments, the Paired Associates Learning total errors adjusted (PALTEA) score is used to assess the efficacy of psilocybin. In some embodiments, after treating according to the methods of the disclosure, a subject's PALTEA score decreases by between about 5% and about 100%, for example, about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, or about 100%, or more, compared to prior to treatment.</p><p id="p-0498" num="0511">In some embodiments, the efficacy and/or safety of psilocybin is evaluated using the cognitive flexibility panel test.</p><p id="p-0499" num="0512">In some embodiments, the Emotion Recognition Task (ERT) test is utilized to evaluate the safety and/or efficacy of psilocybin. The ERT measures the ability to identify 6 basic emotions in facial expressions along a continuum of expression magnitude. In some embodiments, the ERT is performed according to the following protocol: Subjects are shown computer morphed images derived from the facial features of real individuals each showing a specific emotion, on a screen, one at a time. Each face is displayed for 200 ms and then immediately covered up, and the subject must select which emotion the face displayed from the six options (happy, sad, anger, fear, surprise, disgust). The ERT percent correct (ERTPC) of correct responses (emotion selection) the subject made is assessed. A higher score indicates better performance. In some embodiments, after treating according to the methods of the disclosure, a subject's ERTPC increases by between about 5% and about 300%, for example, about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, about 100%, about 110%, about 120%, about 130%, about 140%, about 150%, about 160%, about 170%, about 180%, about 190%, about 200%, about 210%, about 220%, about 230%, about 240%, about 250%, about 260%, about 270%, about 280%, about 290%, or about 300%, or more, compared to prior to treatment.</p><p id="p-0500" num="0513">In some embodiments, the Intra-Extra Dimensional Set Shift (IED) test is used to evaluate the safety and/or efficacy of psilocybin. The IED consists of four 7-item subscales, each of which taps a separate aspect of the global concept &#x201c;empathy.&#x201d; In some embodiments, the Intra-Extra Dimensional Set Shift total errors (IEDYERT) score is used to assess the efficacy of psilocybin.

DSF is used to measure number storage capacity. Subjects hear a sequence of digits and are tasked to recall the sequence correctly, with increasingly longer sequences being tested in each trial. The subject's span is the longest number of sequential digits that can accurately be remembered. Digit span tasks can be given forwards or backwards, meaning that once the sequence is presented, the subject is asked to either recall the sequence in normal or reverse order. For this study, subjects will be asked to recall the sequence in the order presented, i.e., Digit Span Forward. The primary metric for this test is the number of digit sequences successfully recalled. In some embodiments, after treatment with psilocybin, a subject's Digit Span Forward score improves by about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, about 100%, about 110%, about 120%, about 130%, about 140%, about 150%, about 160%, about 170%, about 180%, about 190%, about 200%, about 210%, about 220%, about 230%, about 240%, about 250%, about 260%, about 270%, about 280%, about 290%, or about 300%, or more, as compared to prior to treatment.</p><p id="p-0504" num="0517">In some embodiments, the Five Dimension Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire (5D-ASC) is utilized to evaluate the safety and/or efficacy of psilocybin.

During this visit, subjects joined in a 2 hour group session with the study psychiatrist, lead therapist, chaperones, and all subjects to be dosed the following day. The subject was informed about what to expect during the session. All questions were answered. Subjects who had additional questions or concerns were able to have a 1:1 preparatory session with the assigned chaperone.</p><p id="p-0566" num="1230">Visit 3 (V3): Drug Administration (Day 0): The subject was asked to eat a light breakfast at least two hours prior to coming to the clinic for study drug administration. On Day 0 (V3), the subject underwent the SSTS, had vital signs obtained, medications reviewed, AEs recorded and eligibility reviewed prior to being randomized to study drug. The study drug was administered to up to six subjects simultaneously in individual beds separated by a curtain. The subject was invited to put on eyeshades and headphones, lie down and listen to calming music for the rest of the session (six hours). The subject was supported 1:1 with a chaperone and supervised by the study psychiatrist and lead therapist.</p><p id="p-0567" num="1231">The effects of psilocybin usually started about 20 to 30 min after administration, becoming most intense in the first 90 to 120 min and gradually subsiding in about 5 to 6 hours. The subjects were asked to remain in the room for the duration of the session regardless of the intensity of the effects, preferably lying down and mostly silent unless they have a concern or need to communicate a discomfort or seek reassurance from the therapist, or use the restroom. A light meal and fruit was available for the subject after the session. After the acute effects of study drug administration had subsided, all subjects were assessed for safety and asked to complete the following assessments: PANAS and 5D-ASC. Medications used, if any, during study drug administration session, and adverse events were recorded. The subjects also discussed their psilocybin experience with their therapist. The subject was discharged 6 to 8 hours post dose when, in the opinion of the investigator, the acute effects of psilocybin were resolved. After the acute effects of study drug administration subsided, subjects returned home accompanied by a family member, friend, or chaperone. The therapists checked with the subjects by phone at the end of the day to ensure that the subject arrived home safely.</p><p id="p-0568" num="1232">Visit 4 (V4): Safety Assessments (Day 1): Subjects returned to the clinic the next morning (Day 1 [V4]) for safety assessments, including but not limited to: SSTS, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, review of concomitant medications and AEs and a one-on-one discussion about the subject's experience with the subject's assigned therapist.</p><p id="p-0569" num="1233">Visit 5 (V5): Follow up visit (Day 7 or at Early Termination): Psychometric assessments were completed remotely on Day 7 (V5) or at Early Termination (ET): NEO-FFI, SCL-90, LCI, PET, RMET, SVO, TEQ, SSR, SSTS, SWM, RVP, PAL, review of concomitant medication and recording of AEs. Additionally, at Day 7 (V5) the ERT, IED, OTS, Verbal Fluency and Digit Span Forward tests were conducted.</p><p id="p-0570" num="1234">Visit 6: Follow up visit (Day 28): The SSTS, SWM, RVP, PAL, review of concomitant medication and recording of AEs were obtained at Day 28 (V6).</p><p id="p-0571" num="1235">Visit 7: Follow up Visit (Day 84): The NEO-FFI, SCL-90, LCI, PET, RMET, SVO, TEQ and SSR was obtained remotely at Day 84 (V7).

A lower score on the PALTEA indicated better performance (lower error count) and a positive change from baseline indicated worse performance (higher error count). On average, there was a numeric improvement in performance for the 10 mg and 25 mg psilocybin groups from Baseline to Day 28 whereas the placebo group showed a decrease in performance from Baseline to Day 28 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>F</figref>. Both the 10 mg psilocybin and 25 mg psilocybin groups showed on average of about a 2-point improvement in performance compared to the placebo group (LS mean difference from placebo) at Day 28 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>G</figref>.</p><p id="p-0602" num="1257">The Spatial Working Memory (SWM) of CANTAB was also used to assess the effect of psilocybin on memory. The result of the SWM was reported as Spatial Working Memory between errors (SWMBE). A lower SWMBE score indicated better performance. Therefore, a negative change from baseline indicates better performance (lower error count), and a positive change from baseline indicates worse performance (higher error count). On average, performance improved numerically across psilocybin-treated and placebo treated groups from Baseline to Day 28, with the 25 mg psilocybin group showing a similar performance to that of placebo. The 10 mg group improved less, on average, with a higher error score at Day 28 than placebo as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>H</figref>. The least squares (LS) mean difference indicated the 10 mg group performed less well on average than the placebo group at both Day 7 and Day 28, whilst the 25 mg group performs similarly to the placebo group at Day 28 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>I</figref>).

The least squares mean difference indicated that the 25 mg psilocybin group and 10 mg psilocybin group performed similar to placebo at Day 7.

Higher scores on the RVPA indicated better performance. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>L</figref>, there was an average numeric improvement in performance across all groups. The ANOVA suggested there was no evidence of an overall change in RVPA as a result of exposure to intervention. For both the 10 mg group and 25 mg group, the LS mean difference from placebo at Day 28 was different from placebo (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>M</figref>).

The effect of each psilocybin dose compared to placebo was &#x3c;0.05 for nearly all LCI domains at both timepoints, notably Appreciation for Life, Self-Acceptance, Concern for Others, and Quest for Meaning. Positive trends were also observed for Spirituality, Concern for Worldly Achievement, and Concern Social. However, Religiousness and Appreciation of Death appeared to be unaffected.</p><p id="p-0643" num="1287">The differences between psilocybin dose effects (10 mg versus 25 mg) were not statistically significant for any LCI domain at either timepoint.</p><p id="p-0644" num="1288">Psilocybin had an effect on each of the five primary dimensions of the 5D-ASC scale compared to placebo assessed immediately post-treatment (p&#x2264;0.0001). Differences between doses were observed (p&#x2264;0.05) in two cases (Dread of Ego Dissolution and Auditory Alteration), with the 25 mg psilocybin group showing higher scores than the 10 mg psilocybin group on each of these domains. The 11 sub-scores of the 5D-ASC scale also showed differences between each of the psilocybin dose groups and placebo (p&#x2264;0.0001). Only two of the subscales showed a dose relationship: the mean scores for Anxiety and Complex Imagery were higher in the 25 mg dose group than in the 10 mg dose group.</p><p id="p-0645" num="1289">At both the 25 mg and 10 mg doses, subjects treated with psilocybin showed an increase in the LCI absolute change (p&#x2264;0.0007) and in LCI domain scores measuring Appreciation for Life (p&#x2264;0.0028), Self-Acceptance (p&#x3c;0.0001), Concern for Others (P&#x2264;0.0075), and Quest for Meaning (p&#x3c;0.0139). These effects were evident regardless of the psilocybin dose administered.</p><p id="p-0646" num="1290">PANAS scores, measured immediately post-treatment, showed a reduction in Positive Affect for placebo-treated subjects, which was not observed in the psilocybin groups (p&#x3c;0.03).

However, this result is due in part to the larger improvement in performance from Baseline by the placebo group at Day 7. For the 10 mg group, performance increases again at Day 28 to a level similar to placebo suggesting no adverse effects of the 10 mg dose compared with placebo. The CANTAB cognitive performance results support the safety and tolerability of the administration of a single 10 mg or 25 mg dose of psilocybin.</p><p id="p-0650" num="1294">There was no Visit-Dose effect observed on any of the cognitive outcome measures; PALTEA (episodic memory), SWMBE (working memory), SWMS (executive function and planning), RVPA (sustained attention) and Global Cognitive Composite, suggesting there was no consistent and differential performance changes between the placebo and the 10 mg and 25 mg psilocybin dose groups.</p><p id="p-0651" num="1295">Despite no overall main effect of dose group on RVPA performance (cognitive domain of sustained attention), there was a LS mean difference from placebo for both the 10 mg and 25 mg groups at Day 28 (p&#x3c;0.05), suggesting better performance of subjects in the psilocybin dose groups relative to placebo at Day 28.</p><p id="p-0652" num="1296">PANAS scores, measured immediately post-treatment, showed a reduction in Positive Affect for placebo-treated subjects, which was not observed in the psilocybin groups (p&#x3c;0.03).

One microliter of each sample; a duplicate of a pooled plasma sample; triplicate wells of interplate control and the negative control, were transferred to the plate in this sequence.

Briefly, integrated fluid circuits (IFCs) from Fluidigm were loaded with primers on the left side and samples (DNA sequences) on the right side.

The elevated plus maze (EPM) is a widely used behavioral assay for rodents to assess anti-panic or anti-anxiety effects of pharmacological agents. Briefly, rodents are placed at the junction of the four arms of the maze, facing an open arm, and entries/duration in each arm are recorded over a period of time. An increase in open arm activity reflects anti-anxiety behavior (Waif et al., Nature Protocols, 2007).</p><p id="p-0720" num="1363">Panic anxiety can be induced in rodents through administration of panicogenic drugs such as cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4).

Such self-generated insights are not only therapeutic because of the emotional resolution, but also empowering to subjects.</p><p id="p-0779" num="1429">The psilocybin session is supported by a lead therapist and an assisting therapist, selected and trained according to the FDA-approved training model in conjunction with the current IND for psilocybin. The study psychiatrist is in the immediate vicinity of the session to respond to any emergencies. On the day of the session, subjects come in early in the morning with the goal to take psilocybin around 9 am.</p><p id="p-0780" num="1430">Prior to dose administration, a team of therapists reviews the rules and structure of the session with the subject again. Once all the questions are answered, and the subject reconfirms their consent for the session, they administer the psilocybin (25 mg or 5 capsules that are each 5 mg) with a full glass of water.</p><p id="p-0781" num="1431">The treatment rooms in all trial sites are furnished in soft furniture in muted colors to create a non-clinical calming feel. All treatment rooms are equipped with a high-resolution sound system that allows for simultaneous ambient and earphone listening. The playlist is designed to provide nonverbal guidance.</p><p id="p-0782" num="1432">Subjects are then be encouraged to lie down, practice relaxation and breathing exercises, and listen to calming music. Therapists might want to revisit the intention for the treatment session with the subject. Such revisions immediately prior to the session provide an implicit direction for the subjective experience during the psilocybin session.</p><p id="p-0783" num="1433">Once the effects of psilocybin become noticeable, subjects are encouraged to put on Mindfold eyeshades and earphones and focus on their internal experience.</p><p id="p-0784" num="1434">Patients and/or psychotherapists are discouraged from reading, using laptops or phones at all times, and eating or drinking other than water, during the first 2-3 hours of the session.</p><p id="p-0785" num="1435">Most subjects should tolerate the onset well using the skills practiced during preparation period. Therapists offer support in the form of reminders, encouragement, grounding hand holding, or active guiding, should challenging experiences arise. The best ways for support, and boundaries of physical touch are discussed and practiced during the preparation. In general, therapists are instructed to provide therapeutic grounding above shoulder level only. In case of subjects with a history of physical and sexual abuse, therapeutic touch should be limited to hand and forearm areas only, or to the form of physical support that was agreed during preparation.</p><p id="p-0786" num="1436">As the drug effects start to subside, subjects again might become engaged with emergent narratives. In case of prolonged anxiety or distress, therapists may choose to actively guide subjects through such experiences without interpreting or judging the experiences or giving advice. Once subjects are comfortable, they are encouraged again to engage in introspection.</p><p id="p-0787" num="1437">At the end of the session and after the effects of the psilocybin are no longer evident, subjects become more talkative and interactive. The role of the therapists now is to ensure that experiential processing is complete with some emotional resolution. In those cases where there is still anxiety or despair at the end of the session, subjects are encouraged to relax and reflect for a longer period of time. The provisions are made for therapists to stay with the subject until the effects of the drug have fully subsided, and subject is assessed to be comfortable and fully sober. This is assessed through engaging in &#x2018;small talk&#x2019; about non-contentious topics unrelated to the content of the session.</p><p id="p-0788" num="1438">Subjects and therapists are discouraged to discuss the content of the session until the next day to avoid premature consolidation of the insights.</p><p id="p-0789" num="1439">After the safety assessments, subjects are discharged in the care of a family member or a friend.</p><p id="p-0790" num="1440">On the day of the psilocybin session, the subject arrives at the clinical center between 8 AM and 9 AM. Since subjects are likely to be at least mildly anxious, it is important to validate their anxiety and assure them it is common to be anxious prior to a new experience. The time following arrival and prior to entering the treatment room should be as minimal as possible, as &#x201c;waiting outside&#x201d; (even if reading a book) tends to increase anxiety. The behavioral rules are reviewed again. The subject should reconfirm that he/she:</p><p id="p-0791" num="1441">Will stay in the room for the duration of the session.</p><p id="p-0792" num="1442">Will follow the therapist's instructions as all directions are given entirely to ensure their safety.</p><p id="p-0793" num="1443">Have an accurate mutual understanding of ways the therapist can provide support during the session, including interpersonal grounding, guided imagery and breathing exercises.</p><p id="p-0794" num="1444">Once all the agreements are reconfirmed and the subject is settled in the treatment room, the study investigator or designee offers 25 mg of psilocybin with a full glass of water. After the subject takes the capsules and drinks all the water, he/she should settle back on the couch, listen to the music, focus on his/her breathing and relax.</p><p id="p-0795" num="1445">Before the drug's effects begin, the therapist re-establishes the subject's stated goals for the treatment and to revisit the question: &#x201c;What does feeling better or recovery feel like?&#x201d; The subject is reminded that their primary task during this session is to simply collect new and interesting experiences which can then be discussed with the therapist during the integration phase.</p><p id="p-0796" num="1446">The therapist can remind the subject of the purpose of the psilocybin therapy and the role of experiential processing, namely allowing the subject to be open and curious to whatever arises and encountering thoughts and feelings previously unknown to them.</p><p id="p-0797" num="1447">It should be emphasized that this process inherently requires letting go and a willing passivity to the psychedelic experience; the willingness to let go is correlated with better outcomes in psilocybin therapy. The therapist should remind the subject that the therapeutic team will be supporting them at all times.</p><p id="p-0798" num="1448">Setting and Music: A standardized playlist is employed in all sessions. The playlist follows the pharmacodynamics of psilocybin and provides helpful content to facilitate emergence of memories and emotions as a material for experiential processing and subsequent emotional resolution.</p><p id="p-0799" num="1449">The subject is instructed to accept and explore the music as the day progresses, irrespective of their usual personal preferences or current emotional responses. Criticizing and trying to control the music has often been found to be a symptom of resistance to unfolding content. Therapists may choose to deviate from the playlist in highly unusual situations but allowing the standardized playlist to unfold generally proves effective and frees the therapist to focus on the subject.</p><p id="p-0800" num="1450">Managing Anxiety: Transient anxiety is often reported as subjects encounter changing psychological content. Such anxiety might be viewed as natural and even necessary. It can manifest in different ways, ranging from mild intractability and avoidance of the emerging experiences to extreme paranoia. In most cases, anxiety resolves on its own accord and can be minimized with skillful interpersonal support. Psilocybin provides a unique opportunity for a subject to normalize anxiety and view it as excitement and experience the encounter with honest ambivalence.</p><p id="p-0801" num="1451">During the acute onset of action, the subject might experience perceptual changes in visual, auditory or olfactory modes, and a range of unusual physical sensations. These experiences could be anxiety-provoking. If the subject manifests anxiety and emotional distress, the therapist may offer therapeutic touch or interpersonal grounding, if that is something the subject has agreed to during preparation and has been rehearsed. &#x201c;I want to state again my commitment to be here for you. I will do whatever is necessary to make this a safe place for you so that you can fully experience whatever comes up. If what comes up is difficult, I'd like you to try and stay with it and explore it as much as you can. Please ask me for whatever you need.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0802" num="1452">If the subject is agitated and/or frightened, simple reminders could be helpful: &#x201c;You remember that you are participating in a clinical trial of a new medication for your anorexia. During preparation, we talked about possible anxiety, unusual sensations and intense emotions. This is simply the drug taking effect. It is safe; you will not be harmed. These challenging experiences pass by very quickly if you relax and just watch them. You will return to everyday reality as the effect of psilocybin wanes.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0803" num="1453">The therapist encourages the subject to focus inwards and fully immerse him/herself in all aspects of the experience. The subject may want to practice guided imagery or breathing relaxation techniques in preparation.</p><p id="p-0804" num="1454">Managing Distractions and Avoidance: Occasionally, the subject tries to avoid emerging experiences or distract him/herself while trying to regain cognitive control over the unusual state of their mind. The therapist must recognize that such distractions could take different forms. The subject might want to engage in a conversation or prematurely describe in detail their experience, visions or insights. When this occurs, the therapist and assistant aim to remain as silent as possible, thereby enabling the subject and his/her inner experience to direct the course of the psilocybin session. Active listening skills may be required if the subject engages the therapist in conversation; this should be paired with prompts to encourage the subject to continue focusing attention on present experiences.</p><p id="p-0805" num="1455">Sometimes a subject might ask to go to the bathroom or have a drink of water. The sudden and urgent character of such requests might suggest that they are really trying to avoid emerging material. In such cases, the therapist should encourage subjects to stay with the experience by simply redirecting their attention.</p><heading id="h-0080" level="2">Outcome Measures:</heading><p id="p-0806"

Once a subject completes all Visit 1 assessments the clinical team reviews information and issues approval, if the subject is eligible. At the conclusion of the Visit 1, the subject meets with the study therapist who supports them during the session. Subjects then are given access to an online preparatory material with information about psilocybin safety and effects, videos of subjects from the previous studies sharing their experiences, and guided relaxation and breathing exercises.</p><p id="p-0860" num="1510">Visit 1a: First preparatory session to discuss safety and effects of psilocybin, personal and medical history, and current symptoms. Once a medically qualified study clinician confirms subject eligibility, the subject is seen by the study therapist for preparation between the Screening [Visit 1] and Baseline visit [Visit 2]. During Visit 1a preparatory session, the therapist and subject discuss the subject's history and current symptoms, expectations for the therapeutic session effects and safety profile of psilocybin, and what to expect during the session, and answer any questions the subject may have. The goal of the preparatory session is to start building trust and therapeutic alliance. If at the end of the Visit 1a preparatory session, if either a therapist or a subject feel that sufficient trust and therapeutic alliance could not be formed, the subject does not progress to Baseline visit.</p><p id="p-0861" num="1511">Visit 2 (Visit 2): Baseline visit to discuss safety and effects of psilocybin, personal and medical history, and current symptoms. The day before the psilocybin session 24 hours (h) after Screening [Visit 1]; Visit 1a, Day &#x2212;7; Visit 2, Day &#x2212;1), the subjects undergo a baseline assessment that contains the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI;), the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE), the Eating Disorder Examination&#x2014;Questionnaire Short Form (EDE-QS), the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Clinical Impairment Assessment Questionnaire (CIA), Eating Disorder readiness ruler (ED-RR), the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI), the Physical Appearance State and Trait Anxiety Scale&#x2014;State and Trait Versions (PASTAS), the C-SSRS, the Body Image State Scale (BISS), food related rituals and obsessions using the Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorder Scale&#x2014;Self-Report (YBC-EDS-SRQ), visual analogue scales (VAS) to rate hunger, fullness and desire to eat, vital signs including weight (measured by a health professional), urinalysis, urine drug screen, and urine pregnancy test (only for women of childbearing potential), blood test, and ECG.

Subjects are required to remain in the study facility for a total of eight hours post ingestion. After the acute effects of the psilocybin pass, subjects are evaluated for safety by the study psychiatrist and accompanied home by a previously agreed upon support person. On the day of psilocybin administration, the following tests are administered: vital signs (i.e., sitting blood pressure, pulse, body temperature, and respiratory rate), Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), and 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D ASC). Medicines that are taken and changes in medications and/or therapy since the previous visit are recorded.

This session includes a safety check, completion of all questionnaires completed at baseline, a qualitative post-dosing interview, and a discussion regarding the subject's experience during the psilocybin session. All subjects participate in two integration sessions. In addition to the above stated objectives of Visit 4 sessions, sessions focus on the therapist assisting subjects in attending to and processing therapeutic content relevant to their illness(es). At visit 4, the following tests are conducted: STAI, MADRS, CIA, EDE-QS, ED-RR, EDI, C-SSRS, PASTAS, BISS, YBC-ES, VAS measures, C-SSRS, Vital signs (ie, sitting blood pressure, pulse, body temperature, and respiratory rate) and weight, and 12 lead ECG.

Psilocybin for the Treatment of Binge Eating</heading><p id="p-0868" num="1517">The aim of this in vivo study is to explore the efficacy of psilocybin for the treatment of binge eating. 65 female Wistar rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories and individually-housed in polypropylene cages with sawdust bedding and environmental enrichment. Animals were maintained on a reverse phase light-dark cycle and had access to standard powdered diet at all times and free access to water.</p><p id="p-0869" num="1518">56 animals were trained to binge-eat using 2-hour exposure to preferred fatty food (chocolate) according to an irregular access schedule on days 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 18, 23, and 28, while a separate control cohort of 9 animals was exposed to an empty pot for 2 hours on the same irregular access schedule. Once trained to binge-eat, animals were treated with vehicle (saline, negative control), psilocybin (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg IP), or lisdexamfetamine (LDX, 0.8 mg/kg, daily PO) (positive control). A timeline of the study is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0870" num="1519">Binging behavior was assessed one hour after administration of treatment (e.g. psilocybin, vehicle, or LDX as described above). The weight of the chocolate pot was recorded before and after each binging session. Body weight, food intake (using the food energy values, kJ/g) and water intake were recorded.</p><p id="p-0871" num="1520">In order to assess an longer term timepoint but also avoid performing two binging sessions in quick succession, 8 days following treatment each animal was administered with a single injection of the same treatment given previously and then tested for binging behavior 24 hours later, as described above.</p><p id="p-0872" num="1521">Body weight was analyzed by analysis of covariance with Day 1 body weight as a covariate. Body weight change from Day 1 to 10 of dosing (Day 30 to 39) was analyzed similarly. On binge days, chow intake, chocolate intake, and total food intake during the 2 hour binge session (expressed as kJ) and 24 hour food (kJ) intake were analyzed by analysis of covariance with the equivalent measure, averaged over the previous 2 binge days (Day 23 and 28 of the training phase), as a covariate. Average intake for the 3 post-dose binge days was analyzed similarly. On non-binge days, 24-hour food (kJ) was analyzed by analysis of covariance with average food/water intake from non-binge days from &#x2212;5 to 0 (training days 24 to 27 and 29) as a covariate. Average food intake for all post-dose non-binge days was analyzed similarly. Comparisons to the binge eating vehicle group were by Williams' test for psilocybin and the multiple t test for LDX. All tests were carried out as two-sided tests.</p><p id="p-0873" num="1522">All data from the vehicle/no chocolate group are presented as mean&#xb1;standard error of the mean (SEM). For the other treatment groups, food intake data collected on post-treatment binge days (Day 30 and/or Day 38) were adjusted for differences between the groups at baseline (average of Days 23 and 28 of the training phase) and food intake data collected on post-treatment non-binge days (Day 31 to Day 37, and Day 39) were adjusted for differences between the groups at the appropriate baseline (Days 24 to 27 and Day 29 of the training phase). Accordingly, data from groups other than the vehicle/no chocolate group are presented as adjusted mean&#xb1;SEM. Mean body weight changes were adjusted for differences between the treatment groups in Day 1 body weight and are presented as adjusted mean&#xb1;SEM.</p><p id="p-0874" num="1523">Chocolate and total food (i.e. sum of chocolate and chow intake) were significantly decreased during the binging session 1 hour following administration of 1 mg/kg psilocybin, 3 mg/kg psilocybin, and 10 mg/kg psilocybin, as compared to the vehicle treated group that were trained to binge eat (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>). The positive control (LDX) also significantly reduced chocolate eating.</p><p id="p-0875" num="1524">Chocolate and total food (i.e. sum of chocolate and chow intake) were also significantly decreased during the binging session 24 hour following administration of 1 mg/kg psilocybin, 3 mg/kg psilocybin, and 10 mg/kg psilocybin, as compared to the vehicle treated group that were trained to binge eat (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0876" num="1525"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> shows the effect of psilocybin on 24 hour food intake across the whole study. The food intake over a 24 hour period is significantly reduced on Day 1 in all psilocybin groups and in the LDX positive control group. The food intake over the 24 hour period is not significantly altered in the psilocybin group, suggesting that psilocybin does not affect normal feeding behaviour. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> shows the effect of psilocybin on average 24 hour food intake on binge days versus non-binge days. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref> shows that overall body weight is not affected by administration of psilocybin.</p><heading id="h-0084" level="1">Example 19</heading><heading id="h-0085" level="1">In Vivo Study Examining Psilocybin's Effect on the Life Changes Inventory (LCI)&#x2014;Self-Acceptance Score</heading><p id="p-0877" num="1526">To determine whether psilocybin may have a beneficial effect on self acceptance in subjects with eating disorders, a healthy volunteer study was conducted. The study measured various psychological and brain measures both acutely and long-term following psilocybin administration. Healthy volunteers were administered 10 mg psilocybin, 25 mg psilocybin, or placebo. Data were analysed using a mixed model for repeated measures with outcome score as the dependent variable. The model had fixed effects for treatment, visit, former psilocybin experience, and treatment by visit interaction, visit as the repeating factor, and subject as a random effect. Least squares (LS) means were calculated from the model and used for pairwise comparisons between the groups.</p><p id="p-0878" num="1527">The Life Changes Inventory (LCI) was administered 7 days and 84 days after psilocybin administration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref> shows the effect of psilocybin on the LCI self-acceptance score.
