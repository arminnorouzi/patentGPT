Typical solutions for reducing decibel transmission through production facility walls utilize site-erected walls and associated noise-attenuating features (e.g., the addition of extensive and heavy materials) to achieve the required Sound Transmission Class (STC) rating. However, the erection of walls requires significant effort and the resulting walls lack mobility.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Alternatively, lightweight industrial-quality-type wall panels are available that can be pre-installed onto a prefabricated modular building structure, which is then transported to the site. For example, International Patent Pub. No. WO 00/75443 by Deblander utilizes two core layers of noise-insulation foam (e.g., polyurethane foam), with an air gap therebetween. These core layers are sandwiched between two thin metal sheets to form a single metal-skinned panel. However, such panels do not achieve the high STC ratings required for many noise-sensitive industrial installations.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure is directed toward overcoming one or more of the problems discovered by the inventors.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an embodiment, a composite noise-attenuating panel is disclosed that comprises: a first subpanel;

For ease of understanding, X, Y, and Z axes are illustrated, but should not be understood to require any particular orientation of panel <b>100</b> in absolute terms. Each of the X, Y, and Z axes are orthogonal to each other. For the sake of consistency, as used herein, unless otherwise specified, the term &#x201c;length&#x201d; refers to a distance along the X axis, the term &#x201c;height&#x201d; refers to a distance along the Y axis, and the term &#x201c;width&#x201d; refers to a distance along the Z axis.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment, panel <b>100</b> comprises two subpanels <b>110</b>, including a first subpanel <b>110</b>A and a second subpanel <b>110</b>B. One or more spacer blocks <b>120</b> are sandwiched between first subpanel <b>110</b>A and second subpanel <b>110</b>B along the Z axis. In the illustrated embodiment, a plurality of spacer blocks <b>120</b> are sandwiched between first subpanel <b>110</b>A and second subpanel <b>110</b>B. Specifically, a first spacer block <b>120</b>A is sandwiched between first subpanel <b>110</b>A and second subpanel <b>110</b>B at a first end of panel <b>100</b>, a second spacer block <b>120</b>B is sandwiched between first subpanel <b>110</b>A and second subpanel <b>110</b>B in the middle of panel <b>100</b>, and a third spacer block <b>120</b>C is sandwiched between first subpanel <b>110</b>A and second subpanel <b>110</b>B at the second end of panel <b>100</b>, opposite the first end. In alternative embodiments, more or fewer spacer blocks <b>120</b> may be sandwiched between first subpanel <b>110</b>A and second subpanel <b>110</b>B, and/or in a different arrangement than illustrated, based on the particular design goals for panel <b>100</b>. For example, the number of spacer blocks <b>120</b> may be two, three, four, five, and so on. In a particular implementation, the number of spacer blocks <b>120</b> is at least three. In general, increasing the number or area of spacer blocks <b>120</b> may improve the structural integrity of panel <b>100</b>, but may diminish the noise-attenuating characteristics of panel <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the illustrated embodiment, spacer blocks <b>120</b> are spaced apart along the Y axis to define one or more spaces between first subpanel <b>110</b>A and second subpanel <b>110</b>B. For example, a first space is defined by first subpanel <b>110</b>A, second subpanel <b>110</b>B, spacer block <b>120</b>A, and spacer block <b>120</b>B, and a second space is defined by first subpanel <b>110</b>A, second subpanel <b>110</b>B, spacer block <b>120</b>B, and spacer block <b>120</b>C. Each spacer block <b>120</b> may extend an entire length of panel <b>100</b> along the X axis. It should be understood that, as used herein, the term &#x201c;an entire length&#x201d; may include both an instance in which spacer block <b>120</b> spans all of the entire length of panel <b>100</b> and an instance in which spacer block <b>120</b> spans virtually the entire length of panel <b>100</b>, except for a small length (e.g., 0-3 inches) on one or both ends, along the X axis, to avoid interference with panel fastening mechanisms described elsewhere herein (e.g., fastening mechanisms <b>510</b> and <b>520</b>). In an alternative embodiment, each spacer block <b>120</b> may extend only a partial length of panel <b>100</b> along the X axis, and/or spacer blocks <b>120</b> may be spaced apart along both the X and Y axes (e.g., in a grid pattern). Each spacer block <b>120</b> may have a rectangular cross-section along all three X, Y, and Z axes.
