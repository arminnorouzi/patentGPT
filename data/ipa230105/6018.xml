Usually, there are many factors that affect the color cast of an OLED display device. From the perspective of the design of the display substrate (an array substrate or a back panel of the OLED), the flatness of an anode greatly affects the color cast.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a partial schematic cross-sectional view of a display substrate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of light emission performed by the display substrate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, sub-pixels of the display substrate include a base substrate <b>110</b>, a semiconductor layer <b>120</b>, a first gate electrode layer <b>130</b>, a second gate electrode layer <b>140</b>, a first conductive layer <b>150</b>, a first planarization layer <b>241</b>, a second conductive layer <b>160</b>, a second planarization layer <b>242</b>, an anode <b>175</b>, and a pixel defining layer <b>190</b> that are sequentially disposed. The semiconductor layer <b>120</b>, the first gate electrode layer <b>130</b>, the second gate electrode layer <b>140</b>, and the first conductive layer <b>150</b> may form a pixel driving circuit including a thin film transistor and a storage capacitor. The second conductive layer <b>160</b> includes a connection electrode <b>161</b>, which is connected to the pixel driving circuit through a via hole (not shown) in the first planarization layer <b>241</b>. The anode <b>170</b> is connected to the connection electrode <b>161</b> through a via hole <b>271</b> in the second planarization layer <b>242</b>. The pixel defining layer <b>190</b> includes an opening <b>191</b> to expose a part of the anode <b>170</b>. When a subsequent organic light emitting layer <b>180</b> is formed in the opening <b>191</b>, the anode <b>175</b> may come into contact with the organic light emitting layer <b>180</b> and drive the organic light emitting layer to emit light. A region defined by the opening <b>191</b> is an effective light emitting region of the sub-pixel.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The via hole <b>271</b> in the second planarization layer <b>242</b> affects the flatness of the anode <b>175</b>. If the via hole <b>271</b> is relatively close to the opening <b>191</b> (that is, the effective light emitting region), the anode <b>175</b> at the location of the opening <b>191</b> includes a phenomenon of &#x201c;inclination&#x201d;. As a result, the light emitting direction of the sub-pixel is offset. If directions of &#x201c;inclination&#x201d; of anodes in sub-pixels of different colors are different, as a result, intensities of light emitted by the sub-pixels of different colors (for example, red, green, and blue) toward different directions do not match each other. Consequently, the phenomenon of color cast occurs. For example, when observing from a side of a display device including the display substrate, the display image is red, and when observing from the other side of display device, the display image is blue.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Regarding this, the embodiments of the present disclosure provide a display substrate and a display device. The display substrate includes a base substrate, a first conductive layer, a first planarization layer, a second conductive layer, a second planarization layer, and a plurality of light emitting element groups. The first conductive layer is located on the base substrate. The first planarization layer is located on a side of the first conductive layer away from the base substrate. The second conductive layer is located on a side of the first planarization layer away from the first conductive layer. The second planarization layer is located on a side of the second conductive layer away from the first planarization layer. The plurality of light emitting element groups are located on a side of the second planarization layer away from the base substrate. The plurality of light emitting element groups are arranged along a first direction to form a plurality of light emitting element columns, and are arranged along a second direction to form a plurality of light emitting element rows. Each light emitting element group includes a first light emitting element, a second light emitting element, a third light emitting element, and a fourth light emitting element. The second light emitting element and the third light emitting element are arranged along the second direction to form a light emitting element pair. The first light emitting element, the light emitting element pair, and the third light emitting element are arranged along the first direction. The first light emitting element includes a first anode. The second light emitting element includes a second anode. The third light emitting element includes a third anode. The fourth light emitting element includes a fourth anode. The second conductive layer includes a first connection electrode, a second connection electrode, a third connection electrode, and a fourth connection electrode. The second planarization layer includes a first via hole, a second via hole, a third via hole, and a fourth via hole. The first anode is connected to the first connection electrode through the first via hole. The second anode is connected to the second connection electrode through the second via hole. The third anode is connected to the third connection electrode through the third via hole. The fourth anode is connected to the fourth connection electrode through the fourth via hole. A plurality of third via holes corresponding to one light emitting element row are approximately located on a first straight line extending along the first direction, and an orthographic projection of the fourth via hole closest to the first straight line on the base substrate is located on a side of the first straight line close to the fourth anode corresponding to the fourth via hole. Therefore, in the display substrate, the location of the fourth via hole is moved toward the fourth anode, so that the distance between the fourth via hole and the effective light emitting region of the adjacent first light emitting element is increased, to ensure the flatness of the first anode located in the effective light emitting region of the first light emitting element, thereby avoiding the phenomenon of color cast; the distance between the fourth via hole and the effective light emitting region of the fourth light emitting element is reduced, so that resistance between the fourth anode located in the effective light emitting region of the fourth light emitting element and the fourth connection electrode is reduced, and the distance between the first anode and the fourth anode is increased, to avoid short-circuiting between the first anode and the fourth anode due to residues left in the manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The display substrate and the display device that are provided in the embodiments of the present disclosure are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">An embodiment of the present disclosure provides a display substrate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic planar diagram of a display substrate according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> are schematic cross-sectional views of a display substrate according to an embodiment of the present disclosure along an AA direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a display substrate according to an embodiment of the present disclosure along a BB direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a display substrate according to an embodiment of the present disclosure along a GG direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic planar diagram of a light emitting element in a display substrate according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the display substrate <b>100</b> includes a base substrate <b>110</b>, a first conductive layer <b>150</b>, a first planarization layer <b>241</b>, a second conductive layer <b>160</b>, a second planarization layer <b>242</b>, and a plurality of light emitting element groups <b>310</b>.

The first light emitting element, the light emitting element pair, and the third light emitting element are arranged along the first direction. That is, the second anode and the third anode are arranged along the second direction to form an anode pair. The first anode, the anode pair, and the third anode are arranged along the first direction. The orthographic projection of the fourth via hole closest to the first straight line on the base substrate is located on the side of the first straight line close to the fourth anode.

Therefore, the display substrate includes the following beneficial effects: (1) the distance between the fourth via hole and the effective light emitting region of the adjacent first light emitting element is increased, to ensure the flatness of the first anode located in the effective light emitting region of the first light emitting element, thereby avoiding the phenomenon of color cast; (2) the distance between the fourth via hole and the effective light emitting region of the fourth light emitting element is reduced, so that resistance between the fourth anode located in the effective light emitting region of the fourth light emitting element and the fourth connection electrode is reduced, and (3) the distance between the first anode and the fourth anode is increased, to avoid short-circuiting between the first anode and the fourth anode due to residues left in the manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">For example, as illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in the display substrate, the location of the fourth via hole <b>2424</b> is moved toward the fourth anode <b>1754</b>. Therefore, the distance between the fourth via hole <b>2424</b> and the effective light emitting region (that is, a region defined by the opening <b>1951</b>) of the adjacent first light emitting element is increased. In addition, because the fourth anode includes a connection portion connected to a pixel driving circuit below the fourth anode, when the location of the fourth via hole <b>2424</b> is moved toward the fourth anode <b>1754</b>, the fourth via hole <b>2424</b> is not overlapped with the effective light emitting region (that is, the region defined by the opening <b>1954</b>) of the fourth light emitting element.

In researches, the inventor of this application notices that, there are many factors that affect the display effect of the OLED display device. The size of the load of the gate electrode layer affects the charging time of a pixel driving circuit, and the charging time of the pixel driving circuit includes relatively large impact on the display effect. Usually, the load of the gate electrode layer is mainly formed by a gate electrode line and a reset signal line. On the other hand, the size of the load of the data line (or a source line) directly relates to the power consumption of an IC. Larger load of the data line indicates a higher requirement for an IC driver, which leads to higher power consumption of the IC. Therefore, when the load between the gate electrode line and the reset signal line and the load on the data line are controlled, the display effect of the OLED display device can be improved, and the power consumption of the OLED display device can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">Regarding this, the embodiments of the present disclosure provide a display substrate and a display device.

First, when a reset signal is transmitted to the reset signal line <b>131</b> to conduct the seventh thin film transistor T<b>7</b>, remaining current that flows through the anode of each sub-pixel is discharged to the sixth thin film transistor T<b>6</b> through the seventh thin film transistor T<b>7</b>, to inhibit light emission caused by the remaining current that flows through the anode of each sub-pixel. Then, when a reset signal is transmitted to the reset signal line <b>131</b> and an initialization signal is transmitted to the initialization signal line <b>141</b>, the sixth thin film transistor T<b>6</b> is conducted, and an initialization voltage Vint is applied to a first gate electrode of the first thin film transistor T<b>1</b> and the first electrode block CE<b>1</b> of the storage capacitor Cst through the sixth thin film transistor T<b>6</b>, so that the first gate electrode and the storage capacitor Cst are initialized.
