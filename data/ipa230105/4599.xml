Thereby, the correlation of the information is displayed in such a way as to be understood at a glance.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is conceivable to apply the device described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2004-230901 to a production step for a cast. The production step for the cast includes a sand treatment step, a molding step, a core step, a melting step, a pouring step, a cooling conveyance step, an after-treatment step and an inspection step, and data measured and calculated in those steps ranges across many kinds. Therefore, the present disclosure provides a technology that efficiently displays a variety of data measured and calculated in the step of producing the cast, on a screen.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An information display system according to an aspect of the present disclosure includes: a display; an input device to accept a user operation; a control device connected with the display and the input device; and a database to associate and store various parameters measured and calculated in a step of producing the cast, wherein the control device includes a graph display control unit to refer to the database and to display a graph on the display, the graph being a graph resulting from plotting a display parameter as a data point, the display parameter being a parameter selected from the various parameters, and an information display control unit to display, when the input device accepts the user operation of selecting the data point of the graph, information relevant to at least one kind of parameter included in the various parameters and associated with the display parameter at the data point selected by the user operation, on the display.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the information display system, the graph resulting from plotting, as the data point, the display parameter that is the parameter selected from the various parameters measured and calculated in the step of producing the cast is displayed. Then, when the input device accepts the user operation of selecting the data point of the graph for the display parameter, the information relevant to the at least one kind of parameter included in the various parameters and associated with the display parameter at the data point selected by the user operation is displayed on the display. In this way, while displaying information, the information display system displays the information relevant to another kind of parameter associated with the data point selected by the user operation, in response to the user operation, and thereby can display information that a user wants to check, at a timing necessary for the user. Consequently, the information display system can efficiently display a variety of data measured and calculated in the step of producing the cast, on the screen.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an embodiment, the information display control unit may display information relevant to a parameter included in the various parameters, associated with the display parameter at the data point selected by the user operation, and meeting a previously set display condition, on the display.

By configuring the information display system in this way, for example, the information display system can cause the user to visually know a parameter that the user should further check.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment, in a case where the data point of the display parameter satisfies an automatic display condition previously set for the display parameter, the information display control unit may display the information relevant to the at least one kind of parameter at the data point, on the display, regardless of the user operation. By configuring the information display system in this way, for example, the information display system can actively display information relevant to the parameter at a data point that is of the data points for the display parameter and that the user should pay attention to, and thereby can cause the user to know the parameter. In an embodiment, in a case where a data point of the display parameter deviates from a permissible range previously set for the display parameter, the information display control unit may determine that the data point satisfies the automatic display condition, and display the information relevant to the at least one kind of parameter at a data point included in data points that satisfy the automatic display condition and most deviating from the permissible range, on the display. By configuring the information display system in this way, the information display system can cause the user to know various parameters at the data point most deviating from the permissible range previously set for the parameter.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment, in a case where a previously set display end condition is satisfied, the information display control unit may end display of the parameter displayed by the user operation, and in a case where the user operation of selecting the data point of the graph is a first user operation, the information display control unit may continue the display of the information relevant to the parameter and displayed by the user operation, even in the case where the display end condition is satisfied. By configuring the information display system in this way, the information display system can continue the display of the information relevant to the parameter and displayed by the user operation or can end the display, depending on the user operation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, in a case where the user operation of selecting the data point of the graph is a user operation of selecting a plurality of data points, the information display control unit may collectively display information relevant to the parameter and related to the plurality of data points, in tabular form. By configuring the information display system in this way, the information display system can compactly display the information relevant to the parameter and relevant to the plurality of data points.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, in response to the user operation of selecting the information relevant to the parameter and displayed on the display, the information display control unit may display a graph on the display, the graph being a graph resulting from plotting the selected parameter as a data point.

An information display system <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a system that displays information about casting equipment. The casting equipment is equipment that produces a cast, and is equipment by which a sand treatment step, a molding step, a core step, a melting step, a pouring step, a cooling conveyance step, an after-treatment step and an inspection step are executed. The casting equipment that the information display system <b>1</b> targets does not need to include all of the above steps, and only needs to include at least one step. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the information display system <b>1</b> includes a display <b>2</b>, an input device <b>3</b>, a control device <b>4</b> and a DB server <b>5</b> (Data base server). The control device <b>4</b> is connected with the display <b>2</b>, the input device <b>3</b> and the DB server <b>5</b> in a mutually communicable manner.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The display <b>2</b> is a device that includes a screen and that displays visual information on the screen for a user such as a worker. The input device <b>3</b> is an interface that accepts a user operation, and examples of the input device <b>3</b> include a mouse and a keyboard. The input device <b>3</b> may be configured as single hardware such as a touch screen, together with the display <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The control device <b>4</b> includes a processor <b>40</b> and a memory <b>41</b>. The processor <b>40</b> is an arithmetic device that supervises the behavior of the control device <b>4</b>. The memory <b>41</b> is a storage medium. The memory <b>41</b> stores modules of programs that are executed by the processor <b>40</b>, definition data and the like. The memory <b>41</b> contains a graph display module <b>410</b> (an example of the graph display control unit), an associated information display module <b>411</b> (an example of the information display control unit) and definition data <b>4</b>U.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The DB server <b>5</b> is a device that contains and manages information collected from the casting equipment. The DB server <b>5</b> is configured as a general computer system that includes a CPU (Central Processing Unit), a main storage device such as a RAM (Random Access Memory) and a ROM (Read Only memory), an input device such as a touch panel and a keyboard, an output device such as a display, an auxiliary storage device such as a hard disk, and the like. The DB server <b>5</b> includes a parameter DB <b>50</b> (an example of the database). The parameter DB <b>50</b> associates and stores various parameters measured and calculated in a step of producing the cast. The control device <b>4</b> can request information to the DB server <b>5</b>, can receive the information contained in the parameter DB <b>50</b>, and can display the information on the display <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">(Details of Parameter DB)</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The parameter DB <b>50</b> associates and stores various parameters measured and calculated in the sand treatment step, the molding step, the core step, the melting step, the pouring step, the cooling conveyance step, the after-treatment step and the inspection step. As an example, the parameter DB <b>50</b> associates and stores an identifier to be put to a product, measurement data measured in each step and a result (conforming product/non-conforming product) of a product inspection. Examples of the identifier to be put to the product include a product number (character, numeral, sign). The identifier to be put to the product may be formed when molten metal is poured into a mold and thereby an identifier put (marked, for example) on the mold is transferred to the product, or may be directly put (marked, for example) to the product taken out of a mold.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The parameter DB <b>50</b> may contain information related to sand property. The information related to the sand property is measured mainly in the sand treatment step. Examples of the information related to the sand property include CB value, moisture, compressive strength, sand temperature, permeability, pouring water amount in a sand mixer, mixing time, atmospheric temperature, humidity, calendar information (day of week, season and the like), equipment state (abrasion status/setting condition/maintenance status of the sand mixer/sand property measurement apparatus and the like), water quality, ratio of new sand and an additive agent, dry state test item (fine powder amount, grain distribution and the like), and operating state (stop time) of a line. The information related to the sand property is linked with a mold (for example, the identifier of a mold) that is being produced, as shift data. The shift data is associated with position information in a mold row, and whenever the mold is moved (conveyed), the shift data is shifted along with the movement. The shifting is displacing the association with the position information in the mold row. For example, the shift data relevant to a mold with a mold identifier N that is positioned at a first position in the row is associated with the first position. In the case where the mold with the mold identifier N moves from the first position to a second position, the association between the shift data relevant to the mold with the mold identifier N and the first position is dissolved along with the movement of the mold with the mold identifier N, and the shift data relevant to the mold with the mold identifier N and the second position are associated.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The parameter DB <b>50</b> may contain information related to the mold. The information related to the mold is measured mainly in the molding step. The information related to the mold is information associated with the product and time, and examples of the information related to the mold include mold strength, kneading condition (mixing time, water pouring amount, additive agent addition amount and the like), molding condition (squeeze pressure, squeeze time, sand filling time, sand filling air pressure, sand amount in a sand tank, and the like), and the operating state (stop time) of the line.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The parameter DB <b>50</b> may contain information related to pouring. The information related to the pouring is measured mainly in the pouring step. The information related to the pouring is information associated with the product and time (charge), and examples of the information related to the pouring include molten metal temperature, pouring temperature, molten metal conveyance time, holding furnace temperature, ladle temperature and molten metal treatment time (inoculant treatment time, slag-off time and the like). The charge is the unit of one melting, and the molten metal for one charge is poured in a plurality of frames.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The parameter DB <b>50</b> may contain information related to the molten metal. The information related to the molten metal is measured mainly in the pouring step. The information related to the molten metal is information associated with the product and time (charge), and examples of the information related to the molten metal include CE value and blending ratio (ratio of scrap material, pig iron and return material) of molten metal materials.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">(Example of Information Display Manner)</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The control device <b>4</b> acquires information from the DB server <b>5</b>, plats a display parameter as a data point, and displays a graph on the screen of the display <b>2</b>. The display parameter is a parameter that is selected from various parameters measured and calculated in the step of producing the cast, and is previously determined. A case where the display parameter is fraction defective will be described below. The fraction defective is expressed as the ratio between the number of non-conforming products that do not satisfy a standard previously determined as the product and the number of produced products.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> are screen examples for describing an information display manner.

The graph A is a line graph in which the abscissa is the time and the ordinate is the fraction defective. The processor <b>40</b> of the control device .<b>4</b> executes the graph display module <b>410</b> contained in the memory <b>41</b>, and thereby displays the graph A on the screen <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the display <b>2</b>. The graph display module <b>410</b> is a program that causes the processor <b>40</b> to function such that the processor <b>40</b> executes a sequence of behaviors for displaying the graph A.

Consequently, the information display system <b>1</b> can efficiently display a variety of data measured and calculated in the step of producing the cast, on the screen.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The exemplary embodiment has been described above, but various omissions, replacements and alterations may be performed without being limited to the above-described exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">[Modification 1: Restriction of Display of Associated Information]</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">When displaying the information relevant to various parameter associated with the display parameter as the associated information, the processor <b>40</b> may display only information relevant to a display parameter meeting a display condition, on the screen <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the display <b>2</b>. The display condition is a condition for deciding information to be displayed from the associated information, is previously set, and is contained in the memory <b>41</b> as the definition data <b>412</b>. For example, the associated information C about the fraction defective is all of the measurement data measured in the respective steps, and therefore, in the case of the display of the associated information C, the associated information C may not fit within the screen in some cases. Therefore, the processor <b>40</b> selects only information relevant to a display parameter meeting the display condition from the associated information C, and displays the information on the screen <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the display <b>2</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, examples of the parameter meeting the display condition for the fraction defective are the CB value and the pouring temperature. With such a configuration, the processor <b>40</b> can perform adjustment such that the associated information C is displayed within the screen <b>2</b><i>a, </i>even in the case of many kinds of associated information C. Further, it is possible to previously determine the display condition such that only a parameter necessary for the analysis of the tendency of the display parameter is included. Thereby, the processor <b>40</b> can display only the parameter necessary for the analysis of the tendency of the display parameter, and can cause the user to know information at which the user should look, at a glance. Alternatively, the display condition may be set for each display parameter, such that the display parameter is displayed as the associated information C in the case where the display parameter deviates from an upper or lower limit value of a threshold value (for example, mold strength: 10 to 25 N/cm<sup>2</sup>) by a predetermined value (for example, mold strength: 5 N/cm<sup>2</sup>) or more. There are sometimes a plurality of measurement values that are compared with the threshold value. For example, in the case where the molten metal for one charge is poured into a plurality of molds, there is a mold strength for each of the plurality of molds. In such a case, the processor <b>40</b> compares the average value of the plurality of measurement values and the threshold value. Instead of the average value, the processor <b>40</b> may use various values such as the maximum value, the minimum value, a value that most deviates from a permissible range previously set for the parameter, and the standard deviation.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">[Modification 2: Emphasis Display of Associated Information]</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The processor <b>40</b> may emphasize and display the associated information that satisfies an emphasis condition.

The definition data <b>412</b> also includes the manner of the emphasis. Examples of the manner of the emphasis include increasing sizes of characters in the associated information, increasing thicknesses of the characters, putting a symbol mark, and displaying highlight. The symbol mark may be a triangular figure that surrounds an exclamation mark, or may be a circular figure. The size and thickness of the character, the color of the symbol mark, and the intensity of the highlight display (the shade of color) may be altered depending on the level of the emphasis. For example, the processor <b>40</b> puts a yellow symbol mark to associated information that is intended to be emphasized, and puts a red symbol mark to associated information that is intended to be further emphasized. Similarly to the display condition, the emphasis condition may target the parameter necessary for the analysis of the tendency of the display parameter. Alternatively, the emphasis condition may target a parameter having data that deviates from a permissible range previously set for the parameter. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a graph showing a relation between the CB values and the time. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the processor <b>40</b> may calculate a ratio at which the measured CB values deviate from a permissible range previously set for the CB value (a value resulting from dividing the number of frames for which the measured CB values deviate from a permissible range previously set for the CB value by the number of frames for one charge), may emphatically display the CB value that is the associated information, at a first emphasis level, in the case where the ratio is 5% or more and less than 10%, and may emphatically display the CB value that is the associated information, at a second emphasis level higher than the first emphasis level, in the case where the ratio is 10% or more. Alternatively, the processor <b>40</b> may emphatically display the parameter, in the case where the measurement data deviates by a predetermined numerical range or more from an upper or lower limit value of a permissible range previously set for the parameter. For example, the processor <b>40</b> emphatically displays the CB value that is the associated information, in the case where the CB value that is the associated information deviates by 3 to 5 from an upper or lower limit value of a permissible range previously set for the CB value. Alternatively, instead of the above-described ratio, the processor <b>40</b> may alter the emphasis level depending on a distance by which the measurement data deviates from an upper or lower limit value of a permissible range previously set for the parameter. For example, the processor <b>40</b> puts a yellow symbol mark to the CB value that is the associated information, in the case where the measurement data of the CB value deviates by 3 from the upper or lower limit value of the permissible range previously set for the CB value, and puts a red symbol mark to the CB value that is the associated information, in the case where the measurement data of the CB value deviates by 5 from the upper or lower limit value of the permissible range previously set for the CB value. By configuring the information display system <b>1</b> in this way, for example, the information display system <b>1</b> can cause the user to visually know a parameter that the user should further check. Alternatively, the emphasis condition may be satisfied, for example, in the case where the average value for one charge deviates by a predetermined value that is previously set.

For example, in the case of selecting the data point by clicking, the associated information stops being displayed in the case of satisfying the display end condition, and in the case of selecting the data point by double-clicking, the display is continued even in the case of satisfying the display end condition. The first user operation is not particularly limited if being distinguishable from the user operation for which the associated information stops being displayed in the case of satisfying the display end condition, and an appropriate operation such as long-pressing, right-clicking, double-tapping and clicking while pressing a Ctrl key is set. The first user operation is previously set, and is contained in the memory <b>41</b> as the definition data <b>412</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> are screen examples for describing an information display manner. Suppose that the user points the cursor at a certain data point (the time is the second charge on 12/1 and the fraction defective is 5%) and selects the data point by double-clicking (an example of the first user operation) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>. When the input device <b>3</b> accepts the user operation of selecting the data point of the graph, the processor <b>40</b> displays associated information C<b>1</b> including various parameters associated with the fraction defective at the data point selected by the user operation, on the screen <b>2</b><i>a, </i>in a manner of making it possible to recognize that the associated information C<b>1</b> is information associated with the data point. Specifically, a leading line is displayed from the data point (the time is the second charge on 12/1 and the fraction defective is 5%), and the associated information C<b>1</b> including a CB value &#x201c;40&#x201d; (standard deviation &#xd7;&#xd7;, average value &#x25ef;&#x25ef;), a pouring temperature &#x201c;1320&#xb0; C.&#x201d; (standard deviation &#xd7;&#xd7;, average value &#x25ef;&#x25ef;), and the like is displayed. The processor <b>40</b> constantly displays the associated information C<b>1</b>, even when the associated information C<b>1</b> satisfies the display end condition. Subsequently, suppose that the user points the cursor at a next data point (the time is the second charge on 12/2 and the fraction defective is 1.3%) and selects the data point by double-clicking (an example of the first user operation) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>. In this case, associated information C<b>2</b> is displayed. At this time, the associated information C<b>1</b> and the associated information C<b>2</b> are simultaneously displayed on the same screen <b>2</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart showing a behavior (an information display method M<b>3</b>) of the information display system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is started, for example, at the timing of the acceptance of the user operation for the start of the graph display. The same processes as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> are denoted by the same reference characters, and detailed descriptions are not repeated. The case of displaying the screens shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> will be described below as an example.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the processor <b>40</b> executes the graph step (S<b>16</b>) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Thereby, the graph is displayed on the screen <b>2</b>a of the display <b>2</b>. Subsequently, the processor <b>40</b> sequentially executes the determination step (S<b>24</b>), the associated information display step (S<b>26</b>) and the determination step (S<b>28</b>) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Thereby, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the associated information C<b>1</b> is displayed on the screen <b>2</b><i>a. </i>Subsequently, as a determination step (S<b>30</b>), the processor <b>40</b> determines whether the user operation is the first user operation. The processor <b>40</b> refers to the definition data <b>412</b>, and determines whether the user operation for displaying the associated information C<b>1</b> is the first user operation. For example, in the case where the first user operation is the double-clicking and where the user has selected the data point for displaying the associated information C<b>1</b> by clicking, the processor <b>40</b> determines that the user operation is not the first user operation. In this case, as the associated information end step (S<b>32</b>), the processor <b>40</b> ends the display of the associated information C<b>1</b>. On the other hand, for example, in the case where the first user operation is the double-clicking and where the user has selected the data point for displaying the associated information C<b>1</b> by double-clicking, the processor <b>40</b> determines that the user operation is the first user operation. In this case, the processor <b>40</b> skips the associated information end step (S<b>32</b>). Thereby, the display of the associated information C<b>1</b> is continued even in the case where the user selects another data point. Then, the processor <b>40</b> executes the graph display end step (S<b>38</b>), and ends the display of the graph (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the case of ending the display of the associated information in the middle, the processor <b>40</b>, for example, may display a cancel button at an upper right portion in a display region for the associated information, and may end the display of the associated information when the cancel button is pressed. Further, the processor <b>40</b> may select the parameter in the associated information, such that the parameters of the associated information C<b>1</b> and the associated information C<b>2</b> that are simultaneously displayed are common. Alternatively, in the case where the processor <b>40</b> displays associated information about a data point for which it is determined that the result is out of a previously set permissible range (rejection) and associated information about a data point for which it is determined that the result is within the previously set permissible range (acceptance), the parameter in the associated information is selected such that the associated information about the data point for which the result is accepted includes the parameter in the associated information about the data point for which the result is rejected.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">By executing the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the information display system <b>1</b> can continue the display of the parameter displayed by the user operation or end the display, depending on the user operation.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">[Modification 5: Comparative Display of Associated Information]</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The processor <b>40</b> may further devise the display of the associated information for easily comparing pieces of associated information that are associated with data points. For example, in the case where the user operation of selecting the data point of the graph is a user operation of selecting a plurality of data points, the processor <b>40</b> may collectively display information relevant to the parameter and related to the plurality of data points, in tabular form. For example, the user operation of selecting a plurality of data points is an operation of clicking a plurality of data points at a predetermined time interval. Alternatively, the user operation of selecting a plurality of data points is an operation of clicking a plurality of data points while pressing a CTRL key. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> are screen examples for describing an information display manner Suppose that a data point (the time is the second charge on 12/1 and the fraction defective is 5%) and a data point (the time is the second charge on 12/2 and the fraction defective is 1.3%) surrounded by broken lines are selected by the user as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>. In this case, the processor <b>40</b> collectively displays parameters for the associated information about the two data points in a table D<b>1</b>. Furthermore, the processor <b>40</b> may display a selection table D<b>2</b> in such a way to allow also another parameter to be added in the comparative table, and may allow the selection of a parameter that is added in the table D<b>1</b>. By configuring the information display system <b>1</b> in this way, the information display system <b>1</b> can compactly display the parameter relevant to a plurality of data points.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">[Modification 6: Detail Display of Associated Information]</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The processor <b>40</b> may put a link to the associated information, and may allow the selection of the parameter in the associated information. Then, in response to the user operation of selecting the parameter in the associated information that is displayed on the display <b>2</b>, the processor <b>40</b> may display a graph resulting from plotting the selected parameter as the data point, on the display <b>2</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> are screen examples for describing an information display manner As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, the CB value and the pouring temperature are shown as the associated information C. Links are put to the parameters in the associated information C. The processor <b>40</b> displays a graph for a parameter selected by the user operation, on the screen <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the display <b>2</b>. For example, in the case where the CB value in the associated information C shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> is selected by the user, a graph E showing the relation between the CB value and the time is displayed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>. A data point group F shown by a broken line in the graph E is information about the CB value displayed as the associated information C and values around that.
