SPHs may have effects on glucose uptake (Chevrier et al., 2015, Roblet et al., 2016) and hepatic glucose production (Chevrier et al., 2015). These bioactivities may be caused by the presence of low molecular (&#x3c;1 kDa) bioactive peptides (BPs) in the SPHs (Chevrier et al., 2015, Roblet et al., 2016).

The peptides described herein can increase glucose uptake or decrease hepatic glucose production in vitro or in vivo.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0040">Glucose uptake can typically occur in one of two ways: passively (such as by facilitated diffusion) or actively (such as by secondary active transport).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0041">An increase in glucose uptake by a cell refers to the increase in the amount, whether active or passive, of glucose that is taken up by the cell. Thus, reducing glucose uptake of a cell includes the reduction of uptake of glucose by the cell from the extracellular environment, e.g., from blood vessels or surrounding environment. Reducing glucose uptake includes a reduction or decrease in the uptake of glucose by at least some cells of a subject. The terms higher or increase refer to any increase above normal homeostatic levels. For example, control levels are in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo levels prior to, or in the absence of, addition of an agent. Thus, the increase can be at least: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100%, or any amount of increase in between as compared to native or control levels.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0042">Peptides provided by the present disclosure are set out in Table 1 (SEQ ID NOs: 1-4).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0043">As used herein, the term &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; refers to two or more amino acids linked by a peptide bond, and includes synthetic and natural peptides as well as peptides that are modified.

Hybridization may occur to all or a portion of a nucleic acid sequence molecule. The hybridizing portion is typically at least 15 (e.g. 20, 25, 30, 40 or 50) nucleotides in length. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the stability of a nucleic acid duplex, or hybrids, is determined by the Tm, which in sodium containing buffers is a function of the sodium ion concentration and temperature (Tm=81.5&#xb0; C.&#x2212;16.6 (Log 10 (Na+))+0.41(% (G+C)&#x2212;600/l), or similar equation). Accordingly, the parameters in the wash conditions that determine hybrid stability are sodium ion concentration and temperature. In order to identify molecules that are similar, but not identical, to a known nucleic acid molecule a 1% mismatch may be assumed to result in about a 1&#xb0; C. decrease in Tm, for example if nucleic acid molecules are sought that have a &#x3e;95% identity, the final wash temperature will be reduced by about 5&#xb0; C. Based on these considerations those skilled in the art will be able to readily select appropriate hybridization conditions. In preferred embodiments, stringent hybridization conditions are selected. By way of example the following conditions may be employed to achieve stringent hybridization: hybridization at 5&#xd7; sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC)/5&#xd7;Denhardt's solution/1.0% SDS at Tm (based on the above equation) &#x2212;5&#xb0; C., followed by a wash of 0.2&#xd7;SSC/0.1% SDS at 60&#xb0; C. Moderately stringent hybridization conditions include a washing step in 3&#xd7;SSC at 42&#xb0; C. It is understood however that equivalent stringencies may be achieved using alternative buffers, salts and temperatures.

EDUF experiments were performed in batches for both cell configurations using constant electrical field strength of 6 V/cm (corresponding to a current density varying between 0.005 and 0.008 A/cm<sup>2 </sup>during the treatment). The system was run at controlled temperature (&#x2dc;16&#xb0; C.) to prevent growth of microorganisms (Suwal, Roblet, Amiot, &#x26; Bazinet, 2015). The pH of SPH and recovery (KCl) solutions were adjusted to pH 6 before each run with 0.1 N NaOH and/or 0.1N HCl and maintained constant thereafter (Roblet et al., 2016). For each treatment 10 mL-sample of SPH and recovery solutions were collected every hour before applying voltage and during the treatment to determine the peptide migration rate and their kinetics of migration. The electrical conductivity of the SPH feedstock and recovery solutions was maintained at a constant level by adding KCl, following the recommendations of Suwal et al, (2015) (Suwal et al., 2015). The current intensity, electrical potential differences of the AEM, CEM and UFMs were recorded every 30 min during EDUF treatment for both configurations. Finally, 3 replicates of each condition were performed.

Results demonstrated a higher migration of cationic peptides comparatively to the anionic peptide (P=0.007). Indeed, the final concentration obtained after 4 h of EDUF separation were 134.20&#xb1;25.01 and 220.58&#xb1;15.75 &#x3bc;g/mL for K<sub>CL</sub>&#x2212; and K<sub>CL</sub>+, respectively. These results are in accordance with our previous works on the separation of salmon protein hydrolysate by EDUF (Henaux et al, 2019). Indeed, higher migration rates were obtained for cationic peptides. Without wishing to be bound by theory, two phenomena could explain these results. First, a higher concentration of cationic peptides in the USPH allowed a higher migration of these peptides in the recovery compartments (Henaux et al. 2019). Secondly, the migration through the ultrafiltration membrane was based on the peptide electrophoretic mobility (depending on the peptide charges and molecular weight). Due to a medium/low charge under the mass ratio resulting in a lower electrophoretic mobility the migration of anionic peptide towards the recovery compartments could be limited, and a higher voltage should be necessary to increase their migration (Aider, Arul, Mateescu, Brunet, &#x26; Bazinet, 2006). Indeed, previous work on the impact of field strength on chitosan oligomer migration have demonstrated that an increase of electric field strength allowed a higher migration of di-, tri- and tetramer (Aider, Brunet, &#x26; Bazinet, 2009). Moreover, from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> it appeared that the migration of anionic peptide reached a plateau at 150 minutes while the migration of cationic peptides continued to increase linearly even after 240 minutes of EDUF experiments.</p><heading id="h-0031" level="2">Evolution of Peptide Profile During the EDUF Separation:</heading><p id="p-0112" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> represents the UV spectra of the recovery compartments after 4 h of EDUF separation.

Indeed, out of fifteen peaks, nine demonstrated an increase of their abundances in K<sub>CL</sub>&#x2212; (peak 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13), while six showed a decrease of their abundances in the K<sub>CL</sub>&#x2212; (peaks 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 15), comparatively to the C<sub>FFC </sub>and/or the C<sub>FFC2</sub>. Concerning configuration 2, significant differences were observed after the EDUF separation, between the A<sub>FFC </sub>and the A<sub>FFC2 </sub>and/or the K<sub>CL</sub>+. Most of the peaks (9 peaks) were decreased in the A<sub>FFC2 </sub>and the K<sub>CL</sub>+ comparatively to the A<sub>FFC</sub>, and only two peaks (peaks 5 and 6) demonstrated a significant increase of its abundance in the K<sub>CL</sub>+ comparatively to the A<sub>FFC</sub>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0117">Without being bound by theory, the differences in abundance observed between both compartments (feed and recovery compartments) may have been principally due to the selectivity of the EDUF process. Inventors demonstrated significant differences in terms of abundances and total peaks between the feed and recovery compartments after 360 minutes of EDUF separation. Moreover, a number of compounds were not able to cross the ultrafiltration membrane (those marked with one asterisk) while, some compounds were concentrated in the recovery compartments (those marked with two asterisks). For configuration 1, forty compounds were concentrated in K<sub>CL</sub>. According to the potential anti-diabetic peptides previously identified (Henaux et al. 2019), three of these peptides were concentrated in the K<sub>CL&#x2212;</sub>. For configuration 2, three compounds were recovered in peak 5 and thirteen in peak 6, among which two compounds (743.36 and 724.36 Da) were observed only in K<sub>CL</sub>+. For peak 5, three compounds were identified (598.37, 587.32 and 491.24 Da) but none were only found in the K<sub>CL</sub>+. Nevertheless, a compound (587.32 Da) was found only in the feed compartment (in both A<sub>FFC </sub>and A<sub>FFC2 </sub>fractions). Therefore, the increase in peak 5 area for K<sub>CL</sub>+ was due to the concentration by EDUF of compounds 598.37 and/or 491.24 Da.</p><heading id="h-0032" level="1">Example 2&#x2014; Analysis of Synthetic Peptides</heading><heading id="h-0033" level="2">Materials and Methods</heading><heading id="h-0034" level="2">Peptide Synthesis</heading><p id="p-0115" num="0118">Peptide synthesis and purification was performed.
