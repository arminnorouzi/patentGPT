The terminal <b>11</b> may communicate with one or a plurality of core networks via a radio access network (RAN). The terminal <b>11</b> may be an Internet of Things terminal, such as a sensor device, a mobile phone (or called &#x201c;cell&#x201d; phone) and a computer with the Internet of Things terminal, for example, may be a fixed, portable, pocket, hand-held, computer built-in or vehicle-mounted apparatus.

Or the base station <b>12</b> may also be a base station (gNB) of a centralized distributed architecture in the 5G system. When the base station <b>12</b> adopts the centralized distributed architecture, the base station usually includes a central unit (CU) and at least two distributed units (DU). A protocol stack of a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer and a media access control (MAC) layer is arranged in the central unit, a physical (PHY) layer protocol stack is arranged in the distributed units, and the examples of the present disclosure do not limit a specific implementation of the base station <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Wireless connection may be established between the base station <b>12</b> and the terminal <b>11</b> through an air interface.

Addressing is realized by adding a source identifier and a target identifier of a sidelink layer 2 to a protocol data unit (PDU) of an MAC layer during transmission of the sidelink data.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the 5G times, in order to support transmission features and quality of service (QoS) of different services, a unicast/broadcast/multicast transmission mechanism is introduced. Unicast transmission supports feedback, radio link monitoring (RLM) measurement, transmitted power control and connection control, and each unicast connection corresponds to a pair of a source sidelink layer 2 identifier and a target sidelink layer 2 identifier. Before unicast transmission, unicast radio resource control (RRC) connection needs to be established between UE and UE, a PC5 RRC message may be sent between UE and UE so as to transmit UE capacity and radio bearer configuration, including a radio link control (RLC) transmission mode, a serial number length, a logic channel identifier, etc. After unicast connection is established, similar to Uu communication, the physical layer may indicate to a higher layer whether out-of-synchronization occurs according to measurement of a sidelink reference signal, after out-of-synchronization continues for a period of time, the RRC layer may announce that radio link failure occurs to corresponding sidelink unicast connection, a corresponding layer 2 target identifier is deleted, and the higher layer is informed of radio link failure of the corresponding layer 2 target identifier.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Target UE is unique during sidelink unicast connection transmission, that is, it has nothing to do with other UE except the target UE, so after failure occurs to a sidelink unicast radio link connection, data transmission cannot be recovered by reestablishing sidelink unicast connection with other UE, and data transmission is interrupted.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Based on the above wireless communication system, various examples of a method of the present disclosure are provided for how to recover data transmission of sidelink unicast connection to increase sidelink coverage when the sidelink unicast radio link connection fails.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a first flowchart of a method for processing radio link failure shown according to an example.

Compared with no processing when the SL unicast radio link connection fails, by using the third UE as a relay device to forward SL data between the first UE and the second UE supported by the third UE, the SL unicast connection data transmission may be recovered through the third UE when the SL unicast radio link connection fails, such that increasing sidelink coverage.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some examples, the method further includes: a connection message for indicating failure of the SL unicast radio link connection with the second UE is sent to the third UE.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Accordingly, the third UE may conveniently know failure information about the SL unicast radio link connection between the first UE and the second UE from the connection message, and detect whether it can provide a relay service for the first UE and the second UE.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some examples, performing SL data transmission with the second UE through the third UE includes:</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">a response message returned by the third UE based on a connection message is received, and SL connection with the third UE is established, where SL connection is established between the third UE and the second UE; and</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">SL data transmission with the second UE is performed through the third UE.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Accordingly, after the response message returned by the third UE based on the connection message is received, the third UE is served as a relay device to send SL data to the second UE, so that a problem of failure in sending the SL data due to inappropriate selection of connected relay UE is avoided.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">It needs to be noted that before sending the connection message to the first UE, the third UE already establishes SL unicast direct connection with the second UE.
