More particularly, the disclosure relates to wellness tracking for individuals and teams. Specific examples described herein relate to wellness capture devices, systems for tracking wellness of individuals and/or teams, and methods of tracking wellness of individuals and/or teams.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Monitoring and tracking the mental health of members of teams can be used to improve overall team performance. Wellness, a general indictor of positive and negative mental (or emotional) states, can be monitored using relatively simple devices that permit team members to self-report their feelings to a centralized datastore. Unfortunately, existing devices, systems, and methods for tracking wellness of team members are not well adapted for the unique needs of particular teams, such as frontline health care teams. Frontline healthcare workers do not have sufficient free time to track or report their emotional states through existing methods such as surveys or mobile apps. Managers of these teams, such as nursing shift supervisors, do not have sufficient time to process complex reports of data collected from existing self-reporting devices to assess the wellness of individual team members and/or the overall wellness of the team. The demands of these roles require wellness capture devices, and related systems and methods that enable real-time, immediate assessment of the wellness of individual team members and the entire team while also enabling in-depth review and analysis of wellness data. Existing devices, systems, and methods for tracking wellness of team members do not meet these demands. Indeed, existing devices, systems, and methods for tracking wellness do not adequately address wellness tracking needs for individuals, either.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A need exists, therefore, for improved wellness capture devices, systems for tracking wellness of individuals and/or teams, and methods of tracking wellness of individuals and/or teams.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF SELECTED EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various example wellness capture devices are described.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An example wellness capture device comprises a housing and a cover that cooperatively define a chamber, a main circuit board with a system on a chip, one or more mechanical connectors, such as a USB port, one or more wireless connection antennae, such as a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) antenna or a Near Field Communication (NFC) antenna, one or more physical inputs, such as a tactile button configured to register manipulation of the cover, and one or more arrays of light emitting diodes (LEDs) adapted to emit a pattern of light based on an input received by a user as well as aimed at displaying the average emotional state of the individual and/or the team. A light diffuser can be included to distribute light emitted by one or more of the LEDs across a surface, such as the cover.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The portable and wearable nature of the wellness capture devices enable the input and capturing of feelings from anywhere in real time. Furthermore, the physicality of a wearable button provides convenience beyond other capture tools, such as software applications that run on mobile computing devices, which is expected to increase usage and adoption. Various systems for tracking wellness of a team are also described.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An example system for tracking wellness of a team comprises a plurality of wellness capture devices, a computing device with a software application stored in memory, the software application adapted to communicate with each wellness capture device of the plurality of wellness capture devices through a direct physical connection between the computing device and the wellness capture device or via a wireless connection between the computing device and the wellness capture device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various methods of tracking wellness of a team are described herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An example method of tracking wellness of a team comprises providing a first wellness capture device to a first member of the team; providing a second wellness capture device to a second member of the team; and operating a software application on a computing device such that the software application communicates with cloud-based computing resources to obtain data relating to the status of the first and second wellness capture devices, processes the data, and presents a visual display of the data or derivatives of the data that relate to the wellness of the first member of the team, the second member of the team, and/or the overall wellness of the team. The data is also sent back from the software application to each connected capture device, to display the average emotional state of the first member of the team, the second member of the team, and/or the overall wellness of the team directly on the capture device. Machine learning and/or artificial intelligence systems and/or processes can be included to predict a future wellness state of an individual and/or of an overall team.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional understanding of the inventive wellness capture devices, systems for tracking wellness of individual and/or teams, and methods of tracking wellness of individuals and/or teams can be obtained with review of the detailed description of selected examples, below, with reference to the appended drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is perspective view of an example wellness capture device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded view of the example wellness capture device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref></p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side view of the example wellness capture device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a top view of the example wellness capture device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a bottom view of the example wellness capture device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an end view of the example wellness capture device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a sectional view of the example wellness capture device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, taken along line <b>7</b>-<b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view of the example wellness capture device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, with the cover removed.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of a system for tracking wellness of a team.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flowchart illustration of a method of tracking wellness of a team.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF SELECTED EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The following detailed description and the appended drawings describe and illustrate various example wellness capture devices, systems for tracking wellness of teams, and methods of tracking wellness of teams.

They do not limit the scope of the claims in any manner.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, the term &#x201c;wellness,&#x201d; and related grammatical terms, refers to the emotional and/or mental wellness of a human being. The term can include an optional physical wellness component, but does not refer solely to physical wellness.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Example wellness capture devices include a housing and a cover that cooperatively define a chamber, a main circuit board with a system on a chip, one or more mechanical connectors, such as a USB port, one or more wireless connection antennae, such as a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) antenna or a Near Field Communication (NFC) antenna, one or more physical inputs, such as a tactile button configured to register manipulation of the cover, and one or more arrays of light emitting diodes (LEDs) adapted to emit a pattern of light based on an input received by a user as well as aimed at displaying the average emotional state of the individual and/or the overall team. A light diffuser can be included to distribute light emitted by one or more of the LEDs across a surface, such as the cover.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref> illustrate an example wellness capture device <b>100</b>. The wellness capture device <b>100</b> comprises a housing <b>110</b> and a cover <b>112</b> that cooperatively define a chamber <b>114</b>. A main circuit board <b>116</b> is disposed in the chamber <b>114</b> and includes a system on a chip module <b>118</b>, a hardware connector <b>120</b>, a wireless antennae <b>122</b>, a tactile input button <b>124</b>, a first array of LEDs <b>126</b>, and a second array of LEDs <b>128</b>. A battery <b>130</b> is disposed in the chamber <b>114</b> and is operably connected to the main circuit board <b>116</b> to power the wellness capture device <b>100</b>. A vibration motor <b>132</b> is disposed in the chamber <b>114</b> and operably connected to the main circuit board <b>116</b> and adapted to vibrate the housing <b>110</b> when energized. A light diffuser <b>134</b> is disposed between the first <b>126</b> and second <b>128</b> arrays of LEDs and the inner surface <b>136</b> of the cover <b>112</b>. The housing <b>110</b> defines a passageway <b>138</b> through which a loop <b>140</b> is passed, providing an attachment member for the wellness capture device <b>100</b>. An attachment member <b>142</b> is disposed on an outer surface <b>144</b> of the housing <b>110</b>, opposite the cover <b>112</b>, and enables temporary securement of the wellness capture device to another surface, such as a desk, an article of clothing, or the like.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this example, the housing <b>110</b> comprises plastic and is configured generally as a puck-shaped member, defining various contours, ridges, slots, and other features for receiving various other components of the wellness capture device <b>100</b>. An outer surface <b>144</b> of the housing <b>110</b> defines a recess for receiving the attachment member <b>142</b>. A circumferential outer wall <b>146</b> defines a passageway <b>148</b> that provides access to hardware connector <b>120</b>. The housing <b>110</b>, itself, is largely open to chamber <b>114</b>, which is only fully defined in cooperation with cover <b>112</b>. This configuration, in conjunction with the preferred soft and flexible nature of the cover <b>112</b>, as described below, is considered advantageous at least because it provides ready access to the main circuit board <b>116</b> and its various components, the battery <b>130</b>, and other internal components of the wellness capture device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Passageway <b>138</b> provides a structure through which another member, such loop <b>140</b>, can be passed to facilitate wearing of the wellness capture device around the wrist, neck, or other body portion. Also, passageway <b>138</b> and loop <b>140</b> provide structure for securement to other personal items for easy transport, storage, and wearing, such as lanyards, keychains, and the like.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this example, the cover <b>112</b> comprises a relatively soft and relatively flexible material as compared to the material of the housing <b>110</b>. Furthermore, and critically, the cover <b>112</b> is translucent, allowing light emitting by one or more of the LEDs from one or both of the first <b>126</b> and second <b>128</b> arrays of LEDs to pass through the cover <b>112</b>. Translucency is considered advantageous to the overall functioning of the wellness capture device as a team wellness tracking tool as this property facilitates use of the capture device <b>100</b> in related systems and methods. Translucency is optional, though, and alternative materials or systems can be used, including any materials or systems that allow the surface to be aesthetically pleasing while enabling the provision of visual feedback. Also, the relatively soft and relatively flexible nature of the material of the cover <b>112</b> is considered advantageous at least because it provides a desirable human interface while also providing a suitable barrier to entry to internal components of the wellness capture device <b>100</b>, as described above, its suitability for use in human-machine interface components, and its aesthetically pleasing nature. Examples of suitable materials for the cover <b>112</b> include, but are not limited to, flexible plastics, elastomeric materials, rubbers, silicone, and thermoplastic polyurethane.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The main circuit board <b>116</b> can comprise any suitable circuit board providing the desired system on a chip, connectivity, input, and LED control. While the illustrated example includes a hardware connector <b>120</b>, a wireless antenna <b>122</b>, a tactile input button <b>124</b>, a first array of LEDs <b>126</b>, and a second array of LEDs <b>128</b>, any suitable number and type of connectivity, input, and light and/or color emission elements can be included. In this embodiment, hardware connector <b>120</b> comprises a USB-A port, wireless antenna <b>122</b> comprises a Bluetooth Low Energy antenna, and the tactile input button <b>124</b> comprises a push button microswitch. In addition to the input button <b>124</b>, other inputs can be included, if desired, such as a microphone, sensors, such as an accelerometer, for tracking a user's temperature, number of steps taken, and other parameters that can go to the user's overall wellness. In one embodiment, a microphone is embedded in tactile input button <b>124</b> such that pressing the input button <b>124</b> activates the microphone for sound input and recording and/or forwarding of the input received by the microphone.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The system on a chip (SoC) <b>118</b> module can comprise any suitable SoC that provides the desired ability to receive input from the tactile input button, connectivity through the hardware connector <b>120</b> and wireless antenna <b>122</b>, and ability to control the first <b>126</b> and second <b>128</b> arrays of LEDs. Examples of suitable SoC modules include, but are not limited to, the nRF52832 general purpose, multi-protocol SoC module available from Nordic Semiconductor.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each of the first <b>126</b> and second <b>128</b> array of LEDs comprise a plurality of LEDs arrange on the main circuit board <b>116</b>. The first array of LEDs <b>116</b> is disposed near the center of the main circuit board <b>116</b> and the second array of LEDs <b>118</b> is disposed near the periphery of the main circuit board <b>116</b>, radially outward from the first array of LEDs <b>116</b>. This structural arrangement is considered advantageous at least because it provides a desired ability to display different light patterns meaningful to wellness tracking (e.g., inner LEDs on, outer LEDs off; inner LEDs off, outer LEDs on; inner LEDs on, outer LEDs on, etc.). Color LEDs can be used, but are not required. If color LEDs are required, LEDs that emit light of any colors can be used.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The battery <b>130</b> can comprise any suitable battery, including a conventional calculator battery, a watch battery, a rechargeable battery, or 9-volt battery, a AAA battery, or any combination of batteries.
