A search results page is presented in response to a search query, and the search results page includes links to the related webpages. Some search engines are website specific, meaning that the search engine returns search results corresponding to different webpages of the website. This helps users navigate the website by enabling word searches, as opposed to the user having to navigate through a website structure to find a particular webpage or enter a specific URL (Uniform Resource Locator). Other search engines identify search results across the Internet by crawling the Internet, and the related webpages found are presented to the user at the search results page.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">At a high level, aspects described herein relate to identifying an item option using deep learning and presenting the item options in a manner that condenses a search results page.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Items generally have various models or variations of the item. For instance, a cell phone may have numerous models, each with different features that are item options. The item options are generally part of item option categories, such as a new version of a cell phone having different color and storage options.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To identify an item option for an item option category in response to a search query at a search engine, a trained machine learned model is employed. The trained machine learned model can be trained using known user features and user purchase history for a plurality of users. When employed, the trained machine learned model uses the search query as the input, and it outputs the item option by identifying a user group having a common user history and predicting the item option based on the common user history of the user group. That is, the trained model identifies users similar to the user associated with the search query, and identifies the item options by determining a probability that group members would select the item option based on the user history of the group members, and identifying the item option based on the probability relative to other item options for an item option category.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Once determined, the item option can be presented at a display as a preselection. The item options can be presented as an item listing or as part of a search results page. At the item listing or the search results page, the item option is preselected from among other item options of the item option category, and the item options for the item option category are configured as selectable options with the identified item option already selected. When provided as part of a search results page, the search results page can exclude other item listings comprising the same item option or a same set of item option categories.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The Summary is intended to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that is further described in the Detailed Description of this disclosure.

Some search engines return webpages related to the search query that are part of a specific website. Due to the vast and ever-changing nature of the Internet, conventional search engines tend to return large numbers of search results, as there are significantly large numbers of webpages related to a search query.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The large number of potential search results is problematic for search engines and Internet users. In particular, a user can only view so many search results, and only a limited number of search results can be provided at a user interface. For instance, a search for &#x201c;size 12 shoes&#x201d; entered into a commonly used search engine at the time of filing this application provided over 850,000,000 related webpages. It is inconceivable that a person could sift through each of these webpages, and there is no possible way to present even a small fraction of the number of websites on a display. Thus, due to the nature of the Internet, how search results are provided at a search results page is critical to the operation of the Internet. Otherwise, the probability of a person finding a contextually related webpage as a search result is near zero, since only a few of the search results can be presented on a display and it is impossible to sift through such large numbers going page by page through the search results, effectively making it impossible to navigate the Internet.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">To describe this problem in another way, there are so many potential search results that closely match any given search query, the probability of a user identifying a webpage that is contextually related to the search, but is not an exact match, is near zero because such webpages would be interspersed within the large number of search results and may only first occur deep into the search results ranking. For instance, if the user searched for &#x201c;size 12 shoes,&#x201d; but would find red sneakers in size 12 to be the most relevant, the user would likely never identify a pair of red sneakers in size 12 because there may be few related webpages interspersed within the 850,000,000 results, and the first related result might be several thousand related webpages down in the ranking of the 850,000,000. Thus, the manner in which a search engine ranks and displays search results is critical to the operation of the Internet, else a user has to provide a search query specific enough to differentiate from, for example, the 850,000,000 results, assuming that such specificity is even possible without knowing the exact contents of the webpage or its URL.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">To overcome some aspects of this problem, search engines seek to provide search results in ways that give users the ability to locate the intended webpage. In the context of ecommerce, this includes providing users the ability to locate an intended item stored on an item listing database for an ecommerce website having the search engine. Some methods of providing search results for a user include employing deep learning to better predict the search results related to a search query that are most likely correlated to the user's intent.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Some conventional machine learning techniques in this area, however, are of limited use because, in many cases, there is not enough data about a particular user to accurately predict the user's intent for many possible search queries. To compensate, some unsupervised learning techniques have been employed, but the results may still not be accurate enough to distinguish the best search results from the millions of potential search results.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another method used to overcome some of these challenges includes specific presentation methods of the search results. Some prior methods provide reranking, or shuffling a top number of search results avoid all the top ranked search results being related to the same webpage or item.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present technology provides additional mechanisms that can be employed to help overcome these challenges, which are not conventional in the technological field. To overcome some of these challenges, some aspects of the present technology employ deep learning methods that make search result predictions based on a group of similar users, which allows for more accurate predictions using less data about the user associated with the search query when compared to conventional methods. By making more accurate predictions with less user data, the user can be presented with the best of the related search results, thus allowing the user the ability to actually identify an intended search result, such as a webpage or item, and the technology can be employed to more users, including those where there is limited data.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Additionally, the present technology describes presentation methods that provide search results to a user in a condensed fashion, thus allowing additional search results having a different contextual relation to the search query to be presented by excluding similar search results. For instance, some presentation methods provide selectable options, thereby allowing some search results to be excluded and enabling presentation of other contextually related search results.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, as will be described in more detail, the technology provides for preselecting selectable options using deep learning. By preselecting options using deep learning, the accuracy of identifying the best option for the user is high, thus where there are multiple options presented, a user is less likely to have to drill down within search results to find the best search result, but instead, is presented with the most likely option. In all, this requires the user to provide fewer inputs to reach a final search result, including a webpage or item listing, than would otherwise be required with conventional systems.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In all, by providing preselections, the search system receives fewer inputs from the user, as would be traditionally required to achieve a similar result. From the perspective of the search engine, the search engine is processing fewer commands due to the fewer user inputs. This enhances the efficiency of the computing system employing the search engine because the computing system is now able to process a larger number of search requests from users with the same computational processing ability as before. When employed, the reduced inputs and functions processed in response frees up bandwidth across the network on which the computing system is employed, thus allowing the network to facilitate the processing of more transactions by the system.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">One example of the technology that effects these benefits identifies item options and provides the item options as a preselection within an item listing or within a search results page. As noted above, one use of the technology facilitates identifying and providing items as search results to a user. In many cases, items will have multiple variations. These might come in the form of updates to an item over previous items, new models of the item, or an item that is offered having various optional features. This is particularly the case with electronics, where new models and different variations of the models are constantly introduced. In general, item options relate to an item feature, and the item features are usually grouped into item option categories. As an example, a new model of a phone might be introduced having different storage options, color options, camera quality options, size options, battery capacity options and so on. Thus, the storage, color, camera quality, size, and battery capacity are examples of item options categories, while an individual option or feature is an example of an item option associated with the item option category. For instance, 50 GB (gigabyte), 100 GB, and 150 GB would be example of item options within the item option category of storage capacity.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Machine learning can be used to identify item options for a user when a search query is received. In particular, a machine learned model, such as a neural network, can be trained to identify item options as an output based on an input of the search query for the user. The neural network can be trained using a training data set that comprises known user features and user purchase history for a plurality of users. Known user features comprise any identifying aspect of the user, while the user purchase history comprises a stored history of a user's past purchases, including the items purchased and item options for any purchased items. The user purchase history can also include interactions within a website, such as search queries entered, and the user activity following the search query, such the interaction with particular search results of items, and the associated item options and item option categories.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">When training a neural network, the neural network is trained to identify similar users. That is, within the plurality of users, users have various user features and user purchase history. The neural network can be trained to identify similar users clustered in the vector space. A cluster of one or more of the similar users is referred to as a user group. The members of the user group, as a result of the training, comprise a common user history. It will be understood, that &#x201c;common&#x201d; user history does not imply that the user history is the same, but rather, it is a user history of users within an identifiable cluster.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Having trained the neural network, the neural network can be employed during runtime by inputting a search query of a user, and may also include a known user feature or item option category. The trained neural network outputs item options that have been determined based on the common user history of the user group associated with the user of the search query. That is, the neural network predicts the item option for an item option category based on the purchase history of the user or the purchase history of the group of users having the common history.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The item options determined by the neural network can be presented to the user as a preselection. That is, the item option categories are configured to comprise selectable options for each of the item options in the item option categories, and the item options determined by the trained neural network can be provided as a preselection of the selectable options. Thus, the user could continue navigation using the preselection or select another selectable option. However, using machine learning, the overall likelihood that the user will continue navigation with the preselection is higher, requiring the user to engage in fewer navigation steps. Additionally, but providing the preselection, the preselection can be provided at a search results page, and the search result page be condensed to show more relevant results. That is, since the user is presented with a preselection, but can change the preselection to another item option, the search results page can exclude other search results having the same item option or the same item option categories, thereby helping to duplicate or contextually similar search results that can hinder the user's ability to identify other more relevant results.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It will be realized that the method previously described is only an example that can be practiced from the description that follows, and it has been provided to more easily understand the technology and recognize its benefits. Additional examples are now described with reference to the figures.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">With reference first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, among other components or engines not shown, example operating environment <b>100</b> includes computing device <b>102</b>.

In implementations, computing device <b>102</b> may be a client-side or front-end device, while in other implementations computing device <b>102</b> represents a back-end or server-side device. As will be discussed, computing device <b>102</b> may also represent one or more computing devices, and as such, some variations of the technology comprise both a client-side or front-end device, and a back-end or server-side computing device performing one or more functions that will be further described.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Operating environment <b>100</b> comprises data store <b>106</b>.

Although some components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are depicted as single components, the depictions are intended as examples in nature and in number, and are not to be construed as limiting for all implementations of the present disclosure. The functionality of operating environment <b>100</b> can be further described based on the functionality and features of its components. Other arrangements and elements (e.g., machines, interfaces, functions, orders, groupings of functions, etc.) can be used in addition to or instead of those shown, and some elements may be omitted altogether.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, many of the elements described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, such as those described in relation to recommendation engine <b>110</b>, are functional entities that may be implemented as discrete or distributed components or in conjunction with other components, and in any suitable combination and location. Various functions described herein are being performed by one or more entities and may be carried out by hardware, firmware, or software. For instance, various functions may be carried out by a processor executing computer-executable instructions stored in memory. Moreover, the functions described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be performed by computing device <b>102</b> at either the front-end, back-end, or in any combination or arrangement.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Search engine <b>108</b> generally receives a search query from a computing device <b>102</b> and provides search results in response. Search engine <b>108</b> may be any type of search engine for a computer network, including a web crawler that returns links to webpages related to the search query from various websites across the network or a search engine specific to a particular website that returns relevant webpages associated with the specific website. In one specific example, an ecommerce website might include a search engine that identifies items related to the search query that are offered for sale by third parties using the website. In this example, the search results might include a list of related items that link to an item listing for the item.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Recommendation engine <b>110</b> generally identifies item options using machine learning and provides the identified item options as preselections of selectable options. To do so, the example recommendation engine <b>110</b> employs model trainer <b>112</b>, item option determiner <b>114</b>, and GUI (graphical user interface) generator <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Model trainer <b>112</b> generally trains a machine learned model to identify item options. One group of machine learning models suitable for use by the present technology includes neural networks. One specific neural network suitable for use comprises a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (ANN).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A multilayer perceptron is beneficial in that it can approximate a training function between an input and output target, which can include a search query provided by a user (the input) and an item option for an item associated with the search query (the output). Through its training, the multilayer perceptron learns the association of the input with the target outputs by finding user groups, or clusters of one or more users, that are points having a similar output value. In this way, the training of the multilayer perceptron learns the relationship of one user to the next user in the vector space, where users that are relatively closer within the vector space are more relatively similar in their actions and are used by the trained neural network, such as the trained multilayer perceptron, to predict item options for similar users, including user members of the user group. In this way, the amount of data for on users can be limited, as the trained machine learned model identifies a similar user group of one or more users and can predict the item option based on the user group of similar users.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">When training a neural network or other type of machine learning model, model trainer <b>112</b> can utilize a training data set, such as training data <b>118</b> in data store <b>106</b>. Training data <b>118</b> generally comprises known user features and user purchase history for a plurality of users. The known user features generally comprise any identifying aspect of the user. This could include aspects such as user identification, location, addresses, education, clothing size, occupation, age, gender, and so on. User purchase history could include aspects such as frequency of purchases, items previously purchased, search query history, item returns, price, and so on. The user purchase history may also include item options for previously purchased items, and the item option categories with which the item options are associated.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Using training data <b>118</b>, model trainer <b>112</b> trains a machine learning model to generate a trained machine learned model. Thus, in the specific example that is provided, model trainer <b>112</b> trains a multilayer perceptron model to generate a trained multilayer perceptron model. The trained machine learned model may be stored as trained models <b>120</b> within data store <b>106</b> for use by other components of operating environment <b>100</b>, including recommendation engine <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In general, item option determiner <b>114</b> determines an item option by employing the machine learned model from model trainer <b>112</b>. Item option determiner <b>114</b> may receive a search query from search engine <b>108</b> for a user associated with the search query, or may receive search results corresponding to relevant items identified by search engine <b>108</b>. Item option determiner <b>114</b> can use the received search query as an input for the trained machine learned model when employing the trained machine learned model retrieved from trained models <b>120</b> in data store <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Based on the training using the training data set, when employed, the trained machine learned model determines an item option for the user associated with the search query by identifying a user group of one or more users based on group members having a common user history. For instance, the trained machine learned model identifies a cluster of one or more users that is spatially related to the user associated with the search query in the vector space by a threshold distance, wherein the group of users within the cluster are clustered by the machine learned model during training based on the user history associated with each user. By virtue of being identified within the user group, the users have a common user history. The common user history might include common item options for items previously purchased by members of the user group. The machine learned model uses the common user history of the user group to predict item options for a user and member of the group.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">When employed by item option determiner <b>114</b>, the trained machine learned model outputs an item option. The trained machine learned model can be employed independently to determine an item option for each item option category for an item. As noted, items may include item option categories having a plurality of item options within the category. Using an example, a new model cell phone might have an item option category for color, including black and silver as item options, and an item option category for size, such as a large and small screen as item options.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The trained machine learned model may independently determine an item option for the first item option category and an item option for a second item option category. In cases where each item option category is determined independently, item option determiner may also use the item option category as an input. That is, relevant search results for a search query may be determined and can include items relevant to the search query. For an item associated with a relevant search result, the item might include various item option categories. Item option determiner <b>114</b> may independently provide each item option category for the item as an input to the machine learned model to output an item option for each item option category.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In another example, item option determiner <b>114</b> determines item options by determining a single item model of the item and using features of the single item model as the item options. For instance, item option determiner <b>114</b> provides the trained machine learned model a search query to identify an item option for an item related to the search query. The item option identified may be included as part of a particular item model. Based on this, the item model is determined, and an item option for each item option category of the item is determined based on features included in the determined item model. In another example, the trained machine learned model is configured to, i.e., trained by model trainer <b>112</b>, output a model of an item relevant to the search query, and the item options are determined by item option determiner <b>114</b> by identifying an item option for each item option category for the item based on features of the determined item model.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an aspect, the trained machine learned model determines item options from among a plurality of item options for an item option category by outputting a probability value for each item option, where the probability value indicates the probability of that item being selected by a user based on a user group with a common user history. Put another way, the probability value can indicate a strength of correlation between an item option and the common user history of the user group. The item option having a probability value that indicates a greater probability relative to other item options is selected as the determined item option. In some scenarios, the output of the trained machine learned model may be indeterminate with respect to some of the item options or may indicate more than one item option with a same or similar probability of being selected by the user based on the item options having the same probability value.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In such cases, Thompson sampling may be employed by item option determiner <b>114</b> to determine the item option. For instance, using Thompson sampling, one of a set of item options is selected. Feedback is received whether a user associated with the search query chooses the selected item option, for instance, by engaging the search results with the selected item option, purchasing an item having a feature corresponding to the selected item option, or by changing the selected item option to a different item option. Based on the feedback, item option determiner <b>114</b> can determine which item option of the set of item options has a greater probability of being selected by a user or by another user within a group of users. Thus, using the values associated with the item options and the Thompson sampling, an item option can be determined and selected for a user in response to a search query.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">GUI generator <b>116</b> generally causes generation of a GUI comprising the item option for display at a display device of computing device <b>102</b>. That is, GUI generator <b>116</b> may provide an item option determined by item option determiner <b>114</b> for display. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrate two example GUIs generated by GUI generator <b>116</b>. It will be understood that these are examples, and other methods of providing item options may be performed.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, example GUI <b>200</b> is generated by GUI generator <b>116</b> and is suitable for display at a display device. Here, GUI generator <b>116</b> causes generation of item listing <b>202</b>. Item listing <b>202</b> may be an item listing determined by search engine <b>108</b> and provided to recommendation engine <b>110</b>. As illustrated, item listing <b>202</b> has been generated to comprise item options <b>204</b>A-<b>204</b>E, which respectively correspond to item option categories <b>206</b>A-<b>206</b>E, meaning that item option <b>204</b>A is one of a plurality of item options that are within item option category <b>206</b>A, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As illustrated, item options <b>204</b>A-<b>204</b>E are each presented as a preselection. That is, in the example provided, a user is navigated to a webpage for item listing <b>202</b>, and each of item options <b>204</b>A-<b>204</b>E are preselected. The user may be navigated to the webpage for the item listing by selecting a search result at a search results page following input of a search query. Put another way, item option category <b>206</b>A of item listing <b>202</b> has associated with it a plurality of item options. The item options of the plurality may be selectable options. In this case, item option <b>204</b>A was determined from item option determiner <b>114</b> to be the most likely item option of the plurality with which the user would interact based on the common purchase history of the user group. As such, GUI <b>200</b> having item listing <b>202</b> is initially presented to the user with the determined item option, item option <b>204</b>A, for example, preselected from among the plurality of item options. The user could change the preselected item option, such as item option <b>204</b>A, to any other item option of the plurality of item options associated with item option category <b>206</b>A. This may be done with one or more of item options <b>204</b>A-<b>204</b>E, although only one example has been described for brevity. By initially presenting preselected item options at an item listing, the user can view a specific variation or model of the item, as determined through machine learning, in a manner that requires less user interaction and manipulation at the user interface than would otherwise be required with conventional methods, thus streamlining navigation through a website.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates another example GUI <b>300</b> that can be generated using GUI generator <b>116</b>. GUI <b>300</b> comprises search results page <b>302</b> that includes search results <b>304</b> for a search query provided at a search engine, such as search engine <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Search results <b>304</b> comprise first through third search results <b>306</b>A-<b>306</b>C, but it will be understood that any number may be provided at search results page <b>302</b>. Here, in response to the search query, search results page <b>302</b> is provided having items relevant to the search query, the items being provided as search results <b>304</b>. Using first search result <b>306</b>A as an example, first search result <b>306</b>A comprises item options <b>308</b>A-<b>310</b>E that each respectively correspond to item option categories <b>310</b>A-<b>310</b>E. For instance, item option category <b>310</b>A has associated with it a plurality of item options, each of which is provided as a selectable option. In the example provided, item option <b>308</b>A has been preselected among the item options associated with item option category <b>310</b>A and provided as a preselection. One or more of item options <b>308</b>A-<b>308</b>E may be provided at search results page <b>302</b> for search results <b>306</b>A as a preselection for one or more of item option categories <b>310</b>A.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Search results page <b>302</b> may provide a condensed set of search results for the search query using selectable options or preselections. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> provides one example. A condensed set of search results may be provided by excluding some search results from search results page <b>302</b>. As previously discussed, one conventional problem is that the sheer number of relevant items can mean that many contextually related items will not be seen by the user based on conventional presentation. However, by excluding some search results, other contextually relevant search results can be provided and seen by the user, such as second search result <b>306</b>B and third search result <b>306</b>C.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In an aspect, search results having a same set of item option categories can be excluded. In this case, search results page <b>302</b> may present only one search result for each relevant item that comprises a same set of item option categories. As illustrated, first search result <b>306</b>A comprises a set of item option categories that includes &#x201c;condition,&#x201d; &#x201c;model,&#x201d; &#x201c;storage,&#x201d; &#x201c;network,&#x201d; and &#x201c;color.&#x201d; Thus, another relevant item having the same set of item option categories may be excluded from search results page <b>302</b>. However, by using selectable options, a user can manipulate the selectable options to view other relevant search results while at search result page <b>302</b>, for instance, by changing item option <b>308</b>A to another item option associated with item option category <b>310</b>A, and so forth. As such, search results page <b>302</b> may omit other items that provide the item in a different variation. By doing so, a user is able to view other contextually relevant search results, such as second search result <b>306</b>B and third search result <b>306</b>C.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some aspects, search results, such as search results <b>304</b>, can be condensed by excluding relevant search results that have a same determined item option by item option determiner <b>114</b> for one or more item option categories. For example, search result <b>306</b>A comprises determined item option <b>306</b>B. Based on the determined item option <b>306</b>B, GUI generator may exclude other search results having the item options determined for the user using item option determiner <b>114</b>.

In aspects, one or more computer storage media having computer-executable instructions embodied thereon that when executed by at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to perform operations of a method, such as the example methods <b>400</b> and <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referencing now method <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, at block <b>402</b>, a search query is received. The search query may be received from a user providing the search query at search engine <b>108</b> from a user-computing device, such as computing device <b>102</b>. At block <b>404</b>, an item corresponding to the search query is identified. Search engine <b>108</b> may identify relevant items as search results for a search query. Search engine <b>108</b> may identify relevant items by querying an item database having an indexed set of item listings and identifying relevant item listings from the item database. In many cases, relevant items identified comprise item option categories that are associated with a plurality of item listing options for various features of an item. A relevant item might comprise variations of the item, each variation having a different set of item options for the item option categories associated with the item.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">At block <b>406</b>, an item option may be determined using item option determiner <b>114</b> of recommendation engine <b>110</b> from a plurality of item options associated with, e.g., &#x201c;available within,&#x201d; an item option category for the item identified at block <b>404</b>. To do so, item option determiner <b>114</b> can employ a trained machine learned model to determine the item option for the user associated with the search query. The trained machine learned model may determine the item option based on a user group of users having a common user history, where the user group is determined during the training of the machine learned model to identify a cluster of one or more users as the user group, where the cluster is determined based on the user history of the users, and the inclusion as members of the cluster is based on the one or more users of the user group having a common user history.
