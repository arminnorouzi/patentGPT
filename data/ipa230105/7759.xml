More particularly, but not exclusively, the present disclosure relates to computing devices that are mounted to aerial lighting fixtures that model and manage characteristics associated with the aerial lighting fixtures.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aerial lighting fixtures are known to include conventional light controllers. These conventional light controllers may be electric devices, mechanical devices, or electromechanical devices. Generally, if the controller detects an amount of light that is determined to be insufficient, the controller will direct the light source in the aerial lighting fixture to illuminate. On the other hand, if the controller detects an amount of light that is determined to be sufficient, the controller will direct the light source in the aerial lighting fixture to extinguish.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some instances, the controller may be more sophisticated and perform additional functionality beyond simply directing the light source to turn on or off. For example, the controller may track time of day when it instructed the light source to turn on or off, store an amount of time the light source was illuminated, or provide additional functionality. If, however, an event occurs that impacts one or more aerial lighting fixtures, then it such an event may go unnoticed or uncorrected. For example, if a hurricane topples numerous aerial lighting fixtures in an area, it may be difficult to determine which light poles are up and which ones have fallen over.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">All of the subject matter discussed in the Background section is not necessarily prior art and should not be assumed to be prior art merely as a result of its discussion in the Background section.

More particularly, each smart sensor device includes an interface connector that is compliant with a particular standard used by streetlight fixtures, such as a NEMA-style connector. The NEMA-style connector enables the smart sensor device to be electromechanically coupled to the streetlight fixture, generally on the top of the streetlight fixture. In this way, the smart sensor device is attached to or otherwise integrated into the streetlight fixture and can pass information between the smart sensor device and the streetlight fixture. The information may include any one or more of high speed data, low speed data, power, digital signals, analog signals, differential signals, or other types of information. In various embodiments, smart sensor devices may include or be referred to as aerial control fixtures, small cell networking devices, streetlight-fixture controller, aerial smart sensor devices, or the like.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present disclosure may be understood more readily by reference to this detailed description of the invention. The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing specific embodiments only and is not limiting to the claims unless a court or accepted body of competent jurisdiction determines that such terminology is limiting. Unless specifically defined herein, the terminology used herein is to be given its traditional meaning as known in the relevant art.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the following description, certain specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of various disclosed embodiments. However, one skilled in the relevant art will recognize that embodiments may be practiced without one or more of these specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. Also in these instances, well-known structures may be omitted or shown and described in reduced detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring descriptions of the embodiments.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a system level deployment <b>200</b> of smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I coupled to streetlight fixtures <b>102</b>A-<b>102</b>I. The streetlight fixtures <b>102</b>A-<b>102</b>I are coupled to or otherwise arranged as part of a system of streetlight poles, and each streetlight fixture includes a light source. Each light source, light fixture, and light fitting, individually or along with their related components, may in some cases be interchangeably referred to as a luminaire, a light source, a streetlight, a streetlamp, or some other such suitable term. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that a smart sensor device <b>104</b> as described herein does not need to be directly coupled to a streetlight fixture <b>102</b> and instead such smart sensor device <b>104</b> can be coupled to buildings, towers, masts, signage, or any other structure. Nevertheless, for simplicity in the description, smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I described herein are coupled to streetlight fixtures <b>102</b>A-<b>102</b>I.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Briefly, each smart sensor device <b>104</b> monitors and collects data from one or more sensors or on conditions associated with the corresponding streetlight fixture <b>102</b>. The smart sensor devices <b>104</b> may periodically monitor sensors, such as record the tilt of the light pole every one second, or they may be triggered to monitor a sensor. For example, a smart sensor device <b>104</b> may be triggered to capture data from one sensor based on other sensor data, such as record the light pole tilt in response to a threshold vibration value being captured by an accelerometer of the smart sensor device. Examples of captured data include, but are not limited to light pole tilt, external vibrations, light source temperature, external temperature, power usage or consumption, images, sound recordings, network traffic, network throughput, cellular signal strength, or other information that can be obtained or recorded by the smart sensor device <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In general, each smart sensor device <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I captures sensor data and provides it to another smart sensor device <b>104</b>, a remote server (not illustrated), or some other computing device <b>110</b>. The computing device that receives the data, whether from a single smart sensor device <b>104</b> or a plurality of smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I processes the data to determine if an incident has or is occurring and to take action based on that incident. For example, a current data signature is generated from an aggregation of the received data. The current data signature is compared to a plurality of known signatures of known incidents to identify a currently occurring incident with the streetlight fixtures <b>102</b>A-<b>102</b>A. Depending on the identified incident, one or more smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I are instructed to take an action. In this way, the smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I provide streetlight fixture modeling and management. The following are a few sample scenarios in which such modeling and management may be performed.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a first example, the monitored data from smart sensor device <b>104</b>B may indicate that the light source of the streetlight fixture <b>102</b>B has failed. The system can instruct smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A and <b>104</b>C control or direct streetlight fixtures <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>C, respectively to increase the light intensity output by their light sources. This increased illumination provided by streetlight fixtures <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>C can help compensate for the failed light source of streetlight fixture <b>102</b>B as experienced by user <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a second example, the monitored data from smart sensor device <b>104</b>E may indicate that the light source of the streetlight fixture <b>102</b>E is failing or otherwise has a diminished operating life. The smart sensor device <b>104</b>E can be instructed to modify how it directs the streetlight fixture <b>102</b>E to turn on or off the light source or its intensity, which can extend the operating life of the light source. Likewise, smart sensor devices <b>104</b>D and <b>104</b>F can also be instructed to modify their control or direction streetlight fixtures <b>102</b>D and <b>102</b>F, respectively, to help compensate for diminished usage of the failing light source of streetlight fixture <b>104</b>E.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a third example, the monitored data from smart sensor devices <b>104</b>H and <b>104</b>I may indicate that a weather incident is occurring, such as a hurricane or tornado. Smart sensor devices <b>104</b>H and <b>104</b>I, or even smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>G can be instructed to output alerts or to collect additional data related to the weather incident.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a fourth example, the monitored data from smart sensor devices <b>104</b>H and <b>104</b>I may indicate that a geologic incident is occurring, such as a landslide. Smart sensor devices <b>104</b>G, <b>104</b>E, and <b>104</b>D can be instructed to output alerts regarding the landslide. Additionally, data on the geologic incident may be provided to user <b>114</b> via mobile device <b>116</b>, or some other computing device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a fifth example, smart sensor device <b>104</b>A may be equipped with a microphone and processing functionality to detect a gunshot. Based on the known location of the smart sensor device <b>104</b>A and the time at which the gunshot was recorded, an approximate location of the origin of the gunshot may be determined. In response, the smart sensor device <b>104</b>A, or the smart sensor device <b>104</b>B may be instructed to capture additional camera images in an attempt to locate and identify the shooter or any possible victims.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a sixth example, the smart sensor device <b>104</b>F and <b>104</b>C may utilize air quality sensors to detect air-quality conditions (e.g., wildland fire smoke, smog, or other pollutants). By tracking these data across a plurality of smart sensor devices, the smart sensor devices may identify an origin of pollutants, the movement of pollutants, the distribution of pollutants, etc. This information can then be used to inform or warn the public of hazardous area or identify and fix the cause of the pollutants.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a seventh example, the smart sensor device <b>104</b>B may utilize tilt or vibration data to determine if the light pole <b>106</b>B has failed or is fatigued and may soon fail. The system can then take action by scheduling or initiating a technician to inspect the light pole <b>106</b>B and replace it if needed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">These examples are not to be construed as limiting or exhaustive and other actions may be performed based on the type of incident identified from the monitored data.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in the system level deployment <b>200</b>, a plurality of light poles <b>106</b> are arranged in one or more determined geographic areas, such as a city or town, neighborhood, street, county, municipality, city block, etc. Each light pole <b>106</b> has at least one streetlight fixture <b>102</b> affixed thereto. For example, streetlight fixture <b>102</b>A is coupled to light pole <b>106</b>A, streetlight fixture <b>102</b>B is coupled to light pole <b>106</b>B, streetlight fixture <b>102</b>C is coupled to light pole <b>106</b>C, and so on. In most cases, the streetlight fixture <b>102</b> is at least twenty feet above ground level and in at least some cases, the streetlight fixtures <b>102</b>A-<b>102</b>I are between about 20 feet and 40 feet above ground level. In other cases, the streetlight fixtures <b>102</b> may of course be lower than 20 feet above the ground or higher than 40 feet above the ground. Although described as being above the ground, streetlight fixtures <b>102</b>A-<b>102</b>I may also be subterranean, but positioned above the floor, such as in a tunnel.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The system of streetlight poles, streetlight fixtures, streetlight sources, or the like in the system level deployment may be controlled by a municipality or other government agency. In other cases, the system streetlight poles, streetlight fixtures, streetlight sources, or the like in the system level deployment is controlled by a private entity (e.g., private property owner, third-party service contractor, or the like). In still other cases, a plurality of entities may share control of the system of streetlight poles, streetlight fixtures, streetlight sources, or the like. The shared control may be hierarchical or cooperative in some other fashion. For example, when the system is controlled by a municipality or a department of transportation, an emergency services agency (e.g., law enforcement, medical services, fire services) may be able to request or otherwise take control of the system. In still other cases, one or more sub-parts of the system of streetlight poles, streetlight fixtures, streetlight sources, or the like can be granted some control such as in a neighborhood, around a hospital or fire department, in a construction area, or in some other manner.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the system level deployment <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, any number of streetlight fixtures <b>102</b> may be arranged with a smart sensor device <b>104</b>. In various embodiments, each smart sensor device <b>104</b> includes at least one connector portion that is compliant with a roadway area lighting standard promoted by a standards body, such as a multi-pin NEMA connector that is compliant with an ANSI C136.41, which allows for uniform connectivity to the streetlight fixture <b>102</b>. The controlling or servicing authority of the system can install the smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I on each streetlight fixture <b>102</b>A-<b>102</b>I, or the smart sensor device <b>104</b> may be built into or embedded in each streetlight fixture <b>102</b>. The use of smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I allows for the controlling or servicing authority to control the streetlight fixtures <b>102</b>A-<b>102</b>I, collect information on the streetlight fixtures <b>102</b>A-<b>102</b>I, or provide other wireless services to the public.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the system level deployment <b>200</b>, a smart sensor device <b>104</b> is electromechanically coupled to a selected light pole wherein the electromechanical coupling is performed via the connector that is compliant with the roadway area lighting standard promoted by a standards body. In the illustrated example, smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I are coupled to streetlight fixtures <b>102</b>A-<b>102</b>I, respectively. In this way, each separate smart sensor device <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I controls or monitors a respective streetlight fixture <b>102</b>A-<b>102</b>I</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the smart sensor device <b>104</b> includes a processor-based light control circuit and a light sensor such that it provides a light control signal to the light source of the respective streetlight fixture <b>102</b> based on at least one ambient light signal generated by its associated the light sensor.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In other embodiments, each smart sensor device <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I may be equipped with communication capabilities, which allows for the remote control of light source of the streetlight fixture <b>102</b>A-<b>102</b>I. Accordingly, each light source in each streetlight fixture <b>102</b>A-<b>102</b>I can be controlled remotely as an independent light source or in combination with other light sources, which also for the wireless communication of light control signals and any other information (e.g., packetized data) between smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">This communication capability may also be used for additional communications between smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I, other computing devices <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>D, or a remote server (not illustrated). Accordingly, each of the plurality of streetlight fixtures <b>102</b>A-<b>102</b>I that has a corresponding smart sensor device <b>104</b> may be communicatively coupled to one another and to other computing devices. Each smart sensor device <b>104</b> may be in direct or indirect wireless communication with one another, such as via wireless communication links <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I may communicate with a remote server (not illustrated), which is discussed in more detail below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In other embodiments, one or more of the smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I may communicate with other computing devices <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>D. The other computing devices <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>D may be controlled by a mobile network operator (MNO), a municipality, another government agency, a third party, or some other entity. In at least one embodiment, one or more of the other computing devices <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>D be internet of things (IoT) devices or some other types of devices. For example, in this illustration, two public information signs <b>110</b>B, <b>110</b>C, and a private entity sign <b>110</b>D are shown, but many other types of devices are contemplated. Each one of these devices may form an unlicensed wireless communication session (e.g., Wi-Fi) or a cellular-based wireless communication session with one or more wireless networks made available by the smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I in the system level deployment <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As one non-limiting, non-exhaustive example, each smart sensor device <b>104</b> may operate a small cell networking device to provide wireless cellular-based network communication services. It is generally known that a &#x201c;small cell&#x201d; is a term of art in the cellular-based industry. A mobile device, e.g., mobile device <b>116</b>, provisioned by the MNO communicates with a small cell in the same or similar manner that the mobile device communicates with a macrocell tower. In at least some cases, an active communication session formed between a small cell and a mobile device may be handed off to or from a small cell as the mobile device moves into or out from the active range of the small cell. For example, a user having an active communication session enabled by a small cell may be in motion, and when the mobile device is in motion, the active communication session may in some cases be automatically and seamlessly handed off and continue via another small cell or via a macrocell tower.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As is known, many different types of small cells are deployed by MNOs to serve particular geographic areas within a larger macrocell. Some of the different types are microcells, metrocells, picocells, and femtocells. Microcells generally cover an area having diameter less than about one mile and operate with a radiated power of about five watts (5 W) to ten watts (10 W). Metrocells generally cover an area having a diameter of less than about a half mile and operate with a radiated power of about 5 W or less. Metrocells can provide wireless cellular-based service for up to about 200 concurrent mobile devices. Picocells generally cover an area having a diameter less than about 500 feet and operate with a radiated power of about 100 milliwatts (mW) to 5 W; providing cellular-based wireless service for up to about 5 dozen concurrent mobile devices. Femtocells generally cover areas having a diameter less than about 30 feet and operate with a radiated power of about 10 mW to 1000 mW to provide cellular-based service for up to just a few mobile devices.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Small cells are usually owned and installed and maintained by the MNO on whose network they will operate on. Even in cases of femtocells, which may be installed by non-MNO entity, the femtocells are deployed and provisioned by the MNO for operation on the MNO's wireless cellular-based network. This provisioning is necessary in a small cell because the small cell operates in the MNO's licensed frequency spectrum. In addition to having front end with a cellular-based interface, the small cell has a back end that provides backhaul services for the device. Small cell backhaul is the transmission link between the small cell and the MNO's core network. In some small cells, backhaul services are provided across conventional broadband internet services such as digital subscriber line (DSL), cable, a T1 line, or some other wide area network access point.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the system level deployment <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, various ones of the light poles <b>106</b> may be 50 feet apart, 100 feet apart, 250 feet apart, or some other distance. In some cases, the type and performance characteristics of each smart sensor device <b>104</b> are selected based on their respective distance to other such devices such that wireless communications are acceptable.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I may be coupled to a street cabinet <b>108</b> or other like structure that provides utility power (e.g., &#x201c;the power grid&#x201d;) in a wired way via the coupled streetlight fixture <b>102</b> and light pole <b>106</b>. The utility power may provide 120 VAC, 240 VAC, 260 VAC, or some other power source voltage, which is used to power both the light source of the streetlight fixture <b>102</b> and the coupled smart sensor device <b>104</b>. In addition, smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I may also be coupled to the same street cabinet <b>108</b> or another structure via a wired backhaul connection via the coupled streetlight fixture <b>102</b> and light pole <b>106</b>. It is understood that these wired connections are in some cases separate wired connections (e.g., copper wire, fiber optic cable, industrial Ethernet cable, or the like) and in some cases combined wired connections (e.g., power over Ethernet (PoE), powerline communications, or the like). For simplification of the system level deployment <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the wired backhaul and power line <b>106</b> is illustrated as a single line. The street cabinet <b>108</b> is coupled to the power grid, which is administered by a licensed power utility agency, and the street cabinet <b>108</b> is coupled to the public switched telephone network (PSTN).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As mentioned above, a smart sensor device <b>104</b> may operate as a small cell networking device.

At block <b>402</b>, monitored data from one or more smart sensor devices <b>104</b> is received. As mentioned above, the data may be received by a smart sensor device that is collecting the data, another smart sensor devices that is not collecting data, a remote server computer, or some other computer. The smart sensor devices can report their collected data at selected times, at selected time intervals, when a threshold amount of data is collected, upon request, etc.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In various embodiments, the smart sensor devices collect the data by monitoring one or more sensors or conditions associated with the smart sensor device, the streetlight fixture to which the smart sensor device is coupled, or an environment surrounding the streetlight fixture. In at least one embodiment, the smart sensor devices receive instructions, such as from remote server computer <b>310</b>, that indicate what sensors are to be monitored and what data is to be collected.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Examples of the collected data include, but are not limited to, tilt sensor data, accelerometer data, temperature data, power metering data, camera images or video, sound data, humidity sensor data, rain collection data, wind collection data, air quality data, or other data that can monitored about the smart sensor device itself, the streetlight fixture to which the smart sensor device is couple, the light pole that the corresponding streetlight fixture is coupled, or the environment surrounding the smart sensor device and the corresponding streetlight fixture and light pole.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In other embodiments, the collected data may include other data associated with the smart sensor device. For example, as discussed above, the smart sensor devices may operate as small cell networking devices to provide wireless cellular-based network communication services in some embodiments. The smart sensor devices may collect data associated with this communication service, including, but not limited to, signal strength, signal quality, data throughput, number of active users of the wireless network, etc. This wireless-network communication data may be utilized to track the overall status and quality of the network.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Process <b>400</b>A proceeds to block <b>404</b>, where the monitored data is aggregated. This aggregation can be for a single sensor, a single type of data, data from a plurality of sensors, a plurality of types of data, data from a single smart sensor device, data from plurality of smart sensor devices, etc. In some embodiments, aggregation of the monitored data includes correlating the data to a same distributed clock. In this way, the data can be analyzed and compared based on the time it was captured and the location of where it was captured (i.e., the location of the smart sensor device that captured the data). In various embodiments, the aggregation also combines the data into one or more time periods as selected by a user.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Process <b>400</b>A continues at block <b>406</b>, where a current data signature of the monitored data is generated from the aggregated data. Depending on how the data is aggregated, the current data signature may be for a single sensor, a single data type, multiple sensors, multiple data types, a single smart sensor device, or multiple smart sensor devices.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The current data signature provides metrics, information, illustrations, or other representations of the sensor data. In some embodiments, the current data signature indicates how sensor values changed over time. For example, a smart sensor device can monitor a tilt sensor and collect tilt angle data. The current data signature that is generated for this data may be a graph of the tilt angle over time, which can provide an estimate of how the respective tilt angle of the light pole coupled to the smart sensor device changes over time.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In other embodiments, the current data signature indicates a relationship between two or more sensor values. For example, a smart sensor device may capture light source temperature data and streetlight fixture power consumption data. The current data signature that is generated for this data may be the relationship between the light source temperature and the power consumption by the light source, which can provide an estimate of the efficiency of the light source.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As mentioned above, the current data signature may be generated for a plurality of smart sensor devices. This current data signature may include information for each separate smart sensor device (e.g., vibration data for each sensor over time) or it may be some combination of the data (e.g., an average power consumption over time). It should be noted that the plurality of smart sensor devices may be the smart sensor devices coupled to streetlight fixtures on a given street, on a particular block, along a particular stretch of highway, in a city or town, in a particular radius or area, etc. In this way, data from smart sensor devices can be analyzed at a lower granularity, such as at the city level, or at a higher granularity, such as at the street or block level.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">It should be recognized that virtually any combination of sensor data and data metrics may be used to generate the current data signature for data from one or more smart sensor devices.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Process <b>400</b>A proceeds next to block <b>408</b>, where the current data signature is compared to a plurality of known signatures. The know signatures are patterns, thresholds, trends, tendencies, values, or other models or collections of information that are representative of a particular type of incident. The plurality of known signatures may be generated by an administrator, a manufacturer (e.g., the manufacturer or the light pole or the manufacturer of the streetlight fixture), based on historical data and failures, etc. Examples of the known signatures may include, but are not limited to, failed light source signatures, failing light source signatures, weather incident signatures, geologic incident signature, fatigued or failed light pole signatures, fatigued or failed streetlight fixture signatures, etc.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As one non-exhaustive example, a failing light source signature may be a steady decline in power consumption by the light source (or the streetlight fixture) over time. When the current data signature is compared to the failing light source signature, a match between the current data signature and the known failing light source signature may occur if the monitored data also shows a steady decline in power consumption. Therefore, the system can take action as if the light source in the streetlight fixture coupled to the smart sensor device that capture the data is failing.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Similarly, a failed light source signature may be a power consumption threshold that is set based on an amount of power expected to be consumed by the light source when illuminated. When the current data signature is compared to the failed light source signature, a match between the current data signature and the known failed light source signature may occur if the monitored data indicates that the power consumption is below the power consumption threshold. Therefore, the system can take action as if the light source in the streetlight fixture coupled to the smart sensor device that capture the data has failed.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In another example, a fatigued light pole signature may be a collection of vibration or tilt sensor values over a selected time period. The vibration and tilt of the light pole can provide an indication of when the light pole might break, fall down, or otherwise fail. Thus, a match between the current data signature and the known fatigued light pole signature may occur if the monitored data shows similar amounts of vibration or tilt over time to the vibration and tilt values in the fatigued light pole signature.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Likewise, a failed light pole signature may be a tilt sensor value over a selected threshold, such as over 20 degrees from horizontal. This type of tilt value may indicate that something has happened to the light pole, and it is now bent over or on the ground. Thus, a match between the current data signature and the known failed light pole signature may occur if the monitored data shows a tilt angle over the selected threshold in the failed light pole signature. One example implementation of tilt angle data is further described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In yet another example, an earthquake signature may be a selected pattern of vibrations that are detected by a plurality of smart sensor devices within a geographic area. Similarly, a hurricane signature may be a plurality of sensors within a geographic area capturing similar tilt angles during a same time period. In still another example, an earth-mounding signature may be a selected pattern of changes in elevation of a smart sensor device. For example, if one or more smart sensor devices indicate that their elevation has increased 2 cm over a one month period of time, then the ground beneath the associated light poles may be moving in an upward direction (i.e., mounding).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">It should be noted that these exemplary known signatures are not to be construed as limiting or exhaustive. Rather, other types of known signatures may be generated and utilized for different types of incidents. As discussed above, the current data signature can be generated based on data from a single smart sensor device or from data from a plurality of smart sensor devices, or from a single sensor or from multiple sensors. Thus, the known signatures may also be directed towards data from one or more sensor or one or more smart sensor devices. Moreover, sensor data may be collected and analyzed for a particular street, neighborhood, city, county, house, block, or other geographical area.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Process <b>400</b>A continues next at decision block <b>410</b>, where a determination is made whether there is a match between the current data signature and one or more known signatures. As indicated above, a match may be a simple as a single data value surpassing a threshold, or a match may be as elaborate as a specific pattern of sensor data values from a plurality of smart sensor devices. Thus, a match may be an exact match of data values, a value that surpasses a threshold, one or more data values within a given range or within some tolerance percentage from a threshold, a combination of data values, or some other selected trigger of when a match occurs between the current data signature and a known signature. If there is a match, process <b>400</b>A flows to block <b>412</b>; otherwise, process <b>400</b>A flows to block <b>416</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">At block <b>412</b>, an incident is identified based on the match between the current data signature and a known signature. In various embodiments, the identified incident is an incident associated with the known signature that matched the current data signature. In some embodiments, the identified incident is one that is affecting one or more streetlight fixtures coupled to the smart sensor devices. In other embodiments, the identified incident may be one that is affecting or occurring in an area surrounding the smart sensor devices.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Process <b>400</b>A proceeds next to block <b>414</b>, where an action is performed based on the identified incident. These actions can include instructing a smart sensor device to perform an action or collect additional data, outputting a value or information to a user, or initiating a response to address an issue associated with the identified incident. Examples of such actions are further described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B-<b>4</b>E</figref>. Briefly, however, the following discussion includes few examples of the types of actions that may be performed.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In a first example, the monitored data from a smart sensor device <b>104</b> may indicate that the light source of the streetlight fixture <b>102</b> to which the smart sensor device <b>104</b> is coupled has failed. Nearby smart sensor devices (e.g., smart sensor devices that are mounted on streetlight fixtures adjacent to streetlight fixture <b>102</b>, smart sensor devices that are mounted on streetlight fixtures within a line of sight of streetlight fixture <b>102</b>, or some other smart sensor device or streetlight that is similarly &#x201c;near&#x201d; the failed or failing device) can then be instructed to control or direct their corresponding streetlight fixtures to increase the light intensity output by their light sources, which can help compensate for the failed light source. This example is further illustrated and discussed below in conjunction with process <b>400</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In a second example, the monitored data from a smart sensor device <b>104</b> may indicate that the light source of the streetlight fixture <b>102</b> to which the smart sensor device <b>104</b> is coupled is failing or otherwise has a diminished operating life. That smart sensor device <b>104</b> can be instructed to modify how it directs the streetlight fixture <b>102</b> to turn on or off the light source or its intensity, which can extend the operating life of the light source. Likewise, nearby smart sensor devices can also be instructed to modify their control or direction of their corresponding streetlight fixtures to help compensate for a diminished usage of the failing light source. This example is further illustrated and discussed below in conjunction with process <b>400</b>C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In a third example, the monitored data from multiple smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I may indicate that a weather incident is occurring. Various actions can then be performed to provide alerts or collect additional data related to the weather incident. This example is further illustrated and discussed below in conjunction with process <b>400</b>C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In a fourth example, the monitored data from multiple smart sensor devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>I may indicate that a geologic incident is occurring. Various actions can then be performed to provide alerts or collect additional data related to the geologic incident. This example is further illustrated and discussed below in conjunction with process <b>400</b>D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Although four examples are identified and described in more detail below, other types of known signatures and incidents can be utilized to perform additional actions based on the monitored data.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">For example, one or more smart sensor devices may utilize microphones that can detect a gunshot. Based on the known location of the smart sensor devices and the time at which the gunshot was recorded, an approximate location of the origin of the gunshot may be determined. In response, the smart sensor devices that captured to gunshot, or other smart sensor devices in the general area where the gunshot originated, can be instructed to capture additional camera images in an attempt to locate and identify the shooter or any possible victims.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As another example, the smart sensor devices may utilize air quality sensor to detect air-quality conditions (e.g., wildland fire smoke, smog, or other pollutants). By tracking these data across a plurality of smart sensor devices, the smart sensor devices may identify an origin of pollutants, the movement of pollutants, the distribution of pollutants, etc. This information can then be used to inform, warn, or alert the public of hazardous area or identify and fix the cause of the pollutants.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In yet another example, tilt or vibration data from a smart sensor device may indicate that at corresponding light pole has failed or is fatigued and may soon fail. The system can then take action by scheduling or initiating a technician to inspect the light pole and replace it if needed. This action may include automatically inputting a location of each fatigued or failed light pole into a navigation application of the technician. Such actions can be very helpful when it comes to responding to natural disasters. For example, after a hurricane hits an area, the smart sensor device data can be utilized to determine which light pole are down and which ones may need maintenance, which can be quicker and more efficient than a technician driving around to personally identify downed light poles.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">These examples are not to be construed as limiting or exhaustive and other actions may be performed based on the type of incident identified from the monitored data.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">If, at decision block <b>410</b>, there is no match between the current data signature and a known signature, then process <b>400</b>A flows from decision block <b>410</b> to block <b>416</b>. At block <b>416</b>, an output is provided to a user indicating that the data model signature is unknown. In various embodiments, this output may be via a graphical user interface, which enables the user to view or interact with the current data signature or the monitored data.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">After block <b>414</b> or after block <b>416</b>, process <b>400</b>A terminates or otherwise returns to a calling process to perform other actions. Although not illustrated, process <b>400</b>A may, in some embodiments, loop to block <b>402</b> to continue to receive additional monitored data from the smart sensor devices.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Although process <b>400</b>A is primarily described as aggregating data from multiple smart sensor devices, embodiments are not so limited. In some embodiments, process <b>400</b>A may be employed to aggregate data from a single smart sensor device.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a logical flow diagram generally showing an embodiment of a process <b>400</b>B for taking an action based on data model signature matching a known signature associated with a failed light source.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Process <b>400</b>B begins after a start block. At block <b>422</b>, a failed light source is identified based on the current data signature generated at block <b>406</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> and a known failed light source signature, which is determined at blocks <b>410</b> and <b>412</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. The known signature of a failed light source may include, but is not limited to, a power consumption threshold, a temperature threshold, a feedback sensor, a light intensity threshold (e.g., if the light source should be illuminated but a light-intensity sensor is not detecting light sufficient to be an illuminated light source), etc.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Process <b>400</b>B proceeds to block <b>424</b>, where a first smart sensor device associated with the failed light source is identified. The first smart sensor device is the smart sensor device that is coupled to the streetlight fixture that includes the failed light source. In various embodiments, the first smart sensor device is the smart sensor device that captured data on the failed light source.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Process <b>400</b>B continues at block <b>426</b>, where one or more second smart sensor devices near the first smart sensor device are identified. In various embodiments, each smart sensor device includes a GPS unit that is used to determine a location of the corresponding smart sensor device. In other embodiments, an administrator or technician may input the location of each smart sensor device. Accordingly, the location of each device may be a geographic coordinate (e.g., longitude and latitude), a street address, a street name or section, a neighborhood, or some other location identifier.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The second smart sensor devices are identified as those smart sensor devices that are within a selected geographic characteristic associated with the first smart sensor device. For example, the second smart sensor devices may include the smart sensor devices that are within 100 meters of the first smart sensor device, are on a same street as the first smart sensor device, within a same block or neighborhood as the first smart sensor device, within a threshold number of streetlights or houses as the first smart sensor device, or within some other geolocation boundary.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Process <b>400</b>B proceeds next to block <b>428</b>, where an instruction is sent to each second smart sensor device to increase the intensity of the working light source of the correspondingly coupled streetlight fixture. To increase the intensity of a light source, the second smart sensors send one or more signals to the correspondingly coupled streetlight fixture to control a dimming feature of the light source in the streetlight fixture. In some embodiments, the amount in which to increase the intensity may be the same for each second smart sensor device or it may be different, such as depending on a distance the second smart sensor device is from the first smart sensor device. In this way, the second smart sensor devices closest to the first smart sensor device increase the intensity of their corresponding light sources more to compensate for the failed light source compared to second smart sensor devices that are farther away from the first smart sensor device.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">After block <b>428</b>, process <b>400</b>B terminates or otherwise returns to a calling process to perform other actions.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is a logical flow diagram generally showing an embodiment of a process <b>400</b>C for taking an action based on data model signature matching a known signature associated with a failing light source.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Process <b>400</b>C begins after a start block. At block <b>432</b>, a failing light source is identified based on the current data signature generated at block <b>406</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> and a known failing light source signature, which is determined at blocks <b>410</b> and <b>412</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. The known signature of a failing light source may include, but is not limited to, a power consumption threshold or changes over time, temperature threshold or changes over time, a light intensity threshold or changes over time (e.g., if the intensity of the light source becomes diminished over time based on a sensor detecting the intensity of the light source), etc.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Process <b>400</b>C proceeds to block <b>434</b>, where a first smart sensor device associated with the failing light source is identified. The first smart sensor device is the smart sensor device that is coupled to the streetlight fixture that includes the failing light source. In various embodiments, the first smart sensor device is the smart sensor device that captured data on the failing light source.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Process <b>400</b>C continues at block <b>436</b>, where one or more second smart sensor devices near the first smart sensor device are identified. Similar to block <b>426</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the second smart sensor devices may be identified as those smart sensor devices that are within a selected geographic characteristic associated with the first smart sensor device. For example, the second smart sensor devices may include the smart sensor devices that are within 100 meters of the first smart sensor device, are on a same street as the first smart sensor device, within a same block or neighborhood as the first smart sensor device, within a threshold number of streetlights or houses as the first smart sensor device, or within some other geolocation boundary.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Process <b>400</b>C proceeds next to block <b>438</b>, where an instruction is sent to the first smart sensor device to modify usage of the light source of the correspondingly coupled streetlight fixture to extend the operating life of the light source. The first smart sensor device can modify the usage of the failing light source by reducing the intensity of the failing light source, delaying illumination of the failing light source at night, changing an ambient light threshold value to illuminate the failing light source to be later in the evening, turning off the failing light source prior to dawn or on select nights, or changing other characteristics of the failing light source or its streetlight fixture, or some combination thereof that seek to prolong the life of the failing light source.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Process <b>400</b>C continues next at block <b>440</b>, where an instruction is sent to each second smart sensor device to adjust usage of the working light source of the correspondingly coupled streetlight fixtures to account for the changes made by the first smart sensor device. The second smart sensor devices can adjust their corresponding light sources based on the adjustments by the first smart sensor device. For example, if the first smart sensor device dims the failing light source all night, then the second smart sensor devices can increase the intensity of their corresponding light sources all night to compensate for the failing light source. As another example, if the first smart sensor device delays illumination by one hour, then the second smart sensor devices can increase the intensity of their corresponding light sources for that hour but return to normal illumination when the failing light source is illuminated by the first smart sensor device.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Similar to block <b>428</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, some second smart sensor devices may modify their light source usage the same or different than other second smart sensor devices, such as based on a distance the second smart sensor devices are away from the first smart sensor device.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">By having the first smart sensor device reduce usage of the failing light source, the operating life of the failing light source might be extended. Moreover, the increase usage of the working light sources by the second smart sensor devices can compensate for the failing light source. Furthermore, if multiple light sources are starting to fail, the smart sensor devices can coordinate their usage to prolong the life of all light sources or to coordinate their failure. In this way, the municipality managing the streetlights can dispatch a technician to replace multiple light sources in one area at a given time and not just one at a time. In such embodiments, instructions are sent to each smart sensor device to modify usage of its corresponding light source based on the remaining operating life expectancy of that corresponding light source.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">It should be noted that various different combinations of light source usage adjustments can be made by the first and second smart sensor devices to prolong the operating life of a failing light source, while maintaining suitable illuminate at street-level.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">After block <b>440</b>, process <b>400</b>C terminates or otherwise returns to a calling process to perform other actions.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> is a logical flow diagram generally showing an embodiment of a process <b>400</b>D for taking an action based on data model signature matching a known signature associated with a weather incident.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Process <b>400</b>D begins after a start block.

In other embodiments, the instruction to the third smart sensor devices may be to output a visual warning about the incoming weather incident via the light source of the correspondingly coupled streetlight fixture, such as by having the light source blink at a selected frequency.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In various embodiments, the third smart sensor devices may be instructed to illuminate their corresponding light sources in a given pattern so as to show people an evacuation route away from the weather incident or to a safe location.

Moreover, weather incident warnings or alerts may be provided to the user or to the public via other communication means, such as via mobile phone text messages.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">After block <b>454</b>, process <b>400</b>D terminates or otherwise returns to a calling process to perform other actions.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">As discussed throughout <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>, an estimated path of a weather incident is determined based on data received from smart sensor devices in different geographic locations. As a further illustration of this functionality, wind speed and direction can also be monitored across a neighborhood or over an entire city to determine a weather incident's progress. For example, every (or nearly every) streetlight fixture <b>102</b> on each light pole <b>106</b> can have thereon a smart sensor device <b>104</b> installed, as discussed herein. A tilt sensor inside or embedded in the smart sensor device <b>104</b> can be used to detect an angle of the correspondingly coupled light pole <b>106</b>. The angle or change of angle over time can be normalized to an estimated wind speed that is experienced at the streetlight fixture <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the smart sensor device <b>104</b> may also include an external anemometer to measure the speed of the wind experienced by the streetlight fixture <b>102</b>. The wind speed data captured from a plurality of smart sensor devices (e.g., anywhere from 5 devices to 10,000 devices or more) can be used to detect a high wind event, such as a hurricane, tornado, Nor'easter, or some other weather incident with wind speed that can cause harm to people or property.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">The smart sensor devices <b>104</b> collect and monitor data, as described herein, as a weather incident begins and as it progresses. For example, as a hurricane comes ashore, a first string of smart sensor devices on streetlight fixtures on a street next to the shore can capture the wind speed and other data regarding the hurricane. This information, which can be combined with information obtained from additional smart sensor devices more inland as the hurricane moves ashore, can be used to predict the wind speed and path of the hurricane. The prediction can then be provided to a local weather station to distribute a warning via television, radio, or other communication means, to the public regarding the storms progress and predicted path. In this way, multiple highly accurate measurements of wind speed and direction can be taken from all over a city to determine where and how the hurricane is progressing, weakening, strengthening, changing course, etc. Similar monitoring and predicting techniques can be used to track tornados or other weather incidents and warn people of the incoming danger.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref> is a logical flow diagram generally showing an embodiment of a process <b>400</b>E for taking an action based on data model signature matching a known signature associated with a geologic incident.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Process <b>400</b>E begins after a start block.

In at least one embodiment, the identified geologic incident includes at least one of an earthquake, volcanic activity, a lahar, or a landslide.

As discussed herein, information and data collected by the network of smart sensor devices can be used for various different purposes, from detecting one or more light sources that are out or failing to tracking weather or geologic incidents. The smart sensor device data can also be used for other purposes after a weather or geologic incident has ended.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">For example, a report of the smart sensor device data from an incident can be provided to an insurance provider. The insurance provider can utilize the report to assess claims or to create incentives prior to a next incident. In one non-limiting example, the insurance provider may receive a claim for a damaged roof caused by a hurricane. The insurance provider can utilize data from the smart sensor devices installed in the streetlight fixtures next to or near the damaged roof to determine if that roof actually received winds that were high enough to damage the roof as claimed. If the wind speed capture by the nearby smart sensor device is insufficient, the insurance company can take additional actions to verify the claim.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Likewise, the smart sensor device data can be used to compare different claims against one another. For example, two houses on a same block can provide claims for the exact same roof damage. The data from multiple smart sensors on that block can be used to determine if both houses experienced the same wind speed or if they in fact experienced different wind speeds. If different wind speeds are detected, then the insurance company can take additional actions to verify the claims.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">As another example, the smart sensor device data can be used to assess and compare failed structures with surviving structures. The smart sensor device data can be used to determine if the surviving structures received little or no damage because they did not experience the same wind speeds as the failed structures, or if both structures experienced the same wind speed, but the surviving structures received little or no damage because of other structural factors (e.g., shape of house or roof, types of materials, use of damage mitigating devices or procedures, etc.). This comparative information can then be used by the insurance provider to provide incentives to its customers. For example, if the smart sensor device data revealed that concrete fences reduce the amount of roof damage that a house sustains during a hurricane, then customers in hurricane-prone areas can be provided a discount in their premiums if the homeowner installs a concrete fence.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Again, the aggregation and comparison of smart sensor device data from a plurality of smart sensor devices distributed across a city can provide valuable information to warn people about various types of incidents, as well as to reduce or prevent damage from future incidents.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref> is a logical flow diagram generally showing an embodiment of a process <b>400</b>F for taking an action based on an inertial sensor data signature matching a known signature associated with a failed or failing light pole.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Process <b>400</b>F begins after a start block. At block <b>482</b>, inertial sensor data is obtained from a smart sensor device. The inertial sensor data may include accelerometer data, gyroscope data, or other movement-related data. For example, in some embodiments, the inertial sensor data includes tilt angle and vibration information. As discussed herein the smart sensor device may send the inertial sensor data to a remote server computer periodically or at selected times or upon request.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Process <b>400</b>F proceeds to block <b>484</b>, where a determination is made whether the inertial sensor data exceeds a point-in-time threshold. In various embodiments, the point-in-time threshold may include a single data point threshold value (contrasted with a minimum, maximum, average, or standard deviation threshold for sensor data collected for a period of time). In this way, the inertial sensor data is utilized to make real time determinations regarding the status of the light pole.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In some embodiments, one or more types of inertial sensor data are compared against one or more threshold values. For example, tilt angle may be compared against a tilt threshold angle. If the tilt angle exceeds the tilt threshold angle, then it may be determined that an incident has occurred resulting in the light pole being bent over or broken, such as a car running into the light pole or hurricane winds toppling the light pole. In some embodiments, when a single type of inertial sensor data exceeds a threshold value, a signal may be generated to indicate that the inertial sensor data has exceeded the point-in-time threshold. In other embodiments, the point-in-time threshold is exceeded when a combination of multiple types of inertial sensor data each exceeds its respective threshold value.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">If the inertial sensor data exceeds the point-in-time threshold, then process <b>400</b>F flows to block <b>486</b>; otherwise, process <b>400</b>F flows to block <b>488</b>.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">At block <b>486</b>, the light pole associated with the smart sensor device that provided the inertial sensor data is identified as a failed light pole. The location of the failed light pole may be determined from GPS data from the smart sensor device and provided to a user. In some embodiments, other information associated with the failed light pole may also be provided to the user. For example, in some embodiments, a portion or all of the inertial sensor data (e.g., the tilt angle) may be provided to the user. In other embodiments, a damage estimate for the failed light pole may be provided to the user. For example, if the tilt angle exceeds one threshold value but not a second threshold value, then the user may be informed that the light pole is only leaning and may need to be up-righted. But if the tilt angle exceeds the second threshold value, then the user may be informed that the light pole may be broken or on the ground and may need to be replaced.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">After block <b>486</b>, or if the inertial sensor data does not exceed the point-in-time threshold, process <b>400</b>F proceeds to block <b>488</b>. At block <b>488</b> an inertial sensor data signature for a period of time is determined. This collection of inertial sensor data enables the status or failure of the light pole to be monitored or determined over time.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">In some embodiments, the inertial sensor data signature may be an average, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, or other statistical value of inertial sensor data from one or more inertial sensors for a select period of time. In other embodiments, the inertial sensor data signature may be a pattern. For example, the inertial sensor data signature may indicate a first vibration level for a given amount of time followed by a particular tilt angle, which is subsequently followed by a second vibration level that is greater than the first vibration level. These example inertial sensor data signatures are for illustrative purposes and other inertial sensor data signatures may be employed.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Process <b>400</b>F continues at decision block <b>490</b>, where a determination is made whether the inertial sensor data signature exceeds a pole failure signature threshold. In various embodiments, the inertial sensor data signature is compared to a plurality of known pole failure signatures. The known signatures are patterns, thresholds, trends, tendencies, values, or other models or collections of information that are representative of a pole failure. The plurality of known signatures may be generated by an administrator, a manufacturer (e.g., the manufacturer or the light pole), based on historical data and failures (e.g., through the use of machine learning on historical field data or lab tests), etc.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">In various embodiments, the known pole failure signatures may be specific to the type of light pole associated with the smart sensor device. For example, a wood light pole generally has a different amount of acceptable sway compared to a steel light pole. Similarly, different mounting hardware between the light pole and the ground may be taken into account for the known pole failure signatures.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">If the inertial sensor data signature exceeds a pole failure signature threshold, then process <b>400</b>F flows to block <b>492</b>; otherwise, process <b>400</b>F loops to block <b>482</b> to continue to obtain additional inertial sensor data.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">At block <b>492</b>, the light pole associated with the smart sensor device that provided the inertial sensor data is identified as a failed light pole. The location of the failed light pole may be determined from GPS data from the smart sensor device and provided to a user, similar to what is described above at block <b>486</b>.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Although process <b>400</b>F is described with respect to a failed light pole, process <b>400</b>F may also be employed to determine structural failures in the light fixture itself. For example, if the light fixture mounting hardware fails, the light fixture may fall off of the light pole. In this instance, the tilt sensor data may exceed a threshold value (e.g., because the light fixture is upside down) indicating that there is a failure in the light fixture, even though the light pole itself is still standing. Accordingly, process <b>400</b>F may be employed to detect failures in the light pole, failures in the ground-to-light pole mounting hardware, failures in the light fixture-to-light pole mounting hardware, or some combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a system diagram that describes one implementation of computing systems for implementing embodiments described herein.
