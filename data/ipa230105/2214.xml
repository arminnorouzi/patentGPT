device includes a substrate, typically made of crystalline silicon and a suspended element, which is often formed from a portion of the substrate using integrated circuit fabrication techniques. The suspended element is connected to a fixed part of the substrate by one or more flexures, which may also be formed from a portion of the substrate. The flexures are typically made long and thin to permit movement of the suspended element relative to a fixed part of the substrate. A drive beam connected to the suspended element provides a mechanical contact to an actuator, which may be a comb-drive actuator, a gap-closing actuator or other type of actuator. In some actuator designs, components of the actuator may also be fabricated from a portion of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a simplified schematic top-view diagram of an example of a MEMS device <b>100</b> in which a microstructure which is suspended over an etched cavity and is able to mechanically actuate in rotation or in other degrees of freedom. Specifically, a suspended element <b>101</b> includes a large stiff portion that is tethered to anchors <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> via flexures <b>104</b>, e.g., in the form of torsion springs, which allow the suspended element <b>101</b> (also referred to as rotator) to rotate about an axis <b>105</b>, but mostly constrains the suspended element from lateral or vertical translation and rotation in all other directions. The diagram shows the top view of the structure which is typically defined by a photo-mask in a silicon etching process. Its thickness into the page of the figure is typically uniform, e.g. about 50 microns (&#x3bc;m), and is defined by the thickness of the silicon layer that is etched to form the rotator and, typically but not invariably, the anchors <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> and flexures <b>104</b>. In a typical embodiment the thickness of the rotator is the thickness of an SOI wafer device layer. The anchors <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> are attached to a fixed part <b>110</b> of substrate <b>111</b>, e.g., a SOI wafer handle layer. This fixed part <b>110</b> has a cavity <b>106</b> etched into it to allow the MEMS rotator structure its movement. The device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be used to provide some actuating force to another part of the MEMS device such as e.g. a MEMS mirror. A drive beam <b>107</b>, which is also suspended over the etched cavity <b>106</b>, conveys the rotation of the rotator shuttle <b>101</b> to a remotely attached structure (e.g. a MEMS mirror) which is not shown in the figure. The drive beam <b>107</b> may also be formed from the same substrate as the suspended element <b>101</b>. It should be noted that the rotation can be imparted to the suspended element by electrostatic, electromagnetic, thermal, or other means, the details of which are also not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The MEMS rotator as schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is typically used in standard air environment, at nearly 1 atm of pressure and room temperature. In special cases with hermetic packaging it may be surrounded with a different backfill gas such as N2, SF6, etc, or at different pressures. In all cases of nearly atmospheric pressure conditions the structure's mechanical damping is typically dominated by losses to the surrounding fluid (gas, air). These losses are relatively very low and therefore the structures typically have very high quality factors on the order of 100. Thus, they can be difficult to control when actuated as it is easy to initiate resonant/ringing response. Furthermore this results in high susceptibility to shock and vibrations which is not desired. Therefore, it is desired to lower the quality factor of the structure by increasing damping by mechanical means, possibly providing nearly critical underdamping or even exactly critical damping with Q=0.5.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">To provide desired mechanical properties, a viscoelastic medium is sometimes incorporated into a gap between gap between sidewalls of both the fixed part of the substrate and either the suspended element or the drive beam or both the suspended element and drive beam. The viscoelastic medium provides a damping mechanism that controls mechanical properties such as resonance. The amount of damping is difficult to control.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The viscoelastic medium may be a silicone-based gel or oil or another type of viscoelastic gel or fluid. The choice of medium can be based on a number of important parameters of performance. Firstly the material should be possible to dispense in correct quantities to the appropriate locations on the device, therefore its viscosity cannot be too high. Secondly, the material should have a favorable viscoelastic damping &#x201c;tangent delta&#x201d; (tan &#x3b4;) property. tan &#x3b4; indicates how much energy is absorbed (changed into heat) by a material when it deforms. Namely, since the medium will exhibit both loss-less elastic properties and lossy viscous properties, it is important that there is a favorable high ratio of the lossy component of its viscoelasticity over the loss-less component. Namely it is preferred that the medium contributes to the overall damping coefficient of the MEMS device and that it has minor or no effect on the overall stiffness of the MEMS device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Aspects of the present disclosure improve control of viscoelastic damping in MEMS devices by incorporating one or more fluid confinement structures on either the fixed part of the substrate and/or on the suspended element <b>101</b> (i.e. the fixed part, the suspended element or both) to confine a viscoelastic fluid in a limited part of a gap between one or more sidewalls of both the fixed part <b>110</b> of the substrate and either the suspended element <b>101</b> or the drive beam <b>107</b> or both the suspended element <b>101</b> and drive beam <b>107</b>. In this way a first portion of the gap is bridged by the fluid and second portion of the gap is not so bridged. The structures are configured to prevent flow of the fluid to other parts of the gap.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The fluid confinement structures may include one or more sharp edges on either the fixed part of the substrate and/or on the suspended element configured to restrict the flow of the fluid to prevent flow of the fluid to other parts of the gap.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The sharp edges may include corners formed by one or more of the sidewalls of the fixed part of the substrate and/or the suspended element and/or the drive beam. Such corners may include one or more 90 degree corners. In some implementations, the corners may include sidewall corners of the suspended element <b>101</b> or drive beam <b>107</b> that are opposite corresponding vertical sidewall corners of the fixed part <b>110</b> of the substrate.

Presently these products can dispense fluids of lower viscosity not exceeding 20 centipoise (cP). Viscoelastic fluids exceeding these parameters may still be dispensed via these methods after their preparation by preheating or premixing with solvents to lower their viscosity as they are ejected from the dispensing device.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">While the above is a complete description of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, it is possible to use various alternatives, modifications, and equivalents.
