Stents are most commonly used to treat blockages, occlusions, narrowing ailments and other similar problems that restrict flow through a passageway. One area where stents are commonly used for treatment involves implanting an endovascular stent into the vascular system in order to improve or maintain blood flow through narrowed arteries. However, stents are also used in other treatments as well, such as the treatment of aneurysms. Stents have been shown to be useful in treating various vessels throughout the vascular system, including both coronary vessels and peripheral vessels (e.g., carotid, brachial, renal, iliac and femoral). In addition, stents have been used in other body vessels as well, such as the digestive tract.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The use of stents in coronary and peripheral vessels has drawn particular attention from the medical community because of the growing number of people each year that suffer from vasculature problems associated with stenosis (i.e., narrowing of a vessel). This has led to an increased demand for medical procedures to treat such problems. The widespread frequency of heart problems and other vasculature problems may be due to a number of societal changes, including the tendency of people to exercise less and the prevalence of unhealthy diets, in conjunction with the fact that people generally have longer life spans now than previous generations. Stents have become a popular alternative for treating vascular stenosis because stenting procedures are considerably less invasive than conventional procedures. For example, stenosis of the coronary arteries was traditionally treated with bypass surgery. In general, bypass surgery involves splitting the chest bone to open the chest cavity and grafting a replacement vessel onto the heart to bypass the blocked, or stenosed, artery. However, coronary bypass surgery is a very invasive procedure that is risky and requires a long recovery time for the patient. Vascular stents are also being more widely used to treat many different peripheral arteries due to the minimally invasive nature of stenting procedures. To address the growing demand for minimally invasive medical procedures for the treatment of coronary arteries, peripheral arteries and other passageway problems, the medical community has begun to turn away from conventional invasive procedures like bypass surgery and increasingly the treatment of choice now involves a variety of stenting procedures.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many different types of stents and stenting procedures are possible. In general, however, stents are typically designed as tubular support structures that may be inserted percutaneously and transluminally through a body passageway. Traditionally, stents are made from a metal or other synthetic material with a series of radial openings extending through the support structure of the stent to facilitate compression and expansion of the stent. Although stents may be made from many types of materials, including non-metallic materials, common examples of metallic materials that may be used to make stents include stainless steel, nitinol, cobalt-chrome alloys, amorphous metals, tantalum, platinum, gold and titanium. Typically, stents are implanted within a passageway by positioning the stent within the area to be treated and then expanding the stent from a compressed diameter to an expanded diameter. The ability of the stent to expand from a compressed diameter makes it possible to thread the stent to the area to be treated through various narrow body passageways while the stent is in the compressed diameter. Once the stent has been positioned and expanded at the area to be treated, the tubular support structure of the stent contacts and radially supports the inner wall of the passageway. As a result, the implanted stent mechanically prevents the passageway from narrowing and keeps the passageway open to facilitate fluid flow through the passageway.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Stents can generally be characterized as either balloon-expandable or self-expanding. However, stent designs and implantation procedures vary widely. For example, although physicians often prefer particular types of stents for certain types of procedures, the uses for balloon-expandable and self-expanding stents sometimes overlap and procedures related to one type of stent may be adapted to other types of stents.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Self-expanding stents are increasingly used and accepted by physicians for treating a variety of ailments. Self-expanding stents are usually made of shape memory materials or other elastic materials that act like a spring. Typical metals used in this type of stent include nitinol and 304 stainless steel. A common procedure for implanting a self-expanding stent involves a two-step process. First, the narrowed vessel portion to be treated is dilated with a balloon but without a stent mounted on the balloon. Second, a stent is implanted into the dilated vessel portion. To facilitate stent implantation, the stent is installed on the end of a catheter in a compressed, small diameter state and is usually retained in the small diameter by inserting the stent into a sheath at the end of the catheter. The stent is then guided to the balloon-dilated portion and is released from the catheter by pulling the restraining sheath off the stent. Once released from the restraining sheath, the stent radially springs outward to an expanded diameter until the stent contacts and presses against the vessel wall. Traditionally, self-expanding stents have been more commonly used in peripheral vessels than in coronary vessels due to the shape memory characteristic of the metals that are used in these stents. One advantage of self-expanding stents for peripheral vessels is that traumas from external sources do not permanently deform the stent. Instead, the stent may temporarily deform during an unusually harsh trauma but will spring back to its expanded state once the trauma is relieved. Self-expanding stents, however, are often considered to be less preferred for coronary vessels as compared to balloon-expandable stents. One reason for this is that balloon-expandable stents can be precisely sized to a particular vessel diameter and shape since the ductile metal that is used can be plastically deformed to a desired size and shape. In contrast, self-expanding stents are designed with a particular expansible range. Thus, after being implanted, self-expanding stents continue to exert pressure against the vessel wall.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Self-expanding stents of one class are typically cut from a thin walled nitinol tube. Such a stent is shown, for instance in co-owned U.S. Patent publication 2013/0073052. After being cut, the stent is expanded and heat set to a diameter several times larger than the original tube diameter. With the stent now biased toward the larger diameter, the stent is compressed and loaded into a catheter of a stent delivery system. During the loading procedure, the stent is simultaneously circumferentially compressed and longitudinally compressed in order to push the stent into the catheter of the stent delivery system. Because these stents are cut from relatively thin walled nitinol tubes, there is a risk of substantial deformation and maybe even collapse during the loading procedure. As the industry seeks to manufacture ever smaller diameter stents from thinner walled tubes, problems associated with effective loading of the stent into a delivery system can become acute.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure in certain aspects is directed toward one or more of the problems set forth above.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A stent includes a framework having with a length along a stent axis, and includes a sequence of cells that each occupy a discreet segment of the stent length.

The embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>7</b></figref> may be heat set at expanded diameters <b>62</b> of 5 and 6 millimeters respectively. The result being that the framework <b>21</b> is now biased toward the expanded diameter <b>62</b>. Thus, during one typical manufacture, the stent <b>20</b> starts out at a tube diameter <b>61</b> (circumference C/&#x3c0;) that is smaller than an expanded diameter <b>62</b> at which the stent is heat set. Later, the stent <b>20</b> is then compressed to a loading diameter <b>60</b>, which is smaller than the tube diameter <b>61</b> in certain embodiments, for loading into a stent delivery system. Although the advanced T-bar structure and geometry of the present disclosure could scale to virtually any sized stent, the present disclosure and the illustrated embodiments are taught in the context of a stent <b>20</b> having a tube diameter <b>61</b> of 5 Fr. or less.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In order to provide more longitudinal support when the stent <b>20</b> is loaded into a stent delivery system, every strut <b>30</b> of the framework <b>21</b> is oriented parallel to the stent axis <b>24</b> when the hollow cylindrical shape <b>22</b> is at the tube diameter <b>61</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>7</b></figref>.

Each vertex <b>32</b> defines a peak <b>29</b>. The cell separation distance <b>59</b> occurs between opposed peaks <b>29</b> on adjacent cells <b>25</b>, and defines a gap between adjacent cells <b>25</b>. In the case of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> embodiment, the column <b>41</b> of the T-bars <b>40</b> may have a tall H shape <b>72</b>, with each leg <b>73</b> of the H shape <b>72</b> being less than a width <b>34</b> of each of the struts <b>30</b>.

In one embodiment, concave edge <b>49</b> could extend further into slot <b>71</b>, more completely bifurcating top bar <b>43</b> into two peaks (e.g. with outer contours resembling the contours formed by outer edges <b>33</b>).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">An individual peak <b>29</b> or <b>28</b> of a first cell <b>25</b> can be longitudinally aligned with an oppositely facing individual peak <b>29</b> or <b>28</b> of a second cell <b>25</b> adjacent to the first cell (across the gap defined by the cell separation distance <b>59</b>). In one example, a first cell <b>25</b> and a second cell <b>25</b> have the same total number of peaks (the sum of any and all peaks <b>28</b> and <b>29</b>) as one another, and each of the peaks of the first cell <b>25</b> is longitudinally aligned with a corresponding oppositely facing peak of the second cell, such as the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

Loading involves compressing the stent <b>20</b> down below its tube diameter to a loading diameter, and then pushing the stent out of a compression head and into a delivery system. The reason that loading can be challenging is because the stents are designed to have high radial stiffness in order to help maintain vessel patency after deployment, while maintaining substantial flexibility in other modes of deformation (axial, bending and torsion) in order to achieve good fatigue performance in the body. The present disclosure recognizes that one area of stent geometry that can strongly influence packing density and hence loadability without negative consequences to other stent performance aspects are the geometry and structure of the T-bars <b>40</b>. The present disclosure recognizes that the width <b>47</b> of the column <b>41</b> and width of the top bar <b>43</b> can be made wider without compromising stent performance in other areas. The T-bars <b>40</b> of the present disclosure can also utilize material removal via at least one slot (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) along their long axis <b>42</b> centerlines to improve circumferential bending performance that benefits certain stages of stent manufacturing. Specifically, during the manufacture of stents <b>20</b>, fractures and cracks can occur in the region where the struts <b>30</b> merge with the top bar <b>43</b> of the T-bars <b>40</b>. This stress can be caused by the high circumferential stiffness of a wide T-bar. By removing material from the central region of the top bar <b>43</b>, which is shown in the illustrated embodiment by the concave edge <b>49</b>, adequate circumferential stiffness is alleviated to allow small diameter thin walled stents to be manufactured and undergo expansion and heat-setting operations without cracking. Thus, an alternative to the concave edge <b>49</b> shown could be to have that surface of the top bar <b>43</b> be made convex instead. For instance, with regard to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, material removal according to the teaching of the present disclosure to address circumferential stiffness could be achieved by possibly extending the length of slot <b>71</b> along long axis <b>42</b> to reduce the amount of material that makes up top bar <b>43</b>. Alternatively, material could be removed from the thickness of column <b>41</b> and/or top bar <b>43</b> using a material removal technique such as ablation with a laser to optionally reduce the wall thickness while not creating an opening through column <b>41</b> and/or top bar <b>43</b> while adjusting the stiffness of column <b>41</b> and/or top bar <b>43</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Many of the characteristics of stent <b>20</b> disclosed herein seek to facilitate relatively uniform strain in individual portions of stent <b>20</b>, particularly when repeatedly expanding stent <b>20</b> and, after being set at the expanded diameter, when later compressed for loading into a catheter. Examples include using curved surfaces at all transitions, use of similar cross-sectional areas (thickness&#xd7;width) where bending occurs and removal of material where necessary.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In other embodiments herein, at least a portion of the surface of the framework <b>21</b> can have a coating layer <b>100</b> thereover (see e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C</figref>). For example, part or all of the surfaces of the struts <b>30</b> and/or vertices <b>32</b> and/or the T-bars <b>40</b> of the framework can be covered with a coating layer <b>100</b>. In some forms, the coating layer <b>100</b> can include a therapeutic agent, such as a restenosis-inhibiting agent. The restenosis-inhibiting agent may, for example, be: a microtubule stabilizing agent such as paclitaxel, a paclitaxel analog, or a paclitaxel derivative or other taxane compound; a macrolide immunosuppressive agent such as sirolimus (rapamycin), pimecrolimus, tacrolimus, everolimus, zotarolimus, novolimus, myolimus, temsirolimus, deforolimus, or biolimus. In addition or alternatively, the coating layer <b>100</b> can include a polymer matrix, for example a polymer matrix comprising or constituted of a biodegradable polymeric material. Such a biodegradable polymeric material may include a single biodegradable polymer or a mixture of biodegradable polymers. Examples of biodegradable polymers include polycaprolactone, polylactic acid homopolymers, polylyactic acid copolymers such as a polyglycolic acid/polylactic acid copolymer, polyhydroxybutarate valerate, polyorthoester and polyenthylenoxide/polybutylene terephthalate. Those of skill in the art will understand that other biodegradable polymers or non-biodegradable polymers are also available and can be used.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The therapeutic agent can be incorporated in the coating at any suitable level.

The loading procedure begins by circumferentially compressing the stent down to a loading diameter <b>60</b> that is smaller than the tube diameter <b>61</b>. For instance, in one specific example, the tube diameter could be 1.35 millimeters for a 5 French stent, and the corresponding loading diameter might be 1.34 millimeters (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). The circumferentially compressed stent is then moved toward loading into a catheter <b>11</b> of a stent delivery system <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> with a device identified as a compression head. Next, a force F is applied to push the stent <b>20</b> into catheter <b>11</b> while maintaining the circumferential compression. The result of this is to put stent <b>20</b> into a loading configuration <b>15</b> in which the stent is simultaneously compressed circumferentially and longitudinally while the stent <b>20</b> is slid into the catheter <b>11</b>. This longitudinal stress may cause adjacent cells <b>25</b> to move from out of contact into contact responsive to the longitudinal compression. This contact between adjacent cells <b>25</b> is believed to provide additional column strength and longitudinal rigidity to the stent <b>20</b> while being loaded to avoid undesirable outcomes, such as buckling or other undesirable deformations during the loading process. The longitudinal compression on stent <b>20</b> during the loading procedure may be a consequence of stent friction interaction with the interior wall of catheter <b>11</b> while the pushing force F is applied to facilitate loading. After the loading procedure is complete, one could expect the longitudinal geometry of the stent to resiliently resume the separation distance <b>59</b> between adjacent cells <b>25</b> after the longitudinal compression is relieved.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">By utilizing wide top bars <b>43</b>, the individual struts <b>30</b> can be oriented parallel to the stent axis when the hollow cylindrical shape <b>22</b> is at the tube diameter <b>61</b>. This helps to permit each of the struts <b>30</b> to carry a fraction of the longitudinal loading compression in parallel with the longitudinal loading push force F. The columns <b>41</b> of the T-bars <b>40</b> can be made less stiff in the circumferential direction by material removal through the inclusion of slots <b>70</b> and <b>71</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and/or by the curved shape of the T-bars <b>40</b>. Thus, the slots <b>70</b> and <b>71</b> can locally reduce stiffness, allow more uniform bending, and prevent or inhibit the appearance of cracks during heat setting at an expanded diameter <b>62</b>.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The present disclosure finds general applicability in self expanding stents. More particularly, the teachings of the present disclosure are specifically applicable to smaller diameter self expanding stents, such as those having diameters of five French or less. These smaller diameter stents might find application in, for instance, arteries in the lower leg of a patient. Although the stent <b>20</b> in the present disclosure has been illustrated in the context of being manufactured from a thin walled tube of nitinol, such as superelastic nitinol, the present disclosure also contemplates stents made from other appropriate materials, such as other superelastic metals or biodegradable polymers that exhibit superelastic traits similar to nitinol.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The 5 mm (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) and 6 mm (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) stent designs are similar to each other and to the 4 mm (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), but each have unique cell lengths and may have differing wall thicknesses. Cell length finds an analogy to strut length. Unique cell lengths and wall thickness values may be necessary to achieve the appropriate radial force and axial/bending/torsional flexibility for good fatigue performance for each stent diameter. Utilization of parallel laser cuts and associated parallel struts, along with a thin cutting space between cells can be expected to benefit the loading for other stent sizes as well, especially if the stents are designed to achieve a high radial force. This may be because stents with high radial force, but highly flexible in other modes (axial, bending and torsion to promote good fatigue in those modes) generally may have low column strength, meaning that these high radial force thin-walled stents are compressed and pushed into the delivery system they may buckle under the axial pushing force. Tight spacing of the struts and cells enhances column strength, reducing the potential for buckling during loading. Parallel cuts and the associated parallel struts along with low spacing between cells may be a particular benefit to even lower French sized stents including 4 Fr., 3 Fr., and may be even associated small stent diameters as low as 1 mm.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The present is for illustrative purposes only, and should not be construed to narrow the breadth of the present disclosure in any way.
