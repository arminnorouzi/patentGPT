num="0001">The present inventive concepts relate generally to health care systems and services and, more particularly, to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in managing patient care.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In caring for a patient, a health care service provider may interact with one or more payors, such as insurance companies, government agencies, and the like, that are responsible for paying for all or a portion of the patient's expenses. A health care service provider may generate claims for the paying entity that each may include a diagnosis code and one or more current procedural terminology (CPT) codes. CPT codes are numbers assigned to every task and service a health care service provider may provide to a patient including, but not limited to, medical, surgical, and diagnostic services. They are used by payors to determine the amount of reimbursement that a health care service provider will receive by a payor for that service. When compiling a claim for submission to a payor, however, a health care service provider may miss one or more codes for services or products rendered to the patient. This may be the result of an oversight by an individual responsible for entering the code where the code is never entered, an entry mistake where the code is entered incorrectly, a naming convention where a health care service provider uses a different code to represent a group of CPT codes, or other reason that results in a claim being generated that is missing one or more CPT codes for services or products rendered to the patient. These missing CPT codes may result in a health care service provider being inadequately reimbursed for services or products rendered and/or additional expenses in submitting amended or revised claims to payors.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to some embodiments of the inventive concept, a method comprises receiving a current claim associated with care provided to a patient by a provider, the claim including a current diagnosis code and a first current procedural terminology (CPT) code that are based on the care that was provided; identifying, using an artificial intelligence (AI) engine, a second current CPT code based on the current diagnosis code and the first current CPT code; and generating a current confidence level value that the second current CPT code is missing from the current claim.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In other embodiments, the method further comprises generating a notification that the second current CPT code is missing from the current claim when the confidence level value exceeds a threshold value.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In still other embodiments, identifying, using the (AI) engine, the second current CPT code based on the current diagnosis code and the first current CPT code comprises: identifying, using an association rules learning (ARL) engine, the second current CPT code based on the current diagnosis code and the first current CPT code.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In still other embodiments, the method further comprises training the ARL engine using a plurality of historical claims associated with past care provided to a plurality of patients, the plurality of historical claims containing a plurality of diagnosis codes and a plurality of CPT codes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In still other embodiments, training the ARL engine comprises: identifying, for each of the plurality of diagnosis codes, if condition-then result associations between ones of the plurality of CPT codes.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In still other embodiments, the method further comprises generating, for each of the plurality of diagnosis codes, at least one rule based on the if condition-then result associations between ones of the plurality of CPT codes.

However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that embodiments of the inventive concept may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known methods, procedures, components and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the inventive concept. It is intended that all embodiments disclosed herein can be implemented separately or combined in any way and/or combination. Aspects described with respect to one embodiment may be incorporated in different embodiments although not specifically described relative thereto. That is, all embodiments and/or features of any embodiments can be combined in any way and/or combination.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, the term &#x201c;provider&#x201d; may mean any person or entity involved in providing health care products and/or services to a patient.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Embodiments of the inventive concept are described herein in the context of a current procedural terminology (CPT) code capture system that includes an artificial intelligence (AI) engine, which uses machine learning and association rules learning (ARL). It will be understood that embodiments of the inventive concept are not limited to a machine learning and/or ARL implementation of the CPT code capture system and other types of AI systems may be used including, but not limited to, a multi-layer neural network, a deep learning system, a natural language processing system, and/or computer vision system. Moreover, it will be understood that the multi-layer neural network is a multi-layer artificial neural network comprising artificial neurons or nodes and does not include a biological neural network comprising real biological neurons.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Some embodiments of the inventive concept stem from a realization that when compiling a claim for submission to a payor, a provider may miss one or more CPT codes for services or products rendered to a patient. These missing codes may be identified manually by coders and/or reviewers, but this may be a slow, labor intensive process. Embodiments of the inventive concept may provide a CPT code capture system that includes an AI engine to analyze historical claim information to detect patterns between CPT codes contained therein to identify potential candidate CPT code(s) that may be missing from a current claim. In some embodiments, the AI engine may use an ARL engine to identify co-occurrences of CPT codes in historical claims. Rules may be derived based on these co-occurrences and, based on the frequency that the individual rules are found to be true in the historical claim information, confidence level values may be determined for the various rules. The rules may be organized, and tables generated according to diagnosis code. These tables may be applied to a current claim to determine the likelihood that one or more CPT codes are missing from the claim based on the CPT codes in the claim and the confidence levels contained in the tables for the various associations between CPT codes. For example, if a table has been generated for diagnosis code 14891, and the table expresses a rule that if CPT code 80053 is present in a claim, then there is about a 62% likelihood that CPT code 36415 is also present. If a claim includes CPT code 80053, but does not include CPT code 36415, then it may be beneficial to scrutinize the claim further to consider adding CPT code 36415 as CPT codes 80053 and 36415 occur together at a relatively high frequency. The CPT code capture system may, therefore, allow coders and/or reviewers to focus on those claims that are more likely to have coding errors therein, which may reduce the labor and time involved in manually reviewing claims for coding errors.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a communication network <b>100</b> including a CPT code capture system, in accordance with some embodiments of the inventive concept, comprises a health care facility server <b>105</b> that is coupled to devices <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, and <b>110</b><i>c </i>via a network <b>115</b>. The health care facility may be any type of health care or medical facility, such as a hospital, doctor's office, specialty center (e.g., surgical center, orthopedic center, laboratory center etc.), or the like. The health care facility server <b>105</b> may be configured with a claim system module <b>120</b> to manage patient files and facilitate the compilation of patient care data. This patient care data may be generated from health care products and services provided to the patients through health care service providers. The providers may use devices, such as devices <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, and <b>110</b><i>c</i>, to manage patients' electronic records and to issue orders for the patients. An order may include, but is not limited to, a treatment, a procedure (e.g., surgical procedure, physical therapy procedure, radiologic/imaging procedure, etc.) a test, a prescription, and the like. Thus, the claim system module <b>120</b> of the health care facility server <b>105</b> may be configured to process the data in the patients' electronic medical records and to compile this information into potential claims for payment from one or more entities on behalf of the individual patients. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, two different entities are illustrated: a government entity, such as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is represented by a CMS server <b>140</b><i>a</i>, and an insurance entity is represented by an insurance server <b>140</b><i>b</i>. The CMS server <b>140</b><i>a </i>and the insurance server <b>140</b><i>b </i>have payment modules <b>145</b><i>a </i>and <b>145</b><i>b</i>, respectively, that are configured to process each of the claims submitted thereto for reimbursement. Each of the claims may be approved for reimbursement or denied in whole or in part due to one or more deficiencies. The network <b>115</b> communicatively couples the devices <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, and <b>110</b><i>c </i>to the health care facility server <b>105</b>. The network <b>115</b> may comprise one or more local or wireless networks to communicate with the health care facility server <b>105</b> when the health care facility server <b>105</b> is located in or proximate to the health care facility. When the health care facility server <b>105</b> is in a remote location from the health care facility, such as part of a cloud computing system or at a central computing center, then the network <b>115</b> may include one or more wide area or global networks, such as the Internet.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to some embodiments of the inventive concept, a CPT code capture system including a CPT code capture server <b>130</b> and a CPT code capture engine module <b>135</b> may be used to analyze claims generated by one or more providers to identify potential missing CPT codes. The CPT code capture engine <b>135</b> may include an artificial intelligence (AI) engine to analyze historical claim information to detect patterns between CPT codes contained therein. In some embodiments, the AI engine may use an association rules learning (ARL) engine to identify co-occurrences of CPT codes in historical claims. Based on these patterns, if condition-then result rules may be generated in which the various CPT codes correspond to the antecedent (if condition) and the consequent (then condition). Each rule may have a confidence level value assigned thereto, which is a measure of the likelihood that the consequent is present in a claim, i.e., the rule is found to be true, when the antecedent is present in a claim. Thus, CPT codes associated with a particular diagnosis code in a claim may be used to search the antecedent field in the table for that particular diagnosis code. Potential missing CPT codes from the consequent fields in the table may be identified for each of the CPT codes currently in the claim. When the confidence level is above a defined threshold, a coder and/or reviewer may be notified to review the claim for consideration of adding one or more of the potential missing CPT codes or determining if there are other errors in the claim.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example communication network including a CPT code capture system, it will be understood that embodiments of the inventive concept are not limited to such configurations, but are intended to encompass any configuration capable of carrying out the operations described herein.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram that illustrates the CPT code capture system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in accordance with some embodiments of the inventive concept. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, historical claim information including diagnosis codes and CPT codes may be provided as input to an AI pattern detection module <b>205</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example of the historical claim information organized by diagnosis code. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, various diagnosis codes may have one or more CPT codes associated therewith. The AI pattern detection module <b>205</b> may be configured to use ARL to detect patterns in the CPT codes associated with each of the diagnosis codes contained in the historical claim information. ARL is a machine learning algorithm that can detect patterns or co-occurrences in the CPT codes associated with each of the diagnosis codes. These co-occurrences of the CPT codes may be expressed as if condition-then result associations from which rules may be derived. Depending on the size of the dataset there may be numerous potential rules that may be generate. In some embodiments, the more statistically significant rules may be selected from the universe of all possible rules base on the co-occurrences of the various CPT codes.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The support and confidence assessment module <b>210</b> may be configured to use support and confidence criteria to select rules for capturing potential missing CPT codes from claims in accordance with some embodiments of the inventive concept. The support criterion is a measure of how frequently each of the CPT codes or combination of the CPT codes, i.e., any set of CPT codes used as an antecedent or consequent, occurs in the historical claim information. The confidence criterion is an indication of the proportion of a number of times that a rule is true, i.e., occurrence of the consequent given the antecedent, to a number of occurrences of the antecedent. Based on these two criteria, the rule generation module <b>215</b> may be configured to generate one or more rules for each of the diagnosis codes. The table generation module <b>220</b> may be configured to express these rules in the form of tables where a table is created for each of the different diagnosis codes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example of these tables for two different diagnosis codes 14891 and N12. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the tables have CPT codes filled in for the various antecedents and consequents fields. Each row in the tables corresponds to a particular rule for that diagnosis code. The tables also include a confidence field that corresponds to the confidence criterion determined for that rule and the particular CPT codes associated therewith. As described above, any set of CPT codes may be used as an antecedent or consequent. Thus, the antecedent for each rule may be a single CPT code or multiple CPT codes and the consequent for each rule may be a single CPT code or multiple CPT codes in accordance with various embodiments of the inventive concept. The relationship between the various CPT codes and groups of CPT codes may be illustrated by way of a graph. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example graph for a diagnosis code <b>110</b> in which the nodes represent various CPT codes and groups of CPT codes associated with the diagnosis code <b>110</b> from the historical claim information. The directional edges are weighted with their conditional probabilities or confidence levels indicating the likelihood that the CPT code(s) corresponding to the terminating node are present as a consequent when the CPT code(s) corresponding to the originating node are present as an antecedent.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, tables output from the table generation module <b>220</b> for each of the diagnosis codes in the historical claim information may be provided as input to a rule application module <b>225</b>. The rule application module <b>225</b> may be configured to apply these lookup tables to a current claim with a particular diagnosis code and one or more CPT codes associated therewith. The CPT code(s) individually or in combination in the current claim may be used to determine if there is a match in the antecedent field for the lookup table associated with that diagnosis code. When a match is detected, the one or more CPT codes included in the consequent field may be identified along with the confidence value that is indicative of the likelihood that these CPT codes co-occur with the CPT code(s) in the antecedent field. When the confidence value exceeds a defined threshold and CPT code(s) in the consequent field are not present in the claim for this diagnosis code, then a coder or reviewer may be notified to manually review the claim for consideration of adding one or more of the potentially missing codes and/or correcting other errors in the claim that may be uncovered by this investigation into the potential missing CPT code(s).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref> are flowcharts that that illustrate operations for capturing missing CPT codes from a claim in accordance with some embodiments of the inventive concept. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, operations begin at block <b>600</b> where the CPT code capture system receives a current claim associated with care provided to a patient. The claim includes a current diagnosis code and a first current CPT code. An AI engine, such as the AI engine described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, may identify a second current CPT code based on the current diagnosis code and the first current CPT code at block <b>605</b>. A current confidence level may be generated at block <b>610</b> that is indicative of the likelihood that the second CPT code is missing from the current claim.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the AI engine may be configured to use an ARL engine that has been trained using a plurality of historical claims associated with past care provided to a plurality of patients. These historical claims may include a plurality of diagnosis does and a plurality of CPT codes. For each of the diagnosis codes, if condition-then result associations are identified between the CPT codes at block <b>700</b>. These associations may be between sets of the CPT codes where each set includes one or more CPT codes. At block <b>705</b>, for each of the diagnosis codes, one or more rules are generated based on the if condition-then result associations identified at block <b>700</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The rules that are generated may be a subset of the universe of possible rules to emphasize the rules that are more statistically significant. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a rule support value may be determined for each of the CPT codes or combination of codes used as an antecedent of consequent at block <b>800</b>. The rule support value is indicative of the frequency of occurrence of the itemset, i.e., CPT code or combination of CPT codes, in the historical claim information dataset. A confidence level value for each of the if condition-then result associations between the itemsets is determined at block <b>805</b>. The confidence level value indicates the likelihood of occurrence of the consequent given the antecedent. It may be determined as a proportion of occurrence on both antecedent and consequent over occurrence of the antecedent, i.e., a likelihood that a particular rule would have a true result. At block <b>810</b> the rules are selected based on the rule support values and the confidence level values.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a block diagram of a data processing system that may be used to implement the CPT code capture server <b>130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in accordance with some embodiments of the inventive concept.
