The airbag is commonly stored in a deflated condition, together with an inflator, in a vehicle instrument panel. In the event of a frontal impact to the vehicle of a magnitude above a predetermined threshold, the inflator is actuated and the airbag is inflated into a position between the vehicle occupant and the instrument panel.

The vehicle <b>20</b> extends along a centerline <b>22</b> from a first or fore end <b>24</b> to a second or aft end <b>26</b>. The vehicle <b>20</b> extends to a left side <b>28</b> and a right side <b>30</b> on opposite sides of the centerline <b>22</b>. The first end <b>24</b> of the vehicle <b>20</b> includes an instrument panel <b>42</b> facing a passenger compartment or cabin <b>40</b>. A windshield or windscreen <b>44</b> is located between the instrument panel <b>42</b> and the roof <b>32</b>. A steering wheel <b>49</b> is connected to the instrument panel <b>42</b> on the left side <b>28</b> of the vehicle <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Seats <b>50</b> are positioned in the cabin <b>40</b> and can be arranged in front and rear rows <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>, respectively, arranged in a forward-facing manner similar to that of conventional automobiles. It will be appreciated that the vehicle <b>20</b> could alternatively include more or fewer rows of seats <b>50</b> (not shown). In any case, a seatbelt <b>56</b> is associated with each seat <b>50</b> for restraining an occupant <b>60</b> in that seat.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Each seat <b>50</b> includes a base or bottom <b>53</b> for receiving the legs <b>66</b> of the occupant <b>60</b>. A seat back <b>55</b> extends from the base <b>53</b> towards the roof <b>32</b> and receives the upper torso <b>64</b> of the occupant <b>60</b>. A headrest <b>57</b> is connected to the seat back <b>55</b> and receives the head <b>62</b> of the occupant <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The occupant restraint system <b>10</b> includes at least one vehicle occupant protection device in the form of an inflatable airbag <b>70</b> housed/concealed in the instrument panel <b>42</b>. Mounting the airbag <b>70</b> in the instrument panel <b>42</b> is convenient because the airbag can be positioned in a location with a desired proximity to the occupant <b>60</b> it is intended to help protect. This can help reduce the necessary inflatable volume of the airbag <b>70</b> and can also help provide a desired airbag deployment time without requiring an excessively high-volume inflator.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The airbag <b>70</b> is stored in a module <b>68</b> having a housing <b>69</b> made of a durable material, such as plastic or metal. In the example configuration shown, the airbag modules <b>68</b> are mounted in the instrument panel <b>42</b> forward of the passenger side <b>30</b> occupant <b>60</b>. The airbag <b>70</b> inflates and deploys upwards in the cabin <b>40</b> and rearward of the instrument panel <b>42</b>, i.e., towards the rear end <b>26</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>. Accordingly, the airbag <b>70</b> is a passenger side airbag.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The airbag <b>70</b> is at least one of rolled and folded before being placed in the housing <b>69</b> of the module <b>68</b>. The module <b>68</b> is then placed within the instrument panel <b>42</b> on the passenger side <b>30</b> and covered with a door. Alternatively or additionally, the module <b>68</b> can be placed within the steering wheel <b>49</b> (not shown) or within the instrument panel <b>42</b> on the side <b>28</b> when the vehicle <b>20</b> is autonomous (not shown).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In any case, an inflator <b>74</b> is positioned in each module <b>68</b> for providing inflation fluid to each airbag <b>70</b>. The inflator <b>74</b> is operatively connected (e.g., by wires) to an airbag controller <b>80</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) that includes or communicates with one or more crash sensors (not shown). The airbag controller <b>80</b> is operative to determine the occurrence of a crash event and to actuate the inflator(s) <b>74</b> in a known manner to inflate the airbag(s) <b>70</b>. The inflator <b>74</b> can be of any known type, such as stored gas, solid propellant, augmented or hybrid.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The airbag <b>70</b> can be constructed of any suitable material, such as nylon (e.g., woven nylon 6-6 yarns), and may be constructed in any suitable manner. For example, the airbag <b>70</b> may include one or more pieces or panels of material. If more than one piece or panel is used, the pieces or panels can be interconnected by known means, such as stitching, ultrasonic welding, heat bonding, or adhesives, to form the airbag <b>70</b>. The airbag <b>70</b> can be uncoated, coated with a material, such as a gas impermeable urethane, or laminated with a material, such as a gas impermeable film. The airbag <b>70</b> can therefore have a gas-tight or substantially gas-tight construction. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that alternative materials, such as polyester yarn, and alternatives coatings, such as silicone, may also be used to construct the airbag <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, upon sensing the occurrence of an event for which inflation of the airbag <b>70</b> is desired, such as a vehicle collision, the controller <b>80</b> provides signals to the inflator <b>74</b>. Upon receiving the signals from the controller <b>80</b>, the inflator <b>74</b> is actuated and provides inflation fluid to the inflatable volume of the airbag <b>70</b> in a known manner. The inflating airbag <b>70</b> exerts a force on the housing <b>69</b>, which causes both the housing and instrument panel <b>42</b> to open (e.g., via tear seam or door). This releases the airbag <b>70</b> to inflate and deploy from its stored condition behind the instrument panel <b>42</b> to a deployed condition extending into the cabin <b>40</b> forward of and aligned with the passenger side <b>30</b> seat <b>50</b> in the front row <b>52</b>. The airbag <b>70</b>, while inflated, helps protect the vehicle occupant <b>60</b> in the front row <b>52</b> by absorbing the impact of the occupant.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The airbag <b>70</b>, when deployed, extends from a lower end <b>84</b> to an upper end <b>86</b> and defines an inflatable volume <b>90</b>. A first or front panel <b>92</b> faces rearward towards the occupant <b>60</b>. A second or rear panel <b>94</b> faces forward towards the windshield <b>44</b>. The airbag <b>70</b> can include one or more vents (not shown) for venting inflation fluid from the inflatable volume <b>90</b> in a known manner in response to occupant penetration.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In its deployed condition, the lower end <b>84</b> is configured to cover at least a portion of the occupant's knees and the upper portion of the legs <b>66</b>. The upper end <b>86</b> is configured to extend vertically to a position sufficient to receive and help protect the occupant's head <b>62</b> and upper torso <b>64</b>. The extent of the airbag <b>70</b> deployment vertically and/or horizontally (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>) can be adjusted in order to adjust the coverage of the airbags. To this end, the airbag <b>70</b> can be configured to extend further fore and/or aft in order to help protect the occupant <b>60</b> in the event of a side, oblique or offset collision. The inflated width of the airbag <b>70</b> in the inboard-outboard direction can also be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A tether <b>100</b> is secured to the interior of the airbag <b>70</b> for forming a depression or pocket <b>110</b> in the occupant-facing panel <b>92</b> configured to receive the occupant <b>60</b> during a vehicle crash. The pocket <b>110</b> can provide a volume of reduced tension in the airbag <b>70</b> fabric along the occupant-facing panel <b>92</b>, which provides a relatively softer impact/reduced impact forces between the occupant and the occupant-facing panel <b>92</b>. To this end, the tether <b>100</b> extends from a first end <b>102</b> connected to the airbag <b>70</b> at a first location indicated at <b>104</b> within the housing <b>69</b> to a second end <b>106</b> connected to the airbag <b>70</b> at a second location indicated at <b>108</b>. In one example, the second location <b>108</b> is positioned on the interior side of the occupant-facing panel <b>92</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Because the occupant <b>60</b> is belted, a frontal crash resulting in forward occupant <b>60</b> movement causes the occupant to move in a path toward the airbag <b>70</b>, as indicated generally by the arrow F in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. That said, the connection between the airbag <b>70</b> and the instrument panel <b>42</b>, in combination with the engagement between the deployed airbag and instrument panel/windshield <b>44</b>, act to limit or restrict forward movement of the airbag away from the occupant <b>60</b> in response to occupant penetration. In other words, the instrument panel <b>42</b> and windshield <b>44</b> can help prevent or limit airbag <b>70</b> movement in the direction F.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The inflation rate, deployment trajectory, and shape of the airbag <b>70</b> can be configured to optimize the protection of occupants <b>60</b> having a wide range of sizes and/or seating positions. To this end, the airbag <b>70</b> can optionally be used in combination with additional tethers and/or have multiple chambers to achieve appropriate or desired deployment characteristics suitable for the vehicle interior and/or seating position of the occupants <b>60</b>. These features can be configured to help protect occupants <b>60</b> that are slouched, reclined, etc.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">With this in mind, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b>B</figref> illustrate example components and manufacturing steps for assembling the airbag <b>70</b>. To this end, the airbag <b>70</b> includes a series of panels interconnected to define the ends <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>, the inflatable volume <b>90</b> for receiving inflation fluid from the inflator <b>74</b>, and the tether <b>100</b>. A weave direction of each panel <b>120</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>180</b>, <b>190</b> is indicated at W.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Two of the panels used to form the airbag <b>70</b> are illustrated at <b>120</b> and <b>140</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

In this manner, the tabs <b>132</b>, <b>152</b> are aligned with one another.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Panels <b>160</b>, <b>180</b> for forming the tether <b>100</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the panel <b>160</b> extends longitudinally along a centerline <b>162</b> from a first end <b>164</b> to a second end <b>166</b>. An opening <b>168</b> for receiving the inflator <b>74</b> is provided in the first end <b>164</b>. Peripheral edge portions <b>170</b>, <b>172</b> extend on opposite sides of the centerline <b>162</b> from the first end <b>164</b> to the second end <b>166</b>. In one example, the peripheral edge portions <b>170</b>, <b>172</b> diverge away from one another such that the panel <b>160</b> becomes wider in a direction extending towards the second end <b>166</b>. In other words, the panel <b>160</b> is tapered. The taper can extend only along portion(s) of the length of the panel <b>160</b> (as shown) or can be continuous along the entire length of the panel <b>160</b> (not shown). Alternatively, the peripheral edge portions <b>170</b>, <b>172</b> can extend parallel to one another such that the width of the panel <b>210</b> is substantially constant (not shown).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A series of alignment features <b>174</b>, e.g., tabs, is provided at the second end <b>166</b>. In the example shown, tabs <b>174</b> are provided along the respective peripheral edge portions <b>170</b>, <b>172</b> so as to be symmetrically arranged about the centerline <b>162</b>. In other words, each of the tabs <b>174</b> has the same longitudinal position along the respective peripheral edge portion <b>170</b>, <b>172</b> relative to the centerline <b>162</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the panel <b>180</b> extends longitudinally along a centerline <b>182</b> from a first end <b>184</b> to a second end <b>186</b>. The panel <b>180</b> includes a base <b>190</b> centered on the centerline <b>182</b>. A pair of second centerlines <b>192</b> is positioned on opposite sides of the centerline <b>182</b>. The second centerlines <b>192</b> can extend at an angle relative to one another (as shown) or extend parallel to one another (not shown). In this example, the second centerlines <b>192</b> are spaced apart and angled relative to one another in the same manner as the longitudinal edge portions <b>170</b>, <b>172</b> are with one another.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A series of alignment features <b>194</b>, e.g., tabs, is provided at the first end <b>184</b>. In the example shown, tabs <b>194</b> are provided on the base <b>190</b> so as to be symmetrically arranged about the centerline <b>182</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Projections <b>196</b> extend outwardly from the base <b>190</b> on opposite sides of the centerline <b>182</b>. As shown, the projections <b>196</b> are triangular and widen in a direction extending towards the second end <b>186</b>. In one example, the projections <b>196</b> extend along and outward from second centerlines <b>192</b>. Consequently, the projections <b>196</b> diverge from one another in a direction extending towards the second end <b>186</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">One or more openings <b>200</b> are provided along each second centerline <b>192</b> such that the openings are symmetrical about the centerline <b>182</b>. The openings <b>200</b> can have any shape, e.g., circular, elliptical, round, triangular, polygonal, etc. The openings <b>200</b> along each second centerline <b>192</b> can have the same size as one another or different sizes. As shown, the openings <b>200</b> are circular and increase in diameter in a direction extending towards the second end <b>186</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Alignment features <b>202</b>, e.g., notches, are provided on each projection <b>196</b> and the base <b>190</b>. Tabs <b>204</b> extend downward (as shown) from the projections <b>196</b>. A tab <b>206</b> extends downward (as shown) from the base <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, the panel <b>180</b> is positioned atop the panel <b>160</b> such that the alignment features <b>174</b>, <b>194</b> are aligned with one another. In this orientation, the second centerlines <b>192</b> are aligned or substantially aligned with the respective longitudinal edge portions <b>170</b>, <b>172</b> and, thus, the openings <b>200</b> are aligned with the longitudinal edge portions. In this state, the projections <b>196</b> therefore extend outward or laterally relative to the longitudinal edge portions <b>170</b>, <b>172</b> and the centerline <b>162</b>. The panels <b>160</b>, <b>180</b>, however, are not secured to one another at this time.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Rather, the overlaid panels <b>160</b>, <b>180</b> are positioned over the overlaid panels <b>120</b>, <b>140</b> such that the centerlines <b>122</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>162</b>, <b>182</b> are coextensive and the tabs <b>132</b>, <b>206</b> are aligned with one another. The projections <b>196</b> are then folded inwards over the respective second centerlines <b>192</b> and towards the centerlines <b>122</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>162</b>, <b>182</b> in the manner indicated generally at R. Since the second centerlines <b>192</b> are aligned with the longitudinal edge portions <b>170</b>, <b>172</b> the projections <b>196</b> are also folded inwards about and relative to the longitudinal edge portions.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Folding the projections <b>196</b> aligns the tabs <b>204</b> on the projections with the already aligned tabs <b>132</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>206</b> and forms a folded-over portion or portions <b>210</b> in the tether <b>100</b>. In other words, the pair of inwardly/laterally folded projections <b>196</b> cooperate to define the folded-over portion <b>210</b>. It will be appreciated that the projections <b>196</b> can be folded to sit atop the panel <b>180</b> or folded so as to be positioned between the panel <b>140</b> and the first panel <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Stitching <b>220</b> extends along and through the aligned longitudinal edge portions <b>128</b>, <b>138</b> of the panels <b>120</b>, <b>140</b>, the folded-over portion <b>210</b> and second ends <b>166</b>, <b>188</b> of the panels <b>160</b>, <b>180</b>, and the aligned longitudinal edge portions <b>130</b>, <b>150</b> of the panels <b>120</b>, <b>140</b> to form an airbag subassembly <b>230</b>. The portion of the stitching <b>220</b> extending through the tether <b>100</b> extends transverse, e.g., perpendicular, to the centerlines <b>162</b>, <b>182</b> of the panels <b>160</b>, <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">That said, the same stitching <b>220</b> interconnects not only the panels <b>120</b>, <b>140</b> with one another but also the panels <b>160</b>, <b>180</b> with one another and all the panels <b>120</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>180</b> together in a single step/pass. In other words, no separate sewing or securing step is needed to secure the projections <b>196</b> to the second end <b>166</b> of the panel <b>160</b>. One or both ends of the stitching <b>220</b> can include backtack (not shown) to prevent loosening of the stitching. It will be appreciated that one or more additional panels of material are secured to the subassembly <b>230</b> in order to form the remainder of the airbag <b>70</b>, including the ends <b>84</b>, <b>86</b> and rear panel <b>94</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, in the installed state, the first end <b>102</b> of the tether <b>100</b> extends into the housing <b>69</b> and connects to the inflator <b>74</b>. In particular, the inflator <b>74</b> is received by&#x2014;or placed in fluid communication with&#x2014;the opening <b>168</b> in the panel <b>160</b>. When a vehicle crash is detected, the controller <b>80</b> actuates the inflator <b>74</b> to inflate and deploy the airbag <b>70</b> in a known manner. Since the second end <b>106</b> of the tether <b>100</b> is secured to the occupant-facing panel <b>92</b>, the second end moves in the rearward direction of the vehicle <b>20</b> with the occupant-facing panel <b>92</b> relative to the fixed first end <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The deploying airbag <b>70</b> tensions the tether in the manner generally indicated at T in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> until the airbag becomes fully deployed, in which case the tether is taught (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). Due to the geometry of the airbag <b>70</b>, the instrument panel <b>42</b>, and/or the positioning of the housing <b>69</b> therein, tension T on the tether <b>100</b> can produce undue stress therein.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">With this in mind, the tether <b>100</b> is advantageously configured to mitigate the aforementioned stresses and help increase the performance and reliability of the tether. In particular, forming the folded-over portion <b>210</b> via the stitching <b>220</b> reinforces the tether <b>100</b> and helps to prevent tearing thereof during airbag deployment. To this end, as noted, the stitching <b>220</b> extends transverse to the tether <b>100</b> centerline. Due to the orientation of the tether <b>100</b> within the airbag <b>70</b>, this results in the stitching <b>220</b> extending transverse, e.g., perpendicular, to the direction of tension T on the tether. This helps to maximize the resistance of the stitching <b>220</b> to tearing/coming undone when tensioned.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Furthermore, the tapered shape of the panel <b>160</b>, as well as the openings <b>200</b> in the folded-over portion <b>210</b>, helps to better distribute tensile forces acting on the tether <b>100</b>. In particular, these features help the tether <b>100</b> to experience reduced stitch force, reduced edge tearing force, and a more evenly spread force distribution across the panel fabric during deployment of the airbag. More specifically, during tensioning of the tether <b>100</b>, the fabric of the tether stretches such that the openings <b>200</b> elongate. This elongation helps to damped/alleviate stress on the fabric. This advantageously helps to prevent tearing of the tether and/or stitching during airbag deployment.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">What have been described above are examples of the present invention.
