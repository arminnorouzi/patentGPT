Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">Seaplanes with pontoons for landing on water are well known. Seaplanes also include conventional landing gear built into or adjacent the pontoons for landing on runways and to maneuver the seaplanes on land. Like standard aircraft, seaplanes are often parked on tarmacs or in hangars for storage or maintenance. Also like standard aircraft, seaplanes sometimes are moved to different locations within hangars or on tarmacs using tow tractors. Typically, a towing apparatus is connected to the landing gear of a seaplane and to a tow tractor. The towing apparatus is usually rigid to maintain a safe distance between the seaplane and the tow tractor since a chain or rope cannot be used to push the seaplane, nor stop its forward momentum, and can snap or break under a repeated or constant pulling force. At least one problem with the conventional towing apparatus and arrangement is that the apparatus is attached directly to the landing gear of the seaplane. This can exert undue towing and pushing forces on the relatively fragile landing gear.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">What is needed in the aviation industry is a towing system that will not place unnecessary stress on landing gear, particularly those of a seaplane.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure is directed in general to towing systems that attach to cross beams or other structural members of seaplanes, other than landing gear, for towing, pushing, and maneuvering seaplanes on land using a tow tractor. The towing systems are simple to make, easy to use, enhance aviation safety, and safeguard landing gear integrity.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an exemplary embodiment, an airplane towing system may include a first telescoping bar having a proximal end and a distal end. The distal end is rotatably connected to a tow hitch, and the first telescoping bar can compress or extend in response to an external force, such as a towing, turning, or pulling force. A first actuator is located between the proximal and distal ends of the first telescoping bar, and the first actuator can compress or extend the first telescoping bar in response to the external force. Similarly, a second telescoping bar may be provided with a proximal end and a distal end. The distal end of the second telescoping bar can be rotatably connected to the tow hitch, and the second telescoping bar can compress or extend in response to the external force. Further, a second actuator may be installed between the proximal and distal ends of the second telescoping bar. The second actuator can compress or extend the second telescoping bar in response to the external force. Also, a first clamping assembly may be rotatably connected to the proximal end of the first telescoping bar, and a second clamping assembly may be rotatably connected to the proximal end of the second telescoping bar. The first and second clamping assemblies can be to an airplane.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this exemplary embodiment, the first telescoping bar may further include a proximal rod and a distal rod in which the proximal rod is movable within the first actuator. Likewise, the second telescoping bar may further include a proximal rod and a distal rod in which the proximal rod is movable within the second actuator.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The first actuator in this embodiment also may include a raceway and a pin that can be inserted through the first telescoping bar and through the raceway. The pin and the raceway operate to delimit travel of the first telescoping bar. Similarly, the second actuator of the embodiment may include a raceway and a pin being that can be inserted through the second telescoping bar and through the raceway whereby the pin and the raceway cooperate to delimit travel of the second telescoping bar.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also in this embodiment, the first and second actuators can cooperate to extend or compress respective first and second telescoping bars in response to the external force, wherein again the external force may be a towing force, a pushing force, a turning force, or combinations of these forces.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The exemplary embodiment may further include a protective material placed between the first and second clamping assemblies and a cross beam of the airplane. The protective material may be neoprene or other cushioning material and can be affixed to interiors or undersides of the first and second clamping assemblies or wrapped over the cross beam before attaching the first and second clamping assemblies.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The airplane towing system may also include a cross bar connected to the proximal end of the first telescoping bar and the proximal end of the second telescoping bar with the first and second clamping assemblies being attached to the bar.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another exemplary embodiment, an airplane towing system may include a first telescoping bar having a proximal end and a distal end, the distal end being configured for rotatable connection to a tow hitch, the proximal end being configured to compress or extend relative to the distal end in response to an external force; a second telescoping bar having a proximal end and a distal end, the distal end of the second telescoping bar being configured for rotatable connection to the tow hitch, the proximal end of the second telescoping bar being configured to compress or extend relative to the distal end of the second telescoping bar in response to an external force; a first clamping assembly rotatably connected to the proximal end of the first telescoping bar; and a second clamping assembly rotatably connected to the proximal end of the second telescoping bar, the first and second clamping assemblies being attachable to an airplane.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The airplane towing system in this embodiment may further include a protective material for placement between the first and second clamping assemblies and a cross beam of the airplane. Still further, a cross bar may be connected to the proximal end of the first telescoping bar and to the proximal end of the second telescoping bar.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In yet another exemplary embodiment, an airplane towing system may include a first bar having a proximal end and a distal end, the distal end being configured for rotatable connection to a tow hitch; a second bar having a proximal end and a distal end, the distal end of the second bar being configured for rotatable connection to the tow hitch; a first clamping assembly rotatably connected to the proximal end of the first telescoping bar; a second clamping assembly rotatably connected to the proximal end of the second bar; and a protective material configured for placement between the first and second clamping assemblies and a cross beam of the airplane, the first and second clamping assemblies being attachable the cross-beam airplane. The airplane towing system may also include a cross bar connected to the proximal end of the first bar and the proximal end of the second bar.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Additional objects and advantages of the present subject matter are set forth in, or will be apparent to, those of ordinary skill in the art from the description herein. Also, it should be further appreciated that modifications and variations to the specifically illustrated, referenced, and discussed features, processes, and elements hereof may be practiced in various embodiments and uses of the disclosure without departing from the spirit and scope of the subject matter.

Here, the exemplary towing system <b>10</b> is shown in a first state or equilibratory position A in which a towing apparatus <b>12</b> is being used to push or pull a seaplane <b>14</b> in a straight line along a tarmac or hangar floor <b>1</b> by ground support equipment, such as a tug or tow tractor <b>3</b>. In this example, the towing apparatus <b>12</b> is connected to a tow bar or hitch <b>5</b> of the tractor <b>3</b> and to the seaplane <b>14</b> between its pontoons <b>16</b>, rather than connecting the towing apparatus <b>12</b> to landing gear <b>18</b> and tires <b>20</b> of the seaplane <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows that the towing apparatus <b>12</b> may include a first variable length or responsive bar <b>22</b>, a second variable length or responsive <b>24</b>, and a fixed bar <b>26</b>. The towing apparatus <b>12</b> can be connected to a structural beam, cross bar, or spreader bar <b>28</b> of the seaplane <b>14</b> using cuffs or clamping devices or assemblies <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, which are discussed in further detail below. Here, the responsive bar <b>22</b> may include a first arm or rod <b>34</b>, a second arm or rod <b>36</b>, and an actuation device or telescoping actuator <b>38</b>. Likewise, the responsive bar <b>24</b> may include a first arm or rod <b>40</b>, a second arm or rod <b>42</b>, and an actuating device or telescoping actuator <b>44</b>. More particularly, the responsive bar <b>22</b> may be rotationally connected at a first or distal end <b>46</b> to the hitch <b>5</b> of the tractor <b>3</b> and rotationally connected at a proximal or opposite end <b>48</b> to the clamping device <b>30</b>. Similarly, the responsive bar <b>24</b> may be rotationally connected at a first distal end <b>50</b> to the hitch <b>5</b> of the tractor <b>3</b> and rotationally connected at an opposite, proximal end <b>52</b> to the clamping device <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> further shows, when the seaplane <b>14</b> is being pushed or pulled in a straight-line by exemplary towing system <b>10</b> in the first state A, the towing apparatus <b>12</b> is in equilibrium and the responsive bars <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> appear symmetrical. By way of comparison, if the tractor <b>3</b> turns to the left as shown in this example (in phantom for clarity), the actuator <b>38</b> permits the responsive bar <b>22</b> to extend or telescope as shown in phantom state C while the actuator <b>44</b> permits the responsive bar <b>24</b> to compress as shown in phantom state D to reduce twisting and torsional forces on the seaplane <b>14</b>. The fixed bar <b>26</b> ensures that the proximal ends <b>48</b>, <b>52</b> remain spaced apart as shown and that rotational forces are applied to the distal ends <b>46</b>, <b>50</b>. The respective extension and compression of the responsive bars <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> would, of course, be reversed if the tractor <b>3</b> turns to the right, as further explained below.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> broadly shows the towing apparatus <b>12</b> and its responsive bar <b>22</b>, the second responsive bar <b>24</b>, and the fixed bar <b>26</b> of the towing system <b>10</b>. As introduced above, the towing apparatus <b>12</b> in this example is shown connected to the spreader bar <b>28</b> of the seaplane <b>14</b> using the clamping devices <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. Also as introduced above, the responsive bar <b>22</b> in this example includes the rod <b>34</b>, the rod <b>36</b>, and the actuation device <b>38</b>. The responsive bar <b>24</b> includes rods <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, and the actuating device <b>44</b>. Again, the responsive bar <b>22</b> may be rotationally formed at one end <b>46</b> and rotationally connected at the opposite end <b>48</b> to the clamping device <b>30</b>. And the responsive bar <b>24</b> may be rotationally connected at one end <b>50</b> and rotationally connected at the opposite end <b>52</b> to the clamping device <b>32</b>. As introduced, this arrangement applies towing and other forces to the towing apparatus <b>12</b> rather the landing gear <b>18</b>.

For instance, and as explained in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> below, in a left-hand turn, pin <b>62</b> could be pulled against end <b>58</b> while pin <b>72</b> could be pressed against end <b>70</b>, but in a right-hand turn, pin <b>62</b> could be pressed against end <b>60</b> while pin <b>72</b> is pulled against end <b>68</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">By way of example, the clamping device <b>32</b> introduced above is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> in which the clamping device <b>32</b> is attached with the attachment mechanism <b>74</b> to the spreader bar <b>28</b>. Here, a neoprene insert or wrap <b>76</b>, which may be any rubber or cushioning material, may be applied between the spreader bar <b>28</b> and the clamping device <b>32</b> to prevent damage to the spreader bar <b>28</b>. The clamping device <b>32</b> may be at first separated into two parts <b>32</b>A and <b>32</b>B in order to place them over and under the spreader bar <b>28</b>. This may be accomplished using a rotational mechanism such as a swivel bolt <b>78</b> that may have a head or body <b>80</b> that fits through an aperture <b>82</b> in the end <b>52</b> of the rod <b>42</b>. Once the parts <b>32</b>A and <b>32</b>B are installed respectively over and under the spreader bar <b>28</b>, the bolt body <b>80</b> can be inserted through the aperture <b>82</b> and a nut <b>84</b> used to rotationally secure together the parts <b>32</b>A and <b>32</b>B to effect installation of the clamping device <b>32</b>. A similar arrangement would be used at the end <b>48</b> of the rod <b>36</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.

Here, the pin <b>72</b> includes a grip or ring <b>86</b> and an end <b>90</b> that extends through an aperture <b>88</b> in the rod <b>42</b>. A spring actuated ball lock <b>92</b> may be provided at the end <b>90</b> to secure the pin <b>72</b> through the rod <b>42</b>, i.e., the ball lock <b>92</b> compresses as it is inserted in the aperture <b>88</b> and springs open when it emerges from the aperture <b>88</b> to lock the pin <b>72</b> through the rod <b>42</b>. As further shown in this example, the ends <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> of the raceway <b>64</b> limit travel of the pin <b>72</b>. And while the rod <b>42</b> is permitted to telescope within a channel <b>96</b> of the raceway <b>64</b>, axial movement of the rod <b>42</b> is limited by the pin <b>72</b> as it engages the ends <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> of the raceway <b>64</b>, depending on variable pushing, pulling, and directional forces, as indicated by the double-headed arrow. In the neutral position E shown here, the pin <b>72</b> is between the first end <b>68</b> and the second end <b>70</b>. Those skilled in the art will understand that certain components can be reversed and are not limited to the examples shown.
