which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to a towing apparatus and, more particularly, to a hitch mounting system integrated into the frame of a vehicle, such as a truck, and accessed through the body, such as the bed, of the vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many vehicles are designed to transport freight, goods, merchandise, personal property, and other such cargo. An operator often utilizes a hitch assembly to connect a towed vehicle to a towing vehicle, e.g., connecting a trailer to a pick-up truck, to increase the capacity to transport the cargo. Other types of cargo carrying accessories may also be mounted or attached to a vehicle as well to assist with carrying various items such as bicycles, motorcycles, lawn equipment, ATVs, ladder holders, construction equipment and accessories, slide out beds and the like. Many types of coupling devices have been developed for providing this connection between the towing vehicle and towed vehicles or cargo carrying accessories.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When towing a trailer or camper, for example, it is well known to utilize a hitch to connect the towed vehicle to a towing vehicle. There are many different types of hitches that may be attached to the towing vehicle in a variety of ways, depending on the type of hitch used. For example, some fifth wheel hitches mount to the frame underneath the bed of the pickup truck while other fifth wheel hitches mount to an above bed mounting system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditional fifth wheel hitches include a head assembly for receiving a king pin on a towed vehicle, a base having a plurality of legs, and one or more mounting rails. In some systems, the legs of the fifth wheel hitch are designed to be secured to mounting rails that are attached above or on the load bed of the towing vehicle. In other systems, the mounting rails may be fixed to the frame of a vehicle underneath the bed. For example, the mounting rails may be connected between two portions of a pickup truck frame underneath the truck bed. The mounting rails may include a plurality of apertures for receiving the legs of the fifth wheel hitch.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Corresponding openings may be cut in the truck bed and aligned with the apertures in the mounting rails. The legs of the fifth wheel hitch may be connected to apertures in the mounting rails through the openings in the truck bed, thereby securing the fifth wheel hitch to the frame of the vehicle. When the fifth wheel hitch is not in use, the legs may be disconnected from the apertures in the rails and the hitch may be removed from the bed of the truck. Caps may be placed over the apertures to allow the truck bed to be used for other purposes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Traditional gooseneck hitches may also mount to a towing vehicle frame beneath the load bed of the towing vehicle. A gooseneck hitch may be designed for use in a load bed of a towing vehicle similar to a fifth wheel hitch. The difference is that the gooseneck uses a ball and coupler verses a kingpin and pin receiver. Gooseneck hitches may include a mounting plate configured to connect to the frame of the towing vehicle, a receptacle in the mounting plate configured to receive a hitch ball, and the hitch ball may be removably connected to the receptacle and configured to engage a coupling member of the towed vehicle. An opening in the load bed of the towing vehicle may be aligned with the receptacle in the mounting plate. This may allow the hitch ball to connect to the receptacle through the opening in the load bed of the towing vehicle. The hitch balls themselves are typically removable or retractable when not in use. This may generally prevent obstruction of the load bed of the towing vehicle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Towing vehicles are generally arranged to accommodate either a fifth wheel hitch or a gooseneck hitch, but not both. To convert a towing vehicle from accommodating a fifth wheel hitch to a gooseneck hitch or vice versa is time and labor intensive and inefficient. However, since fifth wheel hitches and gooseneck hitches use different mounting configurations, traditionally only one hitch can occupy this location. Therefore, there is a need in the art for an improved apparatus for towing vehicles that may allow for selectively accommodating either a fifth wheel hitch or a gooseneck hitch.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additionally, because the mounting rails attach to the underside of the towing vehicle, there may be significant space limitations. This may impact the ability to attach mounting rails to the underside of the towing vehicle, including, without limitation to the frame of the towing vehicle. Therefore, there is a need in the art for improved mounting systems that are integrated with a towing vehicle frame.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Disclosed is a hitch mounting system capable of attaching to a vehicle, where the vehicle includes a frame and a body wherein the body has, for example, a load bed having an integrated mounting apparatus. The hitch mounting system may include at least one rail and a receiving member integrated with an under body/bed portion of a load bed of a vehicle capable of attaching to a fifth wheel attachment, a gooseneck trailer attachment or other cargo carrying accessories such as accessories for carrying bicycles, motorcycles, lawn equipment, ATVs, ladder holders, construction equipment and accessories, slide out beds and the like. In one embodiment, the frame may include an inserted feature such as a casting or other manufactured part, weldments, or other combination of parts into a vertical aperture/hole in the frame of the vehicle. The parts may either be welded to the frame or attached via fasteners such as nuts along the top and or bottom or the parts may be incorporated by a threaded mechanism. The frame may include a receiving member having a receiving member pattern in order to receive an attachment member in a receiving member attachment pattern. The receiving member pattern and receiving member attachment pattern may be generally complementary shaped. The receiving member pattern may be in a football-type shape or any other shape to accommodate engagement with the receiving member attachment. The inserted feature may further be adjustable along the height in order to maintain a planar surface during installation. In another embodiment the inserted feature may be flush or below the ridges of a corrugation in a truck bed and align with apertures/holes in the bed of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Throughout this disclosure, the terms aperture and hole may be used interchangeably as well as the terms body and bed, without intending to affect the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The under bed integrated frame hitch mounting system disclosed more specifically relates to the integration of a mounting system into or onto the frame of a vehicle for attaching a fifth wheel attachment, a goose neck towing mechanism or other cargo carrying accessory directly to the frame of the vehicle eliminating the need for external attachments of under bed mounting systems to a frame in order to integrate a towing apparatus such as a fifth wheel, goose neck or other cargo carrying accessory. More specifically, this disclosure relates to the use of one or more receiving members pucks integrated into or onto the frame of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment, the frame may include at least one flange to receive a receiving member. The flange may be in any shape to accommodate various receiving members and may further include a slot that may be shaped to accommodate various designs. The flange may be configured to accommodate the use of a t-pin style system having a larger t-bushing. In this embodiment, installation of a fifth wheel or gooseneck hitch is all integrated in the truck bed and does not require the use of pin attachments from underneath the bed. In another embodiment, the system may accommodate overlap joints for attachment of an additional bolt-on under bed system for the use of heavy-duty trucks.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, the integrated design utilizes inserts having various lengths integrated into a frame for configuration with a threaded receiving member. In an embodiment, a threaded tube may be inserted into the frame. Various insert lengths may be utilized for adjustment to various hitch configurations. The threaded tube may be affixed to the frame via various methods including welding or fastening such as with bolts or rivets. A threaded receiving member may then be inserted into the threaded tube, the threaded receiving member having an adjustable height and further including an additional spacer for adjustment to the particular hitch member configuration. An alignment pin and spanner wrench may be used to attach and secure the system. The spanner wrench may be configured for use with a hex head shape threaded insert or any other shape presented within the system. The design may further include a trim panel made of plastic or any other satisfactory material shaped over the bed corrugation for aiding alignment of the receiving member. The trim panel may embody a hex head shape threaded insert and bed corrugation to further secure the system. An anti-corrosion coating or material may be disposed to prevent corrosion along any surfaces of the frame or among receiving member attachment components.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one

It should be understood, however, that these components may have different configurations, the same configuration or substantially similar configurations. Further, these components may be utilized in different manners in the various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Disclosed is an exemplary hitch mounting system <b>100</b> capable of attaching to an under bed/body portion of a vehicle. The vehicle may include a frame <b>120</b> and a body, such as a truck load bed <b>110</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> for example) that may be positioned above or on adjacent (such as next to or parallel) to the frame <b>120</b>. The vehicle may include an integrated hitch mounting system <b>100</b> configured to attach various accessories to the vehicle, including, without limitation trailer attachments, such as a fifth wheel hitch, a gooseneck hitch with safety chain tie down members, accessories, including, without limitation a sliding bed, a bike rack, a motorcycle rack system, kayak holder, canoe holder, ski rack, surf board rack, snowboard rack, ladder holder, light holder, grill holding device or the like. The present system may be utilized with any kind of accessory and is not limited to just that shown and described herein.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Typical mounting systems utilize a rail members or H frame to attach a trailer to the vehicle frame. The hitch mounting system <b>100</b> of the current disclosure does not require the use of a separate rail members and may be integrated with the vehicle frame <b>120</b> itself by incorporation of hitch receiving members <b>140</b> or pucks into the frame <b>120</b> itself or onto the frame <b>120</b>. Discussed below are various embodiments of how a receiving member <b>140</b> or receiving members may be attached, such as directly attached, to the frame <b>120</b> or structural member of a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, for example, the hitch mounting system <b>100</b> may include at least one receiving member <b>140</b>, which may be called a puck that is integrated or directly or indirectly attached with a frame <b>120</b> or structural member of a vehicle under the load bed <b>110</b>. The receiving member <b>140</b> is capable of having attached thereto an accessory and/or a towing attachment system, such as a fifth wheel or a gooseneck trailer attachment or other cargo carrying attachments. Integration of the hitch mounting system <b>100</b> provides for load sharing between the top and bottom member of the truck frame, and provides improved drainage through the frame <b>120</b>, which further lowers the amount of debris buildup inside the hitch mounting system <b>100</b>. In the embodiments disclosed, frame apertures <b>125</b> (and inserts <b>155</b> if present, such inserts <b>155</b> may include insert apertures) in the frame <b>120</b>, as well as mounting structures <b>910</b> with apertures <b>125</b>. The foregoing may align with and are accessible through body apertures <b>115</b> in the body <b>110</b> (or load bed) of the vehicle. In all cases hereinafter, reference to an insert <b>155</b> includes an insert with an insert aperture internally for insertion of a receiving member <b>140</b> or a hitch or cargo carrying apparatus or a fastening device, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 9,522,583, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, the hitch mounting system <b>100</b> may include receiving members <b>140</b> (such as the four shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of any appropriate configuration, including, without limitation, U.S. Pat. No. 8,414,009, which is incorporate herein by reference. The hitch mounting system <b>100</b> may be attached to the frame <b>120</b> in any appropriate manner, including, without limitation, via welding, fastening or the like. The receiving members <b>140</b> may be positioned in body apertures <b>115</b> that are positioned in the load bed <b>110</b> of the vehicle. There may be any appropriate number of body apertures <b>115</b> in the load bed <b>110</b>, including, without limitation, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight or more. The hitch mounting system <b>100</b> may include an equivalent number of receiving members <b>140</b> as body apertures <b>115</b>. The body apertures <b>115</b>/receiving members <b>140</b> may be of any appropriate configuration on the load bed <b>110</b>. For example, the receiving member's <b>140</b>/body apertures <b>115</b> may be in a square, rectangular, trapezoidal, circular, oval or the like shape. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there may be four the receiving members <b>140</b>/body apertures <b>115</b> in a generally rectangular shape along with a fifth one in the center.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the frame <b>120</b> may include an insert <b>155</b> having an insert aperture, such as a casting or other manufactured part, weldments, or other combination of parts inserted into a vertical aperture/hole <b>125</b> in the frame <b>120</b>. In one embodiment, the vertical aperture/hole <b>125</b> may be at least on the side of the frame <b>120</b> (or both sides of the frame) that is adjacent to the underside of the body/load bed <b>110</b> (the &#x201c;top&#x201d; of the frame). In another embodiment, the vertical aperture/hole <b>125</b> may extend through the lower side of the frame (or &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; of the frame). Having an aperture/hole <b>125</b> in the bottom of the frame <b>120</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> for example, provides an access point for cleaning/draining of debris or liquid (water) as well as an access port for assisting with receiving member <b>140</b> installation or accessory connection. The components may either be welded via welds <b>159</b> (as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b><i>a</i></figref>) to the frame <b>120</b> or attached via fasteners such as nuts <b>157</b> along the top and/or bottom (as shown for example in FIG.). In such embodiments, a tube member <b>180</b> may be inserted into the frame aperture <b>125</b>. In these embodiments, there may be four frame apertures <b>125</b> and four tube members <b>180</b>. Although, the present disclosure may contemplate one, two, three, five, six or more such frame apertures <b>125</b> and tube members <b>180</b>. The frame apertures <b>125</b> may generally align with the body apertures <b>115</b> and may comprise the same number of such. The hitch mounting system <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may include a spacer <b>158</b>, which help align the hitch mounting system <b>100</b> or more specifically the receiving member <b>140</b> to be operatively positioned relative to the load bed <b>110</b>, e.g., the receiving member <b>140</b> may be generally aligned with the load bed <b>110</b>. The tube member <b>180</b> may be configured to operatively receive the receiving member <b>140</b> in any appropriate manner, such as being threaded, welded, fastened or the like. The nut <b>157</b> may be attached, such as being threaded to the tube member <b>180</b> to lock the tube member <b>180</b> to the frame <b>120</b> in an operative position. While the nut <b>157</b> is shown as being threaded, it can also be welded, fastened, adhered or the like.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The receiving members <b>140</b> may further include a receiving member pattern in order to receive a receiving member attachment wherein the receiving member pattern is generally complementarily shaped relative to the receiving member attachment shape. The receiving member pattern may be in a football-type shape, a slot, rectangular shape, square shape, oval shape or any other shape to accommodate a receiving member attachment, such as a T-pin device that is selectively locked to the receiving members <b>140</b>. The inserted feature may further be adjustable along the height in order to maintain a planar surface during installation. Further, the hitch mounting system <b>100</b> and all of the components therein may include anti-corrosion materials or coatings along the edges to further protect the frame <b>120</b> and other components from corrosion.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The hitch mounting system <b>100</b> may be utilized for attaching an accessory such as a fifth wheel hitch assembly, goose neck hitch or other cargo carrying accessory directly to the frame <b>120</b>, eliminating the need for external attachments of under bed mounting systems to the frame <b>120</b>. More specifically, this disclosure relates to the use of a receiving member <b>140</b> or receiving members integrated into the frame <b>120</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>19</b></figref> illustrate various embodiments of receiving members <b>140</b> that are integrated with various shaped frames <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In another embodiment as illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the integrated design utilizes inserts <b>155</b> having insert apertures and which have various lengths integrated into a frame <b>120</b> via a threaded receiving member <b>140</b>. In an embodiment, a threaded tube or insert <b>180</b> may be inserted into the frame <b>120</b>. And insert <b>155</b>, which may also comprise a threaded tube <b>180</b>, may be affixed to the frame <b>120</b> via various methods including welding, threading or fastening such as with bolts, nuts <b>157</b>, or rivets or the insert <b>155</b>, or threaded tube <b>180</b>, may have external threads as well and may be incorporated into the frame <b>120</b> via aperture <b>125</b> utilizing a threaded mechanism. A threaded receiving member <b>140</b> may then be inserted into the threaded tube <b>180</b>, the threaded insert or receiving member <b>140</b> may allow the height of the receiving member to be adjusted relative to the load bed <b>110</b>. This may allow the receiving member <b>140</b> to be positioned at an operative height in any vehicle. In other words, the user need only thread the threaded tube <b>180</b> and/or the receiving member <b>140</b> to the appropriate height so that the receiving member is at generally the same height as the load bed <b>110</b>. Further, an additional spacer <b>158</b> may be included to further adjust the height of the receiving member <b>140</b> to be at an operative height relative to the load bed <b>110</b>. The spacer <b>158</b> allows for height adjustment of the receiving member <b>140</b> to account for variations in distance between the frame <b>120</b> and the body <b>110</b> of the vehicle as well as allowing for the receiving member <b>140</b> and inserts <b>155</b> to be used in different vehicles (the same holds true for the threads on the threaded tube <b>180</b> and/or receiving member <b>140</b>). The spacer <b>158</b> further ensures that the receiving member <b>140</b> is adjustable to become flush with the body <b>110</b> of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In a further embodiment, a receiving member plug <b>240</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, may be incorporated into a threaded-in receiving member insert system <b>140</b> via any means of connection including welding or bolts in the sleeve. In one embodiment as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the plug <b>240</b> stays in the threaded receiving member <b>140</b> and eliminates the need to remove a removable plug and risk the possibility of losing it. The receiving member plug <b>240</b> further helps with a locking rod <b>220</b> to prevent rotation of the threaded receiving member <b>140</b> once installed in the integrated frame system. A biasing member (such as spring <b>190</b>) and/or a locking rod <b>220</b> can be dimensioned to eliminate the need for a &#x201c;T-pin&#x201d; insert unless a locking rod <b>220</b> is in place. If needed, the locking rod <b>220</b> can be lifted using a cable <b>200</b> from above or from below with a notched pipe (not shown). The notch in the pipe allows for unlocking and rotation from under the frame <b>120</b> (this is the backup removal plan in the event a preferred mode of removal is not an option). The preferred install/removal mechanism would include use of the cable <b>200</b> and a spanner wrench <b>150</b> from the bed side. The locking rod <b>220</b> may prevent the receiving member <b>140</b> from being threaded away from or into the threaded tube <b>180</b>, i.e., it prevents the threads on the receiving member <b>140</b> from rotating relative to the threaded tube <b>180</b> keeping the receiving member <b>140</b> in its position.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In a further embodiment, an alignment pin <b>172</b> and spanner wrench <b>150</b> may be used to attach the hitch mounting system <b>100</b> or more specifically to help thread the receiving member <b>140</b> with the threaded tube <b>180</b>. The spanner wrench <b>150</b> may be configured for use with a shaped head of the receiving member <b>140</b>, such as a hex shape head <b>160</b> for the threaded receiving member insert <b>140</b> as well as any other type of receiving member <b>140</b>, or any other shape insert presented within the hitch mounting system <b>100</b>. The alignment pin <b>172</b> may allow the receiving member <b>140</b> to be aligned in an operative position relative to the insert <b>155</b>. The insert <b>155</b> may include an aperture and the receiving member <b>140</b> may include an aperture. When the apertures are aligned, the alignment pin <b>172</b> may be inserted into the apertures ensuring the receiving member <b>140</b> is operatively aligned and operatively aligned relative to the insert <b>155</b>. The alignment pin <b>172</b> may further prevent the receiving member <b>140</b> from rotating relative to the threaded tube <b>180</b> to which it is threaded fixing the receiving member <b>140</b> in its operative position, which may also prevent removal of the receiving member <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The hitch mounting system <b>100</b> may further include a trim panel <b>170</b> made of plastic or any other satisfactory, resilient material shaped over the bed corrugation to create a finished look to the bed of the truck when the hitch mounting system <b>100</b> is installed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the trim panel <b>170</b> may include an opening the operatively accommodates the hex head <b>160</b> shape threaded receiving member <b>140</b> and bed corrugation to further secure the hitch mounting system <b>100</b> and create the finished look to generally match the corrugation of the bed of the towing vehicle.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a locking bar <b>220</b> or any other member may be inserted through the frame <b>120</b> at a height configured to accommodate the accessory attachment member, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In this embodiment, the portion of the frame <b>120</b> including the bar or other member insertion may further include a receiving member slot hole shape or another shape of a receiving member cut into it. The bar or member may be secured by either a fastener (not shown), via welding or any other configuration of attachment. The integrated frame receiving member or receiving member feature may be shaped using methods including hydro-forming and may further function as the top of the receiving member and bear all the loads except the vertical up load, which may be supported by a &#x201c;T&#x201d; pin or other equivalent apparatus. The formed receiving member may also be integrated with other frame stiffening processes described herein to provide vertical strength in lieu or conjunction with a &#x201c;T&#x201d; pin or other equivalent apparatus.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In another embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b></figref>, the hitch mounting system <b>100</b>/under bed anchor system <b>300</b> may further use a threaded insert <b>310</b> having a plunger/anchor style or rivet to further secure the receiving member <b>140</b> to the frame <b>120</b>. The under bed anchor system <b>300</b> of this embodiment utilizes a lever and ramp configuration to secure a receiving member <b>140</b> or other attachment in a threaded insert <b>310</b> of a frame <b>120</b>. Lever arms <b>340</b> and a threaded bolt <b>320</b> may be used to clamp the &#x201c;receiving member accepting sleeve&#x201d; into place in the frame <b>120</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref> as, for example, the under bed anchor system <b>300</b>. An aperture <b>125</b> in the bottom and top of the frame <b>120</b> may allow for extension of threaded bolt <b>320</b> as well as lever arms <b>340</b> when moving from an engaged to disengaged clamping position relative to the truck bed <b>110</b>. The spacer <b>158</b> allows for further height adjustment to ensure the threaded insert <b>310</b> is flush with the body <b>110</b> of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this embodiment, the threaded insert <b>310</b> may be inserted into the frame aperture <b>125</b>. The lever arms <b>340</b> may pivot to allow the threaded insert <b>310</b> to be inserted into the frame aperture <b>125</b>&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Once inserted, the lever arms <b>340</b> will rotate relative to the body of the threaded insert <b>310</b> to an engaged position such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. In this position, the lever arms <b>340</b> will engage an underside of the load bed <b>110</b>. This engagement will prevent withdrawal of the threaded insert <b>310</b> from the frame aperture <b>125</b> and locks the threaded insert relative to the frame <b>120</b>. To rotate the lever arms <b>340</b>, a user may rotate or screw the threaded bolt <b>320</b>, which will position the lever arms <b>340</b> from the disengaged position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) to the engaged position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In other embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>23</b></figref> a receiving member <b>140</b> or insert <b>155</b> may be affixed to the top of the frame <b>120</b> via any suitable means of fastening including, but not limited, to a bolt configuration, rivets, and welding or being integrally or monolithically formed therewith.
