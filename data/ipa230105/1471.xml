An outlet is provided at the bottom of the tundish through which the molten metal provided in the tundish can be discharged into a mould located below the tundish. In the mould, the molten metal solidifies into a billet.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such outlets at the bottom of a tundish in continuous billet casting are known as metering nozzles. These nozzles regulate the flow rate of the molten metal flowing from the tundish into the mould.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such metering nozzles are also known as nozzle changer systems. Such nozzle changer systems include a first nozzle that is permanently installed in the bottom of the tundish. This first nozzle, fixed in the bottom of the tundish, is known as the &#x201c;upper nozzle&#x201d;. Such an upper nozzle regularly comprises a refractory component in which a tubular member is embedded. The upper nozzle is arranged at the bottom of the tundish in such a way that molten metal can flow through the tubular member. In practice, this tubular member of an upper nozzle is regularly referred to as an &#x201c;insert&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to the upper nozzle, a nozzle changer system also comprises an exchangeable nozzle, which also comprises a tubular member, which in practice is also regularly referred to as an &#x201c;insert&#x201d;. In practice, such an exchangeable nozzle is also referred to as a &#x201c;flying nozzle&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The tubular member of the exchangeable nozzle is also regularly embedded in a refractory material, in particular a ceramic refractory material.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a nozzle changing system, the exchangeable nozzle can be connected to the upper nozzle in such a way that the tubular member of the upper nozzle and the tubular member of the exchangeable nozzle form a continuous channel through which molten metal can be discharged from the tundish.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The use of such a nozzle changer system in a tundish for continuous casting has the particular advantage that the exchangeable nozzle can be released from its connection to the upper nozzle and replaced by a new exchangeable nozzle, for example in the event of wear of the exchangeable nozzle or if an exchangeable with another diameter of the nozzle channel is required. In practice, a nozzle changer is used to connect the exchangeable nozzle on the upper nozzle block and to release it from the upper nozzle. Such nozzle changers of nozzle changer systems are devices, in particular mechanical devices, which can also be operated hydraulically.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In principle, such nozzle changer systems have proven themselves in practice.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the inventors of the invention of the present application have discovered that in such nozzle changer systems, a gap may be formed between the upper nozzle and the exchangeable nozzle, while molten metal flows through the upper nozzle and the exchangeable nozzle connected to it. However, this allows molten metal to be drawn into the gap, which may solidify in the gap. However, this solidified metal between the upper nozzle and the exchangeable nozzle can obstruct the movement between the upper nozzle and the exchangeable nozzle and in some cases even block the nozzle changer system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention is based on the object of providing an exchangeable nozzle for a nozzle changer system, which can reduce the occurrence of a gap between the exchangeable nozzle and the upper nozzle during the casting of molten metal.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, the invention is based on the object of providing a process for manufacturing such a nozzle.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A further object of the invention is to provide a nozzle changer system comprising such a nozzle.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Finally, a further object of the invention is to provide a tundish comprising such a nozzle changer system.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In order to solve the problem, an exchangeable nozzle for a nozzle changer system for billet casting is provided, said exchangeable nozzle comprising the following:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0016">A tubular member;</li>    </ul>    </li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0017">said tubular member extending along a longitudinal axis from a first end of</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0018">said tubular member to a second end of said tubular member; said tubular member further comprising:    <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0019">an inner passageway, extending through said tubular member along said longitudinal axis from said first end of said tubular member to said second end of said tubular member;</li>        <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0020">an inlet, opening into said inner passageway at said first end of said tubular member; and</li>        <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0021">an outlet, opening into said inner passageway at said second end of said tubular member;</li>        <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0022">said tubular member consisting of partially stabilized sintered zirconia;</li>        <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0023">said partially stabilized sintered zirconia being partially stabilized by MgO; and</li>        <li id="ul0003-0006" num="0024">said partially stabilized sintered zirconia having a degree of stabilization not above 26% by mass;</li>        <li id="ul0003-0007" num="0025">said tubular member comprising free carbon.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0017" num="0026">The invention is based on the basic finding that the formation of the gap between the exchangeable nozzle and the upper nozzle in a nozzle changer system during the casting of a molten metal is due to the fact that the tubular member of the exchangeable nozzle is subject to a substantial change in volume. This change in volume is due to the fact that the tubular member in exchangeable nozzles consists of zirconium dioxide (i.e. zirconia, ZrO<sub>2</sub>). However, it is well known that zirconium dioxide is present in various modifications depending on the temperature, namely a monoclinic low-temperature modification, which at 1,170&#xb0; C. first changes to the tetragonal and at 2,370&#xb0; C. to the cubic high-temperature modification. These modifications are reversible when these temperatures are exceeded or deceeded. At the same time zirconium dioxide is present in the three modifications with a different density, so that the phase transformations of the zirconium dioxide are associated with a sudden, extreme change in volume when the temperatures exceed or fall below the mentioned temperatures what is also known as the &#x201c;anomalous thermal expansion&#x201d; of zirconium dioxide.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0027">In accordance with the invention, it has now been established that the formation of the gap between the exchangeable nozzle and the upper nozzle is caused by this anomalous thermal expansion of the zirconium dioxide, insofar as the tubular member of the exchangeable nozzle consists of zirconium dioxide.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0028">In the state of the art it is known to stabilize the tetragonal and especially cubic high temperature modification of zirconium dioxide by doping the zirconium dioxide with oxides such as CaO, MgO, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. This allows the tetragonal and cubic high temperature modification to be maintained up to room temperature, so that the anomalous thermal expansion of the zirconium dioxide due to a phase transformation can be reduced or even completely suppressed during heating and cooling.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0029">It is known from the state of the art to completely stabilize zirconium dioxide by these doping oxides and to stabilize zirconium dioxide as fully stabilized zirconia (FSZ) or to only partially stabilize zirconium dioxide and to provide zirconium dioxide as partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ). However, the inventors found out that a tubular member consisting of fully stabilized zirconia is disadvantageous in an exchangeable nozzle for two reasons. The first reason is that fully stabilized zirconia requires higher amounts of the above identified stabilizing oxides such as CaO, MgO, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>which, however, deteriorate the refractory properties of the tubular member, especially its corrosion resistance. Further, even though fully stabilized zirconia does not show an anomalous thermal expansion, the thermal expansion (i.e. the usual change in volume of every object which is exposed to temperature change) of fully stabilized zirconia is very high and, especially, higher than that of non- or only partially stabilized zirconium dioxide so that the occurrence of a gap cannot be reduced if the tubular member consists of fully stabilized zirconia.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0030">Surprisingly, in the context of the invention according to the present application, the inventors have found that the occurrence of a gap between the exchangeable nozzle and the upper nozzle can be reduced without or with only minimal deterioration of the refractory properties of the tubular member made of zirconia at the same time if the exchangeable nozzle comprises a tubular member made of partially stabilized, sintered zirconia, provided that the partially stabilized zirconia is partially stabilized by MgO, the partially stabilized zirconia has a degree of stabilization of not more than 26% by mass, and the tubular member further comprises free carbon.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0031">Surprisingly, it was found that with a nozzle changer system of the aforementioned type during the casting of steel, a significantly reduced or practically no gap appears between the exchangeable nozzle and the upper nozzle if the exchangeable nozzle has such a tubular member (or &#x201c;insert&#x201d;). According to the inventors' studies, this is due to the fact that the tubular member of the invention's exchangeable nozzle remains almost unaffected by anomalous thermal expansion at the temperatures to which the exchangeable nozzle is subjected during the casting of steel. It has not yet been finally clarified what this is due to. However, in accordance with the invention, it turned out that the small change in volume only occurs if the tubular member has the specific combination of the features described above. The inventors assume that the free carbon further stabilizes the zirconia and that, hence, even though the zirconia is only partly stabilized the anomalous thermal expansion can be broadly suppressed. Further, as the zirconia is only partly stabilized, the amounts of stabilizing oxides in the zirconia are smaller than they would be in fully stabilized zirconia and, hence, the refractory properties of the tubular member, especially its corrosion resistance, is almost not influenced by this small amount of stabilizing oxides. Furthermore, the thermal expansion of the partially stabilized zirconia is smaller than that of fully stabilized zirconia.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0032">The inventors of the present invention found out the anomalous thermal expansion of the tubular member can be no further suppressed if the degree of stabilization is above 26% by mass. However, as for a higher degree of stabilization higher amounts of stabilization oxides would be required and, hence, the refractory properties of the tubular member, especially its corrosion resistance, would be deteriorated and at the same time the thermal expansion of the partially stabilized zirconia would increase, the degree of stabilization of the zirconia is not above 26% by mass.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0033">The tubular member of the exchangeable nozzle according to the invention consists of sintered zirconium dioxide partially stabilized by MgO, whereby the partially stabilized sintered zirconium dioxide has a degree of stabilization not exceeding 26% by mass. The degree of stabilization is known to denote the mass fraction of stabilized zirconia in relation to the total mass of zirconia. In this respect, a full stabilization of the zirconium dioxide is given at a degree of stabilization of 100% by mass. In accordance with the invention, it was found that the anomalous thermal expansion of the tubular member, especially at the temperatures in the tubular member prevailing during casting, i.e. especially at temperatures in the range from 1,000&#xb0; C. to 1,300&#xb0; C., can only slightly be increased if the degree of stabilization is above 15% by mass. Further, it has been found that the anomalous thermal expansion can be decreased strongly if the degree of stabilization is above 1% by mass, and even better if it is above 2% by mass and even still better if the degree of stabilization is above 3% by mass. According to a preferred embodiment, the partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide therefore has a degree of stabilization in the range of 1 to 26% by mass, further preferred in the range of 2 to 20% by mass and especially preferred in the range of 3 to 15% by mass.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0034">The degree of stabilization of the zirconia can be determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), especially according to standard DIN EN 13925-2:2003-07.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0035">The tubular member consists of partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide, i.e. sintered particles or grains of zirconium dioxide. In this respect, the tubular member is a ceramic tubular member made of sintered zirconium dioxide. The partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide preferably comprises a proportion of MgO in the range from 1 to 3% by mass, especially a proportion of MgO in the range from 1 to less than 3% by mass. In accordance with the invention, it was found that such a proportion of MgO in the partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide could achieve a degree of stabilization of not more than 26% by mass, especially within the aforementioned ranges. The proportion of MgO in the partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide is particularly preferred in the range from 1 to 2.8% by mass and even more preferred in the range from 1.2 to 2.6% by mass.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0036">According to the invention, it has been established that only a slight change in volume of the tubular member can be present in case of degrees of stabilization above 26% by mass. However, to this end higher amounts of MgO in the zirconium dioxide are necessary, especially amounts of above 3% by mass, reducing the refractory properties, especially the corrosion resistance of the tubular member substantially.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0037">The partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide preferably comprises a content of SiO<sub>2 </sub>not exceeding 1.5% by mass, even more preferred a content of SiO<sub>2 </sub>below 1.5% by mass and even more preferred a content of SiO<sub>2 </sub>below 1.2% by mass. Further, the partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide preferably comprises a content of SiO<sub>2 </sub>of at least 0.5% by mass.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0038">Especially preferred, the partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide comprises a content of SiO<sub>2 </sub>in the range from 0.5 to 1.5% by mass, even more preferred in the range from 0.5 to 1.2% by mass. In accordance with the invention, it was determined that a degree of stabilization in accordance with the invention can be achieved by such proportions of SiO<sub>2 </sub>in the partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide with the aforementioned proportions of MgO.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0039">The total mass of ZrO<sub>2 </sub>and HfO<sub>2 </sub>in the partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide is preferably at least 92% by mass, even more preferably in the range of 92 to 98% by mass and even more preferably in the range of 94 to 97% by mass. It is well known that zirconium dioxide also regularly contains hafnium dioxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>), as HfO<sub>2 </sub>is difficult to separate from ZrO<sub>2 </sub>in practice, so that, as usual, the total mass of ZrO<sub>2 </sub>and HfO<sub>2 </sub>in the partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide is given here for the zirconium dioxide content in the partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0040">In accordance with the invention, it was determined that a partially stabilized sintered zirconium dioxide in accordance with the invention can be made available if the ZrO<sub>2</sub>+HfO<sub>2 </sub>content in the partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide is present in the aforementioned proportions in the partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide, in particular if these proportions are present in combination with the aforementioned proportions of MgO and SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0041">Preferably the total mass of ZrO<sub>2</sub>, HfO<sub>2</sub>, MgO and SiO<sub>2 </sub>in the partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide is at least 98% by mass and even more preferably at least 99% by mass.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0042">The information given herein on the mass proportions of MgO, SiO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2 </sub>and HfO<sub>2 </sub>in the partially stabilized, sintered zirconia is based on the total mass of the partially stabilized sintered zirconia.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0043">The information given herein on the mass proportions of MgO, SiO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2 </sub>and HfO<sub>2 </sub>in the partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide is in each case information on the chemical composition of the partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide. The proportions of these oxides in the partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide and the loss of ignition (LOI), i.e. the chemical composition of the partially stabilized, sintered zirconium dioxide and the loss of ignition, are determined by X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF) in accordance with DIN EN ISO 12677:2013-02.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0044">The tubular member of the invention's exchangeable nozzle comprises free carbon, i.e. carbon which is not bound.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0045">Preferably, the free carbon is present (i.e. distributed) over the volume of the tubular member. According to a preferred embodiment, the free carbon is present on the surface and in the open pores of the tubular member. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, to provide such a tubular member comprising free carbon, the tubular member is impregnated with a carbon comprising impregnation, i.e. a carbon comprising impregnating agent, and heated afterwards such that, after heating, carbon of the carbon comprising impregnation remains in the tubular member as free carbon.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0046">The carbon comprising impregnation may preferably be at least one of the following: pitch or tar. Particularly preferred, the carbon comprising impregnation is pitch, especially coal tar pitch. To impregnate the tubular member with the carbon comprising impregnation, the carbon comprising impregnation can be applied to the tubular member or poured on. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, in order to impregnate it with the carbon comprising impregnation, the tubular member is soaked with the carbon comprising impregnation.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0047">Preferably the tubular member comprises free carbon in an amount in the range from 0.1 to 4.0% by mass. In accordance with the invention, it was found that the anomalous thermal expansion of the tubular member during casting, especially at the temperatures prevailing during casting in the range from 1,100&#xb0; C. to 1,200&#xb0; C., can be particularly strongly suppressed if the tubular member comprises free carbon in such a proportion. In accordance with the invention, it was found that the anomalous thermal expansion, especially in the aforementioned temperature interval, can be further reduced if the proportion of free carbon is increasingly approaching a proportion in the range from 1 to 2% by mass. It may therefore be particularly preferred that the tubular member comprises free carbon in an amount in the range from 0.5 to 3% by mass and even more preferably in an amount in the range from 1 to 2% by mass. The above-mentioned data in % by mass are in relation to the mass of the tubular member without the free carbon.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0048">As explained above, it was found, in accordance with the invention, that the tubular member of the exchangeable nozzle in accordance with the invention has only a slight anomalous thermal expansion during the casting process, in particular also in the temperature range from 1,100&#xb0; C. to 1,200&#xb0; C. relevant for the casting of molten metal, in which zirconium dioxide also undergoes the phase transformation between its monoclinic low-temperature modification and its tetragonal high-temperature modification. In this respect, the difference in linear thermal expansion of the tubular member of the invention's exchangeable nozzle at 1,1000 and 1,200 C can be below 0.1 percentage points, in particular even below 0.05 percentage points. For example, a linear thermal expansion in the range from 0.75 to 0.80% at 1,100&#xb0; C. as well at 1,200&#xb0; C. could be determined for the tubular member of the exchangeable nozzle according to the invention.

In contrast, the linear thermal expansion of the tubular member E1T at 1,100&#xb0; C. is about 0.77% and at 1,200&#xb0; C. about 0.75%. In this respect, the difference in linear thermal expansion in this temperature interval for the tubular member E1T is only about 0.02 percentage points.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0111">A similarly small change in the linear thermal expansion of the tubular member E2T is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, where the linear thermal expansion of the tubular member E2T is represented by a solid line and the tubular member E2 by a dashed line.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0112">While the linear thermal expansion was measured in the experiments according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref> in an argon atmosphere, the measurement according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> was performed in an air atmosphere.
