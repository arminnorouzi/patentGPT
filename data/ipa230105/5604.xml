typically seek to benchmark operational efficiency of the department against similar hospital departments at other institutions. Such benchmarking can be used to determine how well their competitors are doing, and to assess whether there is scope for improvement in operational efficiency.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, a meaningful comparison would require finding at least one, and preferably two, three, or even more, similar institutions (e.g., having a similar patient case mix, number of resources, etc.) to compare against. It is, however, difficult, to find such a similar institution. Even if potentially similar hospital departments are identified at other institutions, it is challenging to gain access to operational performance data of other institutions. This can be due to unwillingness to share information for competitive reasons, and/or inability to share information that may contain personally identifying information (PII) or protected health information (PHI) about patients. For example, in the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) constrains disclosure of patient PII.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following discloses certain improvements to overcome these problems and others.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, an apparatus for generating benchmarking metrics of current operational workflow performance of a hospital department includes at least one electronic processor programmed to: generate a department profile identifying resources of the hospital department including at least an active medical equipment inventory and a personnel profile; retrieve current statistics for the hospital department including at least one of patient arrival timeliness, patient no-show, and emergency department (ED) arrival statistics; compute values of one or more key performance indicator (KPI) metrics for the current statistics; generate an executable workflow model for workflow processes of the hospital department including temporal aspects of the workflow processes, the workflow model having variables representing at least patient arrival timeliness, patient no-show, and ED arrival; simulate a best case scenario by executing the workflow model on inputs including the department profile and best case values for the variables of the workflow model and compute values of the one or more KPI metrics for the simulated best case scenario; simulate a worst case scenario by executing the workflow model on inputs including the department profile and worst case values for the variables of the workflow model and compute values of the one or more KPI metrics for the simulated worst case scenario; and output, on at least one display device, the values of the one or more KPI metrics computed for the simulated best case scenario, the values of the one or more KPI metrics computed for the simulated worst case scenario, and the values of the one or more KPI metrics computed for the current statistics.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another aspect, a non-transitory computer readable medium stores instructions executable by at least one electronic processor to perform a method for generating benchmarking metrics of current operational workflow performance of a hospital department. The method includes: generating a department profile identifying resources of the hospital department including at least an active medical equipment inventory and a personnel profile by operations including: retrieving hospital department data and patient data from at least one database; generating a department profile for each resource from the retrieved hospital department data and patient data; and providing a user interface via which the generated profiles are displayed on the at least one display device and via which a user can modify the generated profiles using via at least one user input device; retrieving current statistics for the hospital department including at least one of patient arrival timeliness, patient no-show, and ED arrival statistics; computing values of one or more KPI metrics for the current statistics; generating an executable workflow model for workflow processes of the hospital department including temporal aspects of the workflow processes, the workflow model having variables representing at least patient arrival timeliness, patient no-show, and ED arrival; simulating a best case scenario by executing the workflow model on inputs including the department profile and best case values for the variables of the workflow model and compute values of the one or more KPI metrics for the simulated best case scenario; simulating a worst case scenario by executing the workflow model on inputs including the department profile and worst case values for the variables of the workflow model and compute values of the one or more KPI metrics for the simulated worst case scenario; and outputting, on at least one display device, the values of the one or more KPI metrics computed for the simulated best case scenario, the values of the one or more KPI metrics computed for the simulated worst case scenario, and the values of the one or more KPI metrics computed for the current statistics.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect, a method for generating benchmarking metrics of current operational workflow performance of a hospital department includes: generating a department profile identifying resources of the hospital department including at least an active medical equipment inventory and a personnel profile; retrieving current statistics for the hospital department including at least patient arrival timeliness, patient no-show, and ED arrival statistics; computing values of one or more KPI metrics for the current statistics; generating an executable workflow model for workflow processes of the hospital department including temporal aspects of the workflow processes, the workflow model having random variables representing at least one of patient arrival timeliness, patient no-show, and ED arrival; simulating a best case scenario by executing the workflow model using Monte Carlo simulation on inputs including the department profile and best case values for the random variables of the workflow model and compute values of the one or more KPI metrics for the simulated best case scenario; simulating a worst case scenario by executing the workflow model using Monte Carlo simulation on inputs including the department profile and worst case values for the random variables of the workflow model and compute values of the one or more KPI metrics for the simulated worst case scenario; and outputting, on at least one display device, the values of the one or more KPI metrics computed for the simulated best case scenario, the values of the one or more KPI metrics computed for the simulated worst case scenario, and the values of the one or more KPI metrics computed for the current statistics.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One advantage resides in providing a benchmarking procedure for a hospital department using data only from the hospital department.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another advantage resides in providing a benchmarking procedure for a hospital department without relying on data from external hospital departments.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another advantage resides in providing a hospital department with a representation of best- and worst-case scenarios for workflows in the hospital department, and optionally also one or more intermediate-case scenarios.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A given embodiment may provide none, one, two, more, or all of the foregoing advantages, and/or may provide other advantages as will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art upon reading and understanding the present disclosure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The disclosure may take form in various components and arrangements of components, and in various steps and arrangements of steps.

However, the data for other medical institutions needed for the benchmarking may be difficult to obtain due to competitive and/or patient privacy considerations.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The following discloses a benchmarking approach referred to as &#x201c;internal&#x201d; benchmarking, in which the performance data of the hospital department being evaluated is extrapolated to best case and worst case scenarios (and one or more intermediate scenarios) and the current performance is compared with these extrapolations. This permits benchmarking without the need for data from other medical institutions.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments disclosed herein, an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) or other hospital database is mined to determine relevant information, including: the number of imaging systems (of each imaging modality, in the case of a multimodality department) and statistics such as the types of imaging examinations being performed, rate of late arrivals, rate of no-shows, rate of unscheduled ED arrivals, and so forth. The number of imaging technicians may be mined from department human resources (HR) databases or other sources. This provides a department profile, which may be presented to a hospital administrator for review and (if needed) manual adjustment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A patient workflow model is also generated for the department (and for each imaging modality, if multimodality). The patient workflow model can be a Business Process Model (BPM) or other dynamic model that captures the process flow and temporal aspects. In the illustrative example, each step of the process is characterized by activity, location, resources utilized, and time interval for the activity (with the time interval, and possibly the resources used, being expressed stochastically). To generate the model, a standard template model may be employed, which may be adjusted to the specifics of the hospital department using statistical data mined from the EMR and/or information obtained from interviews with department staff or other information sources.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A given scenario is analyzed by Monte Carlo simulations. Each simulation receives as input a schedule of patients scheduled for respective imaging examinations with various arrival times (on-time, some late, etc.) and some ED arrivals and/or no-shows, generated stochastically in accord with the mined department profile. The stochastic generation process can be biased to reflect a &#x201c;best case&#x201d; scenario by biasing the stochastic generation to produce most patients arriving on-time and on-schedule with few or no ED arrivals or no-shows. The stochastic generation process can be biased to reflect a &#x201c;worst case&#x201d; scenario by biasing the stochastic generation to produce many late arrivals and numerous ED arrivals and no-shows. Various intermediate scenarios can also be generated. Each stochastically generated schedule is &#x201c;processed&#x201d; by running the patients on the schedule through the patient workflow model, and computing key performance indicator (KPI) metrics.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The KPIs for the simulated scenarios are then compared with actual current statistics for the hospital department. For example, the best case scenario provides an upper limit on the number of patients that could realistically be handled per day, the worst case scenario provides a lower limit on the number of patients that could realistically be handled per day, and these can be compared against the number of patients actually handled per day. Similar comparisons can be run for patient wait time, scanner utilization, and other KPIs.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">While described in the context of medical imaging departments, the disclosed concept can be applied more generally to any hospital department that processes patients in accordance with workflows that are amenable to modeling.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an illustrative apparatus <b>10</b> for generating benchmarking metrics of current operational workflow performance of a hospital department is shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also shows an electronic processing device <b>18</b>, such as a workstation computer, or more generally a computer. Alternatively, the electronic processing device <b>18</b> can be embodied as a server computer or a plurality of server computers, e.g. interconnected to form a server cluster, cloud computing resource, or so forth. The workstation <b>18</b> includes typical components, such as an electronic processor <b>20</b> (e.g., a microprocessor), at least one user input device (e.g., a mouse, a keyboard, a trackball, and/or the like) <b>22</b>, and at least one display device <b>24</b> (e.g. an LCD display, plasma display, cathode ray tube display, and/or so forth). In some embodiments, the display device <b>24</b> can be a separate component from the workstation <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The electronic processor <b>20</b> is operatively connected with one or more non-transitory storage media <b>26</b>. The non-transitory storage media <b>26</b> may, by way of non-limiting illustrative example, include one or more of a magnetic disk, RAID, or other magnetic storage medium; a solid state drive, flash drive, electronically erasable read-only memory (EEROM) or other electronic memory; an optical disk or other optical storage; various combinations thereof; or so forth; and may be for example a network storage, an internal hard drive of the workstation <b>18</b>, various combinations thereof, or so forth. It is to be understood that any reference to a non-transitory medium or media <b>26</b> herein is to be broadly construed as encompassing a single medium or multiple media of the same or different types. Likewise, the electronic processor <b>20</b> may be embodied as a single electronic processor or as two or more electronic processors. The non-transitory storage media <b>26</b> stores instructions executable by the at least one electronic processor <b>20</b>. The instructions include instructions to generate a visualization of an graphical user interface (GUI) or application program interface (API) <b>27</b> for display on the display device <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The apparatus <b>10</b> also includes, or is otherwise in operable communication with, one or more databases <b>28</b> storing, for example, data related to patients of the hospital department, data related to workflows of the hospital department, and so forth. The database <b>28</b> can be any suitable database, including a Radiology Information System (RIS) database, a Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) database, an Electronic Medical Records (EMR) database, a Health Information System (HIS) database, and so forth. Alternatively, the database <b>28</b> can be implemented in the non-transitory medium or media <b>26</b>. The workstation <b>18</b> can be used to access the stored data</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also shows modules programmed into the at least one electronic processor <b>20</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a profiler module <b>30</b> and a scenario generator module <b>32</b>. The profiler module <b>30</b> is programmed to create profiles <b>34</b> for several aspects of the hospital department, including resources (e.g., medical devices, medical staff, and so forth), patients, work orders, department policies, and so forth. The profiles <b>34</b> are used to estimate the amount of work the resources is capable of producing under different settings and/or scenarios. The data related to these aspects can be stored in the database <b>28</b> and/or the non-transitory computer readable medium <b>26</b>, or can be manually entered by a user via the at least one user input device <b>22</b> (e.g., such as answers to a patient screening form, results from a radiology report, and so forth). Furthermore, to calculate KPI metrics for the actual statistical data for the hospital department, an empirical data performance metric calculator module <b>42</b> is programmed into the at least one electronic processor <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The apparatus <b>10</b> is configured as described above to perform method or process <b>100</b> for generating benchmarking metrics of current operational workflow performance of a hospital department. The non-transitory storage medium <b>26</b> stores instructions which are readable and executable by the at least one electronic processor <b>20</b> to perform disclosed operations including performing the method or process <b>100</b> for generating benchmarking metrics of current operational workflow performance of a hospital department. In some examples, the method <b>100</b> may be performed at least in part by cloud processing.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an illustrative embodiment of the method <b>100</b> generating benchmarking metrics of current operational workflow performance of a hospital department is diagrammatically shown as a flowchart. At an operation <b>102</b>, a department profile <b>34</b> that identifies resources of the hospital department is generated. The resources can include at least, for example, an active medical equipment inventory, which refers to equipment that is in use, and not equipment that is not in use (excluding temporary outages). In one example, for an imaging hospital department, the active medical equipment inventory can be an inventory of active medical imaging devices annotated at least by imaging modality. In another example, for an hematology hospital department, the active medical equipment inventory can include an inventory of hematology analyzer labeled as to, for example, type or types of analyses each analyzer can perform. In a further example, for a surgical laboratory hospital department, the active medical equipment inventory can include surgical devices or suites with information such as availability of oxygen or anesthetic lines, specified medical equipment, or so forth. These are merely non-limiting examples. The department profile <b>34</b> can also include, for example, a personnel profile that can include, for example, a list of employees assigned to the department with each employee identified as to role and impacting the workflow, such as imaging technicians and possibly patient transport personnel.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">To generate the department profile <b>34</b>, data can be retrieved from the at least one database <b>28</b> and/or the non-transitory computer readable medium <b>26</b>. For example, hospital data can be retrieved, and include one or more of types of procedures to be performed, distribution of process time for each procedure, availability of resources, a maintenance schedule for the resources, downtime of the resources, a resource to staff ratio, a patient to nurse ratio, an order list of procedures, scheduled examinations, and unscheduled examinations. Patient data can also be retrieved, including one or more of a type of patient, records of no-shows or late arrivals to appointments, age, gender, need for sedation, presence of contrast allergies, presence of claustrophobia, and presence of foreign bodies. From the retrieved data, a department profile <b>34</b> can be generated for each resource (e.g., each piece of active medical equipment and each personnel).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The profiles <b>34</b> for each aspect can be displayed on the display device <b>24</b> via the GUI <b>27</b> for review by a user and/or medication of the profiles via the at least one user input device <b>22</b>. To do so, the user can select an &#x201c;update/validate profiles&#x201d; field <b>29</b> implemented in the GUI <b>27</b>. The profiles <b>34</b> can display relevant information to be extracted for the scenario generator module <b>32</b>. For example, a profile <b>34</b> for an imaging scanner can contain the types of procedures, the distribution of process time for each of the scan types, its availability, a maintenance schedule, a model to predict downtime, etc. In another example, a profile <b>34</b> for the hospital department staff can contain staff availability, skill level, vacation plans, a model to predict absences, etc. In a further example, a profile <b>34</b> for patients can include types of patients (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, ED, and so forth), a model to predict probability of no-show/late arrivals, ages, genders, need for sedation, contrast allergies, claustrophobic presences, foreign bodies presences, etc. In yet another example, a department profile <b>34</b> can include a device to staff ratio, a patient to nurse ratio, and other department policies. In another example, a work order profile <b>34</b> can include an order mix, scheduled/unscheduled exams to determine short-term demand, etc. These are merely non-limiting examples, and are not to be construed as limiting. However, more relevant information extracted from the profiles <b>34</b> can include: procedure rooms and devices in those rooms (e.g., imaging modalities in respective procedure rooms); times for procedures types; types of patients; types of work orders per room and staff member(s); procedure room availability and schedules; staff availability and schedules; a number of procedures that the rooms can handle; and preferred time slots for certain types of exams.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">At an operation <b>104</b>, current statistics for the hospital department are retrieved (e.g., from the at least one database <b>28</b> and/or the non-transitory computer readable medium <b>26</b>). The current statistics for the hospital department can include, for example, at least patient arrival timeliness, patient no-show, and ED arrival statistics.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">At an operation <b>106</b>, values of one or more KPI metrics <b>40</b> can be computed for the current statistics. To do so, the empirical data performance metric calculator module <b>42</b> performs the calculations.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">At an operation <b>108</b>, an executable workflow model <b>44</b> is generated for workflow processes of the hospital department. The workflow model <b>44</b> can include information such as, for example, temporal aspects of the workflow processes in the hospital department. The workflow model <b>44</b> can include variables, such as scalar variables, or a random variable with a probability density function (PDF) value, such as statistical distributions. The variables can include at least one of patient arrival timeliness, patient no-show, and ED arrival, for example. To generate the workflow model <b>44</b>, a mode workflow template is retrieved (e.g., from the non-transitory computer readable medium <b>26</b>) and adjusted based on the computed current statistics. In some examples, the workflow model <b>44</b> can be a Business Process Model (BPM), or any other suitable model such as a queuing model, a discrete event simulation (DES) model, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">At an operation <b>110</b>, a &#x201c;best-case&#x201d; scenario <b>50</b> is simulated by executing the workflow model <b>44</b>. Inputs, such as the department profile <b>34</b> and &#x201c;best case values&#x201d; for the variables of workflow model <b>44</b>, are input to the workflow model. The best case values can include, for example, values representing: patient arrival timeliness that is better than the current statistics; patient no-shows that are lower than the current statistics; ED arrivals that are lower than the current statistics; patients being on-time; no patients being no-shows; no ED values, and so forth. The scenario generator module <b>32</b> then executes the workflow model <b>44</b> to simulate the best case scenario <b>50</b> with these variables. Values of one or more KPI metrics <b>40</b> can be calculated for the simulated best case scenario <b>50</b> using the calculator module <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Similarly, at an operation <b>112</b>, a &#x201c;worst case&#x201d; scenario <b>52</b> is simulated by executing the workflow model <b>44</b>. The operation <b>112</b> can be performed concurrently with, or subsequently to, the operation <b>110</b>. The department profile <b>34</b> and &#x201c;worst case values&#x201d; for the variables of the workflow model <b>44</b> are input to the model. The worst case values can include, for example, values representing: patient arrival timeliness that is worse than the current statistics; patient no-shows that are higher than the current statistics; ED arrivals that are higher than the current statistics; no patients being on time, and so forth. The scenario generator module <b>32</b> then executes the workflow model <b>44</b> to simulate the worst case scenario <b>52</b> with these variables. Values of one or more KPI metrics <b>40</b> can be calculated for the simulated worst case scenario <b>52</b> using the calculator module <b>42</b>. In some examples, at least one &#x201c;intermediate&#x201d; scenario <b>54</b> can be simulated, e.g., using the department profile <b>34</b> and intermediate values between the best and worst case variable values as described. One or more KPI metrics <b>40</b> can be calculated for the intermediate scenario(s) <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one example embodiment, the variables of the workflow model <b>44</b> are random variables, which are used to instantiate a Monte Carlo simulator <b>56</b> implemented in the scenario generator module <b>32</b>. The workflow model <b>44</b> is executed using the Monte Carlo simulator <b>56</b>. To do so, for each simulated patient the Monte Carlo simulator <b>56</b> draws a scalar value for each random variable from its corresponding PDF. For example, if a random variable is selected representing patient no-shows, this random variable may have a PDF that is 90% &#x201c;shows&#x201d; and 10% &#x201c;no shows&#x201d;. For a given patient, the draw of the scalar value would be a show for 90% of each Monte Carlo simulated patient, and a no show for 10% of the Monte Carlo simulated patients. In another example, for a random variable of patient timeliness, the PDF can be a Gaussian distribution that is peaked at on-time values and tails off with increasing lateness. For each patient, the lateness value is drawn from the corresponding PDF.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">At an operation <b>112</b>, the values of the KPI metrics <b>40</b> for the simulated best case scenario <b>50</b> and the simulated worst case scenario <b>52</b> (and, where computed, for the intermediate scenario(s) <b>56</b>), along with values of KPI metrics computed for the current statistics are output on the at least one display device <b>24</b> via the GUI <b>27</b>. In addition to the update/validate profiles field <b>29</b>, the GUI <b>27</b> also includes a &#x201c;create/update/validate/scenarios&#x201d; field <b>31</b> which the user can use to execute the scenario generator module <b>32</b>. In addition, a &#x201c;view benchmarking comparison&#x201d; field <b>33</b> is included, which the user can access to compare the values of the KPI metrics <b>40</b> with the current statistics for the hospital department.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a particular example, the hospital department can be a medical imaging department. Once the corresponding profile(s) <b>34</b> are generated, the scenario generator module <b>32</b> simulates the best case scenario <b>50</b> and the worst case scenario <b>52</b>. For example, the medical imaging department can include 2 magnetic resonance (MR) scanners, one of which is a 1.5 Tesla (T) model and the other is a 3T model, and the department as a sufficient number of staff. The best case scenario <b>50</b> can include, for example, handling 22-24 imaging exams, with a patient wait time PDF of p(w), staff utilization PDF of p(s), scanner utilization PDF of p(m), over time PDF of p(ot), and so forth.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another particular example, the scenario generator module <b>32</b> is programmed to update the best case scenario <b>50</b> and/or the worst case scenario <b>52</b> based on one or more changing scenarios. For example, the user can select the &#x201c;view benchmarking comparison&#x201d; field <b>33</b> on the GUI <b>27</b> to view the values of the KPI metrics <b>40</b>. The values of the KPI metrics <b>40</b> are compared against the best case scenario <b>50</b> and/or the worst case scenario <b>52</b>. The user can then input, via the at least one user input device <b>22</b>, one or more changes to the workflow model <b>44</b> to update or change the best case scenario <b>50</b> and/or the worst case scenario <b>52</b> (which would also update the values of the KPI metrics <b>40</b> in a downstream approach). The user can then compare the updated values of the KPI metrics <b>40</b> based on the input changes to the best case scenario <b>50</b> and/or the worst case scenario <b>52</b> to determine if a predetermined change threshold is satisfied (e.g., if a desired change has occurred). The desired change can be observed based on the updated values of the KPI metrics <b>40</b>. If the updated values are closer to a desired range or value for the user, then the desired change has been achieved.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example of the output values of the KPI metrics <b>40</b> as a graphical representation on the display device <b>24</b> via the GUI <b>27</b>. The KPI metrics <b>40</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> include a &#x201c;patient throughput&#x201d; KPI metric, a patient wait time (in minutes) KPI metric, and a scanner utilization (in percentage) KPI metric.
