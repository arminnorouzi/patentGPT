Specifically, embodiments described herein relate to a filter medium that includes a matrix of fibers embedded with minerals that is configured to remove and trap contaminants from raw water using electrostatic forces and that increases the alkalinity of the water.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The quality of drinking water may be evaluated based on the amount of total dissolved solids (&#x201c;TDS&#x201d;) in the water. Dissolved solids may include minerals, salts, metals, cations, or anions dissolved in water. TDS includes inorganic salts such as calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides, and sulfates, and small amounts of organic matter. Such dissolved solids generally have a small size, e.g., below about 0.2 &#x3bc;m. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set the maximum contamination level of drinking water at a TDS of 500 parts per million (mg/L). However, good quality drinking water generally has a TDS of about 250 ppm or less.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The quality of drinking water may also be evaluated based on the amount of total suspended solids (&#x201c;TSS&#x201d;) in the water. Suspended solids may include, for example, silt particles, clay particles, plankton, algae, fine organic debris, and other particulate matter. Suspended solids may have a relatively large size of about 0.2 &#x3bc;m or greater. The national drinking water quality standard (NDWQS) for the maximum TSS in drinking water is 25 mg/L. Average quality tap water generally has a TSS of about 10 mg/L.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to improve the quality of drinking water, various types of filter media may be used to decrease the amount of TDS, TSS or both. There are a wide variety of filtration techniques and filter media for removing contaminants from water. Water filters may have a single stage with one filter or may include multiple stages having a combination of different filter media. Filter media may rely on different types of materials and may include mesh, screens, cloth, or membranes, among others. Filtration may be performed by surface filtration using a mesh or screen, or by depth filtration using a felt or cloth material. Filtration techniques include microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis filtration, and ion exchange filtration.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Selection of filter media for use in a water filter may depend on a variety of design considerations. For example, a filter media may be selected based on the desired quality of the water, e.g., the desired level of TSS or TDS in the water, or to remove a particular contaminant from the water, e.g., viruses and bacteria. The filter media may be selected based on the cost to prepare the filter media, as certain materials and types of filters may be more expensive than others. Generally, the higher the purity of the drinking water desired, the higher the cost of the filter media. The filter media may be selected in order to optimize the expected useful life of the filter media as some applications may allow for easy replacement of the filter media such that a long useful life is not needed, whereas in other applications where the filter is difficult to clean or replace may be designed to provide a longer useful life. Further, the filter media may be selected based on the type of application of the water filter and the desired flow rate of water through the filter media, such as for commercial applications, e.g., in restaurants, for household use in a refrigerator or under-counter application, e.g., below a kitchen sink, or for personal use such as in a water pitcher or water bottle.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some embodiments described herein relate to a filter cartridge for a beverage dispenser that includes an outer housing comprising an inlet and an outlet, and a filter stage comprising a filter medium.

It should be understood that the following descriptions are not intended to limit the embodiments to one preferred embodiment. To the contrary, it is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as can be included within the spirit and scope of the described embodiments as defined by the claims.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Filters having multiple stages generally filter contaminants in order of decreasing size, with the smallest contaminants removed from the water in the final filter stage. As a result, the final filter stage is generally the rate-limiting stage of the filter in terms of the flow rate through the filter. A final filter stage that includes, for example, a mesh screen with sub-micron sized pores to separate contaminants based on size alone may not provide a desired flow rate of water through the filter unless high pressure is used to increase the flow of water through the filter. Further, the fine mesh screen may rapidly become blocked or clogged with contaminants and may need to be frequently cleaned or replaced, which is undesirable. As a result, it is desired to provide a filter media for removing sub-micron contaminants that maintains sufficient water flow rate and does not readily become clogged or blocked.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Additionally, filter media generally do not help to increase the alkalinity or pH of the water to &#x201c;soften&#x201d; the water. Adding minerals to water may help to improve the taste or quality of the drinking water. As a result, a filter media that removes contaminants from raw water and that also helps to increase the alkalinity or pH of the water to improve the quality and taste of the water is desired.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, a filter medium includes a matrix embedded with filler material including a ceramic substrate containing minerals that dissolve slowly over an extended period of time, such as on the order of one or more weeks or months. In this way, the filter medium may increase the alkalinity or pH of the water as the minerals dissolve into the water, and the slow rate of dissolution of the minerals may allow for the filter medium to provide consistent water quality over its useful life. In some embodiments, the filter medium may include a matrix of fibers having an electrostatic charge that is embedded with filler material that dissolves in the water resulting in formation of cavities in the matrix. As a result, formation of cavities in the matrix as the minerals dissolve helps to dynamically improve water flow by creating new flow channels through the filter medium, and the cavities may also serve to trap contaminants within the cavities by electrostatic forces.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As used herein, the term &#x201c;contaminants&#x201d; may refer to any of various substances or matter in water, including but not limited to suspended solids and dissolved solids, including for example, heavy metals, such as lead and mercury, chemical compounds and biomolecules, such as volatile organic compounds, chlorine, chloramine, pesticides, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, particulates, colloids, polysaccharides (TEP), cysts, bacteria, <i>Legionella, E. coli</i>, viruses, and endotoxins, among others.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The filter medium described herein may be particularly suited for use in a home or office setting, such as in a refrigerator or a beverage dispenser <b>300</b>, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. While the filter medium is described herein in connection with a beverage dispenser, it is understood that the filter medium is capable of use in any of various settings or applications for removing contaminants from water.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an exemplary embodiment, a beverage dispenser <b>300</b> may include a housing <b>310</b> defining a beverage container receiving area <b>320</b> in which a beverage container <b>400</b> may be placed. Beverage dispenser <b>300</b> may include one or more dispensing heads <b>330</b> for dispensing a beverage into a beverage container <b>400</b> placed in beverage container receiving area <b>320</b>. Beverage dispenser <b>300</b> may further include a user interface <b>340</b> for receiving a selection of a beverage to be dispensed. User interface <b>340</b> may include, for example, a plurality of buttons <b>342</b> to be operated by a user by pressing a button <b>342</b> corresponding to the desired beverage. Beverage dispenser <b>300</b> may dispense any of various beverages, including for example, still water, sparkling water, cold water, hot water, or may dispense water in combination with a flavoring, sweetener, additive, or the like.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Beverage dispenser <b>300</b> may include a filter unit <b>350</b> containing a filter medium <b>100</b> as described herein for removing contaminants from water. In some embodiments, Filter unit <b>350</b> may include for example one or more filter cartridges, such as filter cartridge <b>200</b> described in further detail below. Beverage dispenser <b>300</b> may be connected to a source of water, such as a water line. Beverage dispenser <b>300</b> may include an inlet port <b>312</b> that communicates the water to an inlet of the filter unit <b>350</b>, such as by an inlet line <b>372</b>. Filter unit <b>350</b> removes contaminants from the water and the filtered water exits filter unit <b>350</b> via an outlet line <b>374</b> and may be dispensed by dispensing head <b>330</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, beverage dispenser <b>300</b> may include one or more water treatment units <b>360</b> for treating the filtered water prior to delivering the filtered and treated water to dispensing head <b>330</b> via a dispensing line <b>376</b>. For example, a treatment unit <b>360</b> may include a heat exchanger or &#x201c;chiller&#x201d; configured to lower a temperature of the water, a heater configured to raise the temperature of the water, or a carbonator configured to carbonate the water, among others. Further, beverage dispenser <b>300</b> may include one or more sources of flavoring, or beverage dispenser <b>300</b> may be placed in communication with one or more sources of flavoring, such as via a flavoring inlet <b>314</b>. Beverage dispenser <b>300</b> may include fluid lines <b>378</b> for communicating a flavoring from a source of flavoring to dispensing head <b>330</b>, and treatment unit <b>360</b> may include a mixer or the like for combining the filtered water with the flavoring. Further, beverage dispenser <b>300</b> may include additional components, such as fluid lines, manifolds, pumps, valves, controllers, and sensors for measuring temperature or flow rate among other parameters, and other components as necessary for moving fluid through the beverage dispenser and operating the beverage dispenser as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. Further, while filter unit <b>350</b> is shown upstream of treatment unit <b>360</b>, it is understood that filter unit <b>350</b> may be arranged downstream of one or more of the treatment units <b>360</b> described above.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Some embodiments described herein relate to a filter medium <b>100</b> that includes one or more layers <b>110</b>, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Each layer <b>110</b> of filter medium <b>100</b> includes a matrix <b>112</b> and filler material <b>120</b>. Filler material <b>120</b> may be embedded in matrix <b>112</b>. Filler material <b>120</b> may be distributed evenly throughout matrix <b>112</b> so that filter media <b>100</b> is substantially homogenous. Filter medium <b>100</b> may remove contaminants from water by blocking contaminants having a size greater than a pore size of filter medium <b>100</b> from passing through filter medium <b>100</b>. Additionally, filter medium <b>100</b> may filter contaminants by adsorption of contaminants to matrix <b>112</b> by electrostatic forces.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, filter medium <b>100</b> may be configured to remove suspended solids and dissolved solids from water having a size in a range of about 0.1 &#x3bc;m to about 1 &#x3bc;m. Contaminants having a size greater than 1 &#x3bc;m may be removed from the water by a pre-filter, such as a carbon block, prior to flowing through filter medium <b>100</b>. Removing contaminants having a size greater than 1 &#x3bc;m prior to flowing the water through filter medium <b>100</b> may further help to avoid clogging or blocking of filter medium <b>100</b> by such relatively large contaminants. Contaminants smaller than 0.1 &#x3bc;m, such as dissolved ions, may pass through filter medium <b>100</b> with little to no interaction due to their small size.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Each layer <b>110</b> of filter medium <b>100</b> may have a thickness t of 0.5 mm to 50 mm, 1 mm to 40 mm, or 2 mm to 30 mm. In some embodiments, filter medium <b>100</b> may have an average pore size of 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 1 &#x3bc;m. Filter medium <b>100</b> may remove contaminants having an average size greater than a pore size of filter media <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, matrix <b>112</b> of filter medium <b>100</b> may include a plurality of fibers <b>114</b>. Filter medium <b>100</b> including a plurality of fibers <b>114</b> may be formed as a non-woven fabric, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Fibers <b>114</b> may include polypropylene fibers, fiberglass, nanofibers, or a mixture thereof.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Matrix <b>112</b> may have an electrostatic charge, such as a positive electrostatic charge. Many contaminants, such as bacteria and long-chain dissolved molecules, e.g., proteins may have a negative electrostatic charge and can be removed from water by electrostatic attraction to a filter medium <b>100</b> having a positive electrostatic charge. In this way, matrix <b>112</b> may trap contaminants, such as negatively charged contaminants by electrostatic attraction. As matrix <b>112</b> may trap contaminants based on electrostatic forces, matrix <b>112</b> may trap contaminants having a size that is smaller than a pore size of the matrix. The use of electrostatic forces to remove contaminants from water allows for filter medium <b>100</b> to have a lower pressure drop and higher flow rate than existing filter media that rely solely on small, micron or sub-micron sized pores to separate contaminants from the water.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, matrix <b>112</b> may further include an additive <b>118</b>, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Additive <b>118</b> may be configured to provide matrix <b>112</b> with an electrostatic charge or to enhance the electrostatic charge of matrix <b>112</b>. Additive <b>118</b> may include for example, activated carbon or alumina. Additive <b>118</b> may coat or be embedded in fibers <b>114</b>. Additive <b>118</b> may be in the form of a particulate or powder. In some embodiments, additive <b>118</b> may have an average size in a range of 0.01 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m. The additive <b>118</b> may be present in an amount of 1% to 50% of a volume of the fibers <b>114</b>, 2% to 40% of a volume of the fibers <b>114</b>, or 5% to 30% of a volume of the fibers <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Filter medium <b>100</b> may also include a filler material <b>120</b>. Filler material <b>120</b> may be embedded in matrix <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, filler material <b>120</b> may be present in filter medium <b>100</b> in an amount of about 1% to about 10% by volume. In some embodiments, filler material <b>120</b> may include minerals. Minerals may include alkaline minerals, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, manganese, magnesium, iron, zinc, phosphorus, or combinations thereof. Minerals may dissolve in water flowing through filter medium <b>100</b> in order to increase the pH or alkalinity of the water and to enhance the quality or taste of the water. However, minerals generally have a high solubility and dissolve rapidly in water. The inventors of the present application found that the solubility of minerals can be decreased such that the minerals dissolve more slowly over an extended period of time by incorporating the minerals into a ceramic substrate. In some embodiments, minerals of filler material <b>120</b> including a ceramic substrate may have a solubility of about 1 mg/L to about 50 mg/L, 2 mg/L to 30 mg/L, or 5 mg/L to 10 mg/L.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">An exemplary filler material <b>120</b> including a ceramic substrate <b>150</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In some embodiments, ceramic substrate <b>150</b> may be formed, for example, from aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), aluminate (AlO<sub>4-x</sub>), or silicate (SiO<sub>4-x</sub>), where x is 0, 1 or 2. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, ceramic substrate <b>150</b> may include a network of aluminum (or silicon) <b>152</b> and oxygen atoms <b>154</b>. In some embodiments, ceramic substrate <b>150</b> may have a crystal structure. Minerals <b>122</b> may be contained in the ceramic substrate <b>150</b>. Minerals <b>122</b> may have a positive charge and may be bonded to ceramic substrate <b>150</b> by interaction with the negatively charged oxygen atoms of the ceramic substrate <b>150</b>. The ceramic substrate <b>150</b> serves to cause the minerals <b>122</b> to dissolve slowly in the water flowing through the filter medium. Minerals <b>122</b> may dissolve over an extended period of time, such as several weeks or months. The solubility of the minerals can be tailored by adjusting the temperature and pressure used to form the filler material <b>120</b>. The solubility may impact the useful life of filter medium <b>100</b>, as a higher solubility may result in depletion of minerals <b>122</b> and of filter medium <b>100</b> more rapidly. Further, the solubility may impact the concentration of minerals <b>122</b> that dissolve into the filtered water, as the higher the solubility of minerals <b>122</b>, the more minerals <b>122</b> will be dissolved from filter medium <b>100</b> into a given quantity of water.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, filter medium <b>100</b> may be configured to release a concentration of minerals similar to a concentration of suspended solids having a size of less than 1 &#x3bc;m in the water to be filtered. For example, if tap water to be filtered has a concentration of suspended solids with a size below 1 &#x3bc;m of about 5 mg/L, filter medium <b>100</b> may be configured to release about 5 mg/L of minerals as water flows through filter media <b>100</b>. In this way, the dissolved minerals essentially replace the suspended solids removed from the water. However, it is understood that the rate at which minerals are released from filter medium <b>100</b> is independent of the rate at which contaminants are removed from the tap water flowing through filter medium.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, filler material <b>120</b> may have a size in a range of 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 20 &#x3bc;m, 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 15 &#x3bc;m, or 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m, wherein the size of the filler material <b>120</b> is an average of the maximum diameter of the filler material <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, filler material <b>120</b> may be formed by grinding commercially available mineral ceramic balls, which may have a size of, for example, 1 mm to 5 mm, to the desired size, e.g., 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 20 &#x3bc;m. In some embodiments, filler material <b>120</b> may be formed by a sol-gel method which allows for formation of filler material <b>120</b> having a size of 1 &#x3bc;m or less.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In operation of filter media <b>100</b>, as water flows through filter medium <b>100</b>, filler material <b>120</b> may begin to partially dissolve into the water, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. As discussed, the minerals may dissolve in the water to increase the alkalinity or pH of the filtered water, softening the water and improving taste.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Additionally, as filler material <b>120</b> dissolves, cavities <b>130</b> are formed in matrix <b>112</b> in the space previously occupied by filler material <b>120</b>. In this way, new flow paths through which water may flow through filter medium <b>100</b> are dynamically formed as minerals <b>122</b> dissolve. Formation of cavities <b>130</b> may help to maintain the flow rate of water through filter medium <b>100</b> throughout the useful life of filter medium <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, cavities <b>130</b> may be formed at a rate of 0.0001 cm<sup>3 </sup>to 0.001 cm<sup>3 </sup>per liter of water flowing through filter medium <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, cavities <b>130</b> formed by dissolving of filler material <b>120</b> may trap suspended solids <b>410</b> within cavities <b>130</b>. As cavities <b>130</b> are surrounded by electrostatically charged matrix <b>112</b>, suspended solids <b>410</b> may become trapped within cavities <b>130</b> by electrostatic forces. When a filler material <b>120</b> is fully dissolved, cavity <b>130</b> has a size that is approximately a size of the filler material <b>120</b>. Thus, in some embodiments, cavity <b>130</b> may have a size of about 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 20 &#x3bc;m. If the size of the cavity <b>130</b> is greater than about 20 &#x3bc;m, the electrostatic forces of matrix <b>112</b> may not be sufficient to attract and maintain sub-micron contaminants within cavity <b>130</b>. Further, if cavity <b>130</b> is less than about 0.1 &#x3bc;m, contaminants may be too large to become trapped within cavity <b>130</b>. Cavities <b>130</b> may trap suspended solids so as to avoid accumulation of suspended solids in matrix <b>112</b> which may otherwise block or clog filter medium <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Some embodiments relate to a method for filtering water containing contaminants using a filter medium. Water containing contaminants may flow through a filter medium that includes a matrix of a plurality of fibers having an electrostatic charge, and a filler material including a ceramic substrate containing minerals. The filler material may be embedded in the matrix of the filter medium. Contaminants may be trapped in the matrix of the filter medium by electrostatic attraction. As water flows through the filter medium, minerals may at least partially dissolve from the filter medium into the water. Cavities may be formed in the matrix of the filter medium as the minerals begin to dissolve. Contaminants may become trapped within the cavities by electrostatic forces. In some embodiments, the water may flow through a pre-filter prior to flowing through the filter medium in order to remove contaminants, such as contaminants having a size of 1 &#x3bc;m or greater.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Filter medium <b>100</b> may be used as a filter stage in a filter cartridge <b>200</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Filter cartridge <b>200</b> may have one or more stages. Filter stages may include any of various filter media known in the art, such as polypropylene, activated carbon, catalytic carbon, kinetic degradation fluxion (KDF), natural fibers, synthetic fibers, hollow fibers, glass fibers, activated aluminum, manganese dioxide, stainless steel wire mesh, cellulose acetate membranes, polysulfone membranes, and reverse osmosis membranes, among others. Filter medium <b>100</b> may be used in one or more stages of filter cartridge <b>200</b>, and may be used as a final stage of filter cartridge <b>200</b>. Thus, filter medium <b>100</b> may be arranged downstream of one or more additional filter stages. In this way, filter medium <b>100</b> may increase the pH of the water and may enhance the water with minerals.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, filter cartridge <b>200</b> includes an outer housing <b>210</b> defining a hollow interior volume and having a first end <b>216</b> opposite a second end <b>218</b>. In some embodiments, housing <b>210</b> may have a generally cylindrical shape. Outer housing <b>210</b> may define one or more inlets <b>212</b> through which water containing contaminants may flow into filter cartridge <b>200</b>, and one or more outlets <b>214</b> through which filtered water may exit filter cartridge <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, inlets <b>212</b> and outlets <b>214</b> may be arranged at first end <b>216</b> of housing <b>210</b>. Outlet <b>214</b> may be arranged centrally and inlets <b>212</b> may be arranged peripherally on housing <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, inlets <b>212</b> may be configured to allow water to flow into filter cartridge <b>200</b> along a longitudinal direction Z of filter cartridge <b>200</b>, and outlet <b>214</b> may be configured to allow water to flow out of filter cartridge <b>200</b> in a longitudinal direction of filter cartridge <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Filter cartridge <b>200</b> may include a pre-filter <b>220</b> arranged within housing <b>210</b>.

For example, pre-filter <b>220</b> may include a carbon block, activated carbon, polypropylene or polyester, among others. In some embodiments, pre-filter <b>220</b> may be configured to remove contaminants having a size of 1 &#x3bc;m or greater. Pre-filter <b>220</b> may have a tubular configuration with an open central area. Filter stages <b>221</b>, <b>22</b> of pre-filter <b>220</b> may be arranged concentrically in a nested configuration. Pre-filter <b>220</b> may be arranged parallel to longitudinal axis Z of housing <b>210</b> and may define a peripheral flow channel <b>211</b> in a space between pre-filter <b>220</b> and housing <b>210</b> and may define a central flow channel <b>213</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, filter medium <b>100</b> may also have a tubular construction with an open central area (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).

Inner housing <b>230</b> helps to ensure water flowing into filter cartridge <b>200</b> through inlet <b>212</b> first flows through pre-filter <b>220</b> prior to reaching filter media <b>100</b>. Further, as central flow channel <b>213</b> of pre-filter <b>220</b> may be relatively small, inner housing <b>230</b> may provide a larger volume within filter cartridge <b>200</b> in which filter media <b>100</b> may be arranged.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Filter medium <b>100</b> may be arranged within inner housing <b>230</b> to define a peripheral flow channel <b>231</b> between filter medium <b>100</b> and inner housing <b>230</b> and a central flow channel <b>233</b> in open central area of filter medium <b>100</b>.
