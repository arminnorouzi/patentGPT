id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to compositions and methods for inhibiting shale and preventing shale accretion. In particular, the present disclosure relates to the use of dry polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) in the form of flakes or powder having a middle range molecular weight in treatment fluids for subterranean formations.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A drilling fluid used in connection with drilling a well in a subterranean formation is any number of fluids (gaseous or liquid) and mixtures of fluids and solids (as solid suspensions, mixtures and emulsions of liquids, gases and solids) used in operations to drill well bores into subterranean formations. Drilling fluids are used to cool the drill bit, lubricate the rotating drill pipe to prevent it from sticking to the walls of the well bore, prevent blowouts by serving as a hydrostatic head to counteract the sudden entrance into the well bore of high pressure formation fluids, and remove drill cuttings from the well bore.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">During drilling of subterranean well bores, it is not uncommon to encounter strata comprising reactive shales. As referred to herein, the term &#x201c;shale&#x201d; is understood to mean materials such as certain types of clays (for example, bentonite) and related subterranean materials that may &#x201c;swell,&#x201d; or increase in volume, when exposed to water. Reactive shales may be problematic during drilling operations because of their tendency to degrade when exposed to aqueous media such as aqueous-based drilling fluids. This degradation, of which swelling is one example, can result in undesirable drilling conditions and undesirable interference with the drilling fluid. For instance, the degradation of the shale may interfere with attempts to maintain the integrity of drilled cuttings traveling up the well bore until such time as the cuttings can be removed by solids control equipment located at the surface. Degradation of drilled cuttings prior to their removal at the surface greatly prolongs drilling time, because shale particles traveling up the well bore break up into smaller and smaller particles, which increasingly exposes new surface area of the shale to the drilling fluid, which leads to still further absorption of water, and further degradation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Shale disintegration may also adversely impact &#x201c;equivalent circulation density&#x201d; (&#x201c;ECD&#x201d;). ECD is affected by the solids content of the drilling fluid, which increases if surface solids control equipment cannot remove shale from the drilling fluid. Plastic viscosity (an indicator of size and quantity of solids) is an important parameter in determining drilling rate. Maintenance of appropriate ECD is extremely important in situations where a well is being drilled wherein a narrow tolerance exists between the weight of the drilling fluid needed to control the formation pressure, and the weight of the drilling fluid that will fracture the formation. In such circumstances, minimizing shale degradation provides improved control of the density of the drilling fluid, and enhances the probability of successfully drilling a well bore.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Shale degradation may substantially decrease the stability of the well bore, which may cause irregularities in the diameter of the well bore, e.g., the diameter of some portions of the well bore may be either smaller or greater than desired. In an extreme case, shale degradation may decrease the stability of the well bore to such extent that the well bore will collapse. Degradation of the shale may also interrupt circulation of the drilling fluid, cause greater friction between the drill string and the well bore, or cause the drill string to become stuck in the well bore. Accordingly, the complications associated with shale swelling during drilling may greatly increase the cost of drilling.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A traditional method of inhibiting shale swelling during drilling to attempt to minimize such complications has been to use an oil-based drilling fluid as opposed to an aqueous-based drilling fluid. However, oil-based drilling fluids are often environmentally undesirable because they may be toxic to marine plants and animals. Accordingly, environmental regulations enacted by numerous countries have curtailed the use of oil-based drilling fluids. Consequently, water-based drilling fluids are preferred because they likely have a more benign effect on the environment than oil-based drilling fluids. However, the use of aqueous drilling fluids results in added complications, due to interactions between components of the subterranean formation such as reactive shales and the aqueous fluids.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To counteract the propensity of aqueous drilling fluids to interact with reactive shales in the formation, a shale inhibiting component may be added to the aqueous drilling fluid. Amphoteric materials are one type of water-based shale inhibitor that have been used in the past. Amphoteric materials are believed to function by attaching to the shale substrate, thus preventing water ingress. Amphoteric inhibitors are environmentally undesirable, however, especially in heavily regulated areas, because they demonstrate low biodegradability and high toxicity. Potassium chloride is another material that has been utilized as a shale inhibitor. Although potassium chloride is widely used as a shale inhibitor in the North Sea, it is considered to be only moderately effective at inhibiting the swelling of shale. Furthermore, potassium chloride is environmentally unacceptable in other areas of the world. For example, potassium chloride is unsuitable for use in regions such as the Gulf of Mexico, because its concentration of potassium ions is troublesome for certain types of marine life, e.g., shrimp. Potassium chloride is also disfavored in certain regions, such as the Middle East, where wells are drilled in close proximity to aquifers due to concerns that the potassium chloride will contaminate the aquifer. Polyglycols have also been used as shale inhibitors in water-based drilling fluids but have not reached satisfactory inhibition levels. Partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamides (&#x201c;PHPA&#x201d;) have also been utilized in many regions, but these do not prevent shale accretion in many cases, have been found to cause formation damage, and are environmentally undesirable.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">PVP-based shale inhibitors may be used but are provided as dilute solutions of PVP in water. As such, large quantities of liquid are required to supply ongoing operations at remote drilling locations. Moreover, supply and storage are difficult to manage when shipping liquid PVP internationally and due to potential delays from carriers. Liquid PVP solutions at high molecular weight (e.g., 2 million to 3 million) pose challenges to industrial processing methods used to convert the polymer component into dry form. Elevated viscosity (expressed as a K-number) forces further dilution of the liquid form in order to effectively spray dry the material, and this results in high energy consumption and poor process yield.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, there is a continuing need for improved compositions and methods for inhibiting shale and preventing shale accretion.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The following figures are included to illustrate certain aspects of the present invention and should not be viewed as an exclusive embodiment.

In one or more embodiments, the dry PVP product has a molecular weight of about 500,000 to about 2,000,000. If the molecular weight is higher, the PVP polymer will require extensive efforts to convert it into flake or powder form. The high molecular weight solid powder also presents poor storage and packaging characteristics due to a very low bulk density. If the molecular weight is lower than about 500,000, the PVP loses its anti-accretion ability. The molecular weight of the dry PVP product is within a range where it may be dried by various methods but has sufficient molecular weight to inhibit shales and clays. As used herein, &#x201c;inhibit shale&#x201d; means to inhibit the tendency of shale to absorb water, and &#x201c;accretion&#x201d; refers to the mechanism by which partially hydrated cuttings stick to parts of the bottomhole assembly and accumulate as a compacted, layered deposit.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one or more embodiments, methods are provided for treating subterranean formations using the dry PVP product. Such treatment operations can include, for example, drilling operations, stimulation operations, production operations, remediation operations, sand control treatments, and the like. As used herein, &#x201c;treat,&#x201d; &#x201c;treatment,&#x201d; and &#x201c;treating&#x201d; refer to any subterranean operation that uses a fluid in conjunction with achieving a desired function and/or for a desired purpose. More specific examples of treatment operations include drilling operations, fracturing operations, gravel packing operations, acidizing operations, scale dissolution and removal operations, loss circulation operations, sand control operations, consolidation operations, anti-sludge operations, and the like.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The treatment fluids generally include an aqueous base fluid and the dry PVP product. In one or more embodiments, the treatment fluid includes a drilling fluid.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The aqueous base fluid in the treatment fluids can include fresh water, salt water (e.g., water containing one or more dissolved salts), brine, seawater, or any combination thereof. One of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure will recognize which types of aqueous base fluids are appropriate for a particular application.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one or more embodiments, the dry PVP product is added directly to an aqueous treatment fluid for use in a subterranean formation. In one or more embodiments, the dry PVP product is added in an amount of about 0.04 pounds per barrel (ppb) to about 10 ppb to the treatment fluid, such as about 1 ppb to about 8 ppb.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Advantageously, this higher activity product can be sent to remote locations more easily than liquid PVP and used at 1/10th the amount needed previously for similar performance. The dry PVP product also allows for stronger additions of PVP to be made quickly and with less increase of viscosity in the fluid system. The dry PVP product further reduces logistical requirements, inventory space required, and heavy lifts at stock points and drilling locations. Along with safer handling, the dry PVP product presents a lower carbon footprint by utilizing about &#x2154; less containers through global shipping lanes. In one or more embodiments, the dry PVP product offers 10 times the strength for shale inhibition compared to liquid PVP and presents fewer effects on fluid rheology, enabling ease of field maintenance and treatment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one or more embodiments, the treatment fluids may contain one or more salts. One of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure will recognize the need for caution when combining a salt with a treatment fluid for use in certain regions of the world where such use of a salt may be subject to environmental restrictions. One of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure will also recognize where it is desirable to use a dense brine rather than achieve density with a solid weighting agent. Where the use of a salt is permissible, a variety of salts may be used. Examples of suitable salts include potassium chloride, potassium acetate, sodium chloride, potassium formate, potassium carbonate, calcium chloride, and calcium bromide. In one or more embodiments, a mixture of suitable salts may be used. In one or more embodiments, suitable salts are present in the treatment fluids in an amount in the range of from about 5 ppb to about the salt saturation limit of the treatment fluid.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one or more embodiments, other additives suitable for use in subterranean well bore operations also may be present in the treatment fluids if desired, including antifoams, biocides, bridging agents, corrosion control agents, dispersants, flocculants, fluid loss additives, foamers, H<sub>2</sub>S scavengers, lubricants, oxygen scavengers, scale inhibitors, viscosifiers, and weighting agents. One of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure will be able to determine if any of such additives are needed for a given application.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one or more embodiments, the present methods include preparing a treatment fluid (e.g., a drilling fluid) by mixing an aqueous base fluid and a dry PVP in flake or powder form having a molecular weight between about 500,000 and 2,000,000; and introducing the treatment fluid in a subterranean formation. The PVP is added to the treatment fluid in dry rather than liquid form (e.g., PVP mixed with water). The term &#x201c;introducing&#x201d; or its variations, as used herein, includes pumping, injecting, pouring, releasing, displacing, spotting, circulating, or otherwise placing a fluid or material within a well, wellbore, or subterranean formation using any suitable manner known in the art.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present methods may be utilized in a variety of subterranean operations that involve subterranean drilling. Examples of suitable subterranean drilling operations include, but are not limited to, water well drilling, oil/gas well drilling, utilities drilling, tunneling, construction/installation of subterranean pipelines and service lines, and the like. These subterranean drilling operations may be utilized to drill a well bore in a subterranean formation, or to stimulate the production of fluids from a subterranean formation, as well as or for a number of other purposes. In one or more embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods of drilling at least a portion of a well bore to penetrate a subterranean formation. In those embodiments, a drilling fluid may be placed in contact with a drill bit and a subterranean formation. In certain embodiments, the drilling fluid may include the dry PVP product before it is introduced into the well bore.

The performance tests were carried out by formulating base water based drilling fluids and incorporating the K60-Flake, K90C-Flake and PERFORMATROL&#xae; shale stabilizer respectively, into each of the fluids. The base water based fluids (10.0 ppg) were formulated as per the products given in Table 4. These fluids were formulated by adding each of the above ingredient in a 2 oilfield barrel (bbl) mixing cup and mixed using a multimixer. Thus, the fluids included water, a salt (KCl), viscosifiers (AQUAGEL GOLD SEAL&#xae;, BARAZAN&#xae; D PLUS&#x2122;), a fluid loss control agent (PAC-L&#x2122;), representative drill cuttings/solids (HYMOD PRIMA CLAY), a weighting agent (API BARITE), and an oxygen scavenger (BARASCAV&#x2122; D&#x2122;) The order of addition and the mixing time for each of the products is given in Table 4. Once the formulation mixing was completed, the fluid was transferred to an aging cell and conditioned by hot rolling at 150&#xb0; F. for 16 hours. After the aging was completed, the fluids were tested for shale erosion and shale accretion performance. The details for these two performance tests are summarized as below.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Shale Erosion Test:</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0036">An appropriate quantity of shale sample (London Clay) was dried, sized and passed between sieve No. 5 and sieve No. 10. Approximately 1 lab barrel (350 ml) of the drilling fluid was taken in a glass rolling jar and about 30 grams of the sized shale sample collected on the No. 10 sieve was added to it. The glass jar was closed and placed in an oven at 150&#xb0; F., and hot rolled for 16 hours. After the 16-hour hot roll, the glass jar was cooled down, and its contents were poured onto the No. 10 sieve. The glass jar was carefully rinsed with a KCl solution (3%) and poured onto the No. 10 sieve to remove any residual fluid and shales. The shales retained on the sieve were then carefully washed with additional KCl solution (3%) to remove any adherent mud solids. Further, the shales were briefly rinsed with fresh water to remove any excess salt. These shales were then transferred from the sieve to a clean dry piece of absorbent paper on a flat surface. A brush was used to remove any shale left in the sieve. The shales were then transferred in a pre-weighed Petri dish and then dried in an oven at 105&#xb0; C. The dried sample was then weighed, and the resulting weight of shale was reported as percent recovery.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Shale Accretion Test:</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0037">A clean and dry Monel tube was weighed and then placed in a glass rolling jar containing about 1 lab barrel (350 ml) of the drilling fluid to be tested. The jar was then closed and hot rolled at 150&#xb0; F. for 5 minutes. Further, about 30 grams of CASING SEAL&#x2122; (granular Wyoming sodium bentonite) was added to the jar, and the fluid was mixed with a spatula to evenly disperse the Casing Seal in the fluid. The jar was then hot rolled at 150&#xb0; F. for an additional 30 minutes. The Monel tube was removed from the fluid in the jar and placed on a screen for a period of about 30 minutes to let the excess fluid run off the tube. The tube was then dried in an oven for 30 minutes at 185&#xb0; F., and the final weight of the tube recorded. The difference in weight of the tube before and after the tests was the amount of shale adhering to the tube and an indication of the shale accretion capability.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0038">All these

In this case, the control fluid reached 85% recovery by virtue of the added KCl.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0053">For Fluid 2E, the BDF&#x2122;-677 guanidine-based compound again showed a lower recovery value than the other inhibitors. This was measured at 89% and only slightly improved from the control. The other inhibitors all achieved 95-97% mass, indicating a high degree of erosion control.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0054">Accretion testing was also conducted on this series of fluids. This revealed poor performance with the control fluid since it had 25% of shale mass sticking to the tube. The polyacrylamide-type inhibitors, EZ MUD&#xae; DP dry PHPA copolymer and CLAY GRABBER&#xae; shale stabilizer, attained accretion values of 9 and 10% respectively. Fluid 2E with the BDF&#x2122;-677 guanidine-based compound had improved accretion over these fluids, with 6% mass sticking. The lowest accretion values obtained were with the two PVP-based inhibitor materials. PERFORMATROL&#xae; shale stabilizer showed 4.5% while K90C-Flakes showed 5.4%. Given the experimental error associated with this test method, these values could be considered the same and superior to the other inhibitors tested.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0055">In terms of formulating fluids for drilling reactive formations, there is an ongoing need for high-efficiency inhibitors that may serve multiple functions within fluids. Shale erosion and accretion are known to be two of the most prevalent challenges that these additives must meet in order to provide adequate performance for drilling. As the previous result sets illustrate, most inhibitor additives function well at only one of these two functions. For example, EZ MUD&#xae; DP dry PHPA copolymer provided an acceptable level of shale recovery when tested in freshwater and a high degree of control with KCl brine. However, its accretion prevention capability was poor compared with the BDF&#x2122;-677 guanidine-based compound and the PVP-based inhibitors.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0056">Conversely, the BDF&#x2122;-677 guanidine-based compound lagged in shale recovery while it achieved acceptable to good accretion control with KCl brine. Those of ordinary skill in the art would recognize the need for binary or tertiary combinations of single-function inhibitors to satisfy multiple well requirements for shale control. The advantage of the dry PVP flakes having a middle range molecular weight is apparent since both accretion and erosion control are achieved with a very small mass of polymer. This improves logistical capabilities to service drilling fluids in remote locations, and drastically simplifies the onsite maintenance required. In view of these benefits, the dry PVP flakes have been shown to be the most efficacious material available for shale inhibition.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0057">Although only a few exemplary embodiments have been described in detail above, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that many other modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of the present invention.
