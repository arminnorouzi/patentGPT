And steel strap connectors are provided to couple the steel straps to the pulleys, which have a significant influence on service life of the steel straps and compactness of the structures.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The existing steel strap connectors generally connect the steel straps to the pulleys through bolts and the like. For example, a steel strap is welded to a connector such as a steel block which is then inserted into a receiving groove defined by the pulley. The connector is immovable as getting stuck in the groove when the steel strap is tensioned, or is prevented from moving with being pressed by an additional bolt. Typically, the strap is overlapped on a surface of the block and fixed thereto by welding. The connection between the strap and the block is supported by merely the welds which is subjected to shear forces when the strap is tensioned.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above existing solutions have disadvantages as follows. Firstly, the welds between the straps and the connectors are mainly subjected to shear forces, and the shear yield strength of the welds is far lower than the tensile yield strength and compressive yield strength thereof, so that the welds are fragile when subjected to shear forces compared with being subjected to tensile force. Secondly, after the steel straps and connectors are welded, the yield strength at the welds is reduced to, generally, 80% to 90%, which makes the connectors fragile. Thirdly, in order to avoid fracture due to lower shear yield strength and local reduction of the yield strength caused by welding, the straps may wrap around a pulley at a larger angle to increase a friction force between the steel straps and the pulley against the tension which causes the shear stress at the welds, so as to ensure safety of the steel straps. Fourthly, in order to ensure reliability of the welds, multiple welds with larger lengths are required to bear the shear force, which results in a large length of the steel strap connector and thus a large space occupation, while a limited space is reserved for the steel strap connector in some practical occasions. Fifthly, in order to improve the fatigue life of steel straps, each strap usually has a plurality of layers which need to be uniformly pre-tightened and wrapped on a pulley for subsequent welding, resulting in a complex process of welding between the steel strap connector and the steel strap.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a strap connector including a core, a pulley and a strap.

It should be noted that the core <b>1</b> is a specific component designed for the strap connector of the present disclosure. The terms such as &#x201c;core,&#x201d; &#x201c;belly portion&#x201d; and &#x201c;neck portion&#x201d; are not intended to limit specific shapes of the components as long as the corresponding dimensional relations are satisfied.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the strap <b>2</b> is connected to the core <b>1</b>. In this embodiment, the strap <b>2</b> is a steel strap. Other strap or rope may be used, for example, a belt which is commonly used as a strap for mechanical transmission. In this embodiment, the strap <b>2</b> is connected to the core <b>1</b> in such a manner that the strap <b>2</b> ride on the belly portion <b>11</b> of the core <b>1</b> to wrap around the core <b>1</b>, and both ends of the strap <b>2</b> are attached to and extended along the neck portion <b>12</b>. However, the specific connection between the strap <b>2</b> and the core <b>1</b> are not limited in the present disclosure. For example, the strap <b>2</b> may be coupled to the core <b>1</b>, or the core <b>1</b> and the strap <b>2</b> may be integrally formed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the strap <b>2</b> may be multi-layered utilizing multiple plies to increase the strength. For example, the strap <b>2</b> of two plies wraps around the core <b>1</b> and extends further to form a structure of four plies. Specifically, the number of plies in the strap <b>2</b> may be designed according to the strength requirements, which is not limited herein.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the pulley <b>3</b> defines a core chamber <b>31</b> which matches the core <b>1</b> in shape. The core chamber <b>31</b> includes an abdomen <b>311</b> and a mouth <b>312</b> sized smaller than the abdomen <b>311</b>. The core chamber <b>31</b> at the pulley <b>3</b> is specifically designed for the strap connector of the present disclosure, and the specific shapes of the core chamber <b>31</b>, the abdomen <b>311</b> and the mouth <b>312</b> may not be limited herein as long as they meet the functional requirements for connection with the core <b>1</b> or a connector including the core <b>1</b> and the strap <b>2</b>. Structural designs for other parts of the pulley <b>3</b> do not affect the implementation of the present disclosure and thus are not limited herein. For example, structural designs for other parts of the pulley <b>3</b> may be the same as or different from those in the existing art.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the connector including the core <b>1</b> and the strap <b>2</b> is connected to the pulley <b>3</b> in such a manner that the core <b>1</b> is received in the core chamber <b>31</b>, the belly portion <b>11</b> is disposed in the abdomen <b>311</b>, the neck portion <b>12</b> is disposed in the mouth <b>312</b>, a section size of the belly portion <b>11</b> is larger than that of the mouth <b>312</b>, and the strap <b>2</b> extends out of the core chamber <b>31</b> through the mouth <b>312</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the technical solution of the embodiment, a core <b>1</b> with a larger belly portion <b>11</b> is provided, and a core chamber <b>31</b> with a larger abdomen and a smaller mouth is defined by the pulley <b>3</b> and matches the core <b>1</b> in shape. The core <b>1</b> and the strap <b>2</b> are connected and then inserted into the core chamber <b>31</b>, so that connector can be engaged to the pulley <b>3</b>. The pulley <b>3</b> rotates as the strap <b>2</b> runs, thereby realizing transmission.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment, both the core <b>1</b> and the core chamber <b>31</b> are teardrop-shaped. The belly portion <b>11</b> has a rear section with a convex surface, and the abdomen <b>311</b> has a rear section with a concave surface. The neck portion <b>12</b> and the mouth <b>312</b> each has a front section tapering in a sharp angle. The belly portion <b>11</b> smoothly transitions to the neck portion <b>12</b>, and the abdomen portion <b>311</b> smoothly transitions to the mouth <b>312</b>. The expression &#x201c;tapering in a sharp angle&#x201d; described herein may be understood as tapering to a tip to form a triangle, or may be understood as tapering to form a trapezoid or the like, as long as the neck portion <b>12</b> tapers in a direction away from the belly portion <b>11</b>. In this embodiment, the core <b>1</b> is in a shape of a teardrop, the core chamber <b>31</b> is teardrop-shaped accordingly, the strap <b>2</b> is extended beyond the tip of the teardrop, and the teardrop gets stuck after strap <b>2</b> is tensioned, resulting in simple structure, convenient installation, reliable connection.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the present embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an enlarged view at position I in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> are simplified in lines for clear illustration) where a force condition is shown. The neck portion <b>12</b> has two opposing side surfaces with an angle &#x3b1; of 10&#xb0; to 60&#xb0; formed therebetween. With the design of the angle &#x3b1;, when the strap <b>2</b> is subjected to a pulling force, the belly portion <b>11</b> of the core <b>1</b> gets stuck in the mouth <b>312</b> of the core chamber <b>31</b>. After the strap <b>2</b> is pre-tensioned, the two opposing side surfaces of the neck portion <b>12</b> of the core <b>1</b> press against inner surfaces of the mouth <b>312</b> of the core chamber <b>31</b>, and a friction on the strap <b>2</b> between the pulley <b>3</b> and the core <b>1</b> due to the pressing forces prevents the strap <b>2</b> from moving, thereby reducing a tension stress in a part of the strap <b>2</b> at the connector. Directions of the pressing forces of the mouth <b>1</b> to the neck portion <b>12</b> depend on the design of the angle &#x3b1; which is an included angle formed between the two opposing side surfaces of the neck portion <b>12</b> of the core <b>1</b>. In this way, miniaturization of the strap connector can be achieved for space saving. With a smaller space reserved for connection of the strap <b>2</b> and the pulley <b>3</b>, miniaturization of the corresponding transmission system or the corresponding structure is facilitated.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the present embodiment, the strap <b>2</b> has a section wrapping around the core <b>1</b>, the core <b>1</b> is sized smaller than the core chamber <b>31</b> in such a way that both the section of the strap <b>2</b> and the core <b>1</b> are received in the core chamber <b>31</b>. With the strap <b>2</b> wrapping around the core <b>1</b>, the upper and lower surfaces of the core <b>1</b> are covered by the strap <b>2</b>, and then both the core <b>1</b> and the strap <b>2</b> are received in the core chamber <b>31</b>. The strap <b>2</b> mainly suffers from tensile stress, and the tensile yield strength of strap <b>2</b> is far higher than the shear yield strength thereof, thereby improving bearing capacity of the strap <b>2</b>. The strap connector in this embodiment can have its force condition improved at the connection, the strap <b>2</b> is not easy to break and may slide slightly within the core chamber <b>31</b>, so that the internal stress of the strap <b>2</b> is fully released, and the service life of the strap <b>2</b> is further increased.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the present embodiment, the strap <b>2</b> is a steel strap, and the core <b>1</b> is fixed to the steel strap by at least one of welding, gluing and one-time molding of the steel strap through a die. In this way, the steel strap can be smoothly attached to the side surfaces of the core without clearances, and the manufacture and assembly of the strap connector are simple with no welding or slight welding being required, thereby avoiding or reducing stress or deformation of the strap connector caused by welding and thus improving reliability of the strap connector.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the second embodiment is a variant of the first embodiment, and is different from the first embodiment in structure of the core <b>1</b>. In this embodiment, the neck portion <b>12</b> of the core <b>1</b> has its middle hollowed to form a strap groove <b>121</b> configured to receive and fix the strap <b>2</b>. The core <b>1</b> is inserted into the pulley <b>3</b> as described in the first embodiment. When the strap <b>2</b> is subjected to a pulling force, the belly portion <b>11</b> of the core <b>1</b> gets stuck in the mouth <b>312</b> of the core chamber <b>31</b>. The neck portion <b>12</b> has two opposing side surfaces with an angle &#x3b1; formed therebetween (not indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, similar to the first embodiment, specifically an angle between two opposing external surfaces of the neck portion <b>12</b>), for example, of 10&#xb0; to 60&#xb0;. After the strap <b>2</b> is pre-tensioned, the two opposing side surfaces of the core <b>1</b> press against inner surfaces of the core chamber <b>31</b>, the pulley <b>3</b> compresses the neck portion <b>2</b> which in turn compresses the strap <b>2</b>, and a friction on the strap <b>2</b> due to the pressing forces prevent the strap <b>2</b> from moving, thereby reducing a tension stress in a part of the strap <b>2</b> at the connector. In this embodiment, the belly portion <b>11</b> and the neck portion <b>12</b> of the core <b>1</b> satisfy a corresponding dimensional relation, the neck portion <b>12</b> tapers in a direction away from the belly portion <b>11</b>, and the strap <b>2</b> is connected in the middle of the neck portion <b>12</b> of the core <b>1</b>. The strap <b>2</b> may be multi-layered utilizing multiple plies to increase the strength. For example, the strap <b>2</b> with two to four plies may be used and connected in the middle of the neck portion <b>12</b> of the core <b>1</b>, which is not limited herein. Other technical solutions and effects of this embodiment may be the same as or similar to those of the first embodiment, and will not be repeated herein.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, according to the embodiments of the present disclosure, a robotic arm is provided including serial links and a strap drive train mechanical transmission of serial links.
