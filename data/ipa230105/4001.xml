A HUD may have lower visibility upon receiving external light such as sunlight incident from outside the movable body. Known HUDs may be less susceptible to external light (refer to, for example, Patent Literature 1 and Patent Literature 2). For example, a HUD described in Patent Literature 1 includes, inside a combiner on which an image of a windshield is projected, an anti-reflective layer with the same size as the combiner. A HUD described in Patent Literature 2 includes, at the interior of a vehicle, a convex lens having an anti-reflective coating installed subsequent to a display device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The movable body may receive external light incident in various directions depending on the situation. The movable body may prevent external light incident in any direction and reflected off any component of the HUD from adversely affecting the field of view of the user.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">One or more aspects of the present disclosure are directed to a HUD that is less susceptible to reflected external light that may affect the field of view of a user, and also a movable body on which the HUD is mountable.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings.

The self-luminous display panel may be, for example, an organic EL display or an inorganic EL display. For the second display panel <b>11</b> being a self-luminous display panel, the display device <b>8</b> may not include the illuminator <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the second display panel <b>11</b> includes a planar active area A including multiple divisional areas.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the divisional areas are defined in u-direction and in v-direction orthogonal to u-direction. The direction orthogonal to u-direction and v-direction is referred to as w-direction. The u-direction may be referred to as a horizontal direction. The v-direction may be referred to as a vertical direction. The w-direction may be referred to as a depth direction. The u-direction is the direction corresponding to the parallax direction of the user <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each divisional area corresponds to a subpixel. Thus, the active area A includes multiple subpixels arranged in a lattice in u-direction and v-direction. Each subpixel has one of the colors red (R), green (G), and blue (B). One pixel may be a set of three subpixels with R, G, and B. One pixel may include four or any other number of subpixels, instead of three subpixels. One pixel may include subpixels with a combination of colors different from R, G, and B. A pixel may be referred to as a picture element. For example, multiple subpixels included in one pixel may be arranged in the horizontal direction. Multiple subpixels having the same color may be arranged, for example, in the vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The multiple subpixels arranged in the active area A form subpixel groups Pg under control by the controller <b>5</b>. Multiple subpixel groups Pg are arranged repeatedly in u-direction. Each subpixel group Pg may be aligned with or shifted from the corresponding subpixel group Pg in v-direction. For example, the subpixel groups Pg are repeatedly arranged in v-direction at positions shifted by one subpixel in u-direction from the corresponding subpixel group Pg in adjacent rows. The subpixel groups Pg each include multiple subpixels in predetermined rows and columns.

The subpixels P<b>1</b> to PN (N=2&#xd7;n&#xd7;b) included in each subpixel group Pg with the same identification reference signs are controlled by the controller <b>5</b> at the same time.
