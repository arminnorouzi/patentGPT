id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present disclosure provides methods of administering chimeric and hybrid Factor VIII (FVIII) polypeptides comprising FVIII and Fc to subjects at risk of developing inhibitory FVIII immune responses, including anti-FVIII antibodies and/or cell-mediated immunity. The administration is sufficient to promote coagulation and to induce immune tolerance to FVIII. The chimeric polypeptide can comprise full-length FVIII or a FVIII polypeptide containing a deletion, e.g., a full or partial deletion of the B domain.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure

The disease is characterized by spontaneous hemorrhage and excessive bleeding after trauma. Over time, the repeated bleeding into muscles and joints, which often begins in early childhood, results in hemophilic arthropathy and irreversible joint damage. This damage is progressive and can lead to severely limited mobility of joints, muscle atrophy and chronic pain (Rodriguez-Merchan, E. C., <i>Semin. Thromb. Hemost. </i>29:87-96 (2003), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The A2 domain is necessary for the procoagulant activity of the FVIII molecule. Studies show that porcine FVIII has six-fold greater procoagulant activity than human FVIII (Lollar &#x26; Parker, <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>266:12481-12486 (1991)), and that the difference in coagulant activity between human and porcine FVIII appears to be based on a difference in amino acid sequence between one or more residues in the human and porcine A2 domains (Lollar, P., et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>267:23652-23657 (1992)), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Treatment of hemophilia A is by replacement therapy targeting restoration of FVIII activity to 1 to 5% of normal levels to prevent spontaneous bleeding (Mannucci, P. M., et al., <i>N. Engl. J. Med. </i>344:1773-1779 (2001), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). e.g.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Plasma-derived FVIII (pdFVIII) and recombinant human FVIII (rFVIII) products are utilized for treatment (on-demand therapy) and prevention (prophylaxis therapy) of bleeding episodes. rFVIII was developed to reduce the risk of blood-borne pathogen transmission following the widespread contamination of plasma products with HIV and hepatitis viruses, and to secure an adequate supply of FVIII product. However, hemostatic protection with current FVIII products is temporally limited due to a short half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of approximately 8-12 hours, requiring prophylactic injections three times per week or every other day for most patients in order to maintain FVIII levels above 1%, a level that has been established as protective against most spontaneous bleeding episodes. Manco-Johnson et al., <i>New Engl J Med. </i>357(6):535-44 (2007).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Many studies have shown that, even at high doses, on-demand therapy is not effective in preventing arthropathy. Aledort L. et al., <i>J Intern Med. </i>236:391-399 (1994); Petrini P. et al., <i>Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol.</i>13:280-287 (1991). The benefits of prophylactic therapy have been demonstrated in numerous clinical studies. Aznar J. et al., <i>Haemophilia </i>6(3):170-176 (2000), Feldman B. et al., <i>J Thromb Haemost. </i>4:1228-1236 (2006), Kreuz W. et al., <i>Haemophilia </i>4:413-417 (1998), Liesner R. et al., <i>B J Haem. </i>92:973-978 (1996), Ljung R., <i>Haemophilia. </i>4(4):409-412 (1998), L&#xf6;fquist T, et al., <i>J Intern Med </i>241:395-400 (1997), Nilsson I, et al., <i>B. J Int Med </i>232:25-32 (1992), Risebrough N. et al., <i>Haemophilia. </i>14:743-752 (2008), Van Den Berg H. et al., <i>Haemophilia </i>9 (Suppl. 1):27-31 (2003), Van Den Berg H. et al., <i>Haematologica </i>89(6):645-650 (2004) and Manco-Johnson et al., supra, established that children started on primary prophylaxis after their first joint bleed had significantly fewer bleeds and less joint damage than children treated on-demand.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Compared to on-demand treatment, prophylactic therapy also decreases disability, hospitalization rate, and time lost from school or work; Aznar J. et al., <i>Haemophilia </i>6(3):170-176 (2000), Molho P. et al., <i>Haemophilia </i>6(1):23-32 (2000) and improves quality of life for patients and their families. Coppola A. et al., <i>Blood Transfus. </i>6(2): 4-11 (2008). However, prophylactic therapy often requires use of central venous access devices in children, and their attendant risks of infection, sepsis, and thrombosis. In addition, despite the benefits, acceptance of and compliance with prophylaxis decreases with age, in part because of inconvenience and invasiveness. Geraghty S. et al., <i>Haemophilia </i>12:75-81 (2006), Hacker M. et al., <i>Haemophilia </i>7(4):392-396 (2001). Thus, an rFVIII product with a prolonged plasma t<sub>1/2 </sub>would potentially be of benefit. Lillicrap D., <i>Current Opinion in Hematology </i>17:393-397 (2010).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Reduced mortality, prevention of joint damage, and improved quality of life have been important achievements due to the development of pdFVIII and rFVIII. Prolonged protection from bleeding would represent another key advancement in the treatment of hemophilia A patients. However, to date, no products that allow for prolonged hemostatic protection have been developed. Therefore, there remains a need for improved methods of treating hemophilia due to FVIII deficiency that are more tolerable, longer lasting, and more effective than current therapies.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, 15-30% of previously untreated patients develop neutralizing anti-FVIII antibodies (inhibitors) after transfusion with FVIII products. Various techniques for avoiding such immune responses have been considered. These techniques include high-dose tolerance protocols, use of peptide decoys mimicking the anti-FVIII antibody, bypassing immune recognition with human/porcine FVIII hybrid molecules, neutralizing FVIII-reactive CD4 T-cells with anticlonotypic antibodies, using universal CD4 epitopes, and blocking costimulation of CTLA-4-Ig or anti-CD40L. See, e.g., Lei et al., <i>Transfusion Medicine </i>105: 4865-4870 (2005). Presentation of FVIII by immune cells in order to induce tolerance has also been studied. For example, Lei et al. found that presentation of FVIII domains on an Ig backbone in B cells prevented or decreased antibodies. Id. In addition, Qadura et al. found that tolerogenic presentation of FVIII using immature dendritic cells may reduce immunogenicity. <i>Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostatis </i>6: 2095-2104 (2008). However, such methods are costly, complicated (e.g., by requiring co-administration of other therapeutics in combination with FVIII or administration of whole cells instead of relatively simple proteins), likely to result in unwanted side-effects, and/or inefficient. Accordingly, there remains a need for simple methods of treating hemophilia due to FVIII deficiency that are effective in patients that develop inhibitory responses.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure provides methods of administering Factor VIII (FVIII) that improve immune tolerance. The methods comprise administering a chimeric polypeptide comprising a FVIII portion and an Fc portion (rFVIIIFc) to a subject at risk of developing an inhibitory FVIII immune response. In some embodiments, the subject would develop an inhibitory immune response if administered an equivalent dose of a polypeptide consisting of the FVIII portion. In some embodiments, the subject has developed an inhibitory immune response or an inhibitory FVIII immune response. The administration of a chimeric polypeptide comprising a FVIII portion and an Fc portion can be sufficient to treat a bleeding condition and to induce immune tolerance to FVIII. The administration can be prophylactic. In some embodiments, the administration decreases the incidence of spontaneous bleeding or prevents bleeding.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The immune response can comprise inhibitory anti-FVIII antibodies. The antibody titer is at least 0.6 Bethesda Units (BU), at least 1.0 BU, or at least 5.0 BU. The immune response can also comprise a cell-mediated immune response, for example, the release of a cytokine. The cytokine can be IL-12, IL-4, or TNF-&#x3b1;, for example. The immune response can also result in clinical symptoms such as increased bleeding tendency, high FVIII consumption, lack of response to FVIII therapy, decreased efficacy of FVIII therapy, and/or shortened half-life of FVIII.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Subjects at risk of developing an inhibitory immune response include those with a mutation, deletion, or rearrangement in a FVIII gene. In some embodiments, the subject does not produce a FVIII protein. In some embodiments, the subject has severe hemophilia. In some embodiments, the subject has a relative (e.g., a parent, cousin, aunt, uncle, grandparent, child, or grandchild) that has developed an inhibitory immune response to FVIII or another therapeutic protein. In some embodiments, the subject is concurrently or was previously receiving a therapy that increases immune function when the FVIII is administered. In some embodiments the subject is receiving interferon therapy or anti-viral therapy in combination with FVIII. In some embodiments, the subject at risk of developing an inhibitory immune response has a genetic polymorphism associated with an increased cytokine level, such as increased TNF-&#x3b1; or increased IL10. In some embodiments, the subject at risk of developing an inhibitory immune response has a TNF-&#x3b1;-308G&#x3e;A polymorphism or allele 134 of the IL10G microsatellite.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the subject at risk for developing an inhibitory FVIII immune response has not been previously exposed to FVIII. In some embodiments, the subject at risk for developing an inhibitory FVIII immune response has been exposed to FVIII.

In some embodiments, the subject at risk for developing an inhibitory FVIII immune response has previously developed an immune response to FVIII (pdFVIII or rFVIII) or another therapeutic protein. In some embodiments, the subject at risk for developing an inhibitory FVIII immune response has previously developed an immune response to a FVIII product such as ADVATE&#xae;, RECOMBINATE&#xae;, KOGENATE FS&#xae;, HELIXATE FS&#xae;, XYNTHA&#xae;/REFACTO AB&#xae;, HEMOFIL-M&#xae;, MONARC-M&#xae;, MONOCLATE-P&#xae;, HUMATE-P&#xae;, ALPHANATE&#xae;, KOATE-DVI&#xae;, or HYATE:C&#xae;.

In some embodiments, the administration reduces the number of anti-FVIII antibodies in the subject, the titer of anti-FVIII antibodies in the subject and/or the level of a cytokine (e.g., IL-12, IL-4, or TNF) in the subject compared to the number, titer, or level prior to administration. In some embodiments, the administration reduces the number of anti-FVIII antibodies in the subject, the titer of anti-FVIII antibodies in the subject and/or the level of a cytokine (e.g., IL-12, IL-4, or a TNF) in the subject compared to the number, titer, or level that resulted from a previous treatment with a polypeptide consisting of a FVIII polypeptide. In some embodiments, the administration reduces the number of anti-FVIII antibodies in the subject, the titer of anti-FVIII antibodies in the subject and/or the level of a cytokine (e.g., IL-12, IL-4, or TNF) in the subject compared to the number, titer, or level that would result from administration of polypeptide consisting of a FVIII polypeptide to the subject.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The methods comprise administration of a chimeric polypeptide comprising a FVIII portion and an Fc portion. The FVIII portion can be human FVIII, full-length FVIII, or FVIII containing a full or partial deletion of the B domain.

The present disclosure also provides methods of inducing immune tolerance to FVIII. The present disclosure also provides improved FVIII chimeric polypeptides and methods of production.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The methods of inducing immune tolerance and production of improved chimeric polypeptides disclosed herein are also generally applicable to one or more clotting factors, e.g., FVII and FIX. Accordingly, the present disclosures regarding FVIII chimeric polypeptides (e.g., FVIIIFc) and their uses, are equally applicable to other chimeric polypeptides comprising a clotting factor portion and an Fc portion. In some specific examples, the clotting factor portion of the chimeric polypeptide is FVII or FIX. In this respect, the present disclosure provides in general a method of inducing immune tolerance to a clotting factor in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject a chimeric polypeptide comprises a clotting factor portion and an Fc portion. Also provided is a method of preventing or inhibiting development of an inhibitor to a clotting factor comprising administering to a subject in need of immune tolerance to the clotting factor a chimeric polypeptide, wherein the chimeric polypeptide comprises a clotting factor portion and an Fc portion.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Treatment of hemophilia A is by replacement therapy targeting restoration of FVIII activity to 1 to 5% of normal levels to prevent spontaneous bleeding (Mannucci, P. M. et al., <i>N Engl. J Med. </i>344:1773-9 (2001), herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). There are plasma-derived and recombinant FVIII products available to treat bleeding episodes on-demand or to prevent bleeding episodes from occurring by treating prophylactically. Based on the short half-life of these products (8-12 hours) (White G. C., et al., <i>Thromb. Haemost. </i>77:660-7 (1997); Morfini, M., Haemophilia 9 (suppl 1):94-99; discussion 100 (2003)), treatment regimens require frequent intravenous administration, commonly two to three times weekly for prophylaxis and one to three times daily for on-demand treatment (Manco-Johnson, M. J., et al., <i>N Engl. J. Med. </i>357:535-544 (2007)), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Such frequent administration is painful and inconvenient. Another major challenge associated with currently available FVIII products is the development of neutralizing anti-FVIII antibodies in patients receiving FVIII therapies. Inhibitory FVIII immune responses can comprise anti-Factor VIII antibodies and/or cell-mediated immune responses.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The present disclosure provides a method of administering FVIII to a human subject in need thereof (e.g., human patient) that is at risk of developing an inhibitory FVIII immune response. The method comprises administration of a chimeric polypeptide comprising a FVIII portion and an Fc portion.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In some embodiments, the administration of the chimeric polypeptide reduces the number of antibodies to FVIII in the subject compared to the number prior to administration. In some embodiments, the chimeric polypeptide is administered to a subject with an inhibitory FVIII immune response, and the administration can reduce the inhibitory immune response. The inhibitory FVIII immune response can be an inhibitory antibody immune response and/or a cell-mediated immune response. Administration of a chimeric polypeptide according to the methods provided herein can decrease or neutralize the inhibitory immune response. Thus, in some embodiments, anti-FVIII antibodies are decreased or eliminated in a subject after administration of a chimeric polypeptide comprising a FVIII portion and an Fc portion. The decrease can be, for example, a 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% reduction.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In some embodiments, the administration of the chimeric polypeptide reduces the titer of antibodies to FVIII in the subject compared to the titer prior to administration. In some embodiments, the titer of anti-FVIII antibodies is decreased in a subject after administration of a chimeric polypeptide comprising a FVIII portion and an Fc portion. Accordingly, administration of a chimeric polypeptide comprising a FVIII portion and an Fc portion can reduce inhibitors to less than 20, less than 10, less than 5, less than 4, less than 3, less than 2, less than 1, or less than 0.6 Bethesda Units (BU).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In some embodiments, the administration of the chimeric polypeptide reduces the level of a cytokine in the subject compared to the level prior to administration. In some embodiments, cytokine levels are decreased in a subject after administration of a chimeric polypeptide comprising a FVIII portion and an Fc portion. The cytokine can be, for example, Il-12, IL-4, and/or TNF-&#x3b1;. The decrease can be, for example, a 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% reduction.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some embodiments, the chimeric polypeptide is administered to a subject that previously developed an inhibitory FVIII immune response. Administration of a chimeric polypeptide to such subjects, according to the methods provided herein, can result in a decreased immune response compared to the previous response. Thus, in some embodiments, fewer anti-FVIII antibodies are produced in a subject after administration of a chimeric polypeptide according to the present methods than were produced after administration of a polypeptide consisting of a FVIII polypeptide. In some embodiments, the administration of the chimeric polypeptide reduces the number of antibodies to FVIII in the subject compared to the number in the subject after a previous treatment with a polypeptide consisting of a FVIII polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some embodiments, the administration of the chimeric polypeptide reduces the titer of antibodies to FVIII in the subject compared to the titer in the subject after a previous treatment with a polypeptide consisting of a FVIII polypeptide. In some embodiments, the titer of anti-FVIII antibodies is lower in a subject after administration of a chimeric polypeptide comprising a FVIII portion and an Fc portion than was produced after administration of a polypeptide consisting of a FVIII polypeptide. In some embodiments, the administration of the chimeric polypeptide reduces the level of a cytokine in the subject compared to the level in the subject after a previous treatment with a polypeptide consisting of a FVIII polypeptide. In some embodiments, cytokine levels (e.g., IL-12, IL-4, and/or TNF-&#x3b1;) are lower in a subject after administration of a chimeric polypeptide comprising a FVIII portion and an Fc portion than the levels after administration of a polypeptide consisting of a FVIII polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some embodiments, the administration of the chimeric polypeptide reduces the number of anti-clotting factor antibodies in the subject compared to the number that would result from administration of a polypeptide consisting of the clotting factor portion or a polypeptide comprising the clotting factor portion, but not comprising the Fc portion to the subject. In some embodiments, the chimeric polypeptide is administered to a subject that has not previously developed an inhibitory FVIII immune response. Administration of a chimeric polypeptide to such subjects, according to the methods provided herein, can result in a lower immune response than would result from administration of a polypeptide consisting of a FVIII polypeptide. Thus, in some embodiments, fewer anti-FVIII antibodies are produced in a subject after administration of a chimeric polypeptide according to the present methods than would be produced by administration of a polypeptide consisting of a FVIII polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some embodiments, the administration of the chimeric polypeptide reduces the titer of anti-clotting factor antibodies in the subject compared to the titer that would result from administration of a polypeptide consisting of the clotting factor portion or a polypeptide comprising the clotting factor portion, but not comprising the Fc portion to the subject. In some embodiments, the titer of anti-FVIII antibodies is lower in a subject after administration of a chimeric polypeptide comprising a FVIII portion and an Fc portion than would be produced by administration of a polypeptide consisting of a FVIII polypeptide. In some embodiments, the administration of the chimeric polypeptide reduces the level of a cytokine (e.g., IL-12, IL-4, and/or TNF-&#x3b1;) in the subject compared to the level that would result from administration of a polypeptide consisting of the clotting factor portion or a polypeptide comprising the clotting factor portion, but not comprising the Fc portion to the subject. In some embodiments, cytokine levels (e.g., IL-12, IL-4, and/or TNF-&#x3b1;) are lower in a subject after administration of a chimeric polypeptide comprising a FVIII portion and an Fc portion than they would be after administration of a polypeptide consisting of a FVIII polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The methods of the present disclosure can further comprise, prior to administration of the chimeric polypeptide, identifying that the subject has one or more characteristics selected from the group consisting of: (a) has a mutation or deletion in the gene encoding the clotting factor; (b) has a rearrangement in the gene encoding the clotting factor; (c) has a relative who has previously developed an inhibitory immune response against the clotting factor; (d) is receiving interferon therapy; (e) is receiving anti-viral therapy; (0 has a genetic mutation in a gene other than the gene encoding the clotting factor which is linked with an increased risk of developing an inhibitory immune response; and, (g) has two or more combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the subject has a genetic mutation in a gene other than the gene encoding the clotting factor comprises one or more mutation selected from the group consisting of: (i) a genetic polymorphism associated with increased TNF-&#x3b1;; (ii) a genetic polymorphism associated with increased IL10; (iii) a genetic polymorphism associated with decreased CTLA-4; (iv) a mutation in DR15 or DQB0602 MHC Class II molecules; and, (v) two or more combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the polymorphism is associated with increased TNF-&#x3b1; is 308G&#x3e;A.

The dosing interval can be at least about one and one-half, two, two and one-half, three, three and one-half, four, four and one-half, five, five and one-half or six times longer than the dosing interval required for an equivalent dose of said FVIII without the non-FVIII portion (a polypeptide consisting of said FVIII portion), e.g., without the Fc portion.

Factor VII (FVII, F7; also referred to as Factor 7, coagulation factor VII, serum factor VII, serum prothrombin conversion accelerator, SPCA, proconvertin and eptacog alpha) is a serine protease that is part of the coagulation cascade. FVII includes a Gla domain, two EGF domains (EGF-1 and EGF-2), and a serine protease domain (or peptidase S1 domain) that is highly conserved among all members of the peptidase Si family of serine proteases, such as for example with chymotrypsin. FVII occurs as a single chain zymogen, an activated zymogen-like two-chain polypeptide and a fully activated two-chain form. As used herein, a &#x201c;zymogen-like&#x201d; protein or polypeptide refers to a protein that has been activated by proteolytic cleavage, but still exhibits properties that are associated with a zymogen, such as, for example, low or no activity, or a conformation that resembles the conformation of the zymogen form of the protein. For example, when it is not bound to tissue factor, the two-chain activated form of FVII is a zymogen-like protein; it retains a conformation similar to the uncleaved FVII zymogen, and, thus, exhibits very low activity. Upon binding to tissue factor, the two-chain activated form of FVII undergoes conformational change and acquires its full activity as a coagulation factor. Exemplary FVII variants include those with increased specific activity, e.g., mutations that increase the activity of FVII by increasing its enzymatic activity (Kcat or Km). Such variants have been described in the art and include, e.g., mutant forms of the molecule as described for example in Persson et al. 2001. PNAS 98:13583; Petrovan and Ruf 2001. J. Biol. Chem. 276:6616; Persson et al. 2001 J. Biol. Chem. 276:29195; Soejima et al. 2001. J. Biol. Chem. 276:17229; Soejima et al. 2002. J. Biol. Chem. 247:49027. In one embodiment, a variant form of FVII includes the mutations. Exemplary mutations include V158D-E296V-M298Q. In another embodiment, a variant form of FVII includes a replacement of amino acids 608-619 (LQQSRKVGDSPN, corresponding to the 170-loop) from the FVII mature sequence with amino acids EASYPGK from the 170-loop of trypsin. High specific activity variants of FIX are also known in the art. For example, Simioni et al. (2009 N.E. Journal of Medicine 361:1671) describe an R338L mutation. Chang et al. (1988 JBC 273:12089) and Pierri et al. (2009 Human Gene Therapy 20:479) describe an R338A mutation. Other mutations are known in the art and include those described, e.g., in Zogg and Brandstetter. 2009 Structure 17:1669; Sichler et al. 2003. J. Biol. Chem. 278:4121; and Sturzebecher et al. 1997. FEBS Lett 412:295. The contents of these references are incorporated herein by reference. Full activation, which occurs upon conformational change from a zymogen-like form, occurs upon binding to is co-factor tissue factor. Also, mutations can be introduced that result in the conformation change in the absence of tissue factor. Hence, reference to FVIIa includes a zymogen-like form, a fully activated two-chain form, or an activatable form. An &#x201c;activatable Factor VII&#x201d; is Factor VII in an inactive form (e.g., in its zymogen form) that is capable of being converted to an active form.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">In some embodiments, the clotting factor is a mature form of Factor IX or a variant thereof. Factor IX circulates as a 415 amino acid, single chain plasma zymogen (A. Vysotchin et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268, 8436 (1993)). The zymogen of FIX is activated by FXIa or by the tissue factor/FVIIa complex. Specific cleavages between arginine-alanine 145-146 and arginine-valine 180-181 result in a light chain and a heavy chain linked by a single disulfide bond between cysteine 132 and cysteine 289 (S. Bajaj et al., Biochemistry 22, 4047 (1983)).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">The structural organization of FIX is similar to that of the vitamin K-dependent blood clotting proteins FVII, FX and protein C (B. Furie and B. Furie, supra). The approximately 45 amino acids of the amino terminus comprise the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, or Gla, domain. This is followed by two epidermal growth factor homology domains (EGF), an activation peptide and the catalytic &#x201c;heavy chain&#x201d; which is a member of the serine protease family (A. Vysotchin et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268, 8436 (1993); S. Spitzer et al., Biochemical Journal 265, 219 (1990); H. Brandstetter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 92, 9796 (1995)).</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">&#x201c;Equivalent dose,&#x201d; as used herein, means the same dose of FVIII activity as expressed in International Units, which is independent of molecular weight of the polypeptide in question. One International Unit (IU) of FVIII activity corresponds approximately to the quantity of FVIII in one milliliter of normal human plasma. Several assays are available for measuring FVIII activity, including the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic substrate assay and a one stage clotting assay.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">&#x201c;Fc,&#x201d; as used herein, means functional neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binding partners, unless otherwise specified. An FcRn binding partner is any molecule that can be specifically bound by the FcRn receptor with consequent active transport by the FcRn receptor of the FcRn binding partner. Thus, the term Fc includes any variants of IgG Fc that are functional. The region of the Fc portion of IgG that binds to the FcRn receptor has been described based on X-ray crystallography (Burmeister et al., <i>Nature </i>372:379 (1994), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).

Additionally, combinations of two, three, or more of these individual mutations can be introduced together, giving rise to hundreds more FcRn binding partners. Certain of these mutations can confer new functionality upon the FcRn binding partner. For example, one embodiment incorporates N297A, removing a highly conserved N-glycosylation site. The effect of this mutation is to reduce immunogenicity, thereby enhancing circulating half-life of the FcRn binding partner, and to render the FcRn binding partner incapable of binding to FcyRI, FcyRIIA, FcyRIIB, and FcyRIIIA, without compromising affinity for FcRn (Routledge et al. 1995, Transplantation 60:847, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; Friend et al. 1999, Transplantation 68:1632, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; Shields et al. 1995, J.

Therefore, another example of new functionality and potential decreased immunogenicity can arise from mutations of this region, as for example by replacing amino acids 233-236 of human IgG1 &#x201c;ELLG&#x201d; to the corresponding sequence from IgG2 &#x201c;PVA&#x201d; (with one amino acid deletion). It has been shown that Fc&#x3b3;R1, Fc&#x3b3;RII, and Fc&#x3b3;RIII which mediate various effector functions will not bind to IgG1 when such mutations have been introduced (Ward and Ghetie, <i>Therapeutic Immunology </i>2:77 (1995), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; and Armour et al., <i>Eur. J. Immunol. </i>29:2613 (1999), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). As a further example of new functionality arising from mutations described above affinity for FcRn can be increased beyond that of wild type in some instances.

To obtain this hybrid, the coding sequence of human recombinant B-domain deleted FVIII was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from human liver poly A RNA (Clontech) using FVIII-specific primers. The FVIII sequence includes the native signal sequence for FVIII. The B-domain deletion was from serine 743 (S743; 2287 bp) to glutamine 1638 (Q1638; 4969 bp) for a total deletion of 2682 bp. Then, the coding sequence for human recombinant Fc was obtained by RT-PCR from a human leukocyte cDNA library (Clontech) using Fc specific primers. Primers were designed such that the B-domain deleted FVIII sequence was fused directly to the N-terminus of the Fc sequence with no intervening linker. The FVIIIFc DNA sequence was cloned into the mammalian dual expression vector pBUDCE4.1 (Invitrogen) under control of the CMV promoter.

Stable clonal cell lines were generated by selection with Zeocin (Invitrogen). One clonal cell line, 3C4-22 was used to generate FVIIIFc for characterization in vivo. Recombinant FVIIIFc was produced and purified (McCue et al. 2009) at Biogen Idec (Cambridge, Mass.). The transfection strategy described above was expected to yield three products, i.e., monomeric rFVIIIFc hybrids, dimeric rFVIIIFc hybrids and dimeric Fc. However, there was essentially no dimeric rFVIIIFc detected in the conditioned medium from these cells. Rather, the conditioned medium contained Fc and monomeric rFVIIIFc. It is possible that the size of dimeric rFVIIIFc was too great and prevented efficient secretion from the cell. This result was beneficial since it rendered the purification of the monomer less complicated than if all three proteins had been present.

The increased level can be sufficient to decrease the incidence of spontaneous bleeding or to prevent bleeding, e.g., in the event of an unforeseen injury.

Adjustments can be made when a subject experiences unacceptable bleeding episodes defined as &#x2265;2 spontaneous bleeding episodes over a rolling two-month period. In this case, adjustment will target trough levels of 3-5%. In another embodiment, prophylactic treatment results in prevention and control of bleeding, sustained control of bleeding, sustained protection from bleeding, and/or sustained benefit. Prophylaxis, e.g., sustained protection can be demonstrated by an increased AUC to last measured time point (AUC-LAST) and reduced clearance, resulting in increased terminal t1/2 compared to short acting FVIII.

In another embodiment, parameters used in a FASTDB alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity are: Matrix=Unitary, k-tuple=4, Mismatch Penalty=1, Joining Penalty=30, Randomization Group Length=0, Cutoff Score=1, Gap Penalty=5, Gap Size Penalty 0.05, Window Size=500 or the length of the subject nucleotide sequence, whichever is shorter.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0300">If the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence because of 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction must be made to the results.

For subject sequences truncated at the 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; ends, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of bases of the query sequence that are 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a nucleotide is matched/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment.

This corrected score is what is used for the purposes of the present disclosure. Only bases outside the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; bases of the subject sequence, as displayed by the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence, are calculated for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0301">For example, a 90 base subject sequence is aligned to a 100 base query sequence to determine percent identity.

The 10 unpaired bases represent 10% of the sequence (number of bases at the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends not matched/total number of bases in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 bases were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 base subject sequence is compared with a 100 base query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so that there are no bases on the 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected.

The 10 unpaired residues represent 10% of the sequence (number of residues at the N- and C- termini not matched/total number of residues in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N- or C-termini of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only residue positions outside the N- and C-terminal ends of the subject sequence, as displayed in the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are made for the purposes of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0306">The polynucleotide variants can contain alterations in the coding regions, non-coding regions, or both. In one embodiment, the polynucleotide variants contain alterations which produce silent substitutions, additions, or deletions, but do not alter the properties or activities of the encoded polypeptide. In another embodiment, nucleotide variants are produced by silent substitutions due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. In other embodiments, variants in which 5-10, 1-5, or 1-2 amino acids are substituted, deleted, or added in any combination. Polynucleotide variants can be produced for a variety of reasons, e.g., to optimize codon expression for a particular host (change codons in the human mRNA to others, e.g., a bacterial host such as <i>E. coli</i>).</p><p id="p-0285" num="0307">Naturally occurring variants are called &#x201c;allelic variants,&#x201d; and refer to one of several alternate forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome of an organism (Genes II, Lewin, B., ed., John Wiley &#x26; Sons, New York (1985)). These allelic variants can vary at either the polynucleotide and/or polypeptide level and are included in the present disclosure. Alternatively, non-naturally occurring variants can be produced by mutagenesis techniques or by direct synthesis.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0308">Using known methods of protein engineering and recombinant DNA technology, variants can be generated to improve or alter the characteristics of the polypeptides. For instance, one or more amino acids can be deleted from the N-terminus or C-terminus of the secreted protein without substantial loss of biological function. Ron et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>268: 2984-2988 (1993), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, reported variant KGF proteins having heparin binding activity even after deleting 3, 8, or 27 amino-terminal amino acid residues. Similarly, Interferon gamma exhibited up to ten times higher activity after deleting 8-10 amino acid residues from the carboxy terminus of this protein. (Dobeli et al., <i>J. Biotechnology </i>7:199-216 (1988), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.)</p><p id="p-0287" num="0309">Moreover, ample evidence demonstrates that variants often retain a biological activity similar to that of the naturally occurring protein. For example, Gayle and coworkers (<i>J. Biol. Chem </i>268:22105-22111 (1993), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) conducted extensive mutational analysis of human cytokine IL-1a. They used random mutagenesis to generate over 3,500 individual IL-1a mutants that averaged 2.5 amino acid changes per variant over the entire length of the molecule. Multiple mutations were examined at every possible amino acid position. The investigators found that &#x201c;[m]ost of the molecule could be altered with little effect on either [binding or biological activity].&#x201d; (See Abstract.) In fact, only 23 unique amino acid sequences, out of more than 3,500 nucleotide sequences examined, produced a protein that significantly differed in activity from wild-type.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0310">As stated above, polypeptide variants include, e.g., modified polypeptides. Modifications include, e.g., acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, pegylation (Mei et al., <i>Blood </i>116:270-79 (2010), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination. In some embodiments, FVIII is modified, e.g., pegylated, at any convenient location. In some embodiments, FVIII is pegylated at a surface exposed amino acid of FVIII, e.g., a surface exposed cysteine, which can be an engineered cysteine. Id.

FVIII activity can be measured by any known methods in the art. For example, one of those methods can be a chromogenic assay. The chromogenic assay mechanism is based on the principles of the blood coagulation cascade, where activated FVIII accelerates the conversion of Factor X into Factor Xa in the presence of activated Factor IX, phospholipids and calcium ions. The Factor Xa activity is assessed by hydrolysis of a p-nitroanilide (pNA) substrate specific to Factor Xa. The initial rate of release of p-nitroaniline measured at 405 nM is directly proportional to the Factor Xa activity and thus to the FVIII activity in the sample.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0320">The chromogenic assay is recommended by the FVIII and Factor IX Subcommittee of the Scientific and Standardization Committee (SSC) of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostatsis (ISTH). Since 1994, the chromogenic assay has also been the reference method of the European Pharmacopoeia for the assignment of FVIII concentrate potency. Thus, in one embodiment, the chimeric polypeptide comprising single chain FVIII has FVIII activity comparable to a chimeric polypeptide comprising processed FVIII (e.g., a chimeric polypeptide consisting essentially of or consisting of two Fc portions and processed FVIII, wherein said processed FVIII is fused to one of the two Fc portions), when the FVIII activity is measured in vitro by a chromogenic assay.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0321">In another embodiment, the chimeric polypeptide comprising single chain FVIII of this disclosure has a Factor Xa generation rate comparable to a chimeric polypeptide comprising processed FVIII (e.g., a chimeric polypeptide consisting essentially of or consisting of two Fc portions and processed FVIII, wherein the processed FVIII is fused to one Fc of the two Fc portions).</p><p id="p-0300" num="0322">In order to activate Factor X to Factor Xa, activated Factor IX (Factor IXa) hydrolyzes one arginine-isoleucine bond in Factor X to form Factor Xa in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, membrane phospholipids, and a FVIII cofactor. Therefore, the interaction of FVIII with Factor IX is critical in coagulation pathway. In certain embodiments, the chimeric polypeptide comprising single chain FVIII can interact with Factor IXa at a rate comparable to a chimeric polypeptide comprising processed FVIII (e.g., a chimeric polypeptide consisting essentially of or consisting of two Fc portions and processed FVIII, wherein the processed FVIII is fused to one Fc of the two Fc portions).</p><p id="p-0301" num="0323">In addition, FVIII is bound to von Willebrand Factor while inactive in circulation. FVIII degrades rapidly when not bound to vWF and is released from vWF by the action of thrombin. In some embodiments, the chimeric polypeptide comprising single chain FVIII binds to von Willebrand Factor at a level comparable to a chimeric polypeptide comprising processed FVIII (e.g., a chimeric polypeptide consisting essentially of or consisting of two Fc portions and processed FVIII, wherein the processed FVIII is fused to one Fc of the two Fc portions).</p><p id="p-0302" num="0324">FVIII can be inactivated by activated protein C in the presence of calcium and phospholipids. Activated protein C cleaves FVIII heavy chain after Arginine 336 in the A1 domain, which disrupts a Factor X substrate interaction site, and cleaves after Arginine 562 in the A2 domain, which enhances the dissociation of the A2 domain as well as disrupts an interaction site with the Factor IXa. This cleavage also bisects the A2 domain (43 kDa) and generates A2-N (18 kDa) and A2-C (25 kDa) domains. Thus, activated protein C can catalyze multiple cleavage sites in the heavy chain. In one embodiment, the chimeric polypeptide comprising single chain FVIII is inactivated by activated Protein C at a level comparable to a chimeric polypeptide comprising processed FVIII (e.g., a chimeric polypeptide consisting essentially of or consisting of two Fc portions and processed FVIII, wherein the processed FVIII is fused to one Fc of the two Fc portions).</p><p id="p-0303" num="0325">In other embodiments, the chimeric polypeptide comprising single chain FVIII has FVIII activity in vivo comparable to a chimeric polypeptide comprising processed FVIII (e.g., a chimeric polypeptide consisting essentially of or consisting of two Fc portions and processed FVIII, wherein the processed FVIII is fused to one Fc of the two Fc portions).

The coding sequence of human FVIII (Genbank accession number NM_000132), including its native signal sequence, was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) from human liver polyA RNA. Due to the large size of FVIII, the coding sequence was obtained in several sections from separate RT-PCR reactions, and assembled through a series of PCR reactions, restriction digests and ligations into an intermediate cloning vector containing a B domain deleted (BDD) FVIII coding region with a fusion of serine 743 (S743) to glutamine 1638 (Q1638), eliminating 2682 bp from the B domain of full length FVIII. The human IgG1 Fc sequence (e.g., GenBank accession number Y14735) was obtained by PCR from a leukocyte cDNA library, and the final expression cassette was made in such a way that the BDD FVIII sequence was fused directly to the N-terminus of the Fc sequence (hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains, beginning at D221 of the IgG1 sequence, EU numbering) with no intervening linker. For expression of the Fc chain alone, the mouse Ig&#x3ba; (kappa) light chain signal sequence was created with synthetic oligonucleotides and added to the Fc coding sequence using PCR to enable secretion of this protein product.

Though cells transfected with the FVIIIFc/Fc dual expression plasmid were expected to secrete three products (FVIIIFc dimer, FVIIIFc monomer, and Fc dimer), only the FVIIIFc monomer and Fc dimer were detected in conditioned media. Purified FVIIIFc was analyzed by non-reducing and reducing SDS-PAGE analysis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and 2B). For the nonreduced SDS-PAGE, bands were found migrating at approximately 90 kDa and 130 kDa, consistent with the predicted molecular weights of the FVIIIFc heavy chain (HC) and light chain-dimeric Fc fusion (LCFc2) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, lane 3). A third band was also detected at approximately 220 kDa, consistent with the predicted molecular weight for single chain FVIIIFc (SC FVIIIFc; HC+LCFc2), in which the arginine residue at position 754 (1648 with respect to the full length sequence) is not cleaved during secretion. For the reduced SDS-PAGE analysis, major bands were seen migrating at approximately 25 kDa, 90 kDa, 105 kDa, and 195 kDa, consistent with the predicted molecular weights for the single chain Fc, HC, LCFc, and SC FVIIIFc (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, lane 3). Cotransfection with human PCS, a member of the proprotein convertase subtlisin/kexin (PCSK) type proteases, resulted in full processing of the rFVIIIFc product (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B</figref>, lane 2).</p><p id="p-0421" num="0479">Densitometry analysis of several batches of rFVIIIFc after SDS-PAGE indicated greater than 98% purity of the expected bands. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was also used to assess the degree of aggregation present, and all batches were found to have aggregate levels at 0.5% or less.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0480">rFVIIIFc structure was further analyzed by thrombin cleavage, reduction, and analysis by LC/UV and LC/MS. The four FVIII fragments generated by thrombin (by cleavages at three arginine residues, at positions 372, 740 and 795 (795 corresponds to 1689 with respect to the full length FVIII sequence), can be detected by UV absorbance (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>), corresponding to the following segments of the protein: Fc (peak 1), light-chain-Fc (peak 2); the A1 domain from the heavy chain (peak 3) and the A2 domain from the heavy chain (peak 4). The 14 amino acid B domain linker and &#x2dc;6 kDa a3-related peptides are not detected by UV absorbance due to their small size.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0481">The rFVIIIFc polypeptide produced without cotransfected processing enzymes exhibited 15-25% single chain FVIIIFc (SC FVIIIFc), which differs from processed rFVIIIFc by a single peptide bond between R754 and E755 (R1648/E1649 with respect to the full length FVIII). This isoform was purified and characterized in all of the biochemical assays described above, and found to be comparable to rFVIIIFc as shown below. The activity of purified single chain FVIIIFc was found to be similar to rFVIIIFc in a chromogenic assay as well as by the various functional assays described below.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0482">(b) Measurement of FVIII Activity by Chromogenic and One-Stage aPTT Assays</p><p id="p-0425" num="0483">FVIII activity was measured by a FVIII chromogenic assay. The average specific activity from four separate batches of rFVIIIFc was found to be 9762&#xb1;449 IU/mg by the chromogenic assay, corresponding to 2148&#xb1;99 IU/nmol. FVIII activity of single chain FVIII:Fc was also measured by the chromogenic assay and compared to the completely processed rFVIIIFc or rFVIIIFc DS (containing about 25% single chain rFVIIIFc). As TABLE 3A shows, single chain rFVIIIFc showed no significant difference in FVIII activity compared to the FVIII activity of completely processed FVIIIFc or rFVIIIFc DS by the chromogenic assay, both in the presence and the absence of von Willebrand Factor (VWF). TABLE 3B shows that full activity of SCrFVIIIFc, as measured by one-stage activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay, was observed in the absence of VWF.</p><p id="p-0426" num="0000"><tables

In order to confirm that the underlying mechanism for the extension of half-life was due to the protection of rFVIIIFc by FcRn, the PK were evaluated in FcRn knockout and human FcRn transgenic mice.</p><p id="p-0447" num="0499">A single intravenous dose (125 IU/kg) was administered and the plasma concentration measured using a chromogenic activity assay. The C<sub>max </sub>was similar between rFVIIIFc and rFVIII (XYNTHA&#xae;) in both mouse strains. However, while the half-life for rFVIIIFc was comparable to that of rFVIII in the FcRn knockout mice, the half-life for rFVIIIFc was extended to approximately twice longer than that for rFVIII in the hFcRn transgenic mice. These results confirmed that FcRn mediated or was responsible for the prolonged half-life of rFVIIIFc compared to rFVIII. Since hemostasis in whole blood measured by rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM&#xae;) has been shown to correlate with the efficacy of coagulation factors in bleeding models of hemophilia mice as well as in clinical applications, we sought to evaluate the ex vivo efficacy of rFVIIIFc in the hemophilia A mice using ROTEM&#xae;.</p><p id="p-0448" num="0500">Hemophilia A mice were administered a single intravenous dose of 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc, XYNTHA&#xae; (FVIII) or ADVATE&#xae; (FVIII).

Prior to secretion from HEK 293 cells, most of the rFVIIIFc is processed into a FVIII heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC+Fc). In circulation, rFVIIIFc is complexed with von Willebrand factor (VWF) and released upon activation in a manner that is indistinguishable from native FVIII. Spontaneous dissociation of the HC and LC is thought to contribute to the loss of FVIII activity in plasma and during storage of FVIII drug products.

However, as shown in TABLE 3B, full activity of SC rFVIIIFc by aPTT was observed in the absence of vWF, suggesting release from vWF can be delayed due to covalent linkage of the a3 acidic region to the HC after Arg 1680 cleavage in SC rFVIIIFc, in contrast to a3 release and dissociation from fully processed FVIII. Delayed dissociation from vWF can explain the reduced activity observed in the aPTT assay and TGA, while full activity was observed in the two-stage chromogenic assay. A reduced rate of activation in the presence of vWF was confirmed in a modified chromogenic substrate assay with limiting thrombin as FVIII activator.</p><p id="p-0506" num="0567">In vivo function of SC rFVIIIFc was assessed in the HemA mouse tail vein transection (TVT) model.

Genotypic identification was collected for seven subjects; inversion of intron 22 was reported in six subjects; and a frame-shift defect was reported in one subject. The genotype was unknown for nine subjects. Thirteen subjects had hepatitis C antibodies, four of whom were also positive for HIV.</p><p id="p-0528" num="0588">Safety: Forty-four treatment-emergent AEs were reported by 11 (69%) subjects during the treatment and follow-up periods. This included the day of dosing with ADVATE&#xae; or rFVIIIFc through a 28-day post-dosing observation period. The majority of events were considered mild and none led to withdrawal from the study. One event, dysgeusia, occurred transiently in one subject while receiving a 65 IU/kg dose of rFVIIIFc and was considered related to rFVIIIFc. One subject experienced an anxiety attack after receiving 65 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc which resulted in 21 AEs, 19 of which were graded as mild, and two of which (headache and photophobia) were rated as moderate. Neither was deemed related to rFVIIIFc by the Investigator. No serious bleeding episodes were reported. No evidence of allergic reactions to injection was detected. All plasma samples tested negative for FVIII inhibitors and anti-rFVIIIFc antibodies. No signs of injection site reactions were observed. No clinically meaningful changes in abnormal laboratory values were reported.</p><p id="p-0529" num="0589">Pharmacokinetics:</p><p id="p-0530" num="0590">Correlation Between aPTT and Chromogenic Activity for rFVIIIFc in Plasma: ADVATE&#xae; and rFVIIIFc activities were determined in the same assays using commercially available reagents and calibration against normal human plasma standards. There was a strong correlation between the results obtained by the one-stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay in samples that had an activity above the LLOQ. Correlation coefficients (Pearson R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.94 and 0.95 were observed between the two assay results for 151 samples following ADVATE&#xae; dosing and 185 samples following rFVIIIFc dosing, respectively. Compared to the aPTT results, the chromogenic FVIII activities were, on average, 21% higher for ADVATE&#xae; and 32% higher for rFVIIIFc, not statistically significant (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). This observation led to a slightly higher estimation of exposure parameters by the chromogenic assessment for both drugs. The apparent higher FVIII recoveries by the chromogenic assay are typical for recombinant FVIII products tested in clinical assays, and are in agreement with most other marketed FVIII products.

In subjects who received 25 or 65 IU/kg of ADVATE&#xae; followed by an equal dose of rFVIIIFc, the plasma FVIII activity rose sharply and reached C<sub>max </sub>within the first hour following dosing.

Traditional dimeric Fc fusions, created through the fusion of the monomeric effector protein to a monomer of Fc and then coupled through a disulfide bond to create a dimer, were not effective for large coagulation proteins such as FVIII. Thus, we have developed methods to create novel Fc fusion protein constructs in which a single (monomeric) effector molecule is attached to Fc (Dumont J. A., et al., <i>BioDrugs </i>20(3):151-60 (2006)), (Dumont J.

In comparison to vehicle-treated mice (n=18) that had a median blood loss of 1 mL, both rFVIIIFc and rFVIII treatments resulted in significantly improved protection (P&#x3c;0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn post-test) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). The median blood loss progressively decreased with increasing doses, reaching maximum reduction to 0.23 mL at 72 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc, and 0.20 mL at 216 IU/kg of rFVIII. Overall, the blood loss was comparable in animals treated with equal doses of rFVIIIFc or rFVIII, indicating that both therapeutics are comparably active in resolving acute arterial bleeds.</p><p id="p-0569" num="0624">Prolonged prophylactic efficacy of rFVIIIFc in HemA mice: To determine if prolonged PK lead to prolonged protection from injury, we compared the prophylactic efficacy of rFVIIIFc and rFVIII in HemA mice. Twenty-four hours after an intravenous dose of 12 IU/kg, one lateral tail vein in HemA mice was transected. Following injury, 49% of rFVIII-treated mice (n=39) survived, compared with 100% survival of rFVIIIFc-treated mice (n=19) (P&#x3c;0.001, Log-Rank test) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref>). To further demonstrate that rFVIIIFc sustains a longer duration of efficacy, HemA mice were injured 48 hours post-dosing with 12 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc. Nevertheless, 58% of rFVIIIFc-treated mice (n=40) survived, which is similar to that achieved in rFVIII-treated mice (49%) injured at 24 hours post dosing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref>). Both rFVIIIFc and rFVIII treatments are significantly better than the HemA vehicle-control group (n=30) in which only 3% of mice survived the injury (P&#x3c;0.0001) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref>). The improved and prolonged prophylactic efficacy of rFVIIIFc is also evident by the measurement of rebleeding post injury (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref>). Whereas 100% of vehicle-treated HemA mice rebled within 10 hours following tail vein transection, 87% of rFVIII-treated and 47% of rFVIIIFc-treated mice rebled after the injury inflicted at 24 hours post dosing, respectively (P=0.002, rFVIIIFc vs rFVIII) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref>). The rebleed profile for rFVIIIFc-treated mice injured at 48 hours is largely comparable to that for rFVIII-treated mice injured at 24 hours post dosing. In contrast, both the survival and rebleed profile for rFVIII-treated mice injured at 48 hours are indistinguishable from the profile for the vehicle-control group (data not shown). Therefore, the results indicate that rFVIIIFc protects HemA mice from tail vein injury twice as long as that achieved by the same dose of rFVIII.</p><p id="p-0570" num="0625">Improved PK/PD of rFVIIIFc in Hemophilia A dogs: The PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of rFVIIIFc were also studied in hemophilia A dogs. Following an intravenous dose of 125 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc, the WBCT was immediately corrected to normal, which is in the range of 8-12 minutes in normal dogs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A</figref> and B). The WBCT remained below 20 min, indicating FVIII activity &#x3e;1%, through approximately 4 days in 3 out of 4 rFVIIIFc-treated dogs and 3 days in the remaining dog (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>). In dog M12 treated with 114 IU/kg of rFVIII and dog M38 with 120 IU/kg of rFVIII, the WBCT was also corrected to normal immediately after dosing. However, the WBCT remained below 20 minutes for 2 days in M12 and 3 days in M38, approximately 1.5-2-fold shorter than that achieved by rFVIIIFc (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>). Furthermore, both rFVIIIFc and rFVIII treatment also improved aPTT clotting time similarly at 5 minutes post dosing.</p><p id="p-0571" num="0626">The PK of rFVIIIFc antigen (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>) was determined by measuring the concentration of rFVIIIFc in plasma with a rFVIIIFc-specific ELISA that detects both the FVIII and Fc portions of the molecule.

After dosing with either rFVIIIFc or rFVIII, platelet numbers and plasma fibrinogen concentration did not change from pre-dose values (data not shown).</p><heading id="h-0044" level="2">Discussion</heading><p id="p-0575" num="0629">These studies have shown rFVIIIFc to be fully active in treating acute bleeds in HemA mice, in addition to retaining normal specific activity. Other studies, not reported here, have shown that rFVIIIFc is also fully functional in interacting with FIXa, FX, and phospholipids in forming the Xase complex (Peters et al., <i>J. Thromb Haemost</i>. DOI: 10.1111/jth.12076 (2012)). Furthermore, the binding affinity to von Willebrand Factor (VWF) was comparable between rFVIIIFc and rFVIII, with a Kd of approximately 1.4 and 0.8 nM for rFVIIIFc and rFVIII, respectively (Peters et al., <i>J. Thromb Haemost</i>. DOI: 10.1111/jth.12076 (2012)).</p><p id="p-0576" num="0630">The activity of rFVIIIFc was not affected by fusion of the C-terminus of FVIII with the N-terminus of Fc since the C1 and C2 domains of FVIII were involved in phospholipid binding which is essential for the formation of prothrombinase complex on activated platelet surfaces (Foster, P. A., et al., <i>Blood. </i>75(10):1999-2004 (1990)). However, this finding was consistent with the observation that residues thought to bind phospholipids, e.g., K2092/F2093 in C1, M2199/F2200 and L2251/L2252 in C2, all appear to form a surface that is distant from the C-terminal residues of FVIII (Shen, B. W., et al., <i>Blood</i>. (2007); Ngo, J. C., et al., <i>Structure. </i>16(4): 597-606 (2008)).</p><p id="p-0577" num="0631">The half-life of rFVIIIFc was doubled only in mice expressing either endogenous murine or transgenic human FcRn, but not in FcRn KO mice (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> and TABLE 12), demonstrating that the mechanism of prolonging half-life of rFVIIIFc is mediated by FcRn. While it is known that both endothelial and hematopoietic cells contribute equally in recycling internalized IgG to the cell surface to facilitate the longevity of IgG and protection from degradation, (Borvak, J., et al., <i>Int Immunol. </i>10(9):1289-1298 (1998)), (Akilesh, S., et al., <i>J Immunol. </i>179(7):4580-4588 (2007)) it is not known specifically which FcRn-expressing cell type(s) are responsible for the uptake and recycling of rFVIIIFc. FcRn is broadly expressed in the vascular endothelium, epithelium of kidney, liver, spleen, as well as in bone marrow-derived APCs including macrophages (Borvak, J., et al., <i>Int Immunol. </i>10(9):1289-1298 (1998)), (Akilesh, S., et al., <i>J Immunol. </i>179(7):4580-4588 (2007)), (Yoshida, M., et al., <i>Immunity. </i>20(6):769-783 (2004)). Since FVIII circulates largely (-98%) in complex with VWF (Lenting, P. J., et al., <i>J Thromb Haemost. </i>5(7):1353-1360 (2007)), and both proteins were colocalized to the macrophages in liver and spleen when recombinant FVIII and VWF were co-injected into VWF-deficient mice (van Schooten, C.J., et al., <i>Blood. </i>112(5):1704-1712 (2008)), macrophages can play a role in rescue of rFVIIIFc from degradation and prolongation of half-life. However, the results can also be indicative of a previously unrecognized pathway for FVIII catabolism, and rescue of the protein permitted by Fc fusion.</p><p id="p-0578" num="0632">Approaches in development to extend the half-life of clotting factors include pegylation (Rostin, J., et al., <i>Bioconjug Chem. </i>11(3):387-396 (2000)), (Mei, B., et al., <i>Blood. </i>116(2):270-279 (2010)), glycopegylation (Moss, J., et al., <i>J Thromb Haemost. </i>9(7):1368-1374 (2011)), (Negrier, C., et al., <i>Blood</i>. (2011)), and conjugation with albumin (Metzner, H. J., et al., <i>Thromb Haemost. </i>102(4): 634-644 (2009)), (Weimer, T., et al., <i>Thromb Haemost. </i>99(4): 659-667 (2008)). Regardless of the protein engineering utilized, the half-life of modified rFVIII variants appears to be maximally twice as long as wild-type FVIII in a variety of preclinical animal models (Liu, T., et al., <i>Blood. </i>112:511 (2008)), (Karpf, D. M., et al., 16(Suppl. S4):40 (2010)). Consistent results have been demonstrated in humans, e.g., rFVIIIFc was reported to improve half-life approximately 1.7-fold compared to ADVATE&#xae; in hemophilia A patients (Powell, J. S., et al., <i>Blood</i>. (2012) prepublished online. DOI:10.1182/blood-2011-09-382846). This limitation of extending FVIII half-life appears to be related to VWF. In FVIII and VWF knockout mice, preliminary experiments observed a 5-fold increase in the half-life of rFVIIIFc compared to rFVIII (Liu, T et al., unpublished results). Similar findings were reported previously in VWF knockout mice utilizing Pegylated-FVIII (Mei, B., et al., <i>Blood. </i>116(2):270-279 (2010)). Taken together, these results indicate that VWF can be a limiting factor for further extending FVIII half-life.</p><p id="p-0579" num="0633">Beyond extending half-life, rFVIIIFc provides additional benefits. One major challenge with FVIII replacement therapy is the development of neutralizing anti-FVIII antibodies (inhibitors). This occurs in 15-30% of previously untreated patients. rFVIIIFc has the potential to induce immune tolerance and thus prevent the development of neutralizing antibodies. It has been reported that retroviral vector-transduced B-cells, presenting FVIII domains as Ig fusion proteins, specifically prevent or decrease existing FVIII antibodies in HemA mice (Lei, T. C. and Scott, D. W., <i>Blood. </i>105(12):4865-4870 (2005)). It was also found that Fc contains regulatory T-cell epitopes capable of inducing Treg expansion and suppression of antigen-specific immune responses in vitro (De Groot, et al., <i>Blood. </i>112(8):3303-3311 (2008)). In addition, the FcRn-mediated transfer of maternal IgG and Fc-fusion proteins across placenta to fetal circulation (Simister, N. E., <i>Vaccine. </i>21(24): 3365-3369 (2003)), Grubb, J. H., et al., <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci U.S.A. </i>105(24):8375-8380 (2008)) could induce neonatal tolerance to rFVIIIFc while also providing needed protection in the newborn from bleeding during delivery.</p><p id="p-0580" num="0634">In conclusion, we have demonstrated that rFVIIIFc, provides approximately 2-fold longer efficacy duration relative to rFVIII in protecting HemA mice from tail vein transection injury and improving WBCT in HemA dogs. The prolonged efficacy correlates well with a 2-fold extended t<sub>1/2 </sub>of rFVIIIFc, a result of recycling of the Fc fusion protein via a specific and well established intracellular pathway.</p><heading id="h-0045" level="1">Example 11</heading><heading id="h-0046" level="1">Immunogenicity of rFVIIIFc in Mice</heading><p id="p-0581" num="0635">130 male Hemophilia A mice, age 7-9 weeks old at the beginning of the study, were randomized into 13 treatment groups based on age and Body weight (n=10/group).

IL-2 is a T-cell mitogen involved in T-cell proliferation, which is secreted by activated T-cells in response to FVIII in hemA mice. IL-4 has been identified as a cytokine secreted by activated T cells in response to FVIII in hemA mice. TNF-&#x3b1; is a pro-inflammatory cytokine responsible for higher antibody production in hemophilia patients.

PD-L1 is an inhibitory ligand that engages the PD-1 receptor on activated T-cells thereby blocking T-cell Receptor (TCR) mediated production of IL-2 and proliferation. Higher DC expression of PD-L1 is a critical factor that can inhibit immunogenicity and promote tolerance. CD80 is a surface marker usually seen on dendritic cells upon phagocytosing antigen and during maturation to present antigen to T cells. CD80 belongs to a panel of co-receptors in activating T cells for proliferation.

Tim3 (T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3) as a negative regulator of T helper 1 (Th1)-cell responses. Tim3 is also expressed by innate immune cells and can promote a pro-inflammatory response. Tim3 inhibits Th1-mediated auto- and alloimmune responses and acts via its ligand, galectin-9, to induce cell death in Th1 but not Th2 cells. CD279 (PD-1) is a member of the extended CD28/CTLA-4 family of T cell regulators. PD-1 is expressed on the surface of activated T cells, B cells, and macrophages suggesting that compared to CTLA-4, PD-1 more broadly negatively regulates immune responses.</p><p id="p-0591" num="0645">Among the tested cytokines that are responsible for immunogenicity and inhibitor formation, in mice injected with the 50 IU/kg of rFVIII-hFc or rFVIII-mFc, there was a significant inhibition in the levels of IL-4 and TNF-&#x3b1; and the levels of IL-2 did not change compared to vehicle injected group.

This could be one responsible factor that suppresses the immune response and drives an immune tolerance reaction. Fc molecules present in IgG and in rFVIIIFc are capable of interacting with the classical IgG Fc receptors and FcRn. Among the Fc receptors, the subtype Fc&#x3b3;RIIb (Fc&#x3b3;R2b) is an inhibitory receptor and delivers suppressive signals that curb the activation of cell types harboring that receptor. Fc receptors including FcRn are chiefly localized in antigen presenting cells (APC-dendritic cells, macrophages and B-cells), but not in T-cells. Therefore, it is possible that the rFVIIIFc could engage FcR2b and/or FcRn in these cells to skew towards a tolerogenic phenotype.</p><p id="p-0642" num="0701">To ascertain whether rFVIIIFc engages FcR2b and/or FcRn in dendritic cells and macrophages to develop a tolerogenic phenotype, the following experiments will be conducted:</p><p id="p-0643" num="0702">1.

Two possible sites for inducing tolerance are the gastrointestinal mucosa and the respiratory mucosa. Oral tolerance to rFVIIIFc can be induced by either feeding animals or using oral gavages to deliver the molecule to the intestinal mucosa. The gut mucosa has specialized secondary lymphoid organs namely the Peyer's patches which contains antigen presenting cells (APC) that are important in regulatory immune responses. These APCs can process antigens and activate specific subsets of dendritic cells and Tregs which can travel to other sites in the body and program other cells of the immune system to suppress an immune response in the presence of antigen, in this case exogenously supplied FVIII. This phenomenon could be mediated by Fc interactions with FcRn and/or FcgR2b present on the APC of the gut mucosal immune system. Respiratory mucosa can be tolerized by inhalation of aerosols of rFVIIIFc which may operate based on the same mechanism as for the gut.</p><p id="p-0647" num="0706">The ascertain whether immune tolerance can be achieve via mucosal route, XYNTHA&#xae; or ADVATE&#xae; will be administered orally or via aerosol to hemA mice.

T-cells were labeled with 10 &#x3bc;M CFSE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) for 15 minutes in warm PBS and plated in 96 well ultra-low adhesion plates (Corning) along with peritoneal macrophages at a density of 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells per ml for each. Cells were then incubated with 0.1, 1 and 10 nM of rFVIII or vehicle or CD3/CD28 microbeads (positive control; Miltenyi Biotec) in X-VIVO 15 medium (Lonza) containing co-stimulatory antibodies namely anti-CD28 and anti-CD49d (BD Biosciences), for 96 hours at 37&#xb0; C. At the end of the incubation, IFN&#x3b3; levels in the culture supernatant were measured using an ELISA kit from Meso Scale Devices (MSD). T-cell proliferation was determined by measuring CFSE fluorescence intensity (MFI) in T-cells gated based on forward and side scatters, using FACS (BD FACS CANTO II).</p><p id="p-0661" num="0720">Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis of results were carried out either using unpaired student's T-test or Mann-Whitney's T-test.

Splenocytes from hemA mice injected with FVIII drug substances or vehicle were stained for CD11c and MHC Class II molecules to gate the dendritic cells. Splenic composition of dendritic cells expressing markers such as CD80, a surface marker upregulated in mature dendritic cells indicating more antigen presentation and CD274 (PD-L1), the ligand for the PD-1 receptor, were identified by co-staining with specific antibodies to these molecules. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>63</b>A</figref>, splenocytes from 100 IU/kg rFVIIIFc or BDD-FVIII injected HemA mice showed a significant decrease in the percentage of dendritic cells expressing CD80, suggesting an abundance of immature dendritic cells.</p><p id="p-0663" num="0722">Although mice receiving fl-FVIII showed a decrease in the percentage of CD80+ dendritic cells compared to vehicle, it did not attain statistical significance (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b>A</figref>). The trend was similar for mice receiving the 50 IU/kg dose of rFVIIIFc. At 250 IU/kg, all the three treatments showed no alterations in the percentage of CD80+ dendritic cells among the splenocytes.</p><p id="p-0664" num="0723">Results from FACS analysis for splenic dendritic cells expressing CD274 (PD-L1), revealed that rFVIIIFc at 100 IU/kg enhanced the percentage of these cells compared to vehicle and other FVIII treatments (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b>B</figref>). This molecule was also regulated at the mRNA level by rFVIIIFc as illustrated by real time PCR analysis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b>C</figref>). This suggests the rFVIIIFc regulates the PD-L1:PD-1 pathway, one of the key immunosuppressive pathways, thereby reducing the immunogenicity to FVIII. In addition to CD274, rFVIIIFc also upregulated mRNA levels of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), a key enzyme that regulates T-cell proliferation and activation by affecting tryptophan metabolism (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b>D</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0078" level="1">Example 24</heading><heading id="h-0079" level="1">rFVIIIFc at Low Doses Enhances the Expression of Markers of Immune Tolerance and Anergy in Splenocytes</heading><p id="p-0665" num="0724">Experimental procedures were conducted according to the Materials and Methods described in Example 23.</p><p id="p-0666" num="0725">In order to identify markers of immune tolerance induced by rFVIIIFc, real time PCR based arrays focused on genes specific for immune tolerance and anergy (SA Biosciences) was employed. mRNA isolated from splenocytes obtained from mice injected with 50 and 250 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc and vehicle was used to identify novel response elements activated by this drug substance.</p><p id="p-0667" num="0726">Candidates were identified based on their expression level (2-fold above or below vehicle), and the p-value based on student's T-test (&#x3c;0.05).

These constructs were used to identify the interactions of the rFVIIIFc with one of these receptors in bringing about the immunosuppressive action. To this end, we tested the IFN&#x3b3; secretion profile of T-cells derived from mice that received two weekly injections of rFVIIIFc-N297A at 250 IU/kg doses (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>68</b>C</figref>) and 50 IU/kg doses (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>68</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0675" num="0734">Side by side comparisons of IFN&#x3b3; secretion from T-cells derived from 250 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc and rFVIIIFc-N297A revealed that the level of the cytokine was highly reduced in the T-cells from animals receiving the mutant, albeit significantly higher levels compared to vehicle. However, the levels of IFN&#x3b3; from the 50 IU/kg group of the mutant protein did not show a significant difference from that of 50 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc. This suggests that the higher antibody production and T-cell proliferation observed at higher doses of rFVIIIFc might be a resultant of the interaction of the Fc with the Fc&#x3b3; receptors which is abolished by the Fc&#x3b3; non-binding mutant.</p><p id="p-0676" num="0735">The foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the invention that others can, by applying knowledge within the skill of the art, readily modify and/or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments, without undue experimentation, without departing from the general concept of the present invention.
