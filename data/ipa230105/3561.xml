In order to know about the yield of oil wells, it is necessary to use relevant equipment to meter the yield of oil wells. In theory, flowmeters such as vortex flowmeters, ultrasonic flowmeters, and metal float flowmeters can be installed in the oil transport pipeline to measure the flow rate of crude oil, and then the yield of the oil wells can be obtained through conversion. However, in practical applications, flowing characteristics of the crude oil in the ground pipeline of oil wells are closely related to the way the liquid comes out of the oil wells. The working process of the oil extraction apparatus includes two strokes, i.e., an upward stroke and a downward stroke. During the upward stroke, the crude oil flows out to the ground pipeline through a sucker rod. During the downward stroke, there is basically no crude oil flowing out, so the liquid in the ground pipeline of the oil well will flow stream by stream. In addition, the unprocessed crude oil itself that has just been mined has a complex composition. It is a mixed liquid that integrates oil, gas, water, various other liquid components, and solid particles, which is viscous and has poor fluidity. The liquid will also entrain agglomerated oil mass. If devices such as the above-mentioned vortex flowmeter, ultrasonic flowmeter, turbine flowmeter, and metal float flowmeter are used to measure the flow rate in the ground pipeline of the oil well, first, due to the unique way of discharging liquid of the oil well, the metering error will be too large and the accuracy requirements cannot be met. In addition, due to the liquid properties of the crude oil, a measuring tube of the flowmeter will be easily blocked, which not only makes it impossible to measure, but also easily causes the pressure in the pipeline to rise and burst the pipeline, thereby leading to safety accidents such as oil leakage and pipeline burst. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a flow metering device that is safe, convenient to install, and meets the accuracy requirements.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In view of the technical problem existing in the prior art, the present disclosure proposes a crude oil flow metering device, which can safely meter the crude oil flow rate of a crude oil transport pipeline and meet the accuracy of metering the crude oil.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to solve the above technical problem, the present disclosure provides a crude oil flow metering device, which includes a measuring part and a metering part; the measuring part includes a measuring tube and a float assembly; the measuring tube includes a liquid inlet and a liquid outlet; an inner diameter of the measuring tube gradually increases from the liquid inlet to the liquid outlet; the float assembly is in-built in the measuring tube, and includes a float and a float connection rod integrally connected with the float; an end of the float connection rod is connected to a detection part; the detection part protrudes out of the measuring tube when the float rises from a bottom end; the metering part includes a position detection module and a processing module; the position detection module is arranged in a detection cavity located above the measuring tube and formed by a first housing; when the detection part at the end of the float connection rod extends into the detection cavity, the position detection module detects a position of the detection part at the end of the float connection rod to obtain a float height detection signal; and the processing module is connected to the position detection module to calculate a flow rate of measured crude oil according to the float height detection signal.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a case where the float in the device is a sphere, the processing module calculates the flow rate of the measured crude oil according to formula 1-5:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>q</i><sub>v</sub>=&#x3b1;[&#x3c0;(<i>R</i><sub>f</sub><i>+&#x394;h </i>sin(&#x3b8;/2))<sup>2</sup><i>&#x2212;&#x3c0;R</i><sub>f</sub><sup>2</sup>]&#x221a;{square root over (2<i>gV</i><sub>f</sub>(&#x3c1;<sub>f</sub>&#x2212;&#x3c1;)/&#x3c1;&#x3c0;<i>R</i><sub>f</sub><sup>2</sup>)}&#x2003;&#x2003;1-5;<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">where q<sub>v </sub>is a volumetric flow, &#x3b1; is a flow coefficient of the device, g is the acceleration of gravity, V<sub>f </sub>is a volume of the sphere float, &#x3c1;<sub>f </sub>is a density of the material of the sphere float, &#x3c1; is a density of the measured crude oil, &#x3b8; is a cone angle of the measuring tube, &#x394;h is a height of the sphere float from its lowest point to a current measurement position, and R<sub>f </sub>is a radius of the sphere float.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">In a case where the float of the crude oil flow metering device is a structural body which has a circular working cross section and which is symmetrical with respect to a vertical centerline, the processing module calculates the flow rate of the measured crude oil according to formula 1-8:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>q</i><sub>v</sub>=&#x3b1;[&#x3c0;(<i>R</i><sub>f</sub><i>+&#x394;h </i>tan(&#x3b8;/2))<sup>2</sup><i>&#x2212;&#x3c0;R</i><sub>f</sub><sup>2</sup>]&#x221a;{square root over (2<i>gV</i><sub>f</sub>(&#x3c1;<sub>f</sub>&#x2212;&#x3c1;)/&#x3c1;&#x3c0;<i>R</i><sub>f</sub><sup>2</sup>)}&#x2003;&#x2003;1-8;<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">where q<sub>v </sub>is a volumetric flow, &#x3b1; is a flow coefficient of the device, g is the acceleration of gravity, V<sub>f </sub>is a volume of the float, &#x3c1;<sub>f </sub>is a density of the material of the float, &#x3c1; is a density of the measured crude oil, &#x3b8; is a cone angle of the measuring tube, &#x394;h is a height of the float from its lowest point to a current measurement position, and R<sub>f </sub>is a maximum working radius of the float.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">During the flow of the measured crude oil from the liquid inlet to the liquid outlet of the measuring tube, the float in the present disclosure can overcome the resistance generated by the viscosity of the crude oil and, in accordance with the flowing pattern (i.e., the crude oil flows stream by stream), rises, stabilizes at a certain height, falls, rises again, stabilizes at a certain height, and falls again, etc. The float can also stabilize at different heights according to the magnitude of the flow rate when the crude oil flows continuously.

Apparently, the described embodiments are some of the embodiments of the present disclosure, not all of them. All the other embodiments obtained by those skilled in the art based on the embodiments of the present disclosure without creative efforts will fall within the scope of protection of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0026">In the following detailed description, reference may be made to various drawings which constitute a part of the present application and which serve to explain specific embodiments of the present application. In the drawings, similar reference signs denote substantially similar components in different figures. The individual specific embodiments of the present application will be described in sufficient detail below to enable those of ordinary knowledge and skills in the art to carry out the technical solutions of the present application. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized, or structural, logical or electrical changes may be made to the embodiments of the present application.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0027">The present disclosure provides a crude oil flow metering device, which determines a rising height of a float in a measuring tube by detecting a position of a detection part on a float connection rod, thereby calculating a flow rate of measured crude oil. Out of the existing flow metering devices, the float type flowmeter is a widely used device for metering the flow rate of gas and liquid. Metering elements of the float type flowmeter include a measuring tube and an indicator. An interior of the measuring tube is a cone-shaped measuring chamber that gradually expands from bottom to top, with a fluid inlet at a lower end and a fluid outlet at an upper end. A float, which is guided by a guide rod and can move up and down freely, is in-built in the cone-shaped measuring chamber. When the measured fluid flows through the cone-shaped measuring tube from bottom to top, a differential pressure is generated between upper and lower ends of the float to form a rising force. When the rising force acting on the float is greater than the weight of the float immersed in the fluid, the float will rise, and the area of the annular gap between the float and a wall of the measuring tube will increase accordingly; a flow velocity of the fluid at the annular gap decreases immediately, the differential pressure between the upper and lower ends of the float decreases, and the rising force acting on the float also decreases until the rising force equals to the weight of the float immersed in the fluid, at which time the float stabilizes at a certain height, and the area of the annular gap between the float and the wall of the measuring tube remains constant. The area of the annular gap and the rising height of the float have a certain correspondence, that is, a rising position of the float in the measuring tube can represent the magnitude of the flow rate. There are usually two types of indicators. One type is to set scales on a tube body, and a value of the scale is determined according to a correspondence between the position and the flow rate. In this type of flowmeter, the flow rate value can be obtained by observing the scale position where the liquid is located. Another type of indicator is a pointer indicator. In this type of flowmeter, the float is in-built with a first steel magnet, the indicator is in-built with a second steel magnet coupled with the first steel magnet, and the second steel magnet is connected to a pointer through a transmission mechanism such as a connection rod. When the float moves up and down and rotates with the measured fluid, a magnetic field generated by the first magnetic steel in-built in the float changes with the movement and rotation of the float. Since the second steel magnet in the indicator is magnetically coupled with the first steel magnet, the second steel magnet rotates with the change of the magnetic field, and the second magnet drives the pointer of the indicator to rotate through the connection rod which serves as the transmission mechanism. After correction, the rising height of the float corresponds to the position of the pointer in a one-to-one correspondence, and the position of the pointer indicates the corresponding flow rate. However, after long-term use of the above-mentioned metal float type flowmeter, due to the limitations of processing and material conditions, the connection rod in the transmission mechanism will not be able to accurately transmit the position of the float due to the fatigue damage suffered, thus resulting in inaccurate measurement and deterioration of the reliability after long-term use. No transmission mechanism is used in the present disclosure, so the present disclosure is not subjected to the fatigue damage of the traditional float position detection assembly, and the accuracy during long-term use can be ensured. In addition, traditional floats have a relatively small weight and cannot adapt to such viscous fluids as crude oil which has a complex composition. Although the present disclosure is very similar to the traditional float type flowmeters in some structures, in order to adapt to the special flowing state and fluid composition of the crude oil, the structure of the present disclosure is significantly different from the traditional float type flowmeters. Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described in detail through specific embodiments as follows.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a partial structure of a crude oil flow metering device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. In this embodiment, the sensor is a Hall sensor, and the corresponding detection part at the end of the float connection rod is a magnet. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the crude oil flow metering device includes a measuring part and a metering part. The measuring part includes a measuring tube <b>11</b> which includes a liquid inlet <b>111</b> and a liquid outlet <b>112</b>, and the measuring tube <b>11</b> includes a straight tube and an inverted cone-shaped tube that are sleeved together. A bottom of the cone-shaped tube is the liquid inlet <b>111</b>, and the liquid outlet <b>112</b> is arranged on a side wall of the straight tube. An inner diameter of the entire measuring tube <b>11</b> gradually increases from the liquid inlet <b>111</b> to the liquid outlet <b>112</b>. By changing the different cone angles of the cone-shaped tube, the cone-shaped tube can be adapted to the measured petroleum with different flow rates. If the flow rate is large, a large cone angle is used, and if the flow rate is small, a small cone angle is used. It has been proven from experience that when the cone-shaped tube adopts a cone angle of no larger than 20 degrees, the accuracy requirements can be well met when metering a certain range of flow rate. In the present disclosure, the cone-shaped tube and the straight tube are movably nested into each other, and the cone-shaped tubes with different cone angles can be selected to match with the straight tube according to the flow rate in the currently measured oil pipeline.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0029">In some embodiments, a distance between the liquid outlet and a top end of the measuring tube is not less than a maximum working distance of the float in a vertical direction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the distance D<b>1</b> between the liquid outlet <b>112</b> and the top end of the measuring tube, that is, a lower surface of an upper flange, is not less than a diameter Rf of the sphere float <b>121</b>. In a case where the measured petroleum fluid includes agglomerated oil mass, when it enters the measuring tube <b>11</b>, even if it cannot immediately flow out of the measuring tube <b>11</b> through the liquid outlet <b>112</b>, the sphere float <b>121</b> will rise upward when the flow rate of the liquid is large enough, thereby creating a liquid flow channel, so that the liquid can flow out of the measuring tube through the liquid outlet <b>112</b> without being retained in the measuring tube for a long time to block the measuring tube.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0030">A float assembly <b>12</b> is in-built in the measuring tube <b>11</b>, and the float assembly includes a float <b>121</b> and a float connection rod <b>122</b> integrally connected with the float <b>121</b>. The float <b>121</b> in this embodiment is a solid metal sphere, such as a stainless steel sphere with a density of 7.8 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>and a diameter larger than the liquid inlet <b>111</b>.

The data processing frequency may be the same as the data collection frequency, or it may be a multiple of the data collection frequency. During data processing, only one data can be processed at a time, or multiple data can be processed at a time. For example, the data is collected once every second.
