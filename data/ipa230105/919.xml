id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a novel use of milk exosomes and, more specifically, relates to various uses of milk exosomes in functional cosmetics, health functional foods, medicines, and the like.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Exosomes are vesicles with a size of several tens to hundreds of nanometers, made of double layers of phospholipids identical to the structure of the plasma membrane. Exosomes contain exosome cargos of proteins, nucleic acids (mRNA, miRNA, etc.) and the like, and in such exosome cargos, a wide range of signaling factors are included, and these signaling factors are known to be specific to cell types and differently regulated according to the environment of secretory cells. It is known that exosomes are intercellular signaling mediators secreted by cells, and various cellular signals transmitted through exosomes regulate cell behaviors, including activation, growth, migration, differentiation, dedifferentiation, apoptosis, and necrosis of targeted cells. It is known that exosomes contain specific genetic materials and bioactive factors according to the nature and state of their originating cells.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Since exosomes are basically originated from cells, they are biocompatible, unlike other nanoparticles, and due to their ability to carry or label a drug or a biologically active component inside or on the surface, there has been a continuous effort to utilize exosomes as a drug carrier or a raw material for cosmetics or drugs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this regard, Korean patent KR 2039302 discloses a cosmetic composition for strengthening and functionally improving skin barrier of the stratum cornea, comprising exosomes derived from stem cells as an active ingredient; Korean patent KR 1662405 discloses a pharmaceutical composition for treating cerebrovascular diseases, comprising exosomes derived from stem cells as an active ingredient; Korean patent KR 1894229 discloses a composition, comprising exosomes derived from deer antler stem cell culture as an active ingredient, for preventing or treating hair loss, or growing hair or promoting hair growth; and Patent WO 2016039356A1 discloses an anti-inflammatory agent comprising milk-derived exosomes as an active ingredient.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, with regard to milk-derived exosomes, other than their use as an anti-inflammatory agent disclosed in WO2016039356A1, and use as a drug carrier disclosed by Munagala et al. (<i>Cancer Lett., </i>371(1): 48-61, 2016), there is little known about other uses of milk-derived exosomes are.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, skin consists of the epidermis, which is a stratified squamous epithelium, the dermis composed of dense connective tissues, and the subcutaneous layer composed of loose connective tissues. The epidermis is located at the outermost layer of the skin, forming a water-proof protective membrane covering the surface of a body, and is composed of layers of squamous epithelial cells and the basal layer underneath. The epidermis contains no blood vessels, and only a slight amount of nerves in relation to the central nervous system. The main cell types constituting the epidermis include keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells. The dermal layer is a skin layer underneath the epidermis that is composed of connective tissues, and provides a cushioning effect that protects the body from pressure and tension. The dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis via the basal layer, thereby supporting the epidermis and supplying nutrients, and contains a number of nerve endings sensing touch and heat.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The skin is gradually damaged by advancing age, or UV rays, external pollutants, and stress, and as the function to protect the skin from such factors decreases, cell protection and proliferation capabilities also decrease. In this case, our body initiates the skin regeneration process for damaged skin. Skin regeneration is any reaction of tissue against damage and is a complex biological process comprising chemotaxis, cell differentiation and replication, synthesis of matrix protein, angiogenesis and reconstitution of wound, as a series of tissue repair processes (Steed, D. L. et al., <i>Clin. Plast. Surg. </i>25: 397, 1998).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the skin is damaged, the process of cell proliferation follows inflammation reactions, which lasts from 2 days to 3 weeks after the skin damage. During this period, fibroblasts deposits collagen, filling the damaged skin, proliferation of fibroblasts is induced, and reconstitution of new cells and interstitial constituents takes place in the wound area. This proliferation process, also known as granulation process, lasts from 2 days to 3 weeks after the formation of wound. In the young skin by new cells, activities of skin cells are high such that fibroblasts in the dermis are highly active in collagen synthesis and metabolism, which is important for skin firmness and inhibition of wrinkle formation. In addition, the synthesis of GAGs (glucosamino-glycans), which is a glycoprotein containing hyaluronic acid that is essential for skin moisturization, is also active, thus imparting firmness, moisture, and elasticity to the skin. Also, in the epidermal layer, basal layer cells actively proliferate, and a balanced production of adhesion proteins such as laminin, integrin, and desmosome that enhance connections between skin cells, takes place, thus strengthening cell tissues and keeping the skin healthy.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, since the skin regeneration capability decreases with advancing age, when skin damage occurs by UV rays, pollutants or stress, skin regeneration takes place incompletely. Thus, the skin loses firmness, forms wrinkles, undergoes discolorations and hyperpigmentation such as age spots, blemishes, freckles and dark spots, and loses water retention capability.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, in order to keep firm, moist and healthy skin, restoring the skin regeneration capability that decreases with advancing age may be the most important. Prior art pertaining to a functional cosmetic composition for such skin regeneration purposes include: Korean patent KR 1888258 pertaining to a composition for skin regeneration, comprising an essential oil extracted from Daisy fleabane flowers as an active ingredient; Korean patent KR 1422690 pertaining to a composition for skin regeneration comprising culture secretions of angiogenic progenitor cells derived from embryonic stem cells; and Korean patent KR 1663912 pertaining to a cosmetic composition for skin whitening, skin wrinkle reduction, or skin regeneration, comprising exosomes derived from human adipose-derived stem cells as an active ingredient.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, the above prior art have issues such as an excessive production cost and unchecked in vivo stability and safety.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Meanwhile, immunity is a self-defense response that physiologically distinguishes exogenous and endogenous foreign materials in the body, and eliminates and metabolizes them. Immunity can be classified as innate immunity, which is initial immunity, and acquired immunity, which is adaptive immunity. In the initial immunity, activities of macrophages and natural killer cells (NK cells) protect the host by suppressing foreign materials (pathogens), and here, the macrophages produce and release activity marker TNF-&#xe1;, while engulfing foreign materials, and the NK cells produce and release activity marker, perforin, to kill pathogen-infected cells. Subsequently, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, helper T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes involved in acquired immunity are activated to kill infected cells or produce antibodies to protect the host. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes, just as NK cells, produce and release a large amount of perforin to kill pathogen-infected cells, and B lymphocytes produce antibodies, dependently or independently on helper T lymphocytes, to protect the host. Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-&#xe1;, are substances that mediate immunity and are known to be involved in the initial immunity in particular. Furthermore, since the innate immunity plays an extremely important role as a defense mechanism against cancer cells, cellular therapy products utilizing the activation of innate immunity, such as NK cells and T cells as a mechanism of action have garnered more attention in recent years.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In general, in the case of immunodeficiency, resistance to infection is compromised, and patients with antibody deficiencies are unable to defend against bacterial infections, and the phagocytic capability of neutrophils is also compromised. Moreover, in such a case, activation of the complement system is also compromised, failing to produce leukocyte migration factors and the like, subsequently increasing the rate of inflammations and causing viremia, spreading to the central nervous system and other sites. Moreover, in case of a cancer patient, not only cancer cells but also normal cells are affected during the process of chemotherapy or radiation therapy, thus causing an adverse effect that drastically decreases the patient's immunity.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this context, there is a need for development of an immunity enhancer capable of enhancing immunity, or functional health food for strengthening immunity, for the prevention or treatment of cancer or infectious diseases.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Meanwhile, according to health insurance medical expenses payment data surveyed by Health Insurance Policy Research Institute of National Health Insurance Corporation from 2001 to 2008, the number of patients actually treated for &#x2018;hair loss&#x2019; was 103,000 in 2001, 142,000 in 2005, and 165,000 in 2008, showing a 60% increase over the past 7 years. By age, the number of patients in their 20's to 40's was 114,000, which accounts 69.5% of the total number of patients, and the number of patients in their 10s or younger was 22,000 or more. As of 2008, among the actually treated patients, 84,000 were men and 80,000 were women, showing that there were slightly more men than women, and as of 2008, the specific types of &#x2018;hair loss&#x2019; among the actually treated patients in natural health insurance include alopecia areata (130,000), cicatricial alopecia (2,000), androgenic alopecia (9,000), and other nonscarring hair loss (8,000). Meanwhile, according to the data of the International Hair and Cosmetics Research Forum in June 2003, there are 250 millions of hair loss patients, and the incidence of hair loss between the age of 24 to 50 was 30 to 65%. As of 2008, there are about 300 million people with hair loss in China, and 30% of the male population in their 30s and 50% of the male population in their 50s show signs of hair loss, and the number of hair loss patients increases by 10-15% every year. According to data surveyed by businesses selling wigs and performing hair transplant surgery in 2007 in Japan, the incidence of hair loss in Japanese population was 26.5%, and the number of patients with hair loss was estimated to be about 12.93 million.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Currently, preparations for hair loss treatment are largely classified into drugs, quasi-drugs, and cosmetics. Prescription drugs that can only be purchased with a doctor's prescription include &#x2018;Propecia&#x2019; developed and marketed by Merck in the US. Finasteride, the main ingredient of Propecia, was approved as a hair loss treatment medication by the US FDA in December 1997. Finasteride is a drug that inhibits 5-alpha-reductase, which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and plays a role in growing vellus hair into thick and long hair. Although effective in alleviating hair loss in the short term, Finasteride is accompanied by side effects such as erectile dysfunction, decreased sexual function, and enlarged breasts in men. Over-the-counter drugs that have been recognized for their safety and effectiveness and thus can be purchased without a doctor's prescription include Minoxidil. Minoxidil was approved by the FDA in December 1997 as the first topical hair loss treatment medication. Although this medication has the effect of promoting hair growth by improving blood circulation and opening potassium channels, it may cause local reactions such as itchiness and rash may occur, and may cause tachycardia and the like.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Among products that have been approved for hair loss prevention and hair growth function by the Korean Food and Drug Administration, quasi-drug products that can be sold at supermarkets or convenience stores according to the public notice of the Minister of Health and Welfare include &#x2018;Hair Power Competent&#x2019; by CJ Lion and &#x2018;Hair Tonic&#x2019; by Moracle, &#x2018;Mo &#x26; More&#x2019; by LG Household &#x26; Health Care, and as cosmetics, shampoos or products used for scalp or hair to maintain or promote the health of skin and hair are sold.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The human hair loss cycle is largely divided into the growing phase (anagen), the transitional phase (catagen), and the resting phase (telogen). The anagen phase is a phase in which hair follicle dermal papilla cells are active, cells are dividing rapidly, and the hair grows at a fast rate. The duration of the anagen phase, although it varies on the type of hair, is about 3-6 years for the head hair. Anagen hair accounts for 80 to 90% of total hair, and people who are experiencing hair loss tend to have a hair cycle with a shortened anagen phase and a prolonged telogen phase, decreasing the portion of anagen hair in the total hair. The catagen phase is a phase in which the anagen phase of hair ends and hair generation gradually slows down, with cell division and growth eventually coming to an end. The catagen phase lasts about 1-1.5 months, and about 1% of the total hair belongs to this phase. The telogen phase is the last stage of growth, in which the hair follicles and dermal papilla are completely separated, and the hair follicles are atrophied, and the hair follicles move further upwards, causing the hair to fall out. The telogen phase lasts about 3-4 months, and 4-14% of the total hair belong to this phase. As the telogen phase ends and the dermal papilla is active again, dermal papilla of new hair are formed, and hair in the telogen phase is pushed out and comes out of the scalp completely.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Since conventional hair loss treatment agents or compositions for hair growth have their efficacy not fully verified, or are accompanied by various side effects, there is an urgent need for the development of a safer and more efficient hair loss treatment agent or hair growth agent.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention has been conceived of to address various issues including the aforementioned issues, and the objective of the present invention is to provide a novel use of more efficient and inexpensive milk-derived exosomes in various cosmetics such as a functional cosmetic composition for skin regeneration, food, and drugs.

The size of exosomes is known to be between 30 nm to 100 nm and are secreted from cells from the fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane, or directly secreted through the plasma membrane. Exosomes are known to play an important role in various processes such as coagulation, intercellular signal transduction, and management of metabolites. In this context, the term &#x201c;milk exosomes&#x201d; used herein refers to exosomes derived from milk of mammals, such as commercial milk and colostrum. Likewise, the term &#x201c;colostrum exosomes&#x201d; refers to milk exosomes derived from milk produced by the mother immediately after the birth of an offspring.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The term &#x201c;milk&#x201d; as used herein primarily refers to cow milk, but includes milk from other mammals, such as a horse, a sheep, a milk goat (goat), and a camel, as functional equivalents. Considering acquisition availability, cost, and the like, commercial cow milk is the most preferable, and commercial &#x201c;goat milk&#x201d; produced from milk goat (goat) can be an excellent alternative. In particular, goat milk has a similar composition as breast milk and is thus easy to digest, and has a high nutritional value, and as such, is recognized as premium milk. Horse milk (horse milk), although not common, is utilized as a milk alternative by nomadic tribes in Central Asia. Meanwhile, &#x201c;colostrum&#x201d; is a form of milk produced during the late stage of pregnancy and several days after birth. Unlike regular milk, colostrum contains more nutrients and antibodies necessary for survival and growth, and also compared to regular milk, contains a higher amount of antioxidant materials such as lactoferrin and hemopexin, and is thus sometimes preferred in health improvement and nutritional aspects.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The term &#x201c;raw milk&#x201d; as used herein refers to milk collected from a ranch that has not undergone any particular processing such as sterilization, and the term &#x201c;commercial milk&#x201d; as used herein refers to milk that is packaged in a commercially available form through a sterilization process and a homogenization process.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The term &#x201c;skin regeneration&#x201d; as used herein refers to the process of a skin regeneration cycle, or the process in which in case of a wound, cells are formed in the basal layer, thereby restoring the skin. Epidermal cells formed in the basal layer are gradually pushed to upper layers and arrive at the stratum corneum. This process is referred to as a skin regeneration cycle or a skin turn-over process. Generally, a skin turn-over process is considered to take 28 days, on average, including a period of 14 days in which cells are formed in the basal layer and travel upwards, and a period of another 14 days in which cells remaining on the stratum corneum die and shed off. Since the process of regeneration and shedding takes longer with advancing age, the skin turn-over cycle may take up to 42 days, and it is known that the skin turn-over cycle typically becomes longer after the age of 30.

Moreover, since milk can serve as an exosome production platform capable of producing exosomes in large quantities at a reduced cost compared to stem cells, a process for producing exosomes in large quantities from milk or colostrum was established (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>). Moreover, through the process established above, it could be confirmed that when isolating exosomes from milk, a significantly larger amount of exosomes was isolated compared to when isolating from HEK293 cells (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>), and particularly, it was found that when using colostrum as the raw material, exosomes were produced with an extremely high yield of 0.45 to 1.5 mg/ml when converted to a protein content. It could be seen that this is a value up to 100 times or higher, when compared to the yield of HEK293 cells (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Moreover, the present inventors, in an attempt to increase exosome production yields from milk, have developed a simpler process that does not utilize ultrafiltration (FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i>), and also confirmed that the use of such an improved process to isolate exosomes from milk is capable of achieving a remarkable yield increase 400 to 1,000 times or more, compared to the conventional ultrafiltration technique (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>). Meanwhile, in order to confirm whether the exosomes prepared by the above method are normal exosomes, the expression of exosome markers CD8, CD63, CD81, and TSG 101 was analyzed by Western blot analysis, and the particle size distribution of exosomes was analyzed by dynamic scattering analysis. As a result, as could be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the exosome markers were identified as normal, although slightly lower than the HEK293-derived exosomes serving as the control, and as could be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, it was found that the milk-derived exosomes were nano-sized particles having an average particle diameter of 68.05 nm and a particle size distribution of 30 to 100 nm. This is a size distribution similar to that of the control exosomes, and from this result, it could be confirmed that exosomes could be normally isolated from milk.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">The present inventors performed stability analysis in order to investigate the utility of exosomes isolated from cell culture media as a raw material for cosmetics. In particular, exosomes isolated from HEK293 cells, which is a human cell line generally used in the production of recombinant exosomes, were freeze-dried and thawed twice, and their shapes were examined by dynamic scattering analysis and a transmission electron microscope (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). As a result, it was found that the exosomes derived from HEK293 cells, when freeze-dried and thawed for the second time, were incapable of retaining their original shapes due to aggregation. Accordingly, it could be confirmed that exosomes derived from a general cell line are used in the form of a freeze-dried raw material, and are an unsuitable raw material for ingredients in a cosmetic composition that is intended to be later stored at room temperature.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">In this context, the present inventors performed comparative analysis between the stability of exosomes isolated from milk and that of exosomes derived from other cells. In particular, particle size analysis by dynamic light scattering was performed between colostrum-derived exosomes according to an example of the present invention and exosomes derived from other cells (HaCat Exo, B16 Exo, and HDF Exo) before and after cryopreservation. It was found that, unlike the control exosomes, milk-derived exosomes retained their shape intact despite freeze-drying and thawing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b</i></figref>), and colostrum exosomes before and after freezing were administered to human dermal fibroblasts, and as a result, it could be confirmed that the ability to induce type I collagen expression remained intact. This shows that biological activity of the milk exosomes according to an example of the present invention remain intact despite the cryopreservation treatment.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Moreover, while the milk exosomes according to an example of the present invention were found to maintain their size despite repeated freezing and thawing, it was found that the other cell-derived exosomes increase in particle size as the number of freeze-thaw cycles increases, and thus give rise to aggregation or fusion, exhibiting an unstable appearance (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Furthermore, to confirm whether or not the exosomes isolated from milk can be successfully delivered to skin cells, the present inventors treated human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) with fluorescent-labeled milk-derived exosomes and identified the location of the exosomes by a fluorescence microscope (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). The result shows that the milk-derived exosomes of the present invention were well transitioned to the cytoplasm of dermal fibroblasts.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">Meanwhile, to confirm whether milk exosomes according to an example of the present invention are potentially capable of giving rise to cytotoxicity, the present inventors administered the milk exosomes to human dermal fibroblasts at a high concentration of 0.1 mg/ml and 0.3 mg/ml, and the result shows that apoptosis did not occur (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">In addition, to confirm whether the milk exosome according to an example of the present invention possess inhibitory activity against UV-induced oxidative cell damage, after inducing damage to human dermal fibroblasts by UV light, colostrum exosomes according to an example of the present invention were administered thereto to confirm the formation of reactive oxygen species. The result shows that unlike the control exosomes derived from other cells, the colostrum exosomes according to an example of the present invention significantly inhibited the formation of UV-induced reactive oxygen species (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">Furthermore, the present inventors investigated whether milk-derived exosomes isolated according to an example of the present invention possess skin regeneration capability. To this end, human keratinocyte HaCaT cells and human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) were treated with commercial milk- and colostrum-derived exosomes to examine the degree of cell proliferation (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The result shows that the milk-derived exosomes of the present invention had superior cell proliferation effect compared to the control group (PBS treated). In particular, it was found that the colostrum-derived exosomes has even higher cell proliferation capability than the commercial milk-derived exosomes. Furthermore, the present inventors investigated the influence on cell migration ability, which is one of the measures of cell regeneration capability (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). The result shows that the milk-derived exosomes of the present invention, when administered, increased cell migration in human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) as well as in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells, compared to the control, and the colostrum-derived exosomes in particular exhibited a significantly high cell migration capability.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Furthermore, to identify various uses of milk exosomes according to an example of the present invention, the present inventors investigated the following: the presence or absence of tube formation when treated in vascular endothelial cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>); analysis of in vivo distribution pattern over time when administered in vivo (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b><i>a </i>to <b>15</b><i>c</i></figref>); comparison of wound healing capacity when administered to a wound artificially introduced in an actual wound model animal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>); analysis of elastin expression when treated to a wound site (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>); a skin wrinkle reduction effect via induction of type I collagen expression and inhibition of MMP-2 expression when treated in human dermal fibroblasts (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b</i></figref>); a skin whitening effect via inhibition of melanin synthesis in melanoma cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>); and a therapeutic effect on hair loss, through the ability to induce the expression of cytokines associated with immune activation when treated in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>), the ability to induce the expression of growth factors associated with inflammation when treated in fibroblasts (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>), uptake into human dermal papilla cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b><i>a</i></figref>), proliferative capacity on human dermal papilla cells in normal and hair loss-induced conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b><i>b</i></figref>), and analysis on hair growth promotion and hair growth in an animal experiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b><i>c</i></figref>).

The specific method is as follows.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">First, in order to remove cell debris and other cellular components from the culture medium containing exosomes, centrifugation was sequentially performed at 300 g for 10 minutes, 2,000 g for 10 minutes, and 10,000 g for 30 minutes, and after filtering the culture medium by a 0.22 &#x3bc;m filter, ultra-centrifugation was performed at 36,900 rpm for 2 hours. The exosomes subsequently obtained were resuspended in PBS containing protease inhibitors (Roche).</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 1: Isolation of Exosomes from Commercial Milk</heading><p id="p-0171" num="0170">The present inventors isolated exosomes from commercial milk by the following method.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">First, the commercial milk was subjected to centrifugation at 3,000 g for 30 minutes, and then sequentially subjected to ultra-centrifugation at 12,000 g for 1 hour, at 35,000 g for 1 hour, and then at 70,000 g for 3 hours. Then, the resulting product was subjected to a first filtration by a 0.8 &#x3bc;m filter, and a second filtration by a 0.45 &#x3bc;m, and then a third filtration by a 0.2 &#x3bc;m filter. The filtrate was subjected to ultra-centrifugation at 100,000 g for 1 hour, and pellets were collected and suspended in PBS containing protease inhibitors (Roche) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). For exosomes isolated from the milk above, protein concentrations of the isolated exosomes were measured using the BCA protein analysis kit (Bio-Rad) as described for Comparative Examples above.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example 2: Isolation of Exosomes from Colostrum</heading><p id="p-0173" num="0172">The present inventors isolated exosomes from colostrum by the same method as described in Example 1 above, except that colostrum (obtained from Lee Sung Young Chang-buk Ranch located at 20, Bongsangwandong 1-ro, Gyeseon-myeon, Changnyeong-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do) was used instead of commercial milk.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example 3: Improvement of Exosome Isolation Process</heading><p id="p-0174" num="0173">The method used in Examples 1 and 2 requires ultracentrifugation and performs sequential centrifugations several times, and thus has a disadvantage that it is time-consuming. In this context, the present inventors sought to develop a simpler and more efficient exosome isolation method.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">To this end, in particular, the present inventors have conceived a novel exosome isolation method through modifications to the previously reported method of isolating exosomes from milk (Yamauchi et al., Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm. 45(3): 359-364, 2019). The method reported by Yamauchi et al., above, utilizes the processes of performing centrifugation of raw milk at 2,000&#xd7;g at 4&#xb0; C. for 20 minutes to remove fat and cells (primary centrifugation), performing dilution by adding an equal volume of distilled water (distilled water dilution), performing titration to pH 4.6 by adding 6N HCl, thereby removing casein through isoelectric precipitation (isoelectric precipitation), performing centrifugation at 5,000&#xd7;g at room temperature for 20 minutes (second centrifugation), and performing filtration sequentially, using 1.0, 0.45, and 0.2 &#x3bc;m filters (sequential filtration). The present inventors have made to the above method the modifications to carry out the first centrifugation process at 5,000&#xd7;g at 4&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes, introduce a process of further removing fat and cells by prefiltering with a 40 &#x3bc;m strainer (Falcon&#xae;, Corning, USA) prior to dilution with distilled water, and after the second centrifugation, utilize a one-time filtration process using a 0.2 &#x3bc;m filter instead of performing the sequential filtrations.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Experimental Example 1: Analysis of Exosome Isolation Yields</heading><p id="p-0176" num="0175">Yields of the HEK293-derived exosomes isolated according to Comparative Example above, and exosomes respectively isolated from commercial milk and colostrum according to Examples 1 and 2 of the present invention were analyzed using the BCA protein assay kit (Bio-Rad).</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">As a result, as could be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>, it was found that the exosomes isolated from HEK293 cells showed an extremely low yield, whereas according to Example 1 of the present invention, an isolation yield of the commercial milk-derived exosomes was 0.05 mg/ml, which is about 5 times higher than the isolation yield of HEK293-derived exosomes of 0.01 mg/ml. In particular, the case of colostrum showed a yield of 0.45 mg/ml at the least, based on proteins, which is significantly high even when compared to the case of commercial milk.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">Meanwhile, as a result of isolating exosomes from milk using the method of Example 3, as could be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>, it could be confirmed that using the non-ultrafiltration exosome isolation method according to an example of the present invention results in a significantly higher yield compared to when using a ultrafiltration method.
