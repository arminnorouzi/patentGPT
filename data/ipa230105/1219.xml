In particular, to devices and methods for improving the clinical outcome of patients suffering from cardiac dysrhythmias without cardiac arrest.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Human beings may develop abnormal electrical rhythms of the heart without complete loss of hemodynamics, that is, without cardiac arrest. Among the most common is atrial fibrillation. Others include: atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and atrial, junctional or ventricular bradycardia, among others. In atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia, the heart rate may be too fast. In atrial, junctional, or ventricular bradycardia, it may be too slow. Ultimately, patients suffering these dysrhythmias may need an electrophysiologic procedure such as ablation or placement of a permanent pacemaker.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, before those definitive procedures, there may be a need to terminate these abnormal electrical rhythms with an electrical therapy that can be external transthoracic cardioversion or pacing, also referred to as acute electrical therapy. Throughout this discussion, the terms transthoracic and transcutaneous may be used interchangeably, and have a similar meaning, specifically the application of electromagnetic energy to myocardium by means of transcutaneous transthoracic countershock or pacing from one or more cutaneous electrode locations. When the term countershock is utilized it is intended to mean the transthoracic application of electrical energy with the intention of terminating a dysrhythmia such that a more normal cardiac rhythm is restored. Termination of atrial fibrillation has been called defibrillation. However, given that the intent of therapy for dysrhythmias is to convert the heart rhythm to a supraventricular organized regular perfusing rhythm, terms such as cardioversion are more accurate. The term defibrillation is often used in regard to countershock technology, and the equipment is often referred to as defibrillators, however, the terms countershock or cardioversion are more accurate. The term countershock refers to an electrical shock being applied to the heart. A device that is intended to enhance the probability that electrical cardioversion has occurred successfully and the heart has been changed from a certain state of dysrhythmia to a more organized rhythm is best described as a cardioverter. With respect to transthoracic pacing of the heart, the terms pacer, pacemaker are used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Both cardioversion and pacing are forms of Acute Electrical Therapy (AET), and as used herein, the terms electrical therapy, acute electrical therapy, and countershock can refer to cardioversion and/or pacing. Both cardioversion and pacing can work by delivering an electric shock through the thorax of a patient, also referred to as transthoracic cardioversion or pacing. Either form of acute electrical therapy can be delivered by a device that can be referred to as a Transthoracic Cardioverter Pacer (TCP). In some cases, a TCP can be a cardioverter that delivers electrical therapy in the form of cardioversion. In some cases, a TCP can be a pacer that electrical therapy in the form of pacing. In some cases, a TCP can provide cardioversion and/or pacing in different situations. As used herein, the term TCP can refer to a pacer, a cardioverter, or a combination pacer and/or cardioverter that can function as a pacer or a cardioverter in different situations.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Detection, recording, measurement, and analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG) is centrally important in detection and management of atrial fibrillation and other dysrhythmias, as taught in U.S. Pat. N. 4,184,493 to Langer, titled CIRCUIT FOR MONITORING A HEART AND FOR EFFECTING CARDIOVERSION OF A NEEDY HEART, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,946 to Mower, titled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CORRECTING ABNORMAL CARDIAC ACTIVITY BY LOW ENERGY SHOCKS, the entire teachings of which are both incorporated herein by reference. Said measurement may be an input into an analysis and control device, which may be standalone or a component of a multimodal device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The success of external cardioversion, countershock and transthoracic pacing is principally associated with improved current flow across or through the myocardium, which is itself a function of electrical potential, along with transthoracic and transcardiac resistances when using a direct current. Decreasing resistance is associated with improved current flow, and techniques which lower transthoracic resistance would generally increase the success of transthoracic countershock or pacing. The equivalent of transthoracic resistance when using alternating current is transthoracic impedance, and measurement of transthoracic impedance with a small current may be used as a surrogate indicator of transthoracic resistance.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Current flow through the chest during transthoracic countershock or pacing may not be linear from one electrode to another, but may also be nonlinear as a function of tissue and organ resistance, capacitance, or impedance. This pattern may be affected by mechanical processes such as chest compression, constriction, ventilation status, visceral organ hydration status, patient specific anatomy, and other factors (see below). Air is an insulator, so the ventilatory cycle of the lungs may affect transthoracic resistance and electrical countershock.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Different tissues have varying capacities for current flow, and this affects placement of electrodes. Of particular importance is the poor capacity of bone and air to carry current. Thus, skeletal structures, and the lungs tend to be avoided when applying electrodes externally.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Although multiple mechanical and physiologic alterations have been identified as means to enhance the efficacy of countershock or pacing, these techniques are rarely used. Currently, almost all transthoracic countershock or pacing is done via self-adhesive electrode pads. Little effort beyond alteration of electrical discharge itself or placement of the electrodes has been made to enhance the efficacy of transthoracic countershock or pacing.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Non-Electrical Means to Enhance Countershock</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some studies, the performance of countershock can be improved by using an anterior-posterior vector. (Kirchhof et al. 2002). In this scenario, one paddle is placed in the front of the patient, and another is placed posteriorly between the shoulder blades. Additionally, the efficacy of electrical countershock or pacing may be improved by application of multiple transthoracic pathways that are electrified near simultaneously or sequentially, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,174,061 to Freeman, titled MULTI-PATH TRANSTHORACIC DEFIBRILLATION AND CARDIOVERSION, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. The efficacy of electrical countershock may be significantly improved by application of countershock via multiple positive-negative electrode pairs, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,708,145 to Tacker Jr., titled SEQUENTIAL-PULSE, MULTIPLE PATHWAY DEFIBRILLATION METHOD, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. It is also known that changing the direction of current flow during the countershock or pacing may enhance efficacy.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Application of Force to Electrodes&#x2014;Transthoracic resistance to current flow may be lowered with the application of force on paddles or gel pads&#x2014;previously called paddle contact pressure. The transition from paddles to self-adhesive gel electrode pads may actually have negatively affected this parameter. The application of force on countershock paddles or electrodes, also referred to as paddle contact pressure, can result in a lowered transthoracic resistance to current flow. (Kerber et al. 1981). An increase in countershock paddle force can be associated with a decrease in transthoracic resistance and an increase in peak current. Clinically, the force that was historically applied manually to paddles to enhance contact force pressure and lower resistance tended to range between 90 and 250 Newtons.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The transition from paddles to adhesive gel pads may have negatively affected this parameter because providers did not physically apply contact pressure to the gel pads. It has been found that applying force to the adhesive gel electrodes can also lower transthoracic impedance, thereby improving it. (Ramirez et al. 2016). When paddle electrodes were being used, practitioners would apply force to enhance contact pressure and lower resistance. It has even been advised that clinicians apply a force similar to a &#x201c;push-up&#x201d; at the moment of electrical discharge. Various practitioners have demonstrated that applying force to the adhesive gel electrodes lowers transthoracic impedance and increases current flow across the myocardium. Such effects are associated with a greater fraction of dysrhythmia patients being successfully cardioverted or paced.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Ventilatory Cycle&#x2014;Air is an insulator, so the ventilatory cycle of the lungs may affect electrical countershock by means of affecting transthoracic resistance. It has been found that an association exists between the ventilatory cycle and transthoracic impedance. (Ewy et al. 1980). An association has been found between the ventilatory cycle and transthoracic impedance, with higher transthoracic impedances with inspiration, and a significant decrease in countershock success when shocks were delivered in inspiration compared to expiration. Physiologically, electrical countershock may be more effective if it is timed to synchronize with the lungs at maximal expiration.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">While control of the ventilatory cycle is straightforward in intubated patients receiving mechanical ventilation, placing the thorax in exhalation to advantage countershock or pacing may be more difficult in patient not under the control of mechanical ventilation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Previously, others have achieved partial exhalation using transcutaneous functional electrical stimulation (FES). FES is the application of electrical pulses to the motor nerve of a muscle causing the muscle to contract, as described in US Patent Publication No. 2002/0128686 to Minogue, titled ELECTROTHERAPY DEVICE AND METHOD, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. Transcutaneous FES has been used to assist respiratory function. FES of the abdominal muscles, in particular the rectus abdominis, acts to assist exhalation</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Vibrational or Acoustic Energy&#x2014;An additional non-electrical transthoracic mechanism that may affect the status of the myocardium is application vibrational or acoustic energy. Acoustic, ultrasound and vibrational energy are the same in nature and differ only in their frequencies. As used herein, the term vibrational energy can include both acoustic and ultrasound energy. This technique has been proposed as: 1) a sole-therapy alternative to electrical countershock, as discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,006,864 to Echt, titled METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIBRATIONAL TREATMENT OF CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference, and 2) as a means for transthoracic pacing (Towe 2006), and 3) as means for both defibrillation and pacing, as disclosed in US Patent Publication No. 2010/0094149 to Kohut, titled NONINVASIVE ULTRASOUND CARDIAC PACEMAKER AND DEFIBRILLATOR, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. Ultrasound is a type of acoustic energy which is widely used for imaging and therapy in medicine. In particular, it is utilized for imaging of the heart. It has also been appreciated that acoustic, ultrasound or vibratory energy might be combined with electrical energy to more efficiently and effectively achieve defibrillation or pacing, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,809,438 to Echt, titled METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR TREATING ARRHYTHMIAS USING A COMBINATION OF VIBRATIONAL AND ELECTRICAL ENERGY, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The optimal parameters of acoustical energy for transthoracic countershock or pacing are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 7,006,864, Table 3 to have efficacy optima. More specifically, there were optimal patterns with respect to: Frequency (MHz) Burst length (cycles), Burst rate (Hz), Duty cycle (%)Duration (msec) and Myocardial Coverage (%).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="147pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Cardioversion and Defibrillation</entry><entry>Pacing</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Preferred</entry><entry>Most Preferred</entry><entry>Most Preferred</entry><entry>Most Preferred</entry></row><row><entry>Parameter</entry><entry>Implementation</entry><entry>Implementation</entry><entry>Implementation</entry><entry>Implementation</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Frequency (MHz)</entry><entry>0.020-10.0</entry><entry>0.050-1.00</entry><entry>0.100-0.300</entry><entry>0.25-0.50</entry></row><row><entry>Burst length</entry><entry>&#x3c;5000</entry><entry>&#x3c;500</entry><entry>&#x3c;50</entry><entry>&#x3c;50</entry></row><row><entry>(cycles)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Burst rate (Hz)</entry><entry>&#x3e;10</entry><entry>&#x2265;100</entry><entry>&#x2265;100</entry><entry>Single burst</entry></row><row><entry>Duty cycle (%)</entry><entry>&#x3c;50</entry><entry>&#x3c;10</entry><entry>&#x3c;5</entry><entry>100</entry></row><row><entry>Duration (msec)</entry><entry>&#x3c;200</entry><entry>&#x3c;50</entry><entry>&#x3c;20</entry><entry>&#x3c;0.20</entry></row><row><entry>No. of cardiac</entry><entry>as required</entry><entry>&#x3c;5</entry><entry>&#x3c;15</entry><entry>All</entry></row><row><entry>cycles</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>MI</entry><entry>&#x3c;50</entry><entry>&#x3c;25</entry><entry>&#x3c;15</entry><entry>&#x3c;2</entry></row><row><entry>TI</entry><entry>&#x3c;4</entry><entry>&#x3c;1</entry><entry>&#x3c;1</entry><entry>&#x3c;0.1</entry></row><row><entry>Myocardial Coverage</entry><entry>&#x3e;50</entry><entry>&#x3e;75</entry><entry>&#x3c;90</entry><entry>&#x3c;20</entry></row><row><entry>Cardiac cycles from</entry><entry>&#x3c;10</entry><entry>&#x3c;5</entry><entry>&#x3c;2</entry><entry>0 or 1</entry></row><row><entry>sense to trigger</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">In using acoustical or vibratory energy for countershock or pacing, it is generally believed that the acoustic energy should be directed such that it engages the largest possible fraction of the cardiac anatomy involved in the dysrhythmia. Avoidance of bony structures, such as the sternum or ribs, or air containing structures such as the lungs, may be associated with greater acoustical energy reaching the myocardium. However, vibrational or acoustic mechanisms to achieve countershock or pacing may be less effective than electrical countershock and has not been developed for use clinically.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">Nerve Stimulation: Vagal nerve stimulation for the treatment of numerous medical conditions is widely known, and it has already been recognized that vagal nerve stimulation may be used to prevent or treat atrial fibrillation and other cardiac rhythm disorders, as taught in US Patent Publication No. 2013/0131746 to Simon, titled NON-INVASIVE VAGUS NERVE STIMULATION DEVICES AND METHODS TO TREAT OR AVERT ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. When undertaken noninvasively, vagal nerve stimulation can be accomplished transcutaneously by means of electrical stimulation. However, it is also possible to stimulate the vagal nerve by means of acoustic, ultrasound or vibratory energy. (see Yap et a12020 the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021">It is also well known that stimulation of the vagus nerve is inhibitory of the cardiovascular system in general and the transcutaneous stimulation of the vagus nerve may be utilized for treatment of atrial fibrillation in particular. This may be done transcutaneously at the ear or neck. As a specific example, transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the auricular branch of the right vagus nerve at the tragus of the ear has been demonstrated to suppress atrial fibrillation. Anatomical studies of the ear indicate that the tragus, concha, and cymba concha may be used for vagal nerve stimulation. Alternatively, the nerve may be electrically stimulated transcutaneously at the neck, with electrodes placed near the sternocleidomastoid muscle.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">ECG Predictors of Countershock Success: Treatments for atrial fibrillation have risks associated with them. Pharmacological cardioversion (termination of the dysrhythmia with drugs) exposes the patient to the toxicities of the drugs. Principal among these is QT prolongation, which can degenerate to Torsade de pointes, which is hemodynamically unstable. There is an old adage that every antiarrhythmic may also be proarrhythmic. In some respects, electrical cardioversion may appear safer because it is not associated with these pharmacologic risks. However, the pain of cardioversion, and in some cases transthoracic pacing, requires the use of sedation or even general anesthesia, which have significant inherent risks. Because of these inherent toxicities, there has been some effort to identify methods to predict the likelihood of efficacy.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">Zeemering et al. (The electrocardiogram as a predictor of successful pharmacological cardioversion and progression of atrial fibrillation 2017) studied the predictive power of various metrics of atrial fibrillation. They considered both clinical patient descriptions (weight, heart volume, etc.) and ECG-derived measurements which had &#x201c;appeared frequently in the last decade of non-invasive AF complexity literature.&#x201d; They concluded that the predictive power of the ECG metrics were generally &#x201c;superior&#x201d; to the clinical metrics, but that only a few of these ECG metrics were useful. The best predictions were yielded by combining ECG metrics with classic metrics of patient physiology.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">Zeemering et al. conducted a statistical analysis of the predictive power of all possible combinations of ECG metrics, and showed the best-performing parameter combination included DF(II), SE(1),FWA(aVF,V1), MOI(V(3+4),V(3+5)). &#x201c;Lead&#x201d; refers to which of the twelve ECG electrodes on the patient the signal comes from. The best model in the first of five categories, single lead frequency domain, uses the dominant frequency at lead 2, the organization index at lead 3, and the spectral entropy at lead 1. It has an AUC of 0.72. Zeemering et al also listed the best-performing single metric (Spectral Variability), the best-performing metric (single or combination) from a single lead (Dominant Frequency at lead 2, Organization Index at lead 3, and Spectral Entropy at lead 1), and the best-performing single metric from a single lead (Dominant Frequency at lead 2). None of these outperform the &#x201c;Combined&#x201d; parameter model.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">Current Techniques Often Ineffective&#x2014;While transthoracic electrical countershock or pacing are often effective in terminating dysrhythmias in patients with perfusing hemodynamics, these therapies are not always successful. In almost every series cases published, approximately 10% of patients in whom transthoracic cardioversion is attempted electrically remain in the dysrhythmia. The rate at which transthoracic pacing fails is not as well known, but failure to capture the heart electrically and or mechanically is quite common. These significant failure rates are despite significant effort at improving the transthoracic countershock or pacing electrical waveform.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">Failed transthoracic cardioversion is problematical in part because patients need to be sedated because of the pain caused by the electrical discharge. When the dysrhythmia is not terminated, the patient remains in a pathological circulatory state and has been subjected to the risks of sedation without benefit. When transthoracic pacing fails to capture the myocardium, the patient may be left hypotensive and require emergency placement of a transvenous pacer.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">It would be desirable to have a device for use during countershock or pacing of patients not in cardiac arrest that can enhance the efficacy of cardiac countershock or pacing through the application of various multimodal systems.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0028">This present disclosure overcomes disadvantages of the prior art by providing a method, apparatus, and multimodal system to improve the efficacy of transthoracic cardioversion or pacing in patients with a perfusing circulation. This may be achieved by a method and/or device that integrates automatic mechanical, pneumatic, acoustic and electrophysiologic capabilities with electrical countershock or pacing capabilities such that the probability of successful cardioversion is increased. The sequence, forces, and electrical properties of the subsystems can be computer controlled. The control system may use pre-defined a priori sequences or may optimize all components based on biomarker or subsystem status feedback. As used herein, &#x201c;a priori&#x201d; refers to parameters, conditions, timing, sequences, etc. that have been previously determined to be effective, and can be pre-programed into the device so that they can be applied by the device immediately and automatically at the beginning of treatment. As used herein, &#x201c;optimization&#x201d; refers to the process of improving parameters in an iterative process that works towards ideal parameters. Optimization can mean iteratively adjusting and updating various parameters in response to biomarkers or other data collected from sensors that can be part of afferent limbs and/or effector limbs, explained more fully below.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">As such, the device is intended to enhance the acute efficacy of both the cardiac electrical therapies of cardioversion (including defibrillation) and pacing by means of synchronizing adjunctive interventions. Such a device and/or method may be called an Cardiac Electrical Therapy Efficacy Enhancement System (CETEES). Devices and subsystems intended to achieve cardioversion or defibrillation will, for the purposes of this description, be referred to as cardioverters. Devices and subsystems intended to capture and achieve cardiac peacemaking will, for the purposes of this description, be referred to as pacers or pacemakers interchangeably. In various embodiments, the electrical subsystem that delivers an electric shock intended to achieve cardioversion or pacing of the heart may be combined into a single cardioversion-pacemaker subsystem that can be referred to as a Transthoracic Cardioverter Pacer (TCP). As used herein, the term TCP can describe a cardioverter, a pacemaker, and/or a combined cardioverter and pacemaker that have been combined into a single system capable of either function. The patterns of electrical discharge from such a subsystem may be determined by a connected controller.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">Because multiple interventions may enhance countershock or pacing, a multimodal device may be utilized. Multimodal medical devices may have an overall structure that includes biomarker based afferent limbs, control modules, and effector limbs. During dysrhythmias, it is common to measure one or more biomarkers chosen from a list that includes: ECG, ECG derived biomarkers such as fast-Fourier transform based power spectra, ET-CO2, indicators of tissue oxygenation or energetics (i.e. NIRS), indicators of hemodynamics such as photoplethysmography, among others.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">Most electromechanical medical devices have control modules that may be similar to a modern digital computer, or may be operator based. Afferent limbs may be subsystems that provide measurements to the control module. Afferent limbs can also be referred to as afferent subsystems. Afferent limbs inputting to the control module may include measurements of clinically relevant biomarkers such as ECG, cardiovascular photoplethysmography, measure of ventilatory status, and others. Effector limbs may also be referred to as effector subsystems. Effector limbs may be those subsystems that affect the status of the patient in some manner. The overall system may be closed loop in which the effect of the effector subsystems is measured by the afferent limb and the control module subsequently adjusts the effector subsystems.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">The present disclosure overcomes disadvantages of the prior art by enhancing the efficacy of transthoracic countershock or pacing using self-adhesive gel electrode pads by means of increased contact pressure, synchronization with ventilation, utilization of multiple current paths, vibrational or acoustic energy, vagal stimulation or other mechanical or physiological means.

Such separate devices are common clinically. A CETEES can include an integrated countershock cardioverter and/or transthoracic pacemaker. The countershock cardioverter and/or transthoracic pacemaker can be a single device that can perform both functions, or the countershock and/or transthoracic pacemaker can be distinct devices. In the interest of brevity, as used herein, the terms countershock, cardioverter, countershock cardioverter, and pacemaker may be used interchangeably, and the use of a single term may include each term.

The countershock system can do more than simply charge the electrodes and release current from the storage capacitors. It can further interface with the control processor, provide status data to the controller, and receiving instructions from the controller. In various embodiments, it can countershock via multiple positive-negative electrode pairs.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0160">In various embodiments, a CETEES can control the combinations of electrode pads that are electrically discharged by the cardioverter such that that current is released from one or more combinations of electrode pads, so that the CETEES can utilize multiple paths across the chest. Multiple electrode pads can be used to create multiple transthoracic pathways through the patient. The use of multiple paths can include applying two or more counter shocks simultaneously along paths that are at an angle to each other. In various embodiments, two counter shocks can be delivered simultaneously along paths that can be at a 90&#xb0; angle to one another.

In various embodiments, one of the electrode pairs may include a positive or negative electrode within the esophagus of the patient. In various embodiments, the CETEES can have one pair of countershock electrodes, or can have more than two countershock electrodes, and in various embodiments the CETEES can have four or more countershock electrodes.

These systems can apply force to an electrode <b>302</b> to push the electrode against the patient <b>110</b> and/or apply force to the patient to push the patient against the electrode. In various embodiments, electrode contract force can be enhanced by a circumferential constrictor subsystem <b>306</b> that can include a pneumatic or hydraulic bladder, a series of bladders, and/or a constricting band to push on electrode pads at the moment of electrical discharge. Various combinations of those mechanisms can also be incorporated together. In various embodiments, selective or full circumferential enhancement of contact force pressure may be achieved by pneumatic or hydraulic means, and/or by mechanical means such as screws or piston mechanisms.

In the human thorax, the lungs can act as air-based insulators during countershock. There is a strong relationship between the phase of ventilation and the transthoracic resistance. The circumferential constriction mechanisms or electrode contact force enhancers of the CETEES may alter the ventilatory state of the lungs at, just before, or throughout the moment of electrical discharge so as to lower transthoracic resistance. More specifically, this subsystem can force exhalation, minimize lung volume, and minimize the diameter of the thorax by placing the lungs in a state of maximal expiration at the time of countershock or pacing electrical discharge.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0168">Incorporation of electrodes into the patient facing surface of a circumferential constrictor can allow both enhanced electrode contact pressure and ventilatory end-exhalation for improved transthoracic resistance and countershock success.

In various embodiments, FES of the rectus abdominis can act to assist exhalation. If a patient is having their breathing assisted by a ventilator, the ventilator can also act as a lung volume minimizer. The ventilation can be synchronized with the countershocks to deliver countershocks during a period of minimum lung volume. Synchronization of the ventilator and the countershocks can include delivering countershocks during the optimal expiratory phase of ventilation, at the moment in a ventilation cycle when the lung volume is at a minimum. Synchronization of the ventilator and the countershocks can include delivering countershocks at the moment before forced inspiration. Synchronization of the vent ilator and countershocks can also include delaying forced inspiration until after the countershock. Maximal exhalation may be achieved by one or multiple means.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">Vagal Nerve Stimulation Subsystem</heading><p id="p-0115" num="0170">Separately or in combination with other interventions, a CETEES device may place the myocardium into a state more amenable to cardioversion or pacing by means of vagal stimulation. Application of electrical vagal nerve stimulation may help to suppress episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Adjunctive application of vagal nerve stimulation may be used to increase the likelihood of successful electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and/or to increase the efficacy of transthoracic pacing. With respect to vagal nerve stimulation energy may begin to be applied: 1) for a period of time before electrical countershock, 2) coincident with electrical countershock, 3) after electrical countershock, 4) a combination of these phases. Because the effect of vagal nerve stimulation likely takes time intervals on the order of minutes to affect the electrophysiologic state of the myocardium, the synchronization relationship that is likely most effective would be for vagal stimulation to initiate 5 to 10 minutes for countershock or pacing.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="1">Sequencing of Subsystems</heading><p id="p-0116" num="0171">The different subsystems have differing time course kinetics for their salutary effect on countershock and pacing thresholds.

In various embodiments, these measurements can be collected through the countershock electrodes. Such a control system can optimize electrical countershock by adjusting the parameters of the electrical countershock based on the measurement of one or more of thoracic resistance, capacitance, impedance, or current flow.

The term &#x201c;algorithm&#x201d; will be utilized in reference to the clinically useful mathematical equations or computer programs produced by the process disclosed. It should be clear that the present disclosure is not describing the application of a particular known algorithm in a clinical setting, but rather the present disclosure provides a method of developing new patient-specific algorithms, individualized for each patient, in real time for each patient as that patient is receiving treatment. This allows for the treatment efficacy to be improved as the treatment is taking place.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0203">The performance of machine learning derived algorithms can be independent of the specific in silico software routine used for its derivation. The numerous specific in silico techniques may be categorized as supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, and association rule learning, statistical classification, partition and hierarchical clustering, and deep learning techniques, among others. Among the most commonly used are the various forms of regression, including multiple linear and logistic regressions. If the same training data set is used, techniques as different as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, association rule learning, hierarchical clustering, multiple linear and logistic regressions are likely to produce algorithms whose clinical performance is indistinguishable or nearly indistinguishable.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0204">Although the techniques of machine learning are to a great extent interchangeable, the independence of the individual variables used in the model is more important.
