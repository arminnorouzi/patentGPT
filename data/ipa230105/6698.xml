Furthermore, 5G cellular communications systems are expected to support of a variety of services and use cases, from low power/low cost Machine Type Communication (MTC) up to &#x201c;fiber replacement&#x201d; Mobile Broadband (MBB) services with data rates above 1 gigabits per second (Gb/s). The latter use case requires high system bandwidth, and hence will be deployed on carriers at 10 GHz and higher. Furthermore, enhanced MBB typically needs higher order modulation (e.g., 64/256/1024&#x2014;Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)) and good Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). High SNRs can be achieved by utilizing massive antenna and beam forming techniques. All in all, such a use case will set very tough requirements on the radio of the wireless device and impairments. For example, phase noise introduced at the radio of the wireless device will need to be small for high carrier frequencies beyond 10 GHz.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this regard, the receiver of the wireless device includes the Phase Locked Loop (PLL) that controls a Controlled Oscillator (CO) to generate the Local Oscillator (LO) signal used by the receiver. The CO typically dominates power consumption and phase noise and, as such, the CO serves as a good reference for the understanding of phase noise at high frequencies. The CO performance is commonly captured through a Figure of Merit (FoM) allowing for a comparison of different CO implementations and is defined by</p><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>F</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mi>o</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mi>M</mi>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mrow>    <mi>P</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>N</mi>      <mrow>       <mi>C</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>O</mi>      </mrow>     </msub>     <mo>(</mo>     <mi>df</mi>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mrow>   <mo>-</mo>   <mrow>    <mn>20</mn>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mrow>     <mi>log</mi>     <mo>&#x2061;</mo>     <mo>(</mo>     <mfrac>      <msub>       <mi>f</mi>       <mi>o</mi>      </msub>      <mi>df</mi>     </mfrac>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mrow>   <mo>+</mo>   <mrow>    <mn>10</mn>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mrow>     <mi>log</mi>     <mo>&#x2061;</mo>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>P</mi>       <mi>DC</mi>      </msub>      <mo>/</mo>      <mn>1</mn>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mi>mW</mi>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">Here PN<sub>CO</sub>(df) is the phase noise of the CO in decibels relative to the carrier per Hertz (dBc/Hz) at a frequency offset df with oscillation frequency f<sub>o </sub>(both in Hertz (Hz)) and power consumption P<sub>DC </sub>in milliwatts (mW). One noticeable result of this expression is that both phase noise and power consumption in linear power are proportional to f<sub>o</sub><sup>2</sup>. Thus, to maintain a phase noise level at a certain offset while increasing f<sub>o </sub>by a factor R would require the power to be increased by R<sup>2 </sup>(assuming a fixed FoM). Conversely, for a fixed power consumption and FoM the phase noise will increase by R<sup>2</sup>, or 6 decibels (dB) per every doubling of f<sub>o</sub>.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">The FoM definition aims to be frequency agnostic but, in practice, there is an additional implementation penalty associated with higher frequencies as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> where FoM of recently published Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) designs in Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology are compared. The penalty is roughly 10 dB/decade.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">Thus, preserving a low phase noise level at higher frequencies calls for a reevaluation of the design of the PLL. One way to further suppress the phase noise from the CO is to increase the PLL bandwidth. In doing so, the phase noise will, to a larger extent, be determined by phase from the PLL as such and possibly even more from the reference crystal oscillator (XO). The phase noise level from the XO referred to the CO output is &#x201c;amplified&#x201d; by the frequency ratio 20 log<sub>10 </sub>(f<sub>o</sub>/f<sub>XO</sub>) [dB]. This phase noise amplification and the need for a larger PLL bandwidth both call for an increased XO frequency as compared to that of XOs conventionally used in wireless devices, such as smart phones. Specifically, the XOs conventionally used in wireless devices typically have a reference frequency in the range of 20-40 megahertz (MHz). However, in order to preserve a low phase noise level for carrier frequencies of 10 GHz and above by mitigating phase noise amplification and using a larger PLL bandwidth, a XO frequency of 100 MHz or more is needed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">This increase in XO frequency from less than 50 MHz to greater than or equal to 100 MHz is a discontinuous step with regards to manufacturing and mechanical structure of the resonator (crystal) used in the XO. These high frequency XOs comes with some issues and drawbacks over the conventional 20-40 MHz XOs. For instance, frequency tolerance, variations versus temperature, and aging are each much larger for a high frequency XO as compared to a 20-40 MHz XO. As an example, a 26 MHz XO may have a tolerance of 10 parts-per-million (ppm), while a &#x3e;100 MHz XO may have a tolerance of 40-50 ppm. Another disadvantage is that the power consumption of a high frequency XO may be 5 to 10 times greater than that of a 20-40 MHz XO.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">Thus, there is a need for systems and methods for mitigating the issues (e.g., lower tolerance and increased power consumption) associated with a high frequency XO when implemented as a reference for a PLL of a wireless device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0010">Systems and methods are disclosed herein that relate to a wireless device that intelligently uses different reference crystal oscillators (XOs) for a Phase Locked Loop(s) (PLL(s)) in a transceiver of the wireless device.

Some examples of a radio access node include, but are not limited to, a base station (e.g., an enhanced or evolved Node B (eNB) in a Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) network), a g Node B (i.e., Fifth Generation (5G), Next Generation, or New Radio (NR) eNB), a high-power or macro base station, a low-power base station (e.g., a micro base station, a pico base station, a home eNB, or the like), and a relay node.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">Core Network Node: As used herein, a &#x201c;core network node&#x201d; is any type of node in a Core Network (CN). Some examples of a core network node include, e.g., a Mobility Management Entity (MME), a Packet Data Network (PDN) Gateway (P-GW), a Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF), or the like.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">Wireless Device: As used herein, a &#x201c;wireless device&#x201d; is any type of device that has access to (i.e., is served by) a cellular communications network by wirelessly transmitting and/or receiving signals to a radio access node(s). Some examples of a wireless device include, but are not limited to, a User Equipment device (UE) in a 3GPP network and a Machine Type Communication (MTC) device.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">Network Node: As used herein, a &#x201c;network node&#x201d; is any node that is either part of the radio access network or the CN of a cellular communications network/system.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">Note that the description given herein focuses on a 3GPP cellular communications system and, as such, 3GPP LTE terminology or terminology similar to 3GPP LTE terminology is oftentimes used. However, the concepts disclosed herein are not limited to LTE or a 3GPP system.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">Note that, in the description herein, reference may be made to the term &#x201c;cell;&#x201d; however, particularly with respect to 5G concepts, beams may be used instead of cells and, as such, it is important to note that the concepts described herein are equally applicable to both cells and beams.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">Systems and methods are disclosed herein that relate to a wireless device that uses two reference crystal oscillators (XOs) for a Phase Locked Loop(s) (PLL(s)) in a transceiver of the wireless device. The two XOs include a first XO having a rust reference frequency and a second XO having a second reference frequency that is greater than the first reference frequency. For example, in one embodiment, the first reference frequency is less than 52 megahertz (MHz) (e.g., in the range of and including 20 to 40 MHz) and the second reference frequency is greater than or equal to 100 MHz. The wireless device decides whether to use the first XO or the second XO based on, e.g., whether the wireless device is in an Out-of-Sync (OOS) state or an in-sync state with respect to a wireless communications network, a connection state of the wireless device with respect to the wireless communication network, and/or a carrier frequency at which the transceiver of the wireless device is configured.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">As one example, in some embodiments, the wireless device configures a transceiver(s) of the wireless device to use the first XO during an initial synchronization procedure by which the wireless device synchronizes to a wireless communications network. During the initial synchronization procedure, phase noise requirements are not so stringent since synchronization signals transmitted by the wireless communications network should be able to be detected at low Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs), and hence are typically modulated using a robust modulation scheme (e.g., Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) or are robust in other way(s) (e.g., only a few possible known sequences for the synchronization signals). Once initial synchronization is made towards a radio access node in the wireless communications system, the wireless device configures the transceiver(s) to use the second XO. In some embodiments, prior to configuring the transceiver(s) to use the second XO, the first XO is tuned towards the carrier frequency of the radio access node, or alternatively a de-rotator is used compensate for the frequency error in the digital domain. As yet another alternative, the divider used in the PLL can be adjusted so as to compensate for the incorrect XO frequency. Note that, regardless of which technique is used to tune the first XO, they all have the same effect with regards to the resulting baseband receive signal in the digital domain being correctly down-converted from RF. Then, the second XO is enabled and tuned (or locked in another PLL) towards the first XO and carrier frequency of the radio access node. Once the second XO has been tuned, the wireless device configures the transceiver(s) to use the second XO for the active operation of the PLL(s) in the wireless device. Hence, the higher frequency, second XO can fulfill the more stringent phase noise requirements needed for high data rate transmission and reception using a carrier frequency of 10 gigahertz (GHz) or higher. In some embodiments, the above procedure is repeated when the wireless device determines that a re-sync is needed due to long Discontinuous Reception (DRX) cycles, detection of large temperature variations, etc.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates one example of a wireless communications system in which embodiments of the present disclosure may be implemented. In this example, the wireless communications system is a cellular communications system <b>10</b>. The cellular communications system <b>10</b> includes a Radio Access Network (RAN) <b>12</b> that includes a number of radio access nodes <b>14</b> (e.g., base stations, eNBs, gNBs, or the like) serving corresponding cells <b>16</b> or beams. The radio access nodes <b>14</b> provide wireless connectivity (i.e., radio access) to wireless devices <b>18</b> (e.g., UEs, MTC devices, or the like). The radio access nodes <b>14</b> are connected to one another via a corresponding interface (e.g., an X2 interface in 3GPP) and connected to a core network <b>20</b> via a core network interface (e.g., a S1 interface in 3GPP).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates one example of the wireless device <b>18</b> according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. Note that in this example, the wireless device <b>18</b> is illustrated as including a receiver <b>22</b>. Note, however, that the concepts disclosed herein are equally applicable to the use of XOs to generate Local Oscillator (LO) signals for a transmitter(s) and/or receiver(s) of the wireless device <b>18</b>. As illustrated, the wireless device <b>18</b> includes the receiver <b>22</b>, a control unit <b>24</b>, a first XO (XO<b>1</b>) <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> that outputs a reference signal having a first reference frequency, a second XO (XO<b>2</b>) <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> that outputs a reference signal having a second reference frequency that is greater than the first reference frequency, and a XO<b>2</b> control system <b>28</b>. As an example, the first reference frequency is less than 52 MHz (e.g., in the range of and including 20 to 40 MHz), and the second reference frequency is greater than or equal to 100 MHz. The control unit <b>24</b> is implemented in hardware or a combination of hardware and software. For example, the control unit <b>24</b> may be implemented as a processing circuit that includes one or more processors (e.g., Central Processing Units (CPUs), Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), or the like), where the processing circuit executes software that causes the control unit <b>24</b> to thereby provide the functionality of the control unit <b>24</b> described herein.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">While the receiver <b>22</b> may include various analog and digital circuits, in the illustrated example, the receiver <b>22</b> includes an antenna(s) <b>30</b>, a Band-Pass Filter (BPF) <b>32</b>, a Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA) <b>34</b>, a mixer <b>36</b>, a BPF <b>38</b>, an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) <b>40</b>, and a digital processor <b>42</b>. In addition, the receiver <b>22</b> includes a Radio Frequency (RF) PLL <b>44</b> that controls a Controlled Oscillator (CO) <b>46</b> to provide a LO signal to the mixer <b>36</b>. In operation, a RF receive signal is received via the antenna <b>30</b> and filtered by the BPF <b>32</b> to thereby provide a filtered, RF receive signal. The filtered, RF receive signal is amplified by the LNA <b>34</b> to provide an amplified and filtered RF receive signal, which is then downconverted from RF to, in this example, baseband at the mixer <b>36</b>. In order to provide this downconversion from RF to baseband, the RF PLL <b>44</b> is configured by the control unit <b>24</b> such that, based on a reference frequency provided by either the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> or the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> depending on the configuration, the LO signal output by the CO <b>46</b> is equal to the carrier frequency fC of a desired receive signal. Note, however, that downconversion may alternatively be to a desired Intermediate Frequency (IF), in which case the frequency of the LO signal generated by the CO <b>46</b> is controlled to be the appropriate frequency needed for downconversion from fC to the desired IF.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">As discussed below, the control unit <b>24</b> configures the receiver <b>22</b> to use either the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> or the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> based on one or more criteria. The one or more criteria may include, for example, a synchronization state of the wireless device <b>18</b>, a connection state of the wireless device <b>18</b> (e.g., Radio Resource Control (RRC) IDLE or RRC CONNECTED), and/or the carrier frequency fC of the desired receive signal (i.e., the carrier frequency of the radio access node <b>14</b>). Thus, in one configuration, the control unit <b>24</b> configures the RF PLL <b>44</b> to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>. In the illustrated example, this configuration of the RF PLL <b>44</b> to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> includes closing a switch <b>48</b>-<b>1</b> and configuring settings (e.g., divider value(s)) of the RF PLL <b>44</b> such that the RF PLL <b>44</b> will control the CO <b>46</b> to provide the desired LO frequency based on the reference frequency of the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>. In another configuration, the control unit <b>24</b> configures the RF PLL <b>44</b> to use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>. In the illustrated example, this configuration of the RF PLL <b>44</b> to use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> includes closing a switch <b>48</b>-<b>2</b> and configuring settings (e.g., divider value(s)) of the RF PLL <b>44</b> such that the RF PLL <b>44</b> will control the CO <b>46</b> to provide the desired LO frequency based on the reference frequency of the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>. In some embodiments, prior to configuring the receiver <b>22</b> to use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>, the XO<b>2</b> control system <b>28</b>, which may be implemented as a PLL, is enabled and operates to adapt the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> based on the signal output by the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>. In this case, the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> has previously be adapted, or tuned, according to the carrier frequency of the radio access node <b>14</b> and, as such, can be used to provide initial adaptation, or tuning, of the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> prior to the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> being connected to the RF PLL <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">Thus, the control unit <b>24</b> can intelligently control which of the XOs <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> is used by the receiver <b>22</b> based on the one or more criteria. In doing so, various advantages can be realized. For example, the control unit <b>24</b> can configure the receiver <b>22</b> to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and deactivate the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> when in an OOS (out-of-sync) state, when in IDLE mode, and/or when operating at a low carrier frequency (e.g., fC&#x3c;4 GHz or, as another example, fC&#x3c;10 GHz) and configure the receiver <b>22</b> to use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and optionally deactivate the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> when in an in-sync state, when in a connected mode, and/or when operating at a high carrier frequency (e.g., fC&#x2265;4 GHz or, as another example, fC&#x2265;10 GHz). In this manner, power consumption can be reduced and, in some embodiments, the amount of time needed to synchronize to the network can be reduced by using the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, which has a smaller tolerance than the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>, during synchronization. Note that these advantages are only examples.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">Note that while the use of the XOs <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> is illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> as being used by the RF PLL <b>44</b> for controlling the LO signal for the receiver <b>22</b>, the XOs <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> may additionally or alternatively be used by an RF PLL to provide a LO signal used for upconversion in a transmitter (not shown) of the wireless device <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow chart that illustrates the operation of the wireless device <b>18</b> and, in particular, the control unit <b>24</b> to control the receiver <b>22</b> to use either the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> or the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. Optional steps are illustrated in dashed boxes. As illustrated, the control unit <b>24</b> decides whether the receiver <b>22</b> should be configured to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> or the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> (step <b>100</b>). As discussed below, in some embodiments, this decision is based on a synchronization state of the wireless device <b>18</b> towards a radio access node <b>14</b>, a connection state of the wireless device <b>18</b> (e.g., RRC IDLE (Dormant State) or RRC CONNECTED or similar states), and/or the carrier frequency fC of the desired receive signal (i.e., the carrier frequency of the radio access node <b>14</b>). More specifically, in some embodiments, the control unit <b>24</b> decides that the receiver <b>22</b> is to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> if the wireless device <b>18</b> is in an OOS state and use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> if the wireless device <b>18</b> is in an in-sync state. In some other embodiments, the control unit <b>24</b> decides that the receiver <b>22</b> is to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> if the wireless device <b>18</b> is in one connection state (e.g., an idle or dormant state) and use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> if the wireless device <b>18</b> is in another state (e.g., a connected or active state). In some other embodiments, the control unit <b>24</b> decides that the receiver <b>22</b> is to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> if the carrier frequency fC used by the radio access node <b>14</b> is less than a predefined or preconfigured threshold (e.g., 4 GHz or 10 GHz) and use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> if the carrier frequency f<sub>C </sub>is greater than or equal to the predefined or preconfigured threshold.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">The control unit <b>24</b> then configures the receiver <b>22</b> in accordance with the decision made in step <b>100</b>. More specifically, upon deciding that the receiver <b>22</b> is to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, the control unit <b>24</b> activates the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> by e.g., asserting the XO activation signal (see XO<b>1</b> ACT/DEACT in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) if the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is not already activated (step <b>102</b>). Note that, in some embodiments, the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is always activated, in which case step <b>102</b> does not need to be performed. In some other embodiments, the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> may at times be deactivated, in which case the control unit <b>24</b> activates the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> if the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is not already activated.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">Once the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is activated, the control unit <b>24</b> configures the receiver <b>22</b> to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> (step <b>104</b>). The exact manner in which the receiver <b>22</b> is configured to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> will vary depending on the particular implementation of the receiver <b>22</b>, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. However, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the control unit <b>24</b> configures the receiver <b>22</b> to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> by connecting the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> to the RF PLL <b>44</b> by, in this example, closing the switch <b>48</b>-<b>1</b> and configuring the RF PLL <b>44</b> (e.g., configuring one or more settings of the RF PLL <b>44</b> such as, for example, one or more divider values) based on the frequency of the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> such that the CO <b>46</b> is controlled to provide the desired LO frequency. As a simple, non-limiting example, the output frequency of the CO <b>46</b> is controlled by the RF PLL <b>44</b> to be N times the reference frequency. So, if the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is connected to the RF PLL <b>44</b>, the RF PLL <b>44</b> controls the CO <b>46</b> such that the output frequency of the CO <b>46</b> is N times the frequency of the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>. Therefore, in this example, the control unit <b>24</b> configures the parameter N of the RF PLL <b>44</b> such that N times the frequency of the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is equal to the desired LO frequency, which for direct downconversion to baseband is equal to the carrier frequency fC. After configuring the receiver <b>22</b> to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, the control unit <b>24</b> optionally deactivates the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> if the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> was active by, e.g., de-asserting the XO<b>2</b> ACT/DEACT signal (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) (step <b>106</b>). By deactivating the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>, power consumption is reduced.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">Returning to step <b>100</b>, upon deciding that the receiver <b>22</b> is to use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>, the control unit <b>24</b> activates the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> by e.g., asserting the XO activation signal (see XO<b>1</b> ACT/DEACT in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) if the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is not already activated (step <b>108</b>). Note that, in some embodiments, the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is always activated, in which case step <b>108</b> does not need to be performed. In some other embodiments, the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> may at times be deactivated, in which case the control unit <b>24</b> activates the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> if the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is not already activated. Also, in this example, the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is first tuned and then used to tune the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>. As such, the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is activated in step <b>108</b>. However, in other embodiments, the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> is not tuned based on the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and, as such, step <b>108</b> is not needed.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">The control unit <b>24</b> activates the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> by, e.g., asserting the XO activation signal (see XO<b>2</b> ACT/DEACT in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) if the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> is not already activated (step <b>110</b>). Note that, in some embodiments, the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> is always activated, in which case step <b>110</b> does not need to be performed. In some other embodiments, the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> may at times be deactivated, in which case the control unit <b>24</b> activates the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> if the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> is not already activated. In this example embodiment, the control unit <b>24</b> causes adaptation of the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> using the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> (step <b>112</b>). For example, if the wireless device <b>18</b> is not already synchronized to the carrier frequency fC of the radio access node <b>14</b>, the control unit <b>24</b> may first configure the receiver <b>22</b> to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> as described above and perform an initial synchronization process whereby the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and the LO signal ae tuned to the carrier frequency fC. Once the wireless device <b>18</b> is synchronized to the radio access node <b>14</b> either as part of step <b>112</b> or as part of a previously performed synchronization process and the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> is activated, the control unit <b>24</b> enables the XO<b>2</b> control system <b>28</b>. The XO<b>2</b> control system <b>28</b> may be, for example, a PLL or some other circuitry that adapts, e.g., a voltage or digital setting of the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> to track the frequency of the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>. For example, if the XO<b>1</b> frequency is 26 MHz and the XO<b>2</b> frequency is desired to be 104 MHz and if the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is fine-tuned during synchronization to the carrier frequency fC, then this fine-tuning can at least initially be performed for the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> by adapting the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> such that its output frequency is exactly four times the XO<b>1</b> frequency, in this example.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">Once the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> is activated and, optionally, adapted using the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, the control unit <b>24</b> configures the receiver <b>22</b> to use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> (step <b>114</b>). The exact manner in which the receiver <b>22</b> is configured to use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> will vary depending on the particular implementation of the receiver <b>22</b>, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art.

After configuring the receiver <b>22</b> to use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>, the control unit <b>24</b> optionally deactivates the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> if the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> was active by e.g., de-asserting the XO<b>1</b> ACT/DEACT signal (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) (step <b>116</b>). By deactivating the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, power consumption is reduced.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">Whether using the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> or the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>, the control unit <b>24</b> determines whether an XO change event has occurred (step <b>118</b>). In other words, the control unit <b>24</b> determines whether an event that may result in a change in which of the XOs <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> is to be used has occurred. For example, in some embodiments, the control unit <b>24</b> decides which XO to use based on the sync state of the wireless device <b>18</b> and, as such, the control unit <b>24</b> detects an XO change event when the sync state of the wireless device <b>18</b> changes. In some other embodiments, the control unit <b>24</b> decides which XO to use based on a connection state of the wireless device <b>18</b> and, as such, the control unit <b>24</b> detects an XO change event when the connection state of the wireless device <b>18</b> changes. In yet another example, in some embodiments, the control unit <b>24</b> decides which XO to use based on the carrier frequency fC and, as such, the control unit <b>24</b> detects an XO change event when the carrier frequency fC changes or when an event (e.g., a handover) that may result in a change in the carrier frequency fC has occurred. If no XO change event is detected, the control unit <b>24</b> continues to monitor for an XO change event. If an XO change event is detected, the process returns to step <b>100</b> where the control unit <b>24</b> decides whether to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> or the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>. The process then continues as described above.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow chart that illustrates the operation of the wireless device <b>18</b> and in particular the control unit <b>24</b> according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. This process is one particular implementation of the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In general, using the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the control unit <b>24</b> configures the receiver <b>22</b> to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> during initial synchronization to the carrier frequency fC of the radio access node <b>14</b>. Once synchronization is complete, the control unit <b>24</b> configures the receiver <b>22</b> to use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">Before discussing the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> in detail, a brief discussion of some problems associated with using a high frequency XO during initial synchronization is presented. The larger uncertainty in frequency (i.e., the larger tolerance) for high frequency XOs (i.e. &#x3e;100 MHz XOs) substantially impacts the time it takes to reach initial synchronization with the network and may also pose a problem in handover events. For instance, assuming a carrier frequency of 2 GHz, a 26 MHz XO has an initial uncertainty of 10 parts-per-million (ppm). To do initial cell search in LTE/Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), a frequency gridding around a hypothesized carrier frequency is needed, with a frequency grid of around 10 kilohertz (kHz). Hence, up to five to six searches are needed for each possible carrier frequency. Once the synchronization signal (e.g., Primary Synchronization Signal/Secondary Synchronization Signal (PSS/SSS), Primary Synchronization Channel/Secondary Synchronization Channel (P-SCH/S-SCH)) is detected for a certain frequency hypothesis, the XO can be adjusted and the correct carrier frequency (e.g., below 100 Hertz (Hz) error) can be achieved. For a 200 MHz XO, the corresponding search grid should be four to five times larger (i.e., 20 to 30 frequency hypothesis for each carrier assuming 2 GHz, for higher carrier frequency even more frequency hypothesis). Hence, the initial synchronization time might be much longer using &#x3e;100 MHz XOs. Conversely, using 26 MHz XOs for initial synchronization will reduce initial synchronization time, but could not manage the stringent phase noise requirements needed for 1+ gigabits per second (Gb/s) data rates above 10 GHz carrier frequency. Using the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the wireless device <b>18</b> addresses these problems.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, prior to synchronization, the control unit <b>24</b> activates the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> if not already activated and configures the receiver <b>22</b> to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> (step <b>200</b>). More specifically, the control unit <b>24</b> activates the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> by, e.g., asserting the XO activation signal (see XO<b>1</b> ACT/DEACT in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) if the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is not already activated. Note that, in some embodiments, the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is always activated, in which case the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> does not need to be activated in step <b>200</b>. In some other embodiments, the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> may at times be deactivated, in which case the control unit <b>24</b> activates the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> if the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is not already activated. Once the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is activated, the control unit <b>24</b> configures the receiver <b>22</b> to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>. The exact manner in which the receiver <b>22</b> is configured to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> will vary depending on the particular implementation of the receiver <b>22</b>, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. However, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the control unit <b>24</b> configures the receiver <b>22</b> to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> by connecting the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> to the RF PLL <b>44</b> by, in this example, closing the switch <b>48</b>-<b>1</b> and configuring the RF PLL <b>44</b> (e.g., configuring one or more settings of the RF PLL <b>44</b> such as, for example, one or more divider values) based on the frequency of the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> such that the CO <b>46</b> is controlled to provide the desired LO frequency. While not illustrated, after configuring the receiver <b>22</b> to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, the control unit <b>24</b> optionally deactivates the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> if the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> was active by, e.g., de-asserting the XO<b>2</b> ACT/DEACT signal (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). By deactivating the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>, power consumption is reduced.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">The receiver <b>22</b> is enabled (if needed), and the control unit <b>24</b> configures the receiver <b>22</b> to receive at a (hypothesized) carrier frequency fC (step <b>202</b>). The carrier frequency f<sub>C </sub>may be determined by, e.g., the control unit <b>24</b> having historical information on possible carrier frequencies for the radio access nodes <b>14</b>. This configuration of the receiver <b>22</b> includes connecting the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> to the RF PLL <b>44</b> and configuring the RF PLL <b>44</b> (e.g., configuring a divider value(s) for the RF PLL <b>44</b>) such that, based on the frequency of the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, the RF PLL <b>44</b> controls the CO <b>46</b> to output the desired LO frequency.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">Next, an initial cell search/scan is performed, where the wireless device <b>18</b> searches for synchronization signals (e.g., PSS/SSS in LTE for instance) transmitted by a radio access node <b>14</b> (step <b>204</b>). Cell search procedures are well known in the art and, as such, the cell search procedure is not described here. The control unit <b>24</b> determines whether a synchronization signal has been detected (step <b>206</b>). In this manner, the control unit <b>24</b> is deciding whether to configure the wireless device <b>18</b> to use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> or to continue to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>. This step is therefore one example implementation of step <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. If a synchronization signal has not been detected, the control unit <b>24</b> updates the (hypothesized) carrier frequency fC (step <b>208</b>) and the process returns to step <b>202</b>. Once a synchronization signal is detected, the control unit <b>24</b> may adapt or fine tune the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and, in particular, the LO frequency to the carrier frequency fC of the received signal (step <b>210</b>). Again, this adaption process is well known in the art and, as such, the details are not repeated herein. However, in general, this adaptation may be performed by adapting the RF PLL <b>44</b> (e.g., adapting the divider value(s) of the RF PLL <b>44</b>) and/or by adapting the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> via, e.g., a voltage or digital setting of the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>. For direct downconversion of the received signal from the carrier frequency fC to baseband, this adaptation results in the LO frequency being substantially matched to the actual carrier frequency fC of the receive signal to within some predefined tolerance (e.g., 100 Hz). In addition or alternatively, the adaptation may be performed by configuring a de-rotator in the digital processor <b>42</b> to compensate for the frequency error in the digital domain.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">Once synchronization is complete, the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> is activated (step <b>212</b>) and adapted based on the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> (e.g., the output of the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>) (step <b>214</b>). More specifically, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the XO<b>2</b> control system <b>28</b> is activated (if not already active). The XO<b>2</b> control system <b>28</b> then adapts the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> based on, in this example, the output of XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> to thereby fine tune the frequency of the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>. The XO<b>2</b> control system <b>28</b> may be, for example, a PLL and the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> serves as a reference for this PLL and this PLL in turn controls. e.g., a voltage or digital setting of the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> to track the frequency of the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">Once the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> is active and tuned, the control unit <b>24</b> configures the receiver <b>22</b> to perform further signal reception using the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> (step <b>216</b>). In other words, the control unit <b>24</b> configures the receiver <b>22</b> to use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">Again, as discussed above, the exact manner in which the receiver <b>22</b> is configured to use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> will vary depending on the particular implementation of the receiver <b>22</b>, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art.

Notably, step <b>218</b> may be performed if the control input to the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> can be held constant while disabling the XO<b>2</b> control system <b>28</b>. Alternatively, the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is kept active as an input to the XO<b>2</b> control system <b>28</b> that in turn continuously maintains lock between the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">Optionally, in some embodiments, the control unit <b>24</b> monitors the synchronization state of the wireless device <b>18</b> (step <b>220</b>).

This embodiment is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> but where the decision as to which of the XOs <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> to be used is based on a connection state of a connection of the wireless device <b>18</b> to a radio access node <b>14</b>. As illustrated, the control unit <b>24</b> determines a connection state of the wireless device <b>18</b> with respect to a serving or camping cell or beam (step <b>300</b>). In some embodiments, the connection state is either idle state or connected state. For example, for LTE, the connection state is the RRC state, which can be either IDLE (or Dormant in 5G NR) or CONNECTED (or active). However, other wireless systems may have different connection states. For example, in 5G, there may be more than two connection states.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">The control unit <b>24</b> then decides which XO to use based on the connection state of the wireless device <b>18</b> (step <b>302</b>). For example, in some embodiments, the control unit <b>24</b> decides to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> if the wireless device <b>18</b> is in one connection state (e.g., idle state such as, for example, RRC IDLE in LTE) and decides to use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> if the wireless device <b>18</b> is in another connection state (e.g., connected state such as, for example, RRC CONNECTED in LTE). Note that the terms &#x201c;idle&#x201d; and &#x201c;connected&#x201d; state as used herein are only examples. Other names for different connection states may be used, such as dormant and active, particularly in future cellular communications networks (e.g., 5G networks). The key is that the receiver <b>22</b> is configured to use different XOs <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> in different connection states, which enables the lower-frequency XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> to be used when desirable or beneficial to do so (e.g., when using low data rates, paging, long DRX (power saving reason and short resync time needed)) and enables the higher-frequency XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> to be used when desirable or beneficial to do so (e.g., when high performance reception is desired such as, e.g., reception using MIMO, higher order modulation, etc.). The process then proceeds as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> to either use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> (steps <b>304</b>-<b>308</b>, which correspond to steps <b>202</b>-<b>206</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) or use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> (steps <b>310</b>-<b>318</b>, which correspond to steps <b>108</b>-<b>116</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) in accordance with the decision made in step <b>302</b>. The control unit <b>24</b> then decides whether the connection state of the wireless device <b>18</b> has changed (step <b>320</b>). If not, the control unit <b>24</b> continues to monitor for a change in the connection state. Upon detecting a change in the connection state, the process then proceeds to step <b>302</b> and is repeated taking into consideration the new connection state of the wireless device <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">With respect to the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the idea is that in idle mode, where only paging and mobility measurement are needed, the lower frequency XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> can be used since such transmissions are typically single layer and low order Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), and since sync is shorter (less drift between DRX cycles). Thus, by using the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the low-frequency XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is used if the wireless device <b>18</b> is in idle mode, and the high-frequency XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> is used if the wireless device <b>18</b> is in connected mode.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flow chart that illustrates the operation of the wireless device <b>18</b> and, in particular, the control unit <b>24</b> according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. This embodiment is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> but where the decision as to which of the XOs <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> to be used is based on the carrier frequency fC of the received signal. As illustrated, the control unit <b>24</b> determines the carrier frequency fC of the received signal or the signal to be received (step <b>400</b>). The control unit <b>24</b> then decides which XO to use based on the carrier frequency fC (step <b>402</b>). For example, in some embodiments, the control unit <b>24</b> decides to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> if the carrier frequency fC is less than a predefined or preconfigured threshold and decides to use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> if the carrier frequency fC is greater than the predefined or preconfigured threshold. The predefined or preconfigured threshold may vary but, as one example, this threshold may be 4 GHz or 10 GHz.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">It should be noted that, in some embodiments, the wireless device <b>18</b> may include separate receivers (i.e., as part of separate transceivers) for different carrier frequencies. For example, the wireless device <b>18</b> may include a first transceiver for carrier frequencies that are less than, e.g., 6 GHz and a second transceiver for carrier frequencies that are greater than or equal to e.g., 6 GHz. In this example, the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> could be used for either transceiver, whereas the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> may only be used for the higher frequency transceiver (e.g., the &#x3e;6 GHz transceiver or millimeter wave (mmW) transceiver). Thus, in this example, if the desired carrier frequency fC is less than, e.g., 6 GHz, then the first, lower frequency transceiver is used and, as such, the control unit <b>24</b> configures the receiver of the first, lower-frequency transceiver to use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>. Conversely, if the desired carrier frequency fC is greater than, e.g., 6 GHz, then the second, higher-frequency transceiver is used and, as such, the control unit <b>24</b> configures the receiver of the second, higher-frequency transceiver to use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> or, in some embodiments, either the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> or the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> based on, e.g., synchronization state and/or connection state, as described above. Thus, in this example, the control unit <b>24</b> decides which receiver to use and which XO to use based on the desired carrier frequency fC.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">The process then proceeds as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> to either use the XO<b>1</b> <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> (steps <b>404</b>-<b>408</b>, which correspond to steps <b>202</b>-<b>206</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) or use the XO<b>2</b> <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> (steps <b>410</b>-<b>418</b>, which correspond to steps <b>108</b>-<b>116</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) in accordance with the decision made in step <b>402</b>. The control unit <b>24</b> then decides whether a handover (HO) over is to be performed (e.g., whether a handover command has been received) (step <b>420</b>). The handover can be an inter-frequency handover or an inter-Radio Access Technology (RAT) handover, for example. The handover is from one cell or beam (source) to another cell or beam (target). The target may operate on a different carrier frequency than the source and, as such, the control unit <b>24</b> re-evaluates which XO to use. In other words, a handover indicates that there may be a new carrier frequency fC.
