In addition, the traffic used by mobile terminals tends to increase in the future.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, in line with the development of Internet of Things (IoT) services (traffic systems, smart meters, and monitoring systems of devices or the like, for example), responding to services having various requirements is demanded. Thus, the communication standards of 5th Generation Mobile Communication (5G or New Radio (NR)) require technologies achieving even higher data signal rate, larger capacity, and lower latency in addition to the standard technologies of 4th Generation Mobile Communication (4G) (3GPP TS 36.211 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 36.212 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 36.213 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 36.300 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 36.321 V15.8.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 36.322 V15.3.0 (2019-09), 3GPP TS 36.323 V15.5.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 36.331 V15.8.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 36.413 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 36.423 V16.0.0 (2019-12), and 3GPP TS 36.425 V15.0.0 (2018-06), for example). The 5th generation communication standards are being technically studied in the working groups of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) (TSG-RAN WG1 and TSG-RAN WG2, for example), and the first edition was issued in December of 2017 (3GPP TS 37.340 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 38.201 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 38.202 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 38.211 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 38.212 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 38.213 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 38.214 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 38.215 V16.0.1 (2020-01), 3GPP TS 38.300 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 38.321 V15.8.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 38.322 V15.5.0 (2019-03), 3GPP TS 38.323 V15.6.0 (2019-06), 3GPP TS 38.331 V15.8.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 38.340 V1.0.0 (2020-03), 3GPP TS 38.401 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 38.410 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 38.413 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 38.420 V15.2.0 (2018-12), 3GPP TS 38.423 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 38.470 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TS 38.473 V16.0.0 (2019-12), 3GPP TR 38.801 V14.0.0 (2017-03), 3GPP TR 38.802 V14.2.0 (2017-09), 3GPP TR 38.803 V14.2.0 (2017-09), 3GPP TR 38.804 V14.0.0 (2017-03), 3GPP TR 38.900 V15.0.0 (2018-06), 3GPP TR 38.912 V15.0.0 (2018-06), and 3GPP TR 38.913 V15.0.0 (2018-06)).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As described above, to respond to various services, 5G assumes supporting many use cases classified into Enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB), Massive Machine Type Communications (MTC), and Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication (URLLC).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In 5G, relaying communications between a base station device and pieces of user equipment by another base station device is being studied. In this relaying, a plurality of base station devices located between a core network and the pieces of user equipment are connected wirelessly, and relaying is executed by wireless communication between the base station devices. Such relaying in 5G, which is also called Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB), allows multi-hop relaying. In IAB, the uppermost IAB donor connected to the core network and IAB nodes are wirelessly connected to each other, and the IAB donor can communicate with the pieces of user equipment via one or more IAB nodes (3GPP TS 38.340 V1.0.0 (2020-03)). In this process, the IAB donor transmits a path setting packet to each IAB node on the path to the user terminal and, with a packet transfer path set, transmits a packet containing data (the related technologies are described, for example, in International Publication Pamphlet No. WO 2019/216371).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in IAB networks, there is a problem in that the number of packets transmitted and received between the IAB donor and the IAB nodes tends to increase, causing congestion. Specifically, when paging information such as an emergency bulletin or System Information Block (SIB) is broadcast, for example, the path setting packet is transmitted from the IAB donor to all the subordinate IAB nodes, and then a packet containing paging information or SIB is transmitted to each IAB node. In this process, even if a path to any IAB node partially overlaps with a path to another IAB node, the packet is transmitted separately to each IAB node.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">That is to say, when two IAB nodes are connected in series to the IAB donor, for example, the IAB donor transmits the path setting packet to the upper IAB node and also transmits the path setting packet to the lower IAB node via the upper IAB node. Subsequently, the IAB donor transmits the packet containing data to the upper IAB node and transmits a similar packet to the lower IAB node via the upper IAB node.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, the IAB donor transmits the packet to be broadcast or multicast individually to each IAB node in the same manner as in unicast. Given this situation, the number of packets transmitted in IAB networks increases, and congestion in radio channels may occur. As a result, throughput is lowered in IAB networks.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of an embodiment, a wireless communication device includes a processor that generates a packet and a transmitter that wirelessly transmits the packet generated by the processor.

In the following, it is assumed that a device closer to the core network is an upper device, whereas a device farther from the core network is a lower device. Thus, in the wireless communication system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the IAB donor is the uppermost device, the IAB nodes #<b>1</b> and #<b>2</b> are connected to the lower position of the IAB donor, and the IAB nodes #<b>3</b> and #<b>4</b> are connected to the lower position of the IAB nodes #<b>1</b> and #<b>2</b>.

In this process, the IAB donor sets a destination address for each packet and wirelessly transmits the packet. In setting the destination address, the IAB donor sets an address for broadcast for a broadcast packet containing data to be broadcast and sets an address for multicast for a multicast packet containing data to be multicast. That is to say, the IAB donor sets, for a packet to be transmitted to a plurality of destinations, an address specifying that it is a packet to be transmitted to the destinations, rather than the address of each of the IAB nodes #<b>1</b> to #<b>4</b> or the UEs #<b>1</b> to #<b>3</b>.

Although illustration of the IAB node #<b>4</b> is omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, Step S<b>108</b> indicates transfer of the packet from the IAB node #<b>2</b> to the IAB node #<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Upon reception of the packet transmitted from the IAB node #<b>2</b> by the IAB node #<b>4</b>, the destination address is the address for broadcast, and thus the BAP termination processing is executed, so that the data contained in the packet is wirelessly transmitted to the UE #<b>3</b>, which is subordinate to the IAB node #<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Thus, by performing path setting for each path, even when the packet is broadcast, the packet is not received by the IAB node more than once. That is to say, the IAB node #<b>3</b>, for example, receives the packet transmitted from the IAB node #<b>1</b> but does not receive the packet transmitted from the IAB node #<b>2</b>. Similarly, the IAB node #<b>4</b> does not receive the packet transmitted from the IAB node #<b>1</b> but receives the packet transmitted from the IAB node #<b>2</b>. Consequently, the same packet is not transmitted and received more than once, the number of packets transmitted and received in the IAB network can be reduced, and the occurrence of congestion can be avoided to mitigate a reduction in throughput.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">As described above, according to the present embodiment, when broadcast, which transmits the same data to all the IAB nodes, is executed, the IAB donor defines paths that do not pass through each IAB node more than once and transmits, to each IAB node, the path setting packet with an instruction on the transmission destination of the packet according to the path. Then, the IAB donor sets the destination address of the BAP packet to the address for broadcast, stores the identification information of the path in the header of the packet, and transmits the packet. The IAB node receiving the packet, if the destination address is the address for broadcast, transfers the packet to the IAB node as the transmission destination according to the path in accordance with the path setting packet received in advance. Thus, the packet is not received more than once by the IAB node, the number of packets transmitted and received in the IAB network can be reduced, the occurrence of congestion can be avoided, and a reduction in throughput can be mitigated.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">[c] Another Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the packet multicasting according to the first embodiment above, it is assumed that the path setting packet is transmitted individually to each IAB node belonging to the group. However, it is also possible to reduce the number of path setting packets transmitted and received in the IAB network by broadcasting the path setting packet. Specifically, the IAB donor may generate the path setting packet containing path setting information about all the IAB nodes belonging to the group of multicast, set the destination address of this path setting packet to the address for broadcast, and transmit the path setting packet.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a sequence diagram of multicast using the path setting packet containing the path setting information about a plurality of IAB nodes.

The following gives a description with the IAB nodes #<b>1</b>, #<b>3</b>, and #<b>4</b>, except for the IAB node #<b>2</b>, assumed to belong to the group. The IAB donor determines the transfer path of the packet to the IAB nodes #<b>1</b>, #<b>3</b>, and #<b>4</b> belonging to the group and, for the packet the destination address of which is the address for multicast, generates the path setting packet designating the transmission destination from each of the IAB nodes #<b>1</b>, #<b>3</b>, and #<b>4</b>. That is to say, the IAB donor generates the path setting packet containing the path setting information of the IAB nodes. Then, the IAB donor sets the destination address of the generated path setting packet to the address for broadcast and transmits the path setting packet to the IAB node #<b>1</b> (Step S<b>501</b>).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Upon reception of the path setting packet by the IAB node #<b>1</b>, the IAB node #<b>1</b> stores therein a setting about the node contained in the path setting packet. That is to say, when receiving the packet the destination address of which is the address for multicast, the IAB node #<b>1</b> stores therein performing the termination processing of this packet, transmitting the data to the UE #<b>1</b>, which is subordinate thereto, and transferring the packet to the IAB nodes #<b>3</b> and #<b>4</b>. Then, the destination address of the path setting packet is the address for broadcast, so that the IAB node #<b>1</b> transfers the path setting packet to the IAB nodes #<b>3</b> and #<b>4</b>, which are connected to the lower position thereof (Steps S<b>502</b> and S<b>503</b>).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Upon reception of the path setting packet by the IAB nodes #<b>3</b> and #<b>4</b>, the IAB nodes #<b>3</b> and #<b>4</b> each store therein a setting about the node contained in the path setting packet. That is to say, when receiving the packet the destination address of which is the address for multicast, the IAB node #<b>3</b> stores therein performing the termination processing of this packet and transmitting the data to the UE #<b>2</b>, which is subordinate thereto. Similarly, when receiving the packet the destination address of which is the address for multicast, the IAB node #<b>4</b> stores therein performing the termination processing of this packet and transmitting the data to the UE #<b>3</b>, which is subordinate thereto.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Thus, the path setting information about all the IAB nodes positioned on the transfer path of the packet to be multicast is contained in the path setting packet, and this path setting packet is broadcast. This processing enables the IAB node receiving the path setting packet to store therein the path setting information about the node and to prepare for receiving the packet the destination address of which is the address for multicast.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">After the path setting packet is broadcast, in the same manner as in the packet multicasting according to the first embodiment above, the packet with the address for multicast set to the destination address is multicast from the IAB donor to the IAB nodes #<b>1</b>, #<b>3</b>, and #<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">As described above, by broadcasting the path setting packet containing the path setting information about the IAB nodes, the number of path setting packets transmitted and received when the packet is multicast can be reduced, and the occurrence of congestion can be avoided more surely.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The above embodiments can be performed in combination with each other as appropriate. When broadcasting the path setting packet containing the path setting information about the IAB nodes, the path setting packet may be broadcast with the path set as in the second embodiment above, for example.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">An aspect of the wireless communication device and the wireless communication system disclosed by the present application produces an effect of making it possible to avoid the occurrence of congestion and to mitigate a reduction in throughput.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">All examples and conditional language recited herein are intended for pedagogical purposes of aiding the reader in understanding the invention and the concepts contributed by the inventor to further the art, and are not to be construed as limitations to such specifically recited examples and conditions, nor does the organization of such examples in the specification relate to a showing of the superiority and inferiority of the invention.
