Therefore, in order to reduce the excessive noise caused by collision in the closing process of drawers, doors and windows, damper structures are usually arranged on the sliding rails of the drawers, doors and windows. The conventional dampers need to be equipped with springs and air cylinders with the same length. The air cylinder can be slowly compressed in the contraction process of the spring, so that the drawers, doors and windows can be closed slowly. However, since the length of the air cylinder needs to be matched with the spring, the air cylinder is excessively long, which will occupy a large space of the sliding rail, resulting in a large size of the sliding rail.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides a damper with hidden rail, so as to reduce the size of a

thereby avoiding the requirement of the traditional damper on the size of the air cylinder, reducing the space occupied by the damping piece and reducing the size of the damping structure; and since the size of the air cylinder is small, the cost of the damper is reduced.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief

Meanwhile, in the present invention, due to the action of the limiting piece, the telescopic direction of the telescopic cylinder can be different from the movement direction of the damper. It is ensured that the length of the projection of the compression surface in the compression direction of the telescopic cylinder is the same as the compression stroke and the length of the projection of the compression surface in the sliding direction of the sliding block is the same as the sliding stroke by adjusting the included angle between the compression surface of the limiting piece and the movement direction of the sliding block and the inclination angle between the telescopic direction of the telescopic cylinder and the compression surface. Compared with the traditional damper, the damper with hidden rail has the advantages of reducing the requirement on the size of the air cylinder and the space occupied by the damping piece, thereby reducing the size of the damping structure. Meanwhile, since the size of the air cylinder is small, the cost of the damper can be effectively reduced.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0066">In particular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an inclination angle is formed between the telescopic cylinder<b>32</b> and the compression surface <b>311</b>, and one end of the telescopic cylinder<b>32</b> abuts against the compression surface <b>311</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the telescopic cylinder <b>32</b> is mounted on the sliding block<b>4</b>, the limiting piece <b>31</b> and the shell <b>1</b> are of an integrated structure, and the telescopic cylinder<b>32</b> is perpendicular to the sliding direction of the sliding block<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0068">In particular, a contact piece is arranged at one end of the telescopic cylinder <b>32</b>, and the telescopic cylinder<b>32</b> abuts against the compression surface <b>311</b> through the contact piece.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0069">The contact piece is of a sleeve structure and sleeves one end of the telescopic cylinder.
