Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">One or more embodiments disclosed herein relate generally to a social networking system. More specifically, one or more embodiments disclosed herein relate to sharing videos over a social networking system.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Background and Relevant Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Online video watching is an increasingly popular pastime among Internet users. For example, users frequently go online to watch movies, TV episodes, news and weather reports, and other types of video clips. Thus, users can watch video online via web-enabled televisions, smart phones, tablets, smart wearables, etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As watching videos online becomes more popular, it has also become increasingly common for users to share videos via a social networking system. For instance, in response to watching a humorous video online, a social networking system user may wish to bring the humorous video to the attention of friends, family members, and/or acquaintances. Accordingly, social networking systems typically provide one or more mechanisms by which the user can share the humorous video with other social networking system users who are associated with the user (e.g., &#x201c;friends&#x201d;). For example, in response to the user selecting an option to share a video, the social networking system can add a link or video player control to the newsfeeds of the user's friends, such that the user's friends can view the video as well.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When sharing videos via a social networking system, however, users typically encounter various problems. For example, a video sharer may only want to share a particular portion or segment of a video with his social networking system friends, rather than having them watch the entire video. In order to point out only a portion of a video, the video sharer typically adds instructions to the video (e.g., via a comment or tag) that state a timestamp within the video where other users should begin watching the video (e.g., &#x201c;Hey, the funny part starts at about 2 minutes in!&#x201d;). Thus, in order to watch the indicated portion, the video sharer's friends must scroll through the video to the right timestamp. This extra hassle frequently deters the video sharer's friends from watching the video at all.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some cases, a video sharer may attempt to edit the video in order to extract only a portion of the video to share via a social networking system. This approach is also problematic for various reasons. For example, video-editing software is typically expensive and requires a large amount of resources to run successfully. Additionally, editing videos may run the video sharer afoul of various copyright standards.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further problems arise with regard to &#x201c;viral&#x201d; videos. For example, a viral video is one that has become extremely popular and is frequently viewed by Internet users. A social networking system user may wish to share a popular video that has become viral with his friends via a social networking system, when only a portion of the viral video is truly what watchers are interested in seeing. When the user's social networking friends watch the viral video, they generally have no indication of what portion of the video that has made the video popular enough to become viral. Thus, the user's social networking friends typically watch the entire video when only a portion of the video is the reason the video has become viral, which is a waste of time. Alternatively, the user's social networking friends may skip the video altogether.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, there are several disadvantages to current methods for sharing videos via a social networking system.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One or more embodiments described herein provide benefits and/or solve one or more of the foregoing or other problems in the art with systems and methods for sharing portions of videos via a social networking system. One or more embodiments described herein include systems and methods for sharing portions of videos by enabling a user to select a portion of a video that the user would like to share with one or more co-users via the social networking system. Thus, rather than having to point out a timestamp within the video that co-users should scroll to, the user can select the exact portion of the video that co-users should watch.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additionally, one or more embodiments described herein include systems and methods for indicating viral portions of popular videos. For example, systems and methods described herein track the most-shared portions of a particular video in order to identify a viral portion of the video. Thus, when social networking system users watch the viral video, systems and methods described herein provide an indication of the most popular portion or portions of the viral video. In this way, social networking system users are spared the hassle of watching a long video when only a portion of that video is truly viral.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additional features and advantages of the present application will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by the practice of such exemplary embodiments. The features and advantages of such embodiments may be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. These and other features will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or may be learned by the practice of such exemplary embodiments as set forth hereinafter.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to describe the manner in which the above recited and other advantages and features can be obtained, a more particular description of the aspects of one or more embodiments briefly described above will be rendered by reference to specific embodiments thereof that are illustrated in the appended drawings.

For example, the video management system of one or more embodiments described herein can enable a user to select a portion of a video to share with other users via a social networking system. Similarly, the video management system of one or more embodiments described herein can track frequently shared portions of a particular video within the social networking system in order to identify a portion of the particular video that has become viral.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">To illustrate, in response to a social networking system user indicating a desire to &#x201c;like&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;share&#x201d; a particular video among other associated social networking system users, the video management system provides editing controls that allow the user to select a specific portion of the particular video. For example, in at least one embodiment, the editing controls provided by the video management system are timeline handles that allow the user to drag a starting timeline handle to the point in a video timeline at which the specific portion of the video begins, and to drag an ending timeline handle to the point in the video timeline at which the specific portion of the video ends.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In response to a user selecting a specific portion of the particular video, the video management system generates a video file layer that indicates the starting and ending points of the specific portion within the particular video. In one or more embodiments, the social networking system adds the particular video to the newsfeeds of the user's social networking system &#x201c;friends&#x201d; (e.g., associated co-users) along with the video file layer such that the particular video auto-plays the specific portion selected by the user in the newsfeeds of the user's friends. Thus, the user's friends can see the selected portion right away without having to watch the entire video, or manually scroll to a particular timestamp within the video.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Furthermore, in one or more embodiments, the video management system tracks all social networking system activity associated with a particular video in order to identify a viral portion or portions of the particular video. For example, the video management system can track all &#x201c;likes&#x201d; and &#x201c;shares&#x201d; associated with various portions of the video in order to identify the most liked and/or shared video portion(s). The video management system may determine that a number of likes and/or shares associated with a particular video portion exceeds a threshold amount to qualify the video portion as a &#x201c;viral portion.&#x201d; Additionally, the video management system can analyze all video file layers associated with a particular video in order to identify one or more portions of the video that have been shared and/or liked by a threshold number of social networking system users and are thus &#x201c;viral.&#x201d; In at least one embodiment, after identifying one or more viral portions of a particular video, the video management system indicates the viral portion of the video every time a social networking system user plays the video.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, the term &#x201c;social networking system&#x201d; refers to a system that supports and enables on-line communication, input, interaction, content-sharing, and collaboration between users. A user of the social networking system can have one or more &#x201c;friends&#x201d; via the social networking system. As used herein, the term &#x201c;friend&#x201d; refers to a co-user associated with a user via the social networking system (i.e., a contact or connection within a user's social network).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As mentioned above, the social networking system can monitor social networking system activity to identify a portion of a video that a social networking system user wishes to like and/or share. Similarly, the social networking system can monitor social networking system activity to determine that a portion of a video has become viral. As used herein, &#x201c;social networking system activity&#x201d; refers to an interaction between a social networking system user and the social networking system. For example, the social networking system provides various input controls that allow a user to comment on a post within a newsfeed, to &#x201c;like&#x201d; (e.g., indicate agreement with or support for) a post within a newsfeed, to share a post, article, video, etc. with other social networking system users, to read an article or play a video shared by another social networking system user, and so forth. Also as used herein, a digital video is considered &#x201c;viral&#x201d; when it has been circulated and viewed rapidly and widely among a threshold number of social networking system users, in accordance with one or more pre-determined thresholds and/or heuristics.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram illustrating an example embodiment of a video management system <b>100</b> (or simply &#x201c;system <b>100</b>&#x201d;).

Likewise, the GUI manager <b>132</b> can provide a user interface that facilitates the display of a social networking system user's newsfeed or wall.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">More specifically, the GUI manager <b>132</b> can facilitate the display of a user interface (e.g., by way of a display device associated with the client computing device <b>128</b>). For example, the GUI manager <b>132</b> may compose the user interface of a plurality of graphical components, objects, and/or elements that allow a user to compose, send, and receive electronic messages, social networking system posts, etc. More particularly, the GUI manager <b>132</b> may direct the client computing device <b>128</b> to display a group of graphical components, objects, and/or elements that enable a user to view social networking system posts, digital videos, etc.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In addition, the GUI manager <b>132</b> may direct the client computing device <b>128</b> to display one or more graphical objects, controls, applications, or elements that facilitate user input for composing and sending posts, and/or viewing digital videos and other digital media. To illustrate, the GUI manager <b>132</b> may provide a user interface that allows a user to provide user input to the social networking application <b>130</b>. For example, the GUI manager <b>132</b> can provide one or more user interfaces that allow a user to input one or more types of content into a social networking system post, an electronic message, etc. As used herein, &#x201c;content&#x201d; refers to any data or information to be included as part of a social networking system post, message, comment, etc. For example, the term &#x201c;content&#x201d; will be used herein to generally describe text, images, applications, digital media (e.g., digital videos), files, location information, or any other data that can be included as part of a social networking system post, message, comment, etc.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">One example of an application provided by the GUI manager <b>132</b> is a video application. For instance, the GUI manager <b>132</b> can provide a video application that allows a user to watch and otherwise interact with a digital video (e.g., a digital video available through the social networking system <b>104</b>). In one or more embodiments, the video application provided by the GUI manager <b>132</b> includes one or more controls that allow a user to control playback of a digital video, like or share a digital video, comment on a digital video, select one or more portions of a video, and receive an indication of one or more viral portions of a video.

In additional or alternative embodiments, the GUI manager <b>132</b> can embed the video application in a newsfeed of a social networking system user such that the video application provides a video preview window within a post in the newsfeed of the social networking system user.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The GUI manager <b>132</b> can also facilitate the input of text or other data to be included in a social networking system post, message, comment, etc. For example, the GUI manager <b>132</b> can provide a user interface that includes a touch display keyboard or any other touch-responsive graphical elements. A user can interact with the touch display keyboard using one or more touch gestures to input text or other types of input to be included in a social networking system post, message, or comment. In addition to text, the user interface including the touch display keyboard can facilitate the input of various other characters, symbols, icons, or other information.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Furthermore, the GUI manager <b>132</b> can provide and transition between two or more graphical user interfaces. For example, in one embodiment, the GUI manager <b>132</b> can provide a newsfeed to a social networking system user containing one or more social networking system posts from co-users associated with the user via the social networking system. Later, in response to detected input from the user, the GUI manager <b>132</b> can transition to a second graphical user interface that includes a video application for viewing a digital video.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the social networking application <b>130</b> can include a user input detector <b>134</b>. In one or more embodiments, the user input detector <b>134</b> can detect, receive, and/or facilitate user input in any suitable manner. In some examples, the user input detector <b>134</b> can detect one or more user interactions with respect to the user interface. As referred to herein, a &#x201c;user interaction&#x201d; means a single interaction, or combination or interactions, received from a user by way of one or more input devices.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, the user input detector <b>134</b> can detect a user interaction from a keyboard, mouse, touch pad, touch screen, and/or any other input device. In the event the client computing device <b>128</b> includes a touch screen, the user input detector <b>134</b> can detect one or more touch gestures (e.g., swipe gestures, tap gestures, pinch gestures, or reverse pinch gestures) from a user that forms a user interaction. In some examples, a user can provide the touch gestures in relation to and/or directed at one or more graphical objects or graphical elements of a user interface.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The user input detector <b>134</b> may additionally, or alternatively, receive data representative of a user interaction. For example, the user input detector <b>134</b> may receive one or more user configurable parameters from a user, one or more user commands from the user, and/or any other suitable user input. The user input detector <b>134</b> may receive input data from one or more components of the social networking system, or from one or more remote locations.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The social networking application <b>130</b> can perform one or more functions in response to the user input detector <b>134</b> detecting user input and/or receiving other data. Generally, a user can control, navigate within, and otherwise use the social networking application <b>130</b> by providing one or more user inputs that the user input detector <b>134</b> can detect. For example, in response to the user input detector <b>134</b> detecting user input, one or more components of the social networking application <b>130</b> allow a user to select a recipient for a message, compose a message, select content to include in a message, and/or send a message to the recipient. Additionally, in response to the user input detector <b>134</b> detecting user input, one or more components of the social networking application <b>130</b> allow a user to navigate through one or more user interfaces to review electronic messages, view and share digital videos, etc.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the video management system <b>100</b> can include the social networking system <b>104</b> hosted by the server device <b>102</b>. The social networking system <b>104</b> can provide social networking system posts (whether text or otherwise) to a graphical user interface (e.g., a profile, a newsfeed, or &#x201c;wall&#x201d;) of one or more users of the social networking system <b>104</b>. For example, one or more embodiments may present a user with a social networking system newsfeed. In one or more embodiments, the user may scroll through the social networking system newsfeed in order to view recent social networking system posts submitted by the one or more co-users associated with the user via the social networking system <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, the social networking system <b>104</b> may organize the social networking system posts geographically, by interest groups, according to a relationship coefficient between the user and the co-user, etc. Additionally, in one or more embodiments, the user may download content from the newsfeed and the social networking system posts displayed therein.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Additionally, in one embodiment, the social networking system <b>104</b> can transmit social networking system posts between users. For example, in response to a user submitting a social networking system post to the social networking system <b>104</b>, the social networking system <b>104</b> can update the social networking system newsfeeds of the co-users who are &#x201c;friends&#x201d; with the user to include the submitted social networking system post. Accordingly, over time, the social networking system <b>104</b> fills the newsfeed of a particular social networking system user with the posts (e.g., including shared content such as shared videos) submitted by the user's friends.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As mentioned above, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the social networking system <b>104</b> further includes the video manager <b>106</b>. In one or more embodiments, and as will be discussed in further detail below, the video manager <b>106</b> monitors and manages activity within the social networking system <b>104</b> related to digital videos. The video manager <b>106</b> also includes a social networking system activity manager <b>108</b>, which in turn can communicate with the social networking system <b>104</b> to receive various types of information. In one or more embodiments, the social networking system activity manager <b>108</b> can receive information related to actions performed by social networking system users, as well as information related to the social networking system users.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, the social networking system activity manager <b>108</b> can receive information related to the social networking system activities engaged in by one or more social networking system users. To illustrate, a social networking system user may click links, &#x201c;like&#x201d; posts, add comments, view digital media, etc. Accordingly, the social networking system activity manager <b>108</b> can receive, monitor, and track information related to any and all social networking system activities performed by a social networking system user. In one or more embodiments, the social networking system activity manager <b>108</b> can identify the content of posts, electronic messages, and comments, as well as any structured data associated with a post, electronic message, comment, etc.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, the social networking system activity manager <b>108</b> can receive information related to digital video interactions engaged in by one or more social networking system users. For example, as mentioned above, social networking system users can watch, share, and select portions of digital videos via the social networking system <b>104</b> and the social networking application <b>130</b>, as will be explained in more detail below. Accordingly, the social networking system activity manager <b>108</b> can receive, monitor, and track information related to any digital video interactions performed by a social networking system user.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As mentioned above, the social networking system activity manager <b>108</b> can receive information related to a social networking system user including demographic information associated with the user. In one or more embodiments, a user's demographic information can include, but is not limited to, the user's gender, age, education, location, hometown, birthday, employment, salary, family and romantic relationships, and so forth. Additionally, the user's demographic information can be related to the user's personal interests (e.g., favorite books, movies, restaurants, etc.). The social networking system activity manager <b>108</b> can identify this information through an analysis of the user's social networking system profile, account information, or via other social networking system activities in which the user engages.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As mentioned above, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the video manager <b>106</b> also includes a video layer manager <b>110</b>. As discussed above, the video management system <b>100</b> enables a social networking system user to select a portion of a particular video to like and/or share with one or more friends. Accordingly, in one or more embodiments, the video manager <b>106</b> detects the user's selection of a portion of the particular video. For example, in response to the user indicating a desire to select a portion of a video, the GUI manager <b>132</b> of the social networking application <b>130</b> can provide a video application including at least two timeline handles that allow the user to indicate a starting timestamp and an ending timestamp of the selected portion. In one or more embodiments, the video layer manager <b>110</b> detects the user's positioning of the timeline handles, and identifies the starting timestamp and ending timestamp of the selected video portion. In additional embodiments, the video layer manager <b>110</b> can provide additional timeline handles for a user to select additional video portions to share simultaneously or subsequently.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Additionally, in one or more embodiments, the video layer manager <b>110</b> creates a video file layer for each selected portion of a particular video. For example, in response to a user dragging timeline handles within a video application in order to select a portion of a digital video, the video layer manager <b>110</b> creates a video file layer that includes a starting timestamp associated with the starting timeline handle (e.g., indicating the beginning of the selected portion within the video), and an ending timestamp associated with the ending timeline handle (e.g., indicating the ending of the selected portion within the video). Additionally, the video layer manager <b>110</b> includes additional information in the video file layer such as a unique identifier associated with the digital video, and a unique identifier associated with the social networking system user who selected the portion of the digital video.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Furthermore, the video layer manager <b>110</b> also stores the created video file layer. In one or more embodiments, in order to prevent storage of multiple copies of the digital video, the video layer manager <b>110</b> can store a created video file layer in one of several different ways. For example, the video layer manager <b>110</b> can create a storage node for the video file layer and associate the node with the user who selected the video portion. Thus, over time as the user selects additional portions of the same or other digital videos, the video layer manager <b>110</b> can associate additional nodes containing video file layers with the user.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Alternatively, the video layer manager <b>110</b> can store a node containing the created video file layer in association with the digital video. For example, the video layer manager <b>110</b> can store the node in association with the digital video identified by a unique digital video identifier included in the video file layer. Thus, over time as additional social networking system users select portions of the digital video, the video layer manager <b>110</b> will associate additional video file layer nodes with the digital video. In additional or alternative embodiments, the video layer manager <b>110</b> may store a created video file layer based on a combination of the methods described above or using any other suitable data storage methods.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Regardless of the storage scheme utilized (e.g., creating a storage node for the video file layer and associate the node with the user who selected the video portion, or associating video file layer nodes with a single video file layer node for the digital video), each video file layer points to a common storage location of the digital video. For example, once a social networking system user uploads a digital video to the social networking system, the social networking system stores a single copy of the digital video in a particular location. Thus, each subsequent video file layer that references the digital video will include that particular storage location. This ensures that the social networking system efficiently utilizes storage space by only maintaining a single copy of the digital video, rather than creating multiple copies of the digital video each time a social networking system user interacts with the digital video.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As mentioned above, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the video manager <b>106</b> also includes a viral video portion manager <b>112</b>. In one or more embodiments, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> identifies viral portions of digital videos. As described above, any type of digital media becomes viral when it is quickly and widely circulated and viewed by a threshold number of users. Accordingly, over time, a particular digital video may be associated with many shares and corresponding video file layers, each indicating one or more portions of the digital video that social networking system users have liked and/or shared. In addition, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can utilize these video file layers and data representative of social networking system user interactions (e.g., likes, shares, comments, views, etc.) to determine the virality of video portions.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one or more embodiments, in order to identify one or more viral portions of a particular video, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can begin by identifying all video file layers associated with the particular video. In one or more embodiments, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> identifies video file layers associated with the particular video by searching for all video file layers that include a unique identifier associated with the particular video. For example, the unique identifier associated with the particular video can be an alpha-numeric string of characters (e.g., a stock keeping unit, etc.), a number, a title, a description, etc.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Once the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> has identified all video file layers associated with the particular video, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can continue the process of identifying one or more viral portions of the particular video by instantiating a counter, and working through the following analysis of the identified video file layers: start at the first timestamp within the particular video, determine whether any of the video file layers contain a starting timestamp that matches the first timestamp, for each video file layer that contains a starting timestamp that matches the first timestamp add one to the counter, and move to the next timestamp within the particular video. When the counter reaches a number at or beyond a threshold amount, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can determine that a viral video portion starts at the current timestamp within the particular video. In one or more embodiments, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can assign a particular value as the threshold amount (e.g., 1000). Alternatively, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can determine that the threshold amount is a certain percentage of the total number of viewers of the particular video (e.g., if the video has been viewed by 1000 users, the threshold amount may be 80% of the total number of viewers, or 800).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Once the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> increases the counter past zero, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can determine whether any of the video file layers contain an ending timestamp that matches the current timestamp, as the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> moves through the timestamps within the particular video. For each video file layer that contains an ending timestamp that matches the current timestamp, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> subtracts one from the counter. If the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> has previously determined that a viral portion of the particular video has started and the counter falls below the threshold amount, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can then determine that the viral portion ends at the current timestamp. In this way, by working timestamp by timestamp through the particular video, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can identify one or more viral portions of the particular video.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In additional or alternative embodiments, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> also takes additional social networking system activity associated with a digital video into account in identifying one or more viral portions of the digital video. For example, in some embodiments, in addition to sharing portions of a digital video, social networking users can &#x201c;like&#x201d; portions of the digital video, view portions of the digital video, and/or comment on portions of the digital video. To illustrate, a social networking user may select a portion of a digital video and submit a comment specific to the selected portion (e.g., &#x201c;This is the part with the awesome guitar solo!&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In that case, the video layer manager <b>110</b> associates the user's submitted comment with, for example, a video file layer associated with the corresponding portion of the digital video. The video layer manager <b>110</b> can create video file layers or modify video file layers to represent or track any type of social networking system activity connected with the digital video. Later, when identifying viral portions of the digital video, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> will identify the video file layer created for the submitted comment (or any other social networking system activity), and take in account any timestamps included in the identified video file layer(s) in the resulting count. In at least one embodiment, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> adds a weight to certain types of social networking system activity indicated by each identified video file layer. For example, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> may assign a heavier weight to a video file layer that indicates a particular portion of the digital video was shared than to a video file layer that indicates a particular portion of the digital video was merely viewed. Thus, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> may assign two counts to a shared portion, while only assigning a single count to a viewed portion. Accordingly, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can generate a virality score (e.g., whether weighted or not) for each portion of a digital video based on all the social networking activity associated with each portion of the digital video. As such, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can take into account, for example, likes, shares, comments, and views related to each portion of a digital video when determining which portion(s) of the video are viral. In particular, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can associate each portion-specific social networking activity with the corresponding portion of a digital video instead of with the digital video as a whole, and adjust a virality score(s) of the corresponding portion and/or overlapping portions accordingly.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition to identifying one or more viral portions of a particular video, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can also collect demographic information associated with users who like or share viral portions of a particular video. As mentioned above, the video manager <b>106</b> can identify and provide demographic information related to viral portions of digital videos to various third parties (e.g., advertisers, researchers, media producers). Accordingly, in order to identify demographic information related to social networking users who like or share viral portions of a particular video, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can determine whether a portion of a video that a particular user is liking or sharing is of interest. Then, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can utilize the user's unique identifier to access, in accordance with the user's privacy settings, the user's profile and other associated information.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can also collect demographic information during the determination as to whether a particular video includes a portion that has become viral, as described above. For example, the viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can collect demographic information (e.g., based on the user's unique identifiers listed in the video file layers), for each identified starting timestamp that causes the counter to increase by one. The viral video portion manager <b>112</b> can later stop collecting demographic information when the counter begins to decrease. The collected demographic information can be utilized by the social networking system <b>104</b> at a later time in order to provide digital video owners, advertisers, etc. with information about the social networking system users who are most interested in and contributed to the virality of the particular digital video.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As mentioned above, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the video manager <b>106</b> also includes a social networking system communication manager <b>114</b>. In one or more embodiments, the social networking system communication manager <b>114</b> manages all communications between the social networking system <b>104</b> and one or more social networking system users, as well as all communications between social networking system users. For example, in response to a social networking system user selecting and liking a portion of a particular digital video, the social networking system communication manager <b>114</b> can generate a social networking system post associated with the portion of the particular video (e.g., based on the video file layer generated as a result of the user selecting the portion of the particular video), and add the generated post to the newsfeeds of the user's social networking system friends.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Furthermore, the social networking system communication manager <b>114</b> can provide, as part of the generated post associated with the portion of the particular video, a video application. In one or more embodiments, the video application is a small application (e.g., including an Applet, Javascript, Flash player, Quicktime player, Windows&#xae; Media player, etc.) that enables a user to playback a digital video. For example, the video application can enable the user to playback a digital video in a video preview window within a newsfeed. Additionally, the video application can also enable the user to activate a full-screen mode, wherein the user can playback the digital video in a full-sized window that takes up all of a computing device's display.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one or more embodiments, the social networking system communication manager <b>114</b> can also configure the video application based on a video file layer. As described above, in response to a user selecting a portion of digital video and liking and/or sharing that portion, the video layer manager <b>110</b> generates a corresponding video file layer that includes a starting timestamp for the portion, an ending timestamp for the portion, a unique identifier associated with the video, and a unique identifier associated with the user. Thus, in response to the user liking and/or sharing a selected portion of a digital video, the social networking system communication manager <b>114</b> can configure the video application based on the video file layer associated with the selected portion, and provide a post including the configured video application on the newsfeeds of one or more of the user's social networking system friends. In at least one embodiment, configuring the video application based on the video file layer includes loading the digital video (e.g., based on the video's unique identifier listed in the video file layer) into the video application, and setting the video application to play (e.g., auto-play or in response to user input starting the video portion) the selected portion of the video (e.g., based on the starting and ending timestamps listed in the video file layer).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Furthermore, as mentioned above, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the video manager <b>106</b> also includes a data storage <b>116</b>.

Furthermore, the social networking application <b>130</b> can provide extra sets of starting and ending timeline handles in response to repeated selections of the like control <b>310</b><i>a, </i>such that the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>a </i>can select additional portions of the digital video.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In additional embodiments, the social networking application <b>130</b> can provide the starting timeline handle <b>324</b><i>a </i>and the ending timeline handle <b>324</b><i>b </i>in response to a press-and-hold touch gesture detected by the user input detector <b>134</b> in connection with the comment control <b>310</b><i>b. </i>In that case, after the user selects the portion of interest within the digital video using the starting timeline handle <b>324</b><i>a </i>and the ending timeline handle <b>324</b><i>b, </i>the social networking application <b>130</b> can provide a text input area in which the user can compose a comment. In response to the user submitting the comment, the social networking system <b>104</b> can associate the comment with the selected portion of the digital video, and/or make the selected portion and/or the comment visible to other users via the social networking system <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Similarly, the social networking application <b>130</b> can provide the starting timeline handle <b>324</b><i>a </i>and the ending timeline handle <b>324</b><i>b </i>in response to a press-and-hold touch gesture detected by the user input detector <b>134</b> in connection with the share control <b>310</b><i>c. </i>In that case, after the user selects the portion of interest within the digital video using the starting timeline handle <b>324</b><i>a </i>and the ending timeline handle <b>324</b><i>b, </i>the social networking application <b>130</b> can instantly generate, and add to the newsfeeds of the user's social networking friends, a post including the selected portion of the digital video.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The starting timeline handle <b>324</b><i>a </i>and the ending timeline handle <b>324</b><i>b </i>enable the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>a </i>to select the starting and ending points of the portion of the digital video that the user wishes to like and/or share. For example, as indicated by the arrow <b>326</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>a </i>can slide the starting timeline handle <b>324</b><i>a </i>and the ending timeline handle <b>324</b><i>b </i>along the playback timeline <b>316</b> as a unit (e.g., by selecting and dragging a point in between the starting timeline handle <b>324</b><i>a </i>and the ending timeline handle <b>324</b><i>b</i>). Alternately or additionally, the user can slide the starting timeline handle <b>324</b><i>a </i>and the ending timeline handle <b>324</b><i>b </i>to points along the playback timeline <b>316</b> independently (e.g., as illustrated by the arrows <b>332</b><i>a </i>and <b>332</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In order to assist the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>a </i>in selecting a portion of a particular digital video, the social networking application <b>130</b> can also provide a way for the user to preview the selected portion of the digital video. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, the social networking application <b>130</b> can provide the portion preview control <b>328</b>. In one or more embodiments, in response to the user selecting the portion preview control <b>328</b> the social networking application <b>130</b> can playback only the portion of the digital video that starts at a timestamp indicated by the starting timeline handle <b>324</b><i>a </i>and ends at a timestamp indicated by the ending timeline handle <b>324</b><i>b. </i>The social networking application <b>130</b> can provide the portion playback within the full screen video GUI <b>304</b><i>b, </i>or alternatively can provide a new GUI for the portion playback. Furthermore, as a user drags the starting timeline handle <b>324</b><i>a </i>or the ending timeline handle <b>324</b><i>b, </i>the social networking application <b>130</b> can present (e.g., within the full screen video GUI <b>304</b><i>b</i>) a still frame of the video that corresponds to the position of the starting timeline handle <b>324</b><i>a </i>or the ending timeline handle <b>324</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Furthermore, once the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>a </i>has indicated the portion of the digital video that is of interest, the user can like only the portion of the digital video, rather than liking the entire digital video. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>C and <b>3</b>D</figref>, the user can like only the portion of the digital video indicated by the starting timeline handle <b>324</b><i>a </i>and the ending timeline handle <b>324</b><i>b </i>by selecting the portion like control <b>330</b>. Depending on the user's privacy settings within the social networking system <b>104</b>, the social networking system <b>104</b> may provide a notification to other social networking system users in response to the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>a </i>liking the portion of the digital video via the portion like control <b>330</b> or the like control <b>310</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Alternatively, or in addition to liking the selected portion of the video, once the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>a </i>has indicated the portion of the digital video that is of interest, the user can share the selected portion by selecting the comment control <b>310</b><i>b. </i>For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> and in response to the user selecting the comment control <b>310</b><i>b, </i>the social networking application <b>130</b> provides an activity control list <b>334</b> within the touch screen display <b>302</b><i>a </i>of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>a. </i>In one or more embodiments, the activity control list <b>334</b> includes activity controls <b>336</b><i>a</i>-<b>336</b><i>d. </i>In at least one embodiment, the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>a </i>can instantly share only the selected portion of the digital video with additional social networking system users by selecting the activity control <b>336</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Furthermore, in at least one embodiment and in response to the user selecting the activity control <b>336</b><i>b, </i>the video manager <b>106</b> can enable the user to compose a post directed at either the full digital video or only at the selected portion of the digital video. Similarly, in response to the user selecting the activity control <b>336</b><i>c, </i>the video manager <b>106</b> can enable the user to send either the full digital video or the selected portion of the digital video as part of an electronic message. Finally, in response to the user selecting the activity control <b>336</b><i>d, </i>the video manager <b>106</b> can provide the user with a hyperlink that the user can copy into other applications that is directed to either the full digital video or the selected portion of the digital video.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Regardless of the action selected by the user after selecting a particular portion of the digital video, the video manager <b>106</b> generates a video file layer associated with the selected portion of the digital video. For example, in response to the user selecting the portion like control (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>) and in addition to providing the selected portion to one or more friends of the user, the video manager <b>106</b> generates a video file layer associated with the selected portion. In one or more embodiments, the video manager <b>106</b> includes within the generated video file layer a starting timestamp indicated by the starting timeline handle <b>324</b><i>a, </i>an ending timestamp indicated by the ending timeline handle <b>324</b><i>a, </i>a unique identifier associated with the digital video, and a unique identifier associated with the user who selected the portion of the digital video. Also as described above, the video manager <b>106</b> can store the generated video file layer based on the unique identifier associated with the digital video or based on the unique identifier associated with the user.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In one or more embodiments, in response to the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>a </i>selecting the activity control <b>336</b><i>a, </i>the social networking system <b>104</b> can share the selected portion of the digital video with additional social networking system users. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref>, the video manager <b>106</b> can generate a post <b>308</b><i>b </i>including a video preview window <b>312</b><i>b </i>and add the generated post <b>308</b><i>b </i>to the newsfeed <b>306</b><i>b </i>displayed within the social networking system GUI <b>304</b><i>a </i>on the touch screen display <b>302</b><i>b </i>of a client computing device <b>300</b><i>b </i>of a social networking system friend of the user who selected the portion of the digital video (e.g., the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>a</i>). As mentioned above, the video manager <b>106</b> can configure the video preview window <b>312</b><i>b </i>based on the video file layer generated when the portion of the digital video was selected. Accordingly, in one or more embodiments, the video preview window <b>312</b><i>b </i>can auto-play the selected portion of the digital video starting at the starting timestamp and ending at the ending timestamp as indicated by the associated video file layer. In additional or alternative embodiments, the generated post <b>308</b><i>b </i>may include additional controls (e.g., in addition to the controls <b>310</b><i>b</i>) for use in association with the video preview window. For example, in one embodiment, the generated post <b>308</b><i>b </i>may include a share control, a like control, and/or a comment control specifically directed to the selected portion of the digital video within the video preview window <b>312</b>b. Alternatively, the generated post <b>308</b><i>b </i>may include the existing share/like/comment controls in different locations.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In one or more embodiments, the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>b </i>can utilize the social networking system activity controls <b>310</b><i>b </i>to like, comment on, or share the digital video. In at least one embodiment, the video manager <b>106</b> may take utilizing the social networking system activity controls <b>310</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref> to mean the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>b </i>is liking, commenting on, or sharing only the selected portion of the digital video, as indicated by the associated video file layer. In alternative embodiments, the video manager <b>106</b> may take utilizing the social networking system activity controls <b>310</b><i>b </i>to mean the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>b </i>is liking, commenting on, or sharing the entire digital video indicated by the associated video file layer. In that case, the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>b </i>can like, comment on, or share only the selected portion of the digital video by opening the digital video in the full screen video GUI, as described above. In one or more embodiments, when the user opens the digital video in the full screen video GUI, the video manager <b>106</b> can provide an indicator within the playback timeline <b>316</b> that shows the portion of the digital video selected by the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>a </i>(e.g., &#x201c;Bob Potter&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">As discussed above, the video manager <b>106</b> can also identify viral portions of digital videos that are shared by users of the social networking system <b>104</b>. For example, when a threshold number of social networking system users like and/or share the same particular portion of a digital video, that portion becomes viral. Accordingly, the video manager <b>106</b> can track the portions of digital videos that are shared and liked by social networking system users in order to determine whether a particular digital video portion has &#x201c;gone viral.&#x201d; In one or more embodiments, in response to identifying a viral portion of a particular digital video, the video manager <b>106</b> can provide an indication within the digital video as to where the viral portion is located within the digital video.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">To illustrate, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> shows the social networking system GUI <b>304</b><i>a </i>on the touch screen display <b>302</b><i>a </i>of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>a. </i>As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the social networking system GUI <b>304</b><i>a </i>includes a newsfeed <b>306</b><i>a </i>of the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>a </i>and shows a post <b>308</b><i>c. </i>In one or more embodiments, the post <b>308</b><i>c </i>includes an embedded video preview window <b>312</b><i>c </i>associated with a particular digital video and has been shared, re-shared, commented on, and viewed by many social networking system users (e.g., as indicated by the information included in the social networking system activity controls <b>310</b><i>c</i>).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Also as described above, the digital video associated with the embedded video preview window <b>312</b><i>c </i>may include one or more viral portions. In one or more embodiments, the video manager <b>106</b> identifies viral portions of widely shared digital videos by identifying video file layers and/or corresponding social networking activity associated with a widely shared digital video (e.g., where the video file layers are created and/or modified in response to and for the purpose of tracking a user liking, sharing, commenting on, or viewing a particular portion of the digital video where the particular portion is indicated by a starting timestamp and an ending timestamp), weighting the social networking activity associated with each video file layer (e.g., based on the types of social networking activity associated with each video portion), and determining virality scores for each segment (e.g., for each timestamp, each second interval, each 5-second interval, or each 10-second interval) of the video to identify the virality thereof. In response to the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>a </i>selecting the video activation control <b>314</b><i>c </i>in the embedded video preview window <b>312</b><i>c, </i>the social networking application <b>130</b> can provide the full screen video GUI <b>304</b><i>b </i>on the touch screen display <b>302</b><i>a </i>of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>a, </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the social networking application <b>130</b> can provide the digital video associated with the embedded video preview window <b>312</b> (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>) in the full screen video GUI <b>304</b><i>b. </i>In one or more embodiments, in response to the video manager <b>106</b> identifying one or more viral portions of the digital video, the social networking application <b>130</b> can also provide a viral portion indicator <b>338</b> within the playback timeline <b>316</b>. For example, the viral portion indicator <b>338</b> indicates the starting and ending points of a viral portion of the digital video that has been liked and/or shared by a threshold number of social networking system users. The viral portion indicator <b>338</b> can include a number of how many likes, shares, comments, and/or views the viral portion of the digital video has garnered (e.g., &#x201c;1.2 k Likes&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In additional or alternative embodiments, the viral portion indicator <b>338</b> can include different colors, icons, etc. within the playback timeline <b>316</b> to draw a user's attention to the viral portion of the video. For example, the viral portion indicator <b>338</b> can be a highlighted section of the playback timeline <b>316</b>. Alternatively, if a particular digital video includes more than one viral portion, the viral portion indicators may be a color coding of the playback timeline <b>316</b> to indicate how viral a particular portion is based on the calculated and weighted virality scores/counts, as described above (e.g., a less viral portion corresponds to a section of the playback timeline <b>316</b> that is colored yellow, while a more viral portion corresponds to a section of the playback timeline <b>316</b> that is colored red). Additionally or alternative, the playback timeline <b>316</b> may be arbitrarily broken into predefined segments (e.g., at 1 second intervals, 5 second intervals, etc.) and each predefined segment may be color coded to indicate a virality of that particular segment.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In one or more embodiments, the user of the client computing device <b>300</b><i>a </i>can like or share only the viral portion of the digital video identified the viral portion indicator <b>338</b> (e.g., by selecting the viral portion within the playback timeline <b>316</b> and then selecting a corresponding activity control).

Computer-readable media that store computer-executable instructions are non-transitory computer-readable storage media (devices). Computer-readable media that carry computer-executable instructions are transmission media. Thus, by way of example, and not limitation, embodiments of the disclosure can comprise at least two distinctly different kinds of computer-readable media: non-transitory computer-readable storage media (devices) and transmission media.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Non-transitory computer-readable storage media (devices) includes RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM, solid state drives (&#x201c;SSDs&#x201d;) (e.g., based on RAM), Flash memory, phase-change memory (&#x201c;PCM&#x201d;), other types of memory, other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">A &#x201c;network&#x201d; is defined as one or more data links that enable the transport of electronic data between computer systems and/or modules and/or other electronic devices. When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or a combination of hardwired or wireless) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a transmission medium. Transmissions media can include a network and/or data links which can be used to carry desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Further, upon reaching various computer system components, program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures can be transferred automatically from transmission media to non-transitory computer-readable storage media (devices) (or vice versa). For example, computer-executable instructions or data structures received over a network or data link can be buffered in RAM within a network interface module (e.g., a &#x201c;NIC&#x201d;), and then eventually transferred to computer system RAM and/or to less volatile computer storage media (devices) at a computer system. Thus, it should be understood that non-transitory computer-readable storage media (devices) can be included in computer system components that also (or even primarily) utilize transmission media.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Computer-executable instructions comprise, for example, instructions and data which, when executed at a processor, cause a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions.

A social networking system may enable its users (such as persons or organizations) to interact with the system and with each other. The social networking system may, with input from a user, create and store in the social networking system a user profile associated with the user. The user profile may include demographic information, communication-channel information, and information on personal interests of the user. The social networking system may also, with input from a user, create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social networking system, as well as provide services (e.g., posts, photo-sharing, video-sharing, event organization, messaging, games, or advertisements) to facilitate social interaction between or among users.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The social networking system may store records of users and relationships between users in a social graph comprising a plurality of nodes and a plurality of edges connecting the nodes. The nodes may comprise a plurality of user nodes and a plurality of concept nodes. A user node of the social graph may correspond to a user of the social networking system. A user may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities). A user node corresponding to a user may comprise information provided by the user and information gathered by various systems, including the social networking system.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">For example, the user may provide his or her name, profile picture, city of residence, contact information, birth date, gender, marital status, family status, employment, educational background, preferences, interests, and other demographic information to be included in the user node. Each user node of the social graph may have a corresponding web page (typically known as a profile page). In response to a request including a user name, the social networking system can access a user node corresponding to the user name, and construct a profile page including the name, a profile picture, and other information associated with the user. A profile page of a first user may display to a second user all or a portion of the first user's information based on one or more privacy settings by the first user and the relationship between the first user and the second user.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">A concept node may correspond to a concept of the social networking system. For example, a concept can represent a real-world entity, such as a movie, a song, a sports team, a celebrity, a group, a restaurant, or a place or a location. An administrative user of a concept node corresponding to a concept may create or update the concept node by providing information of the concept (e.g., by filling out an online form), causing the social networking system to associate the information with the concept node. For example and without limitation, information associated with a concept can include a name or a title, one or more images (e.g., an image of cover page of a book), a web site (e.g., an URL address) or contact information (e.g., a phone number, an email address). Each concept node of the social graph may correspond to a web page. For example, in response to a request including a name, the social networking system can access a concept node corresponding to the name, and construct a web page including the name and other information associated with the concept.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">An edge between a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. For example, an edge between two user nodes can represent a friendship between two users. For another example, the social networking system may construct a web page (or a structured document) of a concept node (e.g., a restaurant, a celebrity), incorporating one or more selectable option or selectable elements (e.g., &#x201c;like&#x201d;, &#x201c;check in&#x201d;) in the web page. A user can access the page using a web browser hosted by the user's client device and select a selectable option or selectable element, causing the client device to transmit to the social networking system a request to create an edge between a user node of the user and a concept node of the concept, indicating a relationship between the user and the concept (e.g., the user checks in a restaurant, or the user &#x201c;likes&#x201d; a celebrity).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">As an example, a user may provide (or change) his or her city of residence, causing the social networking system to create an edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the city declared by the user as his or her city of residence. In addition, the degree of separation between any two nodes is defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the social graph from one node to the other. A degree of separation between two nodes can be considered a measure of relatedness between the users or the concepts represented by the two nodes in the social graph. For example, two users having user nodes that are directly connected by an edge (i.e., are first-degree nodes) may be described as &#x201c;connected users&#x201d; or &#x201c;friends.&#x201d; Similarly, two users having user nodes that are connected only through another user node (i.e., are second-degree nodes) may be described as &#x201c;friends of friends.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">A social networking system may support a variety of applications, such as photo sharing, on-line calendars and events, gaming, instant messaging, and advertising. For example, the social networking system may also include media sharing capabilities. Also, the social networking system may allow users to post photographs and other multimedia content items to a user's profile page (typically known as &#x201c;wall posts&#x201d; or &#x201c;timeline posts&#x201d;) or in a photo album, both of which may be accessible to other users of the social networking system depending upon the user's configured privacy settings. The social networking system may also allow users to configure events. For example, a first user may configure an event with attributes including time and date of the event, location of the event and other users invited to the event. The invited users may receive invitations to the event and respond (such as by accepting the invitation or declining it). Furthermore, the social networking system may allow users to maintain a personal calendar. Similarly to events, the calendar entries may include times, dates, locations and identities of other users.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an example network environment <b>800</b> of a social networking system.

A user viewing the third-party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons (e.g., &#x201c;eat&#x201d;), causing a client system <b>806</b> to send to social networking system <b>802</b> a message indicating the user's action. In response to the message, social networking system <b>802</b> may create an edge (e.g., an &#x201c;eat&#x201d; edge) between a user node <b>902</b> corresponding to the user and a concept node <b>904</b> corresponding to the third-party webpage or resource and store edge <b>906</b> in one or more data stores.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In particular embodiments, a pair of nodes in social graph <b>900</b> may be connected to each other by one or more edges <b>906</b>. An edge <b>906</b> connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments, an edge <b>906</b> may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation, a first user may indicate that a second user is a &#x201c;friend&#x201d; of the first user.

As an example and not by way of limitation, an advertisement may enable a user to &#x201c;like&#x201d; or otherwise endorse the advertisement by selecting an icon or link associated with endorsement. As another example and not by way of limitation, an advertisement may enable a user to search (e.g., by executing a query) for content related to the advertiser. Similarly, a user may share the advertisement with another user (e.g., through social networking system <b>802</b>) or RSVP (e.g., through social networking system <b>802</b>) to an event associated with the advertisement.

Affinity may represent the strength of a relationship or level of interest between particular objects associated with the online social network, such as users, concepts, content, actions, advertisements, other objects associated with the online social network, or any suitable combination thereof. Affinity may also be determined with respect to objects associated with third-party systems <b>908</b> or other suitable systems. An overall affinity for a social-graph entity for each user, subject matter, or type of content may be established. The overall affinity may change based on continued monitoring of the actions or relationships associated with the social-graph entity. Although this disclosure describes determining particular affinities in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates determining any suitable affinities in any suitable manner.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">In particular embodiments, social networking system <b>802</b> may measure or quantify social-graph affinity using an affinity coefficient (which may be referred to herein as &#x201c;coefficient&#x201d;). The coefficient may represent or quantify the strength of a relationship between particular objects associated with the online social network. The coefficient may also represent a probability or function that measures a predicted probability that a user will perform a particular action based on the user's interest in the action. In this way, a user's future actions may be predicted based on the user's prior actions, where the coefficient may be calculated at least in part the history of the user's actions. Coefficients may be used to predict any number of actions, which may be within or outside of the online social network. As an example and not by way of limitation, these actions may include various types of communications, such as sending messages, posting content, or commenting on content; various types of a observation actions, such as accessing or viewing profile pages, media, or other suitable content; various types of coincidence information about two or more social-graph entities, such as being in the same group, tagged in the same photograph, checked-in at the same location, or attending the same event; or other suitable actions. Although this disclosure describes measuring affinity in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates measuring affinity in any suitable manner.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">In particular embodiments, social networking system <b>802</b> may use a variety of factors to calculate a coefficient. These factors may include, for example, user actions, types of relationships between objects, location information, other suitable factors, or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments, different factors may be weighted differently when calculating the coefficient. The weights for each factor may be static or the weights may change according to, for example, the user, the type of relationship, the type of action, the user's location, and so forth. Ratings for the factors may be combined according to their weights to determine an overall coefficient for the user. As an example and not by way of limitation, particular user actions may be assigned both a rating and a weight while a relationship associated with the particular user action is assigned a rating and a correlating weight (e.g., so the weights total 100%). To calculate the coefficient of a user towards a particular object, the rating assigned to the user's actions may comprise, for example, 60% of the overall coefficient, while the relationship between the user and the object may comprise 40% of the overall coefficient. In particular embodiments, the social networking system <b>802</b> may consider a variety of variables when determining weights for various factors used to calculate a coefficient, such as, for example, the time since information was accessed, decay factors, frequency of access, relationship to information or relationship to the object about which information was accessed, relationship to social-graph entities connected to the object, short- or long-term averages of user actions, user feedback, other suitable variables, or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation, a coefficient may include a decay factor that causes the strength of the signal provided by particular actions to decay with time, such that more recent actions are more relevant when calculating the coefficient. The ratings and weights may be continuously updated based on continued tracking of the actions upon which the coefficient is based. Any type of process or algorithm may be employed for assigning, combining, averaging, and so forth the ratings for each factor and the weights assigned to the factors. In particular embodiments, social networking system <b>802</b> may determine coefficients using machine-learning algorithms trained on historical actions and past user responses, or data farmed from users by exposing them to various options and measuring responses. Although this disclosure describes calculating coefficients in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates calculating coefficients in any suitable manner.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">In particular embodiments, social networking system <b>802</b> may calculate a coefficient based on a user's actions. Social networking system <b>802</b> may monitor such actions on the online social network, on a third-party system <b>808</b>, on other suitable systems, or any combination thereof. Any suitable type of user actions may be tracked or monitored. Typical user actions include viewing profile pages, creating or posting content, interacting with content, joining groups, listing and confirming attendance at events, checking-in at locations, liking particular pages, creating pages, and performing other tasks that facilitate social action. In particular embodiments, social networking system <b>802</b> may calculate a coefficient based on the user's actions with particular types of content. The content may be associated with the online social network, a third-party system <b>808</b>, or another suitable system. The content may include users, profile pages, posts, news stories, headlines, instant messages, chat room conversations, emails, advertisements, pictures, video, music, other suitable objects, or any combination thereof. Social networking system <b>802</b> may analyze a user's actions to determine whether one or more of the actions indicate an affinity for subject matter, content, other users, and so forth. As an example and not by way of limitation, if a user may make frequently posts content related to &#x201c;coffee&#x201d; or variants thereof, social networking system <b>802</b> may determine the user has a high coefficient with respect to the concept &#x201c;coffee&#x201d;. Particular actions or types of actions may be assigned a higher weight and/or rating than other actions, which may affect the overall calculated coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation, if a first user emails a second user, the weight or the rating for the action may be higher than if the first user simply views the user-profile page for the second user.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">In particular embodiments, social networking system <b>802</b> may calculate a coefficient based on the type of relationship between particular objects. Referencing the social graph <b>900</b>, social networking system <b>802</b> may analyze the number and/or type of edges <b>906</b> connecting particular user nodes <b>902</b> and concept nodes <b>904</b> when calculating a coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation, user nodes <b>902</b> that are connected by a spouse-type edge (representing that the two users are married) may be assigned a higher coefficient than a user node <b>902</b> that are connected by a friend-type edge. In other words, depending upon the weights assigned to the actions and relationships for the particular user, the overall affinity may be determined to be higher for content about the user's spouse than for content about the user's friend. In particular embodiments, the relationships a user has with another object may affect the weights and/or the ratings of the user's actions with respect to calculating the coefficient for that object. As an example and not by way of limitation, if a user is tagged in first photo, but merely likes a second photo, social networking system <b>802</b> may determine that the user has a higher coefficient with respect to the first photo than the second photo because having a tagged-in-type relationship with content may be assigned a higher weight and/or rating than having a like-type relationship with content. In particular embodiments, social networking system <b>802</b> may calculate a coefficient for a first user based on the relationship one or more second users have with a particular object. In other words, the connections and coefficients other users have with an object may affect the first user's coefficient for the object. As an example and not by way of limitation, if a first user is connected to or has a high coefficient for one or more second users, and those second users are connected to or have a high coefficient for a particular object, social networking system <b>802</b> may determine that the first user should also have a relatively high coefficient for the particular object. In particular embodiments, the coefficient may be based on the degree of separation between particular objects. The lower coefficient may represent the decreasing likelihood that the first user will share an interest in content objects of the user that is indirectly connected to the first user in the social graph <b>900</b>. As an example and not by way of limitation, social-graph entities that are closer in the social graph <b>900</b> (i.e., fewer degrees of separation) may have a higher coefficient than entities that are further apart in the social graph <b>900</b>.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">In particular embodiments, social networking system <b>802</b> may calculate a coefficient based on location information. Objects that are geographically closer to each other may be considered to be more related, or of more interest, to each other than more distant objects. In particular embodiments, the coefficient of a user towards a particular object may be based on the proximity of the object's location to a current location associated with the user (or the location of a client system <b>806</b> of the user). A first user may be more interested in other users or concepts that are closer to the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation, if a user is one mile from an airport and two miles from a gas station, social networking system <b>802</b> may determine that the user has a higher coefficient for the airport than the gas station based on the proximity of the airport to the user.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">In particular embodiments, social networking system <b>802</b> may perform particular actions with respect to a user based on coefficient information. Coefficients may be used to predict whether a user will perform a particular action based on the user's interest in the action. A coefficient may be used when generating or presenting any type of objects to a user, such as advertisements, search results, news stories, media, messages, notifications, or other suitable objects. The coefficient may also be utilized to rank and order such objects, as appropriate. In this way, social networking system <b>802</b> may provide information that is relevant to user's interests and current circumstances, increasing the likelihood that they will find such information of interest. In particular embodiments, social networking system <b>802</b> may generate content based on coefficient information. Content objects may be provided or selected based on coefficients specific to a user. As an example and not by way of limitation, the coefficient may be used to generate media for the user, where the user may be presented with media for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the media object. As another example and not by way of limitation, the coefficient may be used to generate advertisements for the user, where the user may be presented with advertisements for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the advertised object. In particular embodiments, social networking system <b>802</b> may generate search results based on coefficient information. Search results for a particular user may be scored or ranked based on the coefficient associated with the search results with respect to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation, search results corresponding to objects with higher coefficients may be ranked higher on a search-results page than results corresponding to objects having lower coefficients.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">In particular embodiments, social networking system <b>802</b> may calculate a coefficient in response to a request for a coefficient from a particular system or process. To predict the likely actions a user may take (or may be the subject of) in a given situation, any process may request a calculated coefficient for a user. The request may also include a set of weights to use for various factors used to calculate the coefficient. This request may come from a process running on the online social network, from a third-party system <b>808</b> (e.g., via an API or other communication channel), or from another suitable system. In response to the request, social networking system <b>802</b> may calculate the coefficient (or access the coefficient information if it has previously been calculated and stored). In particular embodiments, social networking system <b>802</b> may measure an affinity with respect to a particular process. Different processes (both internal and external to the online social network) may request a coefficient for a particular object or set of objects. Social networking system <b>802</b> may provide a measure of affinity that is relevant to the particular process that requested the measure of affinity. In this way, each process receives a measure of affinity that is tailored for the different context in which the process will use the measure of affinity.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">In connection with social-graph affinity and affinity coefficients, particular embodiments may utilize one or more systems, components, elements, functions, methods, operations, or steps disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser.

The privacy settings (or &#x201c;access settings&#x201d;) for an object may be stored in any suitable manner, such as, for example, in association with the object, in an index on an authorization server, in another suitable manner, or any combination thereof. A privacy setting of an object may specify how the object (or particular information associated with an object) can be accessed (e.g., viewed or shared) using the online social network. Where the privacy settings for an object allow a particular user to access that object, the object may be described as being &#x201c;visible&#x201d; with respect to that user. As an example and not by way of limitation, a user of the online social network may specify privacy settings for a user-profile page identify a set of users that may access the work experience information on the user-profile page, thus excluding other users from accessing the information. In particular embodiments, the privacy settings may specify a &#x201c;blocked list&#x201d; of users that should not be allowed to access certain information associated with the object. In other words, the blocked list may specify one or more users or entities for which an object is not visible. As an example and not by way of limitation, a user may specify a set of users that may not access photos albums associated with the user, thus excluding those users from accessing the photo albums (while also possibly allowing certain users not within the set of users to access the photo albums). In particular embodiments, privacy settings may be associated with particular social-graph elements. Privacy settings of a social-graph element, such as a node or an edge, may specify how the social-graph element, information associated with the social-graph element, or content objects associated with the social-graph element can be accessed using the online social network. As an example and not by way of limitation, a particular concept node <b>904</b> corresponding to a particular photo may have a privacy setting specifying that the photo may only be accessed by users tagged in the photo and their friends. In particular embodiments, privacy settings may allow users to opt in or opt out of having their actions logged by social networking system <b>802</b> or shared with other systems (e.g., third-party system <b>808</b>). In particular embodiments, the privacy settings associated with an object may specify any suitable granularity of permitted access or denial of access. As an example and not by way of limitation, access or denial of access may be specified for particular users (e.g., only me, my roommates, and my boss), users within a particular degrees-of-separation (e.g., friends, or friends-of-friends), user groups (e.g., the gaming club, my family), user networks (e.g., employees of particular employers, students or alumni of particular university), all users (&#x201c;public&#x201d;), no users (&#x201c;private&#x201d;), users of third-party systems <b>808</b>, particular applications (e.g., third-party applications, external websites), other suitable users or entities, or any combination thereof. Although this disclosure describes using particular privacy settings in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates using any suitable privacy settings in any suitable manner.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">In particular embodiments, one or more servers may be authorization/privacy servers for enforcing privacy settings. In response to a request from a user (or other entity) for a particular object stored in a data store, social networking system <b>802</b> may send a request to the data store for the object. The request may identify the user associated with the request and may only be sent to the user (or a client system <b>806</b> of the user) if the authorization server determines that the user is authorized to access the object based on the privacy settings associated with the object. If the requesting user is not authorized to access the object, the authorization server may prevent the requested object from being retrieved from the data store, or may prevent the requested object from be sent to the user. In the search query context, an object may only be generated as a search result if the querying user is authorized to access the object. In other words, the object must have a visibility that is visible to the querying user. If the object has a visibility that is not visible to the user, the object may be excluded from the search results. Although this disclosure describes enforcing privacy settings in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates enforcing privacy settings in any suitable manner.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">The foregoing specification is described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof.
