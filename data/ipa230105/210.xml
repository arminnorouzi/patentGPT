Liu, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,691,433, titled &#x201c;Automatic tightening shoe&#x201d;, provides a first fastener mounted on a shoe's upper portion, and a second fastener connected to a closure member and capable of removable engagement with the first fastener to retain the closure member at a tightened state. Liu teaches a drive unit mounted in the heel portion of the sole. The drive unit includes a housing, a spool rotatably mounted in the housing, a pair of pull strings and a motor unit. Each string has a first end connected to the spool and a second end corresponding to a string hole in the second fastener. The motor unit is coupled to the spool. Liu teaches that the motor unit is operable to drive rotation of the spool in the housing to wind the pull strings on the spool for pulling the second fastener towards the first fastener. Liu also teaches a guide tube unit that the pull strings can extend through.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">OVERVIEW</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present inventors have recognized, among other things, a need for an improved lacing apparatus for automated and semi-automated tightening of shoe laces. This document describes, among other things, the mechanical design of a lacing apparatus portion of a footwear platform. The following examples provide a non-limiting overview of the lacing apparatus and supporting footwear components discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Example 1 describes subject matter including a footwear lacing apparatus. In this example, the footwear apparatus can include a housing structure, a spool and a drive mechanism. The housing structure can include a top section and a bottom section. The spool can include a superior surface, a lace spool under the superior surface and a spool shaft with a keyed connection pin.

While Nike&#xae; has since released at least one version of power-laced sneakers similar in appearance to the movie prop version from Back to the Future II, the internal mechanical systems and surrounding footwear platform employed in these early versions do not necessarily lend themselves to mass production or daily use. Additionally, previous designs for motorized lacing systems comparatively suffered from problems such as high cost of manufacture, complexity, assembly challenges, lack of serviceability, and weak or fragile mechanical mechanisms, to highlight just a few of the many issues. The present inventors have developed a modular footwear platform to accommodate motorized and non-motorized lacing engines that solves some or all of the problems discussed above, among others. The components discussed below provide various benefits including, but not limited to: serviceable components, interchangeable automated lacing engines, robust mechanical design, reliable operation, streamlined assembly processes, and retail-level customization. Various other benefits of the components described below will be evident to persons of skill in the relevant arts.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The motorized lacing engine discussed below was developed from the ground up to provide a robust, serviceable, and inter-changeable component of an automated lacing footwear platform. The lacing engine includes unique design elements that enable retail-level final assembly into a modular footwear platform. The lacing engine design allows for the majority of the footwear assembly process to leverage known assembly technologies, with unique adaptions to standard assembly processes still being able to leverage current assembly resources.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an example, the modular automated lacing footwear platform includes a mid-sole plate secured to the mid-sole for receiving a lacing engine. The design of the mid-sole plate allows a lacing engine to be dropped into the footwear platform as late as at a point of purchase. The mid-sole plate, and other aspects of the modular automated footwear platform, allow for different types of lacing engines to be used interchangeably. For example, the motorized lacing engine discussed below could be changed out for a human-powered lacing engine. Alternatively, a fully-automatic motorized lacing engine with foot presence sensing or other optional features could be accommodated within the standard mid-sole plate.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The automated footwear platform discussed herein can include an outsole actuator interface to provide tightening control to the end user as well as visual feedback through LED lighting projected through translucent protective outsole materials. The actuator can provide tactile and visual feedback to the user to indicate status of the lacing engine or other automated footwear platform components.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">This initial overview is intended to introduce the subject matter of the present patent application. It is not intended to provide an exclusive or exhaustive explanation of the various inventions disclosed in the following more detailed description.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Automated Footwear Platform</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The following discusses various components of the automated footwear platform including a motorized lacing engine, a mid-sole plate, and various other components of the platform. While much of this disclosure focuses on a motorized lacing engine, many of the mechanical aspects of the discussed designs are applicable to a human-powered lacing engine or other motorized lacing engines with additional or fewer capabilities, Accordingly, the term &#x201c;automated&#x201d; as used in &#x201c;automated footwear platform&#x201d; is not intended to only cover a system that operates without user input. Rather, the term &#x201c;automated footwear platform&#x201d; includes various electrically powered and human-power, automatically activated and human activated mechanisms for tightening a lacing or retention system of the footwear.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded view illustration of components of a motorized lacing system for footwear, according to some example embodiments. The motorized lacing system I illustrated in FIG I includes a lacing engine <b>10</b>, a lid <b>20</b>, an actuator <b>30</b>, a mid-sole plate <b>40</b>, a mid-sole <b>50</b>, and an outsole <b>60</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the basic assembly sequence of components of an automated lacing footwear platform. The motorized lacing system <b>1</b> starts with the mid-sole plate <b>40</b> being secured within the mid-sole. Next, the actuator <b>30</b> is inserted into an opening in the lateral side of the mid-sole plate opposite to interface buttons that can be embedded in the outsole <b>60</b>. Next, the lacing engine <b>10</b> is dropped into the mid-sole plate <b>40</b>. In an example, the lacing system <b>1</b> is inserted under a continuous loop of lacing cable and the lacing cable is aligned with a spool in the lacing engine <b>10</b> (discussed below). Finally, the lid <b>20</b> is inserted into grooves in the mid-sole plate <b>40</b>, secured into a closed position, and latched into a recess in the mid-sole plate <b>40</b>. The lid <b>20</b> can capture the lacing engine <b>10</b> and can assist in maintaining alignment of a lacing cable during operation.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an example, the footwear article or the motorized lacing system <b>1</b> includes or is configured to interface with one or more sensors that can monitor or determine a foot presence characteristic. Based on information from one or more foot presence sensors, the footwear including the motorized lacing system <b>1</b> can be configured to perform various functions. For example, a foot presence sensor can be configured to provide binary information about whether a foot is present or not present in the footwear. If a binary signal from the foot presence sensor indicates that a foot is present, then the motorized lacing system <b>1</b> can he activated, such as to automatically tighten or relax (i.e., loosen) a footwear lacing cable. In an example, the footwear article includes a processor circuit that can receive or interpret signals from a foot presence sensor. The processor circuit can optionally be embedded in or with the lacing engine <b>10</b>, such as in a sole of the footwear article.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Examples of the lacing engine <b>10</b> are described in detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>N</figref>.

Examples of the mid-sole plate <b>40</b> are described in detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>D</figref>. Various additional details of the motorized lacing system <b>1</b> are discussed throughout the remainder of the description.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>N</figref> are diagrams and drawings illustrating a motorized lacing engine, according to some example embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> introduces various external features of an example lacing engine <b>10</b>, including a housing structure <b>100</b>, case screw <b>108</b>, lace channel <b>110</b> (also referred to as lace guide relief <b>110</b>), lace channel wall <b>112</b>, lace channel transition <b>114</b>, spool recess <b>115</b>, button openings <b>120</b>, buttons <b>121</b>, button membrane seal <b>124</b>, programming header <b>128</b>, spool <b>130</b>, and lace grove <b>132</b>. Additional details of the housing structure <b>100</b> are discussed below in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an example, the lacing engine <b>10</b> is held together by one or more screws, such as the case screw <b>108</b>. The case screw <b>108</b> is positioned near the primary drive mechanisms to enhance structural integrity of the lacing engine <b>10</b>. The case screw <b>108</b> also functions to assist the assembly process, such as holding the case together for ultra-sonic welding of exterior seams.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this example, the lacing engine <b>10</b> includes a lace channel <b>110</b> to receive a lace or lace cable once assembled into the automated footwear platform. The lace channel <b>110</b> can include a lace channel wall <b>112</b>. The lace channel wall <b>112</b> can include chamfered edges to provide a smooth guiding surface for a lace cable to run in during operation. Part of the smooth guiding surface of the lace channel <b>110</b> can include a channel transition <b>114</b>, which is a widened portion of the lace channel <b>110</b> leading into the spool recess <b>115</b>. The spool recess <b>115</b> transitions from the channel transition <b>114</b> into generally circular sections that conform closely to the profile of the spool <b>130</b>, The spool recess <b>115</b> assists in retaining the spooled lace cable, as well as in retaining position of the spool <b>130</b>. However, other aspects of the design provide primary retention of the spool <b>130</b>. In this example, the spool <b>130</b> is shaped similarly to half of a yo-yo with a lace grove <b>132</b> running through a flat top surface and a spool shaft <b>133</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) extending inferiorly from the opposite side. The spool <b>130</b> is described in further detail below in reference of additional figures.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The lateral side of the lacing engine <b>10</b> includes button openings <b>120</b> that enable buttons <b>121</b> for activation of the mechanism to extend through the housing structure <b>100</b>. The buttons <b>121</b> provide an external interface for activation of switches <b>122</b>, illustrated in additional figures discussed below. In some examples, the housing structure <b>100</b> includes button membrane seal <b>124</b> to provide protection from dirt and water. In this example, the button membrane seal <b>124</b> is up to a few mils (thousandth of an inch) thick clear plastic (or similar material) adhered from a superior surface of the housing structure <b>100</b> over a corner and down a lateral side. In another example, the button membrane seal <b>124</b> is a 2 mil thick vinyl adhesive backed membrane covering the buttons <b>121</b> and button openings <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is an illustration of housing structure <b>100</b> including top section <b>102</b> and bottom section <b>104</b>. In this example, the top section <b>102</b> includes features such as the case screw <b>108</b>, lace channel <b>110</b>, lace channel transition <b>114</b>, spool recess <b>115</b>, button openings <b>120</b>, and button seal recess <b>126</b>. The button seal recess <b>126</b> is a portion of the top section <b>102</b> relieved to provide an inset for the button membrane seal <b>124</b>. In this example, the button seal recess <b>126</b> is a couple mil recessed portion on the lateral side of the superior surface of the top section <b>104</b> transitioning over a portion of the lateral edge of the superior surface and down the length of a portion of the lateral side of the top section <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this example, the bottom section <b>104</b> includes features such as wireless charger access <b>105</b>, joint <b>106</b>, and grease isolation wall <b>109</b>. Also illustrated, but not specifically identified, is the case screw base for receiving case screw <b>108</b> as well as various features within the grease isolation wall <b>109</b> for holding portions of a drive mechanism. The grease isolation wall <b>109</b> is designed to retain grease or similar compounds surrounding the drive mechanism away from the electrical components of the lacing engine <b>10</b> including the gear motor and enclosed gear box. In this example, the worm gear <b>150</b> and worm drive <b>140</b> are contained within the grease isolation wall <b>109</b>, while other drive components such as gear box <b>144</b> and gear motor <b>145</b> are outside the grease isolation wall <b>109</b>. Positioning of the various components can be understood through a comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, for example.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> is an illustration of various internal components of lacing engine <b>10</b>, according to example embodiments. In this example, the lacing engine <b>10</b> further includes spool magnet <b>136</b>, O-ring seal <b>138</b>, worm drive <b>140</b>, bushing <b>141</b>, worm drive key <b>142</b>, gear box <b>144</b>, gear motor <b>145</b>, motor encoder <b>146</b>, motor circuit board <b>147</b>, worm gear <b>150</b>, circuit board <b>160</b>, motor header <b>161</b>, battery connection <b>162</b>, and wired charging header <b>163</b>. The spool magnet <b>136</b> assists in tracking movement of the spool <b>130</b> though detection by a magnetometer (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). The o-ring seal <b>138</b> functions to seal out dirt and moisture that could migrate into the lacing engine <b>10</b> around the spool shaft <b>133</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this example, major drive components of the lacing engine <b>10</b> include worm drive <b>140</b>, worm gear <b>150</b>, gear motor <b>145</b> and gear box <b>144</b>. The worm gear <b>150</b> is designed to inhibit back driving of worm drive <b>140</b> and gear motor <b>145</b>, which means the major input forces coming in from the lacing cable via the spool <b>130</b> are resolved on the comparatively large worm gear and worm drive teeth. This arrangement protects the gear box <b>144</b> from needing to include gears of sufficient strength to withstand both the dynamic loading from active use of the footwear platform or tightening loading from tightening the lacing system. The worm drive <b>140</b> includes additional features to assist in protecting the more fragile portions of the drive system, such as the worm drive key <b>142</b>. In this example, the worm drive key <b>142</b> is a radial slot in the motor end of the worm drive <b>140</b> that interfaces with a pin through the drive shaft coming out of the gear box <b>144</b>. This arrangement prevents the worm drive <b>140</b> from imparting any axial forces on the gear box <b>144</b> or gear motor <b>145</b> by allowing the worm drive <b>140</b> to move freely in an axial direction (away from the gear box <b>144</b>) transferring those axial loads onto bushing <b>141</b> and the housing structure <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> is an illustration depicting additional internal components of the lacing engine <b>10</b>. In this example, the lacing engine <b>10</b> includes drive components such as worm drive <b>140</b>, bushing <b>141</b>, gear box <b>144</b>, gear motor <b>145</b>, motor encoder <b>146</b>, motor circuit board <b>147</b> and worm gear <b>150</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> adds illustration of battery <b>170</b> as well as a better view of some of the drive components discussed above.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref> is another illustration depicting internal components of the lacing engine <b>10</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref> the worm gear <b>150</b> is removed to better illustrate the indexing wheel <b>151</b> (also referred to as the Geneva wheel <b>151</b>). The indexing wheel <b>151</b>, as described in further detail below, provides a mechanism to home the drive mechanism in case of electrical or mechanical failure and loss of position. In this example, the lacing engine <b>10</b> also includes a wireless charging interconnect <b>165</b> and a wireless charging coil <b>166</b>, which are located inferior to the battery <b>170</b> (which is not shown in this figure). In this example, the wireless charging coil <b>166</b> is mounted on an external inferior surface of the bottom section <b>104</b> of the lacing engine <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>F</figref> is a cross-section illustration of the lacing engine <b>10</b>, according to example embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>F</figref> assists in illustrating the structure of the spool <b>130</b> as well as how the lace grove <b>132</b> and lace channel <b>110</b> interface with lace cable <b>131</b>. As shown in this example, lace <b>131</b> runs continuously through the lace channel <b>110</b> and into the lace grove <b>132</b> of the spool <b>130</b>. The cross-section illustration also depicts lace recess <b>135</b> and spool mid-section, which are where the lace <b>131</b> will build up as it is taken up by rotation of the spool <b>130</b>. The spool mid-section <b>137</b> is a circular reduced diameter section disposed inferiorly to the superior surface of the spool <b>130</b>. The lace recess <b>135</b> is formed by a superior portion of the spool <b>130</b> that extends radially to substantially fill the spool recess <b>115</b>, the sides and floor of the spool recess <b>115</b>, and the spool mid-section <b>137</b>. In some examples, the superior portion of the spool <b>130</b> can extend beyond the spool recess <b>115</b>. In other examples, the spool <b>130</b> fits entirely within the spool recess <b>115</b>, with the superior radial portion extending to the sidewalls of the spool recess <b>115</b>, but allowing the spool <b>130</b> to freely rotation with the spool recess <b>115</b>. The lace <b>131</b> is captured by the lace groove <b>132</b> as it runs across the lacing engine <b>10</b>, so that when the spool <b>130</b> is turned, the lace <b>131</b> is rotated onto a body of the spool <b>130</b> within the lace recess <b>135</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As illustrated by the cross-section of lacing engine <b>10</b>, the spool <b>130</b> includes a spool shaft <b>133</b> that couples with worm gear <b>150</b> after running through an O-ring <b>138</b>. In this example, the spool shaft <b>133</b> is coupled to the worm gear via keyed connection pin <b>134</b>. In some examples, the keyed connection pin <b>134</b> only extends from the spool shaft <b>133</b> in one axial direction, and is contacted by a key on the worm gear in such a way as to allow for an almost complete revolution of the worm gear <b>150</b> before the keyed connection pin <b>134</b> is contacted when the direction of worm gear <b>150</b> is reversed. A clutch system could also be implemented to couple the spool <b>130</b> to the worm gear <b>150</b>. In such an example, the clutch mechanism could be deactivated to allow the spool <b>130</b> to run free upon de-lacing (loosening). In the example of the keyed connection pin <b>134</b> only extending is one axial direction from the spool shaft <b>133</b>, the spool is allowed to move freely upon initial activation of a de-lacing process, while the worm gear <b>150</b> is driven backward. Allowing the spool <b>130</b> to move freely during the initial portion of a de-lacing process assists in preventing tangles in the lace <b>131</b> as it provides time for the user to begin loosening the footwear, which in turn will tension the lace <b>131</b> in the loosening direction prior to being driven by the worm gear <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>G</figref> is another cross-section illustration of the lacing engine <b>10</b>, according to example embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>G</figref> illustrates a more medial cross-section of the lacing engine <b>10</b>, as compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>F</figref>, which illustrates additional components such as circuit board <b>160</b>, wireless charging interconnect <b>165</b>, and wireless charging coil <b>166</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>G</figref> is also used to depict additional detail surround the spool <b>130</b> and lace <b>131</b> interface.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>H</figref> is a top view of the lacing engine <b>10</b>, according to example embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>H</figref> emphasizes the grease isolation wall <b>109</b> and illustrates how the grease isolation wall <b>109</b> surrounds certain portions of the drive mechanism, including spool <b>130</b>, worm gear <b>150</b>, worm drive <b>140</b>, and gear box <b>145</b>.

The index wheel <b>151</b> is a variation on the well-known Geneva wheel used in watchmaking and film projectors. A typical Geneva wheel or drive mechanism provides a method of translating continuous rotational movement into intermittent motion, such as is needed in a film projector or to make the second hand of a watch move intermittently. Watchmakers used a different type of Geneva wheel to prevent over-winding of a mechanical watch spring, but using a Geneva wheel with a missing slot (e.g., one of the Geneva slots <b>157</b> would be missing). The missing slot would prevent further indexing of the Geneva wheel, which was responsible for winding the spring and prevents over-winding. In the illustrated example, the lacing engine <b>10</b> includes a variation on the Geneva wheel, indexing wheel <b>151</b>, which includes a small stop tooth <b>156</b> that acts as a stopping mechanism in a horning operation. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>J-<b>2</b>M</figref>, the standard Geneva teeth <b>155</b> simply index for each rotation of the worm gear <b>150</b> when the index tooth <b>152</b> engages the Geneva slot <b>157</b> next to one of the Geneva teeth <b>155</b>. However, when the index tooth <b>152</b> engages the Geneva slot <b>157</b> next to the stop tooth <b>156</b> a larger force is generated, which can be used to stall the drive mechanism in a homing operation. The stop tooth <b>156</b> can be used to create a known location of the mechanism for homing in case of loss of other positioning information, such as the motor encoder <b>146</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>J-<b>2</b>M</figref> are illustrations of the worm gear <b>150</b> and index wheel <b>151</b> moving through an index operation, according to example embodiments.

The process <b>700</b> described in further detail below can include some or all of the process operations described and at least some of the process operations can occur at various locations (e.g., manufacturing plant versus retail store). In certain examples, all of the process operations discussed in reference to process <b>700</b> can be completed within a manufacturing location with a completed automated footwear platform delivered directly to a consumer or to a retail location for purchase. The process <b>700</b> can also include assembly operations associated with assembly of the lacing engine <b>10</b>, which are illustrated and discussed above in reference to various figures, including <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>D</figref>. Many of these details are not specifically discussed in reference to the description of process <b>700</b> provided below solely for the sake of brevity and clarity.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In this example, the process <b>700</b> begins at <b>710</b> with obtaining an out-sole and mid-sole assembly, such as mid-sole <b>50</b> and out-sole <b>60</b>. The mid-sole <b>50</b> can be adhered to out-sole <b>60</b> during or prior to process <b>700</b>. At <b>720</b>, the process <b>700</b> continues with insertion of a mid-sole plate, such as mid-sole plate <b>40</b>, into a plate recess <b>510</b>. In some examples, the mid-sole plate <b>40</b> includes a layer of adhesive on the inferior surface to adhere the mid-sole plate into the mid-sole. In other examples, adhesive is applied to the mid-sole prior to insertion of a mid-sole plate. In some examples, the adhesive can be heat activated after assembly of the mid-sole plate <b>40</b> into the plate recess <b>510</b>. In still other examples, the mid-sole is designed with an interference fit with the mid-sole plate, which does not require adhesive to secure the two components of the automated footwear platform. In yet other examples, the mid-sole plate is secured through a combination of interference fit and fasteners, such as adhesive.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">At <b>730</b>, the process <b>700</b> continues with a laced upper portion of the automated footwear platform being attached to the mid-sole. Attachment of the laced upper portion is done through any known footwear manufacturing process, with the addition of positioning a lower lace loop into the mid-sole plate for subsequent engagement with a lacing engine, such as lacing engine <b>10</b>. For example, attaching a laced upper to mid-sole <b>50</b> with mid-sole plate <b>40</b> inserted, a lower lace loop is positioned to align with medial lace guide <b>420</b> and lateral lace guide <b>421</b>, which position the lace loop properly to engage with lacing engine <b>10</b> when inserted later in the assembly process. Assembly of the upper portion is discussed in greater detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref> below, including how the lace loop can be formed during assembly.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">At <b>740</b>, the process <b>700</b> continues with insertion of an actuator, such as actuator <b>30</b>, into the mid-sole plate. Optionally, insertion of the actuator can be done prior to attachment of the upper portion at operation <b>730</b>. In an example, insertion of actuator <b>30</b> into the actuator cutout <b>480</b> of mid-sole plate <b>40</b> involves a snap fit between actuator <b>30</b> and actuator cutout <b>480</b>. Optionally, process <b>700</b> continues at <b>745</b> with shipment of the subassembly of the automated footwear platform to a retail location or similar point of sale. The remaining operations within process <b>700</b> can be performed without special tools or materials, which allows for flexible customization of the product sold at the retail level without the need to manufacture and inventory every combination of automated footwear subassembly and lacing engine options. Even if there are only two different lacing engine options, fully automated and manually activated for example, the ability to configure the footwear platform at a retail level enhances flexibility and allows for ease of servicing lacing engines.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">At <b>750</b>, the process <b>700</b> continues with selection of a lacing engine, which may be an optional operation in cases where only one lacing engine is available. In an example, lacing engine <b>10</b>, a motorized lacing engine, is chosen for assembly into the subassembly from operations <b>710</b>-<b>740</b>. However, as noted above, the automated footwear platform is designed to accommodate various types of lacing engines from fully automatic motorized lacing engines to human-power manually activated lacing engines. The subassembly built up in operations <b>710</b>-<b>740</b>, with components such as out-sole <b>60</b>, mid-sole <b>50</b>, and mid-sole plate <b>40</b>, provides a modular platform to accommodate a wide range of optional automation components.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">At <b>760</b>, the process <b>700</b> continues with insertion of the selected lacing engine into the mid-sole plate. For example, lacing engine <b>10</b> can be inserted into mid-sole plate <b>40</b>, with the lacing engine <b>10</b> slipped underneath the lace loop running through the lacing engine cavity <b>410</b>. With the lacing engine <b>10</b> in place and the lace cable engaged within the spool of the lacing engine, such as spool <b>130</b>, a lid (or similar component) can be installed into the mid-sole plate to secure the lacing engine <b>10</b> and lace.

In this example, process <b>800</b> starts with operation <b>810</b>, which involves obtaining a knit upper and a lace (lace cable). Next, at operation <b>820</b>, a first half of the knit upper is laced with the lace. In this example, lacing the upper involves threading the lace cable through a number of eyelets and securing one end to an anterior section of the upper. Next, at operation <b>830</b>, the lace cable is routed under a fixture supporting the upper and around to the opposite side. In some examples, the fixture includes a specific routing grove or feature to create the desired lace loop length. Then, at operation <b>840</b>, the other half of the upper is laced, while maintaining a lower loop of lace around the fixture, The illustrated version of operation <b>840</b> can also include tightening the lace, which is operation <b>850</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>. At <b>860</b>, the lace is secured and trimmed and at <b>870</b> the fixture is removed to leave a laced knit upper with a lower lace loop under the upper portion.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> is a flowchart illustrating another example of process <b>800</b> for assembly of a footwear upper. In this example, the process <b>800</b> includes operations such as obtaining an upper and lace cable at <b>810</b>, lacing the first half of the upper at <b>820</b>, routing the lace under a lacing fixture at <b>830</b>, lacing the second half of the upper at <b>840</b>, tightening the lacing at <b>850</b>, completing upper at <b>860</b>, and removing the lacing fixture at <b>870</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The process <b>800</b> begins at <b>810</b> by obtaining an upper and a lace cable to being assembly. Obtaining the upper can include placing the upper on a lacing fixture used through other operations of process <b>800</b>. As noted above, one function of the lacing fixture can be to provide a. mechanism for generating repeatable lace loops for a particular footwear upper. In certain examples, the fixtures may be shoe size dependent, while in other examples the fixtures may accommodate multiple sizes and/or upper types. At <b>820</b>, the process <b>800</b> continues by lacing a first half of the upper with the lace cable. Lacing operation can include routing the lace cable through a series of eyelets or similar features built into the upper. The lacing operation at <b>820</b> can also include securing one end (e.g., a first end) of the lace cable to a portion of the upper. Securing the lace cable can include sewing, tying off, or otherwise terminating a first end of the lace cable to a fixed portion of the upper.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">At <b>830</b>, the process <b>800</b> continues with routing the free end of the lace cable under the upper and around the lacing fixture. In this example, the lacing fixture is used to create a proper lace loop under the upper for eventual engagement with a lacing engine after the upper is joined with a mid-sole/out-sole assembly (see discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> above). The lacing fixture can include a groove or similar feature to at least partially retain the lace cable during the sequent operations of process <b>800</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">At <b>840</b>, the process <b>800</b> continues with lacing the second half of the upper with the free end of the lace cable. Lacing the second half can include routing the lace cable through a second series of eyelets or similar features on the second half of the upper. At <b>850</b>, the process <b>800</b> continues by tightening the lace cable through the various eyelets and around the lacing fixture to ensure that the lower lace loop is properly formed for proper engagement with a lacing engine. The lacing fixture assists in obtaining a proper lace loop length, and different lacing fixtures can be used for different size or styles of footwear. The lacing process is completed at <b>860</b> with the free end of the lace cable being secured to the second half of the upper. Completion of the upper can also include additional trimming or stitching operations. Finally, at <b>870</b>, the process <b>800</b> completes with removal of the upper from the lacing fixture.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a drawing illustrating a mechanism for securing a lace within a spool of a lacing engine, according to some example embodiments.

The system <b>1000</b> illustrates basic components of a motorized lacing system such as including interface buttons, foot presence sensor(s), a printed circuit board assembly (PCA) with a processor circuit, a battery, a charging coil, an encoder, a motor, a transmission, and a spool. In this example, the interface buttons and foot presence sensor(s) communicate with the circuit board (PCA), which also communicates with the battery and charging coil. The encoder and motor are also connected to the circuit board and each other. The transmission couples the motor to the spool to form the drive mechanism.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In an example, the processor circuit controls one or more aspects of the drive mechanism. For example, the processor circuit can be configured to receive information from the buttons and/or from the foot presence sensor and/or from the battery and/or from the drive mechanism and/or from the encoder, and can be further configured to issue commands to the drive mechanism, such as to tighten or loosen the footwear, or to obtain or record sensor information, among other functions.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Motor Control Scheme</heading><p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>D</figref> are diagrams illustrating a motor control scheme <b>1100</b> for a motorized lacing engine, according to some example embodiments. In this example, the motor control scheme <b>1100</b> involves dividing up the total travel, in terms of lace take-up, into segments, with the segments varying in size based on position on a continuum of lace travel (e.g., between home/loose position on one end and max tightness on the other). As the motor is controlling a radial spool and will be controlled, primarily, via a radial encoder on the motor shaft, the segments can be sized in terms of degrees of spool travel (which can also be viewed in terms of encoder counts). On the loose side of the continuum, the segments can be larger, such as 10 degrees of spool travel, as the amount of lace movement is less critical. However, as the laces are tightened each increment of lace travel becomes more and more critical to obtain the desired amount of lace tightness. Other parameters, such as motor current, can be used as secondary measures of lace tightness or continuum position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> includes an illustration of different segment sizes based on position along a tightness continuum.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> illustrates using a tightness continuum position to build a table of motion profiles based on current tightness continuum position and desired end position.
