For example, plasma processing chambers are used to deposit material on a substrate (e.g. plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD), plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), and the like). Additionally, plasma processing chambers may be used to remove material from a substrate in an etching process. Typically, metrology used to quantify a given process is limited to the end result of the process. That is, after a substrate is processed (e.g., with an etching or deposition process), metrology is used to determine how much material was added (e.g., in a deposition process) or removed (e.g., in an etching process).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Currently, the plasma itself can be monitored with systems such as optical emission spectroscopy (OES). OES can be used to determine some aspects of a plasma, such as plasma composition, for example. However, OES is limited in that it cannot account for properties of the plasma such as electron density, plasma (electron) temperature, or spatial differences in such properties. Langmuir probes may also be used to measure plasma properties. A Langmuir probe measures an IV curve and uses the IV  curve to determine properties of the plasma. However, Langmuir probes are limited in that they are typically macro scale, and large numbers of them cannot easily be integrated across the surface of a substrate. </p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments disclosed herein include diagnostic substrates and methods of using the diagnostic substrates to extract plasma parameters.

In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present disclosure. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that embodiments of the present disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known aspects, such as integrated circuit fabrication, are not described in detail in order to not unnecessarily obscure embodiments of the present disclosure. Furthermore, it is to be understood that the various embodiments shown in the Figures are illustrative representations and are not necessarily drawn to scale.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As noted above, it is currently difficult to measure plasma parameters in a plasma chamber. Currently, plasmas may be investigated using OES tools, but OES tools fail to provide plasma densities and electron temperatures. Additionally, OES tools cannot provide on substrate measurements such as material deposition, material etching, and the like. Additionally, measurements are not able to be taken in real time.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Accordingly, embodiments disclosed herein include diagnostic substrates that enable the ability to measure plasma parameters, in real time, during a plasma process. For example, plasma parameters may include, but are not limited to, electron density, electron temperature, electron energy distribution function (EEDF), ion density, and ion energy distribution function (IEDF). The embodiments disclosed herein may also be used to measure surface parameters, such as temperatures, deposition or etching rates, surface stress, surface charge, and other parameters on the diagnostic substrate. </p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an embodiment, the diagnostic substrate may include a plurality of sensors. The sensors described herein may generally be referred to as resonator sensors. For example, the sensors may include MEMS sensors or RF resonators. Capacitively and piezoelectrically driven resonators may also be used. The sensors may include, but are not limited to, surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors, bulk acoustic wave (BAW) sensors, film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) sensors, transversely-excited-bulk acoustic resonator (XBAR), membrane resonators, disk resonator, beam resonators, coil resonators, and the like. That is to say, while several particular examples of resonator sensors are described in greater detail herein, embodiments should not be construed as being limited by the particular examples described herein.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is to be appreciated that embodiments disclosed herein also allow for real time characterization of the various plasma and/or surface properties being investigated. Particularly, embodiments disclosed herein include resonators that are coupled (either directly or indirectly) to antennas. An interrogator external to the diagnostic substrate (and external to the processing tool) may receive signals from the antennas.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a particular embodiment, the array of sensors include sensors with different geometries. In one instance, the array of sensors may include sensors with top surfaces that have different heights from the underlying substrate. In such an embodiment, spatial information about the plasma may be provided since individual sensors will be exposed to different portions of the plasma and/or sheath. In another embodiment, the guard rings around the individual sensors may have different geometries. The different geometries of the guard rings may control the aperture around the resonator, allowing for different interactions with the plasma. In yet another  embodiment, the guard rings may have a uniform geometry, but be applied different biases in order to control the aperture. Additionally, a single guard ring may be supplied a plurality of different biases to have a sensor that comprises different apertures.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a plan view illustration of a diagnostic substrate <b>100</b> is shown, in accordance with an embodiment.

The resonator <b>321</b> may be a resonating disk in some embodiments. While a disk resonator <b>321</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, it is to be appreciated that the  resonator <b>321</b> may be any resonating structure or structures. For example, the resonator <b>321</b> may comprise a capacitively driven resonator, a piezoelectrically driven resonator, an electromagnetic resonator, or an acoustic resonator. In a particular embodiment, the resonator <b>321</b> may alternatively be a SAW, a BAW, an FBAR, XBAR a membrane, disc, a beam, a coil, or the like.

The guard ring <b>322</b> may be connected to circuitry that is configured to hold the guard ring <b>322</b> at a bias potential. As will be described in greater detail below, the bias potential can control an aperture over the resonator <b>321</b> to limit or increase the interaction with the plasma. In an embodiment, an interior surface of the guard ring <b>322</b> is spaced away from an edge of the resonator <b>321</b>. That is, while resonating, the resonator <b>321</b> may not contact the guard ring <b>322</b>. In an embodiment, the electrodes <b>391</b> drive the resonance of the resonator <b>321</b>. In other embodiments, the electrodes <b>391</b> may be omitted. In such embodiments, the resonators <b>321</b> may be driven by the guard rings <b>322</b>. For example, a bias may be applied to the guard rings <b>322</b> with a DC signal, and an AC signal may be stacked onto the DC signal to drive the resonance in the resonators <b>321</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an embodiment, a top surface of the guard ring <b>322</b> may be substantially coplanar with a top surface of the resonator <b>321</b> in the sensor <b>320</b><sub>A</sub>.

In the case of plasma properties, electrons and/or ions from the plasma are attracted to the surface of the resonator <b>321</b>. The increased charge on the resonator results in a change in the resonance frequency. By determining how many electrons and/or ions are attracted to the surface of the resonator <b>321</b>, the plasma density or electron temperature may be determined. Similarly, changes in resonance frequency may also be the result of changes to mass, stress, temperature, etc. of the resonator <b>321</b>. In order to isolate the effect of a single variable being changed, multiple different resonators with different geometries, different biases, or other variations may be used. Having multiple different geometries allows for a system of equations setup to be used to isolate a given variable that is desired to be measured.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an embodiment, the sensors <b>320</b><sub>A </sub>and <b>320</b><sub>B </sub>may each be coupled to an antenna <b>325</b>.
