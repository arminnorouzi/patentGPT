In the embodiment, described is a value element determination device <b>10</b> that is capable of determining value elements of an ICT service and presenting the value elements. The use of the value element determination device <b>10</b> according to the embodiment makes it possible to determine value elements of various ICT services universally without having interviews and the like of users, for example. Therefore, it is also possible to reduce the work and effort required for having interviews for determining the value elements of the ICT service, for example. Furthermore, since various ICT services can be evaluated with common value elements, for example, it is also possible to achieve improvement and the like of the services based on the evaluation result (for example, a value element missing in a certain ICT service can be implemented by combining a plurality of ICT services).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Entire Configuration</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">First, the entire configuration of the value element determination device <b>10</b> according to the embodiment will be described by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

Those functions, target, standpoint, and threshold value are input on a prescribed input screen by a selection operation, an input operation, or the like of the user of the value element determination device <b>10</b>. Note here that the functions of the ICT service are the functions provided to the user as the ICT service, and examples thereof may be &#x201c;measurement/visualization&#x201d;, &#x201c;analysis&#x201d;, &#x201c;control&#x201d;, &#x201c;accumulation&#x201d;, and the like.

The standpoints of the users are the classifications and the like of the users who use the ICT service, and examples thereof may be &#x201c;consumer&#x201d;, &#x201c;business person&#x201d;, and the like.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For example, in a case where the ICT service is a &#x201c;service for accumulating content&#x201d;, the function is &#x201c;accumulation&#x201d; and the target is &#x201c;content&#x201d;. Similarly, in a case where the ICT service is a &#x201c;service for measuring and visualizing sensor data&#x201d;, for example, the function is &#x201c;measurement/visualization&#x201d; and the target is &#x201c;sensor data&#x201d;. As described, in a sentence simply explaining the ICT service, the function corresponds to a verb while the target corresponds to an object.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The relevance calculation unit <b>102</b> uses a relevance matrix stored in the matrix storage unit <b>105</b> to calculate the relevance between the function input via the input unit <b>101</b> and the state-change of the user. Furthermore, the relevance calculation unit <b>102</b> uses the state-change whose calculated relevance exceeds a threshold value to acquire a set including the state-change from the sets (sets of state-change and advantage/disadvantage) stored in the state-change and advantage/disadvantage DB <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Furthermore, when a plurality of sets are acquired from the state-change and advantage/disadvantage DB <b>106</b>, the relevance calculation unit <b>102</b> calculates the similarity in terms of the meanings of the state-change included in those sets and the target corresponding to the function input via the input unit <b>101</b>, and extracts the set whose calculated similarity exceeds the threshold value.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Note here that the state-change is the change in the state of the user occurred by using the function of the ICT service, and examples thereof may be &#x201c;coming to know tendency&#x201d;, &#x201c;becoming aware of abnormality&#x201d;, and the like. Furthermore, the advantage/disadvantage is the advantage or the disadvantage caused for the user due to the state-change, and examples thereof may be &#x201c;being able to make appropriate plan&#x201d;, &#x201c;being able to deal with abnormality&#x201d;, and the like.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, in a case where the ICT service is the &#x201c;service for measuring and visualizing sensor data&#x201d;, the state-change of the user regarding the ICT service may be &#x201c;coming to know tendency&#x201d;, and the advantage/disadvantage may be &#x201c;being able to make plan appropriately&#x201d;. Similarly, in a case where the ICT service is a &#x201c;service for issuing alert&#x201d;, for example, the state-change of the user regarding the ICT service may be &#x201c;becoming aware of abnormality&#x201d;, and the advantage/disadvantage may be &#x201c;being able to deal with abnormality&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The value element determination unit <b>103</b> uses the advantage/disadvantage included in the set acquired or extracted by the relevance calculation unit <b>102</b>, the standpoint input via the input unit <b>101</b>, and the value element stored in the value element storage unit <b>107</b> to calculate the similarity in terms of the meanings of the advantage/disadvantage, the standpoint, and the value element. Furthermore, the value element determination unit <b>103</b> acquires the value element whose calculated similarity exceeds the threshold value from the value element storage unit <b>107</b>. Note here that a value element is an element configuring the value implemented by the use of the ICT service, and examples thereof may be &#x201c;saving time&#x201d;, &#x201c;relieving anxiety&#x201d;, &#x201c;providing connections&#x201d;, and the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The output unit <b>104</b> outputs the value element acquired by the value element determination unit <b>103</b>. Output destinations of the output unit <b>104</b> may be determined arbitrarily. For example, the value element may be output to a display to be displayed or may be output to a speaker to be output by voice.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the matrix storage unit <b>105</b>, a relevance matrix having the relevance between the function and the state-change as the element is stored. An example of the relevance matrix stored in the matrix storage unit <b>105</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a chart illustrating an example of the relevance matrix.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in the relevance matrix, rows are the functions while columns are the state-changes, for example. Furthermore, the relevance matrix takes the relevance between the function corresponding to the row and the state-change corresponding to the column as the element of the corresponding row and column. Note that the element is a value of 0 to 1, both inclusive.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the element at (1, 1) of the relevance matrix indicates that the relevance between function 1 and state-change 1 is 0.8. Similarly, the element at (1, 2) of the relevance matrix indicates that the relevance is 1.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As described, the relevance matrix is a matrix having the relevance between each function and each state-change as an element. As the relevance thereof, cooccurrence probability, cosine similarity, or the like may be used, or values set manually by an evaluator or the like who evaluates the ICT service may be used as well. Note that each element (that is, relevance) of the relevance matrix is determined only by the function and the state-change and not affected by other information (for example, the target of the ICT service, the standpoint of the user, and the like). This is because the relevance calculation unit <b>102</b> first narrows down the advantage/disadvantage from the relation between the function and the state-change as described above.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the state-change and advantage/disadvantage DB <b>106</b>, sets of the state-change of the user and the advantage/disadvantage are stored.
