For example, the flicker value storage <b>260</b> may include a lookup table.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The flicker value may be set based on a just-noticeable difference of a user for the luminance.

When the just-noticeable difference is changed from the first just-noticeable difference value JND<b>1</b> to the second just-noticeable difference value JND<b>2</b>, the user gets more insensitive to the luminance difference. When the just-noticeable difference is changed from the first just-noticeable difference value JND<b>1</b> to the second just-noticeable difference value JND<b>2</b>, the area where the user does not perceive the flicker may increase, and a low driving grayscale range driven at the low driving frequency may be increased.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As explained above, the flicker value may vary according to the just-noticeable difference.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The voltage drop determiner <b>280</b> may adjust the flicker value based on a voltage drop of the display panel <b>100</b>. For example, the voltage drop may include a drop of a driving voltage of the pixel. For example, the voltage drop may include a drop of the data voltage. When the flicker value is determined only based on the grayscale value of the input image data IMG without considering the voltage drop of the display panel, the flicker may be perceived by a user at a portion of the display panel far from the data driver <b>500</b> due to the voltage drop of the display panel.
