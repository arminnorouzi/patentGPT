Such card products generally include printed information, such as a photo, account numbers, identification numbers, and other personal information. Credentials can also include data that is encoded in a smartcard chip, a magnetic stripe, or a barcode, for example.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Card production systems include processing devices that process card substrates (hereinafter &#x201c;cards&#x201d;) to form the final card product. Such processes may include a printing process, a laminating or transfer process, a data reading process, a data writing process, and/or other process used to form the desired credential. An ink jet card printer is a form of card production system that utilizes an ink jet print head to print images to cards.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Ink overspray can occur when the ink jet print head prints near a edge of the print media or substrate. If unprotected, the ink overspray can land and accumulate on components of the ink jet card printer and can negatively affect printer performance as well as print quality of not removed from the components. Conventional printers have employed ink overspray collectors because cleaning ink from intricate components can be a time consuming and cumbersome task. Some ink overspray collectors are disposable and add additional waste to ink jet card printer processes. Non-disposable ink overspray collectors can be time consuming to remove, time consuming to clean, and time consuming to replace. Additionally, non-disposable ink overspray collectors can easily be damaged which can further complicate removal and replacement.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Techniques for handling and reducing ink overspray of an ink jet printer are provided.

In certain examples, the ink jet card printer can include an ink overspray collector that can be easily removed, cleaned and re-installed. In some examples, a controller of the ink jet card printer can execute commands that cause the ink jet card printer to reduce the amount of ink deposited at the edges of the card from the amount that would normally be deposited for a given image so that overspray of the ink is reduced. In some examples, a combination of techniques can be used to reduce overspray and reduce waste generated by operation of ink jet card printer.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> are simplified side and top views of an ink jet card printer <b>100</b>, or portions thereof, in accordance with the present subject matter. In some examples, the ink jet card printer <b>100</b> includes a print unit <b>102</b>, and a card transport <b>104</b>. The card transport <b>104</b> is configured to feed individual cards <b>106</b> along a processing axis <b>108</b>. The print unit <b>102</b> includes an ink jet print head <b>110</b> and a gantry <b>112</b>. The print head <b>110</b> is configured to perform a printing operation on individual cards <b>106</b> supported by the card transport <b>104</b> in a print position <b>114</b> along the processing axis <b>108</b>. The gantry <b>112</b> is configured to move the print head <b>110</b> through a print zone <b>116</b> during printing operations.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some examples, the ink jet card printer <b>100</b> includes a controller <b>118</b>, which represents one or more distinct controllers of the ink jet card printer <b>100</b>, each of which includes at least one processor that is configured to execute program instructions stored in a computer-readable media or memory of the ink jet card printer <b>100</b>, which may also be represented by the controller <b>118</b>, or another location. Any suitable patent subject matter eligible computer readable media or memory may be utilized including, for example, hard disks, CD-ROMS, optical storage devices, flash memory, magnetic storage devices, or other suitable computer readable media or memory that do not include transitory waves or signals. The execution of the instructions by the controller <b>118</b> controls components of the ink jet card printer <b>100</b> to perform functions and method steps described herein.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In certain examples, the ink jet card printer <b>100</b> may include one or more card feeders <b>120</b>, such as card feeders <b>120</b>A and <b>120</b>B, that are each configured to deliver cards <b>106</b> to, and receive cards <b>106</b> from, the card transport <b>104</b>. The ink jet card printer <b>100</b> may also include one or more card flippers <b>122</b>, such as flippers <b>122</b>A and <b>122</b>B, that are configured to invert the cards <b>106</b>. A card supply <b>124</b>, such as a card cartridge containing a stack of cards, may be provided to supply cards <b>106</b> for processing by the ink jet card printer <b>100</b>, and processed cards may be discharged and collected by a suitable card collector (e.g., a hopper) <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The ink jet print head <b>110</b> is configured to perform a direct printing operation to individual cards <b>106</b> supported in the print positions <b>114</b> along the processing axis <b>108</b>. The gantry <b>112</b> can move the print head <b>110</b> along a first scan axis <b>130</b> that is substantially parallel to the processing axis <b>108</b>, and a second scan axis <b>132</b> that is substantially perpendicular to the processing axis <b>108</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, during printing operations. As used herein, the term &#x201c;first scan axis&#x201d; refers to the axis along which the print head <b>110</b> is moved by the gantry <b>112</b> during an active printing phase of the operation, during which ink is discharged from the print head <b>110</b> to form the image on the card <b>106</b>. The term &#x201c;second scan axis&#x201d; refers to the axis along which the print head <b>110</b> can be moved by the gantry <b>112</b> during an inactive printing phase (ink is not discharged from the print head) to position the print head <b>110</b> for the next active printing phase.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In certain examples, the gantry <b>112</b> and the print head <b>110</b> may occupy the print zone <b>116</b> during printing operations, which is indicated by dashed boxes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. The print zone <b>116</b> may generally extend from the processing axis <b>108</b>, or immediately above the processing axis <b>108</b>, into at least a portion of the space above the card transport <b>104</b> and the card feeders <b>120</b>. The print zone <b>116</b> may also surround the card transport <b>104</b> and the card feeders <b>120</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In certain examples, the card feeders <b>120</b> each include a lift mechanism <b>134</b> to move the card feeders <b>120</b> to a lowered position, in which the card feeders <b>120</b> are displaced from the print zone <b>116</b>, such as below the print zone <b>116</b>, as indicated by card feeder <b>120</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and the card feeders <b>120</b>A and <b>120</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an isometric view of a card transport <b>104</b> and card feeders <b>120</b> in their lowered positions <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The lift mechanisms <b>134</b> may also move the card feeders <b>120</b> to a raised position, in which at least a portion of the card feeders <b>120</b> extend into the print zone <b>116</b>, and the card feeders <b>120</b> are positioned to feed cards <b>106</b> to, or receive cards <b>106</b> from, the card transport <b>104</b>, as indicated by the card feeder <b>120</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Thus, the card feeders <b>120</b> may be moved to their raised positions by the lift mechanisms <b>134</b> to facilitate feeding cards <b>106</b> to or receiving cards <b>106</b> from the card transport <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thus, the lift mechanisms <b>134</b> may be used to move the card feeders <b>120</b> from their raised positions, in which at least a portion of the card feeders <b>120</b> would obstruct a printing operation, to their lowered positions, in which the card feeders <b>120</b> do not obstruct the print zone <b>116</b>, to enable the print head <b>110</b> to be moved through the print zone <b>116</b> by the gantry <b>112</b> and perform a printing operation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In certain examples, the card transport <b>104</b> includes belts <b>140</b>, such as first and second belts <b>140</b>A and <b>140</b>B (i.e., belt feeders or conveyors), that are each supported by rollers <b>142</b> for movement along a belt path. In one example, the first and second belts <b>140</b>A and <b>140</b>B are each supported by four rollers <b>142</b>, which are supported by a belt frame <b>144</b>, such as side walls <b>146</b>A and <b>146</b>B of the belt frame <b>144</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The belts <b>140</b> include exposed portions <b>150</b> adjacent the processing axis <b>108</b>. The exposed portion <b>150</b> of each of the belts <b>140</b> is used to feed the cards <b>106</b> along the processing axis <b>108</b> and support the cards <b>106</b> in the print positions <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Motors <b>154</b>A and <b>154</b>B can independently drive the first and second belts <b>140</b>A and <b>140</b>B along their belt paths. Thus, the exposed portion <b>150</b> of the first belt <b>140</b>A may independently feed a card <b>106</b> along the processing axis <b>108</b> in a direction toward the second belt <b>140</b>B or in a direction toward the card feeder <b>120</b>A using the motor <b>154</b>A, and the exposed portion <b>150</b> of the second belt <b>140</b>B may independently feed a card <b>106</b> along the processing axis <b>108</b> in the direction toward the first belt <b>140</b>A, or in the direction toward the card feeder <b>120</b>B using the motor <b>154</b>B.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The belts <b>140</b> of the card transport <b>104</b> may take on any suitable form. In certain examples, the belts <b>140</b> are conventional vacuum belts that are coupled to a vacuum source <b>158</b> (i.e., a source of negative pressure), such as a regenerative vacuum blower. The vacuum source <b>158</b> may be shared by the belts <b>140</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, or separate vacuum sources <b>158</b>A and <b>158</b>B may respectively be used by the belts <b>140</b>A and <b>140</b>B. Chambers <b>160</b> couple the negative pressure generated by the vacuum source <b>158</b> to the exposed portions <b>150</b> of the belts <b>140</b>. The negative pressure is communicated to a top side of the exposed portions <b>150</b> through apertures <b>162</b> in the belts, which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, and is used to secure cards <b>106</b> to the exposed portions <b>150</b> during card feeding and printing operations. Thus, when a card <b>106</b> engages the top surface of the exposed portion <b>150</b> of one of the belts <b>140</b>, the negative pressure generated by the vacuum source <b>158</b> or sources <b>158</b>A and <b>158</b>B adheres the card <b>106</b> to the belt <b>140</b>. When the belts <b>140</b> are driven by the corresponding motor <b>154</b>, the adhered card <b>106</b> is driven along the processing axis <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, with the card feeders <b>120</b> in their lowered positions, and the cards <b>106</b> held in the print positions <b>114</b> against the exposed portions <b>150</b> of the belts <b>140</b>A and <b>140</b>B due to the negative pressure generated by the vacuum source <b>158</b> or sources <b>158</b>A and <b>158</b>B, the gantry <b>112</b> may move the print head <b>110</b> along the first scan axis <b>130</b> (processing axis <b>108</b>) over the cards <b>106</b>, while the print head <b>110</b> prints image lines to the surfaces <b>166</b>, as indicted by arrow <b>170</b>. After the print head <b>110</b> is moved past the end of the card <b>106</b> adjacent the card feeder <b>120</b>B, the gantry <b>112</b> shifts the print head <b>110</b> along the second scan axis <b>132</b>, as indicated by arrow <b>172</b>. The gantry <b>112</b> then moves the print head <b>110</b> back along the first scan axis <b>130</b> (arrow <b>174</b>), during which the print head <b>110</b> prints image lines to the surfaces <b>166</b> of the cards <b>106</b>. The gantry <b>112</b> again shifts the position of the print head <b>110</b> along the second scan axis <b>132</b> (arrow <b>176</b>), and the print head <b>110</b> prints image lines as the gantry <b>112</b> moves the print head <b>110</b> along the first scan axis <b>130</b> (arrow <b>178</b>). These steps of printing image lines while moving the print head <b>110</b> along the first scan axis <b>130</b> and shifting the position of the print head <b>110</b> along the second scan axis <b>132</b>, are repeated until the images have been printed to the surfaces <b>166</b> of the cards <b>106</b>. Accordingly, a single print operation may simultaneously print images to two cards <b>106</b> supported on the belts <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">To print a full edge-to-edge image on a card <b>106</b>, the print head <b>110</b> may be configured to print an image that is slightly larger than the surface <b>166</b> of the card <b>106</b>. As a result, some ink will overspray the edges of the card <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In certain examples, the exposed surface <b>150</b> of each belt <b>140</b> has a smaller surface area than the card <b>106</b>. That is, the width and length of the exposed belt surfaces <b>150</b> are selected such that they are less than the corresponding width and length of the cards <b>106</b>, as generally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> with the cards <b>106</b> shown in phantom lines.

As a result, the orientation of the card feed axis <b>208</b> relative to the processing axis <b>108</b> in a vertical plane changes with movement of the card feeders <b>120</b> between their raised and lowered positions <b>138</b> and <b>136</b>. When the card feeder <b>120</b> is in its lowered position, the card feed axis <b>208</b> is at an oblique angle (e.g., 20-50 degrees) to the processing axis <b>108</b> in the vertical plane. When the card feeder <b>120</b> is in its raised position, the card feed axis <b>208</b> is substantially parallel to the processing axis <b>108</b> in the vertical plane, allowing the card feeder <b>120</b> to deliver a card <b>106</b> to the adjacent belt <b>140</b>, or receive a card <b>106</b> from the adjacent belt <b>140</b> using one or more of the pinch roller pairs <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In certain examples, the pivot axis <b>210</b> is defined by a pivotable connection <b>212</b> between the card feeder frame <b>200</b> and the belt frame <b>144</b>, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

The card feeder <b>120</b>A is moved to its raised position using the corresponding lift mechanism <b>134</b>, and the card <b>106</b> is discharged from the card feeder <b>120</b>A to the belt <b>140</b>A using the pinch roller pair <b>190</b>A. The card feeder <b>120</b>A is then moved to the lowered position and out of the print zone <b>116</b> using the lift mechanism <b>134</b>, and the card <b>106</b> is fed along the processing axis <b>108</b> by the belt <b>140</b>A to the print position <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). An image is then printed to the surface <b>166</b> of the card <b>106</b> using the print head <b>110</b>, which involves moving the print head <b>110</b> with the gantry <b>112</b> through the print zone <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In certain examples, the ink jet card printer <b>100</b> can include a cure light <b>111</b> to assist in hardening recently ejected ink. Such a cure light <b>111</b> can project ultraviolet (UV) light for curing UV-curable inks. In some examples, the cure light <b>111</b> can be attached to the ink jet print head <b>110</b> and can move with the ink jet print head <b>110</b>. In some examples, the cure light <b>111</b> is attached to an axis separate from the ink jet print head axis and can move independent of the ink jet print head <b>110</b>. In operation, after an image is printed, conventional systems pass an illuminated cure light across the entire width or length of the printed media to cure, or harden, the printed ink. For an ink jet printer according to the present subject matter, after printing of an image onto print media using curable ink, the cure light <b>111</b> can be passed over the image at a cure speed and can be moved over unprinted portions of the print media, or retracted over cured portions if the image, at a speed higher than the cure speed.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In certain examples, the printer <b>100</b> includes an ink overspray collector <b>182</b> that surrounds a perimeter of the exposed belt surface <b>150</b> and extends beyond the edges of the cards <b>106</b> when in their print positions <b>114</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Thus, the collector <b>182</b> is positioned to receive ink that is sprayed over the lengthwise and widthwise edges of the cards <b>106</b> during a printing operation. In certain examples, the surface of the ink overspray collector <b>182</b> configured to receive the overspray ink is positioned below or offset some distance, x, from the bottom surface of the card <b>106</b> to be printed to allow for ink buildup. The offset can allow a finished card to pass over ink buildup on the ink overspray collector <b>182</b> without the overspray ink transferring to the underside of the finished card or to the underside of a new card entering the print area. In certain examples, the ink overspray collector <b>182</b> is a disposable component that may be periodically removed and replaced by an operator of the printer <b>100</b>. The collector <b>182</b> may be formed of plastic, paper, cardboard, or another suitable material. In certain examples, the collector <b>182</b> is a single piece of material having an opening <b>184</b>A for the exposed belt surface <b>150</b> of the belt <b>140</b>A, and an opening <b>184</b>B for the exposed belt surface <b>150</b> of the belt <b>140</b>B.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In certain examples, the ink overspray collector <b>182</b> is a reusable component that can be easily cleaned and reused to reduce waste production of the ink jet printer. In certain examples, the ink overspray collector <b>182</b> can include a coated material that allows the overspray ink to be removed relatively quickly and/or easily (e.g., in seconds). In some examples, the reusable component is stiff enough to maintain its shape when installed and laden with overspray ink, but also flexible enough to allow easy removal from the machine, easy removal of ink from the surface of the component, and easy installation back onto the machine. In some examples, the material of the ink overspray collector <b>182</b> is a woven material with a coating that has low adhesion with the ink such that the overspray ink can adhere to the ink overspray collector during operation, but the ink can easily be separated from the surface of the ink overspray collector during a short break in the operation of the ink jet printer. In some examples, the woven material can include fiberglass. In some examples, the coating can include polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates generally an example ink overspray collector.

In certain examples, generally, as the position of the ink jet print head approaches the edge of the print area, the controller can provide overspray modulation. Overspray modulation of the ink can include reducing the amount of ink dispensed near the edge of the print media or print area of the printer compared to an amount of ink that would otherwise be dispensed without overspray modulation. Using less ink than would otherwise be dispensed without overspray modulation can reduce the amount of ink overspray.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some examples, overspray modulation of the dispensing of the ink from the printhead can include reducing the number of ink droplets compared to the number requested to provide the full image being printed.

In some examples, modulation of the dispensing of the ink from the printhead can include reducing the number of ink droplets of certain colors such that the edge of the image fades into the background color provided by the surface of the print media. In some examples, overspray modulation can include one or more of the above techniques in combination with each other. In certain examples, the overspray techniques are applied to nozzles of the print head that dispense ink within a certain distance of the edge of the print media while printing a given image. In various examples, the certain distance is less than 20 millimeters (mm), less than 10 mm, less than 5 mm, or less than 2 mm from the edge of the print media or from the edge of the print area.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates generally an example method of reducing ink overspray.
