During the past decades, two combinations of chemotherapy&#x2014;FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, folinic acid, irinotecan and fluorouracil) and albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) with gemcitabine have gained acceptance as front-line treatments (e.g., standard of care)<sup>1, 3-5</sup>. However, response rates are not high, duration of response is short and progression after first line is inevitable.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer care in many types of cancer in recent years. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1 have the potential to reverse the anti-inflammatory tumor microenvironment and aid the immune system elicit an anti-tumoral response. FDA approved immune-checkpoint inhibitors, as ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab have shown to prolong survival in many cancer patients. However, immunotherapy has failed to improve the outcome of patients in some cancer types, notably PDAC<sup>6</sup>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are a non-invasive, regional antimitotic treatment modality with minimal toxicity which have been approved for the treatment of recurrent and newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have obtained a CE mark for marketing in Europe for the same indications. TTFields act by delivering low intensity (e.g., 1-3 V/cm), intermediate frequency (e.g., 100-300 kHz), alternating electric fields to the tumor using non-invasive transducer arrays placed on the skin around the region of the body containing the tumor. TTFields act predominantly during two phases of mitosis: 1) during metaphase, by disrupting the formation of the mitotic spindle, and 2) during cytokinesis, by dielectrophoretic dislocation of intracellular constituents resulting in apoptosis. Accumulating evidence demonstrate additional anti-neoplastic mechanisms for TTFields, such as interference with DNA repair mechanism, autophagy and migratory properties, as well as increasing the permeability of cells. Importantly, TTFields were shown to enhance antitumor immunity by stimulating macrophages to secrete reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines, promoting dendritic cell recruitment and maturation, resulting in accumulation of CD4+ and CD8+ at the tumor site.<sup>7-14</sup>.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Aspects described herein provide a method of treating cancer in a subject diagnosed with or suspected of having cancer by applying alternating electric fields to the abdomen of the subject at a frequency of 50 kHz to 10 MHz, administering a checkpoint inhibitor to the subject, and administering systemic cancer therapy to the subject.
