The display panel <b>110</b> may include a plurality of pixels P arranged therein, and an image may be displayed on the display panel <b>110</b> according to the brightness of each pixel P.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The display panel <b>110</b> may be a liquid crystal display (LCD) panel, an organic light emitting diode (OLED) panel or a micro LED panel.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The display device <b>100</b> may further include a touch panel which may be separated from the display panel <b>110</b> or integrated with the display panel <b>110</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the touch panel is integrated with the display panel <b>110</b>. Hereafter, for convenience of description, the case in which the touch panel is integrated with the display panel <b>110</b> will be taken as an example.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The touch panel may have touch electrodes TS arranged therein. When the touch panel is integrated with the display panel <b>110</b>, each of the touch electrodes TS may be configured in the form of an in-cell touch electrode which is used for both pixel driving and touch sensing. The in-cell touch electrode may serve as a common electrode in an LCD panel or a cathode electrode in an OLED panel, for example.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the LCD panel, the common electrode may supply a common voltage to each pixel. Furthermore, the common electrode may generate a sensing signal for a touch or approach of an external object to the display panel <b>110</b>, while functioning as the touch electrode TS.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the OLED panel, the cathode electrode may supply a ground voltage to an OLED. Furthermore, the cathode electrode may generate a sensing signal for a touch or approach of an external object on or to the display panel <b>110</b>, while functioning as the touch electrode TS.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">When the touch electrode TS is configured in the form of an in-cell touch electrode, the display device <b>100</b> may drive the display panel <b>110</b> in a time division manner. For example, the display device <b>100</b> may set a display time period and a touch time period as different time periods of one frame, and supply a voltage for pixel driving to the in-cell touch electrode in the display time period and supply a touch drive signal TP to the in-cell touch electrode in the touch time period.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, when the display panel <b>110</b> is a liquid crystal display panel, the display device <b>100</b> may supply a common voltage for pixel driving to the in-cell touch electrode in the display time period, and supply the touch drive signal TP for touch sensing to the in-cell touch electrode in the touch time period.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">For another example, when the display panel <b>110</b> is an OLED panel, the display device <b>100</b> may supply a ground voltage for pixel driving to the in-cell touch electrode in the display time period, and supply the touch drive signal TP for touch sensing to the in-cell touch electrode in the touch time period.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The display device <b>100</b> may update an image in frame units. One frame time may be set to 1/120, 1/60, 1/30 second or the like, and the display device <b>100</b> may update an image at each frame time.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In order to reduce power consumption, the display device <b>100</b> may adjust an image update period. For example, the display device <b>100</b> which has been updating an image in a period of 1/120 second may update an image in a period of 1/60 second, in order to reduce power consumption.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Substantially, the display device <b>100</b> may adjust the image update period by adjusting the frame time. One frame may include a display time period and a blank time period. The display device <b>100</b> may update an image in the display time period, and retain the image in the blank time period. Furthermore, the display device <b>100</b> may adjust the frame time by adjusting the length of the blank time period, thereby adjusting the image update period.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As such, the display device <b>100</b> may have various modes. For example, the display device <b>100</b> may have a display mode and a touch mode within one frame time, or have a display mode and a blank mode within one frame time. The display device <b>100</b> may additionally have more modes. For example, when the touch mode is a mode for finding a touch coordinate in detail, the display device <b>100</b> may further have a mode for determining only whether an external object has simply touched the display panel <b>110</b> or finding a touch location in wider area units each larger than one touch electrode. The mode may be a so-called low power touch mode.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The display device <b>100</b> may include a plurality of components which are operated in different states depending on modes. For example, while a common voltage is supplied to the common electrode in the display mode, a touch drive signal may be supplied to the common electrode in the touch mode. For another example, the display panel <b>110</b> may update an image in the display mode, but retain the image in the blank mode.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The display device <b>100</b> in accordance with an embodiment may supply optimized power to each of the components in each of the modes, thereby minimizing the power consumption.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The power management device <b>120</b> may be mainly involved in minimizing the power consumption.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The power management device <b>120</b> may include a plurality of power converting circuits. By using the power converting circuits, the power management device <b>120</b> may supply different types of power to the respective components of the display device <b>100</b>. The types of power may be classified according to voltage levels or power levels. For example, two different voltage levels of power may be defined as two different types of power. Furthermore, two different power levels of power may be defined as different types of power.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A first power converting circuit may supply power having a first voltage level to a first component, and a second power converting circuit may supply power having a second voltage level to a second component.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The power management device <b>120</b> may differently control the operation states of the respective power converting circuits for each mode of the display device <b>100</b>, thereby minimizing the power consumption of the display device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, when a voltage outputted by the first power converting circuit is used only in the display time period, the power management device <b>120</b> may turn on the first power converting circuit in the display mode, and turn off the first power converting circuit in the touch mode.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">For another example, the second power converting circuit may be involved in generating the touch drive signal TP. In this case, when the touch drive signal TP is generated at different voltage levels in the touch mode and the low power touch mode, the power management device <b>120</b> may control the output voltage of the second power converting circuit to a first voltage in the touch mode, and control the output voltage of the second power converting circuit to a second voltage in the low power touch mode.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The power management device <b>120</b> may turn off a power converting circuit which generates an unnecessary output voltage in each mode, or optimize the output voltage for each mode, thereby minimizing the power consumption.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The power management device <b>120</b> may receive a mode indication signal for mode recognition from the timing controller <b>130</b>. The power management device <b>120</b> may include at least one input terminal, and receive the mode indication signal from the timing controller <b>130</b> through the at least one input terminal. Since the modes may be changed two or more times even within one frame time, the mode indication signal may be transmitted/received in a simple form.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, the power management device <b>120</b> may include two input terminals, and recognize four types of mode indication signals by combining a first signal transferred to a first input terminal and a second signal transferred to a second input terminal. For example, when the high-level first signal is inputted to the first input terminal and the high-level second signal is inputted to the second input terminal, the power management device <b>120</b> may recognize the corresponding mode as the display mode. Furthermore, when the low-level first signal is inputted to the first input terminal and the low-level second signal is inputted to the second input terminal, the power management device <b>120</b> may recognize the corresponding mode as the touch mode.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">For another example, the power management device <b>120</b> may be connected to the timing controller <b>130</b> through digital communication such as inter-integrated circuit (I2C) communication, and receive a 1-byte mode indication signal through the digital communication.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In order to decide the operation states of the plurality of power converting circuits according to the simplified mode indication signal, the power management device <b>120</b> may store mode control values for the respective power converting circuits in advance. Furthermore, the power management device <b>120</b> may recognize the mode from the mode indication signal, and control or change the operation states of the respective power converting circuits according to the mode control values stored therein.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The power management device <b>120</b> may store the mode control values for the respective power converting circuits in a memory such as a register or electrically erasable and programmable read-only memory (EEPROM). In this state, when receiving the mode indication signal from the timing controller <b>130</b>, the power management device <b>120</b> may read the mode control values, recognized according to the mode indication signal, from the memory, and then control the respective power converting circuits.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The display device <b>100</b> may include display driving devices configured to perform at least some functions for driving the display panel and touch driving devices configured to perform at least some functions for driving the touch panel.
