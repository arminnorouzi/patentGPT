In particular, the present application relates to electrodes including silicon particles for use in battery electrodes.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery typically includes a separator and/or electrolyte between an anode and a cathode. In one class of batteries, the separator, cathode and anode materials are individually formed into sheets or films. Sheets of the cathode, separator and anode are subsequently stacked or rolled with the separator separating the cathode and anode (e.g., electrodes) to form the battery. Typical electrodes include electro-chemically active material layers on electrically conductive metals (e.g., aluminum and copper). Films can be rolled or cut into pieces which are then layered into stacks. The stacks are of alternating electro-chemically active materials with the separator between them.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When an anode is accepting lithium, the surface of the anode is in a reducing state. At this potential, carbonate electrolytes used in lithium ion batteries may react on the anode surface forming a solid electrolyte interface (SEI). The anode SEI composition may play an important role in maintaining the integrity of the anode surface and electrolyte when cycling lithium ion batteries. Silicon anodes expand and contract during cycling which can break the SEI layer and cause degradation of the electrolyte onto the newly exposed anode surface and can cause further impedance growth. There is a need to improve the SEI layer formed on a silicon anode to enable longer term cycle life.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In certain implementations, a method of forming an electrochemical cell is provided. The method can include providing a first electrode, a second electrode, a separator between the first and second electrodes, and an electrolyte in a cell container. The first electrode can comprise silicon-dominant electrochemically active material. The silicon-dominant electrochemically active material can comprise greater than 50% silicon by weight. The method can also include exposing at least a part of the electrochemical cell to CO<sub>2 </sub>and forming a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the first electrode using the CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some instances, the SEI layer can comprise solid carbonate on LiF particles. In some methods, forming the SEI layer can occur during lithiation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some instances, the silicon-dominant electrochemically active material can comprise the silicon at about 60% to about 100% by weight.

In some such examples, the CO<sub>2 </sub>can be produced from Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>on a surface of the NCA.

As another example, the CO<sub>2 </sub>can be provided in an amount of about 0.1 to about 0.6 mg per mg of the silicon. In some implementations, the CO<sub>2 </sub>can be provided by adding dry ice to the electrolyte. In some implementations, the CO<sub>2 </sub>can be dissolved in the electrolyte. As an example, the CO<sub>2 </sub>can be dissolved in an amount of about 0.01 to about 0.6 mg per mg of the silicon. In some implementations, the CO<sub>2 </sub>can be produced from a carbonate in the cell container.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some implementations, the electrolyte can comprise greater than about 10% to about 90% carbonate solvent.

For example, the solvent can comprise fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), difluoroethylene carbonate (F2EC), trifluoroethylene carbonate (F3EC), ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), trifluoropropylene carbonate (TFPC), or a mixture thereof. In some instances, the electrolyte can comprise a linear carbonate solvent. For example, the solvent can comprise ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), methyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl carbonate (TFEMC), ethyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl carbonate (TFDEC), difluoromethyl fluoromethyl carbonate (TFDMC), or a mixture thereof.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some implementations, the method can further comprise holding the first electrode, the second electrode, and the separator together while the at least a part of the electrochemical cell is exposed to CO<sub>2</sub>.

For example, silicon has a high theoretical capacity and can increase the energy density of lithium ion batteries compared with lithium ion batteries using other active materials such as graphite. However, silicon can swell in excess of 300% upon lithium insertion. Accordingly, batteries with silicon anodes may exhibit more rapid capacity loss upon cycling compared with batteries with graphite anodes. The repeat expansion and contraction of silicon particles during charge and discharge can lead to mechanical failure of the anode during cycling. Mechanical failure can expose new surfaces of silicon which can react with the electrolyte, irreversibly incorporating Li-ions in the solid electrolyte interface/interphase (SEI) and leading to capacity loss. Certain embodiments described herein can include silicon material with a modified surface, leading to improved cycling performance. For example, some embodiments can provide an SEI with increased stability (e.g., a substantially stable SEI and/or a stable SEI in some instances) to improve the capacity retention and reduce (e.g., and/or prevent in some instances) fast fading.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Some implementations described herein can create an SEI layer on a silicon-based electrode by introducing carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) during formation and cycling. Electrochemical cells with electrodes formed with such an SEI layer described herein may have advantages including increased cycle life, increased energy density, improved safety and cost, and/or decreased electrolyte consumption. Without being bound by theory (e.g., during lithiation in the presence of fluorine and CO<sub>2</sub>), LiF particles can be formed and carbonate species may act as a capping agent on the surface of an electrode. The carbonates in current electrolyte systems do not efficiently form a protective layer on the LiF to control the LiF particle size. CO<sub>2 </sub>can be more efficient at forming solid carbonates such that the LiF particles do not grow to a larger size. Smaller LiF particles in the SEI layer can allow for a more uniform distribution on the electrode surface, yielding a more lithium conductive SEI layer.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some implementations, the electrodes treated with CO<sub>2 </sub>can include silicon particles mixed with binder in a solvent and coated onto a current collector. For example, the Si particles may be used as the active material in powder form. The binder and current collector may be any of those known in the art or yet to be developed. For example, the current collector may be a copper or nickel foil. In some instances, conductive particles (e.g., carbon) may be added.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some implementations, the electrodes treated with CO<sub>2 </sub>can be film-based electrodes. For example, some composite material films can be monolithic, self-supporting structures using pyrolyzed polymer, e.g., as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/008,800 (U.S. Pat. No. 9,178,208), entitled &#x201c;Composite Materials for Electrochemical Storage;&#x201d; U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 13/799,405 (U.S. Pat. No. 9,553,303), entitled &#x201c;Silicon Particles for Battery Electrodes,&#x201d; each of which is incorporated by reference herein. In some embodiments, the self-supported composite material film can be used as an electrode (e.g., without a current collector). In some instances, electrodes with silicon particles in carbonized polymer matrix (e.g., compared to electrodes with silicon particles suspended in a polymeric binder), can allow for a different surface for formation of the SEI layer as the surface of silicon would be initially covered in carbon. For example, in some electrodes with silicon particles in a carbonized polymer matrix, the carbon may cover substantially all of the silicon surface while most polymeric binders typically do not cover all of the active material surface.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Some composite material films may be provided on a current collector to form an electrode. In some embodiments, the composite material film can be attached to a current collector using an attachment substance. The attachment substance and current collector may be any of those known in the art or yet to be developed. For example, some composite material films can be provided on a current collector as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/333,864 (U.S. Pat. No. 9,397,338), entitled &#x201c;Electrodes, Electrochemical Cells, and Methods of Forming Electrodes and Electrochemical Cells;&#x201d; or U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/796,922 (U.S. Pat.

Some composite material films may be formed on a current collector, e.g., as described in U.S. patent application Ser.

The CO<sub>2 </sub>can be provided to at least a portion of the electrochemical cell or can be produced by at least a portion of the electrochemical cell. In some instances, the CO<sub>2 </sub>can be provided in the cell container.

The CO<sub>2 </sub>source can be added to the cell stack or to the electrolyte. In some instances, the CO<sub>2 </sub>can be dissolved (e.g., directly dissolved) in the electrolyte. For example, about 0.01 mg to about 0.6 mg of CO<sub>2 </sub>per mg of silicon can be dissolved in the electrolyte. As one example, dry CO<sub>2 </sub>gas (e.g., 0.01 mg, 0.015 mg, or 0.02 mg CO<sub>2 </sub>per mg of silicon at room temperature and 1 atm) can be bubbled through the electrolyte solution.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Additionally or alternatively, the CO<sub>2 </sub>can be produced from a carbonate or other additive in the cell container. In some implementations, the CO<sub>2 </sub>can be produced by the second electrode. For instance, the second electrode can comprise NCA and the CO<sub>2 </sub>can be produced by Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>(e.g., impurity) on the surface of the NCA. For example, CO<sub>2 </sub>can be produced by the reaction 2HF+Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>=2LiF+H<sub>2</sub>O+CO<sub>2</sub>. In some implementations, the CO<sub>2 </sub>can be produced by the electrolyte.

In some examples, the carbonate solvent can comprise a linear carbonate solvent, such as ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), methyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl carbonate (TFEMC), ethyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl carbonate (TFDEC), difluoromethyl fluoromethyl carbonate (TFDMC), or a mixture thereof.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">With reference to block <b>130</b>, exposure to CO<sub>2 </sub>can form an SEI layer on the first electrode, such as during lithiation (e.g., during formation and/or cycling). In some implementations, the SEI layer can include solid carbonate on LiF particles. Lithium salts may produce carbonate (or oxalate) capping agents. As described herein, the solid carbonate can provide a cap on the LiF particles to limit its growth during formation, allowing smaller particles to form a more uniform distribution in the SEI layer on the electrode surface. In various implementations, the SEI layer on the electrode can be about 1 nm to about 20 nm thick (e.g., about 1 nm to about 15 nm, about 1 nm to about 10 nm, about 3 nm to about 20 nm, about 3 nm to about 15 nm, about 3 nm to about 10 nm, about 4 nm to about 20 nm, about 4 nm to about 15 nm, about 4 nm to about 10 nm, about 5 nm to about 20 nm, about 5 nm to about 15 nm, about 5 nm to about 10 nm, etc.).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some instances, the method <b>100</b> can further include holding the first electrode, the second electrode, and the separator together while at least a portion of the electrochemical cell is exposed to CO<sub>2</sub>. Without being bound by theory, the first electrode, the second electrode, and the separator can be kept together during formation and cycling as generated or added gas may degrade the cell otherwise. Holding the cell layers together can reduce and/or prevent CO<sub>2 </sub>gas from impeding interlayer contact, which can reduce and/or prevent degradation due to delamination. As an example, the first electrode, the second electrode, and the separator can be held together with a gel electrolyte, such as electrolyte with poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polyethylene glycol (PEG), etc. As another example, the first electrode, the second electrode, and the separator can be held together with an adhesive layer on one or more of the electrodes and/or separator and on one or more sides. For example, the adhesive can comprise poly(vinylidene fluoride)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PVDF/PMMA). In some implementations, the separator can include polyolefin, cellulose, or a combination thereof, and the separator can be coated with the adhesive. After the first electrode, the second electrode, and the separator are held together, they (or the entire battery) can be pressed. In some instances, they can be pressed with heat.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some implementations, the first electrode, the second electrode, and the separator can be held together mechanically. The first electrode, the second electrode, and the separator can be held together with pressure. In some instances, the first electrode, the second electrode, and the separator can be held together with a clamp, bolt, clip, or combination thereof. For example, the first electrode, the second electrode, and the separator can be clamped between plates. The plates can be held together with one or more bolts or clips. Other examples are possible. After formation, the clamp, bolt, clip, or combination thereof can be removed or can remain (or be replaced with a different mechanical device) for use during operation.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Various implementations of an electrochemical device can comprise a first electrode, a second electrode, and a separator between the first and second electrodes.
