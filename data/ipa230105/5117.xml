Here, examples of wheel fasteners include wheel nuts and wheel bolts. However, the following embodiments will be described using an example in which the wheel fasteners are wheel nuts (the same applies hereinafter).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A truck <b>100</b>, which is an example of a vehicle, is a 2-axle (4&#xd7;2, 4&#xd7;4) truck, for example. The truck <b>100</b> includes front wheels <b>120</b> detachably fastened to the left and right hubs of the front axle, and rear wheels <b>140</b> detachably fastened to the left and right hubs of the rear axle. Note that the truck <b>100</b> is not limited to a 2-axle truck and may be a different truck such as a 3-axle (6&#xd7;2, 6&#xd7;4, 6&#xd7;6) truck or a 4-axle (8&#xd7;4) truck. Furthermore, the vehicle is not limited to the truck <b>100</b> and may be a different vehicle such as a passenger car, a bus, or a construction machine.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, each of the front wheels <b>120</b> of the truck <b>100</b> is formed by assembling a tire <b>124</b> to a disc wheel <b>122</b>. The disc wheel <b>122</b> has a cylindrical rim (not shown) to which the inner peripheral edge of the tire <b>124</b> is assembled, and a discshaped wheel disc <b>122</b>A joined to the inner peripheral surface of the rim. The plate surface of the wheel disc <b>122</b>A has concentrically formed bolt holes (not shown). Hub bolts HB erected from the left or right hub of the front axle pass through these bolt holes. Wheel nuts <b>126</b> for detachably fastening the front wheel <b>120</b> to the corresponding hub are screwed, with a specified torque, onto the shanks of the hub bolts HB protruding from the bolt holes of the wheel disc <b>122</b>A. In addition, an air valve <b>128</b> for filling the tire <b>124</b> with air and for adjusting the air pressure of the tire <b>124</b> is attached to a predetermined position of the disc wheel <b>122</b>. In the illustrated example, each front wheel <b>120</b> is fastened to the corresponding hub with ten pairs of hub bolts HB and wheel nuts <b>126</b>, but any number of hub bolts HB and wheel nuts <b>126</b> may be used.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The rear wheels <b>140</b> of the truck <b>100</b> have essentially the same structure as the front wheels <b>120</b> except that each rear wheel <b>140</b> has a so-called &#x201c;double tire&#x201d;. Thus, the description therefor will be omitted. Note, however, that the number of hub bolts and wheel nuts for detachably fastening each rear wheel <b>140</b> to the corresponding hub may be different from that for the front wheel <b>120</b>. In the following description, when there is no need to distinguish the front wheels <b>120</b> from the rear wheels <b>140</b>, each of the front and rear wheels will be simply referred to as &#x201c;wheel WH&#x201d;, and the terms &#x201c;disc wheel DW&#x201d;, &#x201c;wheel disc WD&#x201d;, &#x201c;wheel nut WN&#x201d;, and &#x201c;air valve AV&#x201d; will be used to describe their constructions.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The device for detecting wheel fastener looseness is implemented in a smartphone <b>200</b>, which is an example of an information device on which any application program (computer program) may be installed and executed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the smartphone <b>200</b> includes a microcomputer <b>210</b>, a wireless communication function <b>220</b>, a wireless voice call function <b>230</b>, a capturing function <b>240</b>, a display function <b>250</b>, and a bus <b>260</b>. The microcomputer <b>210</b> includes a processor, a non-volatile memory, and a volatile memory. The wireless communication function <b>220</b> allows for wireless data transmission and receptions with external devices. The wireless voice call function <b>230</b> allows for wireless voice call with external devices. The capturing function <b>240</b> is implemented by a camera and/or the like. The display function <b>250</b> is implemented by a liquid crystal display and/or the like. The bus <b>260</b> electrically connects these functions together. The smartphone <b>200</b> is configured to implement various functions related to detection of wheel fastener looseness when a predetermined application program installed in non-volatile memory is executed on the smartphone <b>200</b>. Note that the device for detecting wheel fastener looseness is not limited to being implemented in the smartphone <b>200</b>, and may also be implemented in any other well-known information device that has a capturing function and on which any application program may be installed and executed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The smartphone <b>200</b> performs the steps of: using the capturing function <b>240</b> to capture an image of one of the disc wheels DW to which the wheel nuts WN are fastened; and inspecting whether any of the wheel nuts WN appearing in the captured image is loose by comparing the captured image with the reference image of the disc wheel DW in consideration of the reference point of the disc wheel DW appearing in the captured image. For example, the smartphone <b>200</b> performs these steps when operated by an operator <b>300</b> such as a driver of the truck <b>100</b> or an inspector in, for example, a start-up inspection.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example of reference image generation processing performed by the smartphone <b>200</b>, which is triggered when the operator <b>300</b> selects &#x201c;Reference Image Generation&#x201d; from a menu of operations. Here, when the application program is executed, the smartphone <b>200</b> uses the display function <b>250</b> to display an initial screen that includes the menu of operations such as &#x201c;Reference Image Generation&#x201d; and &#x201c;Nut Inspection&#x201d;, and waits for instructions from the operator <b>300</b> (the same applies hereinafter).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In step <b>1</b> (abbreviated as &#x201c;S<b>1</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>; the same applies to the other steps in the drawings below), the smartphone <b>200</b> uses the capturing function <b>240</b> to capture an image of one of the disc wheels DW of the wheels WH in the truck <b>100</b>. In this event, which disc wheel DW is to be currently captured may be determined, for example, based on the shooting order previously specified by the operator <b>300</b>, and the smartphone <b>200</b> may instruct which image to capture from among the disc wheels DW one by one in this specified order (the same applies hereinafter).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In step <b>2</b>, the smartphone <b>200</b> corrects the tilt of the captured image based on the contour of the wheel disc WD of the disc wheel DW appearing in the captured image. Ideally, the disc wheel DW should be captured from a position facing the disc wheel DW to ensure that the disc wheel DW does not appear tilted in the resultant reference image. However, the operator <b>300</b> who uses the smartphone <b>200</b> to capture disc wheels DW may capture each disc wheel DW from a direction not parallel but inclined to the rotation axis of the disc wheel DW. Thus, by leveraging the fact that when an image of the disc wheel DW is captured from a position inclined with respect to the rotation axis of the disc wheel DW, the contour of the wheel disc WD in the captured image is distorted in one direction so as to appear elliptical, the tilt of the captured image is corrected so that the contour of the wheel disc WD becomes closer to a perfect circle. This approach allows obtaining a desired image capturing the disc wheel DW without requiring the disc wheel DW to be captured from a strictly controlled direction.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In step <b>3</b>, the smartphone <b>200</b> corrects the magnification of the captured image based on the contour of the wheel disc WD of the disc wheel DW appearing in the captured image. Ideally, the disc wheels DW should be captured from positions away from the disc wheel DW by a predetermined distance to ensure that the disc wheels DW appear the same size in the resultant reference images. However, the operator <b>300</b> who uses the smartphone <b>200</b> to capture disc wheels DW may capture images of the disc wheels DW at various capturing distances rather than at a constant capturing distance. Thus, by leveraging the fact that the contour size of the wheel disc WD in a captured image changes as the capturing distance from the disc wheel DW changes, the magnification of the captured image is corrected so that the contour of the wheel disc WD becomes closer to a circle with a predetermined diameter. This approach allows obtaining a desired image capturing the disc wheel DW without requiring the disc wheel DW to be captured at a strictly controlled capturing distance.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In step <b>4</b>, the smartphone <b>200</b> corrects the rotation angle of the captured image based on the reference point of the disc wheel DW appearing in the captured image. Ideally, the wheel nuts WN should constantly appear in their predetermined positions (predetermined angular positions) in the reference images. However, the wheels WH rotate while the truck <b>100</b> is travelling, so that each wheel nut WN is not always in the same position. Thus, the captured image cannot be used as a reference image without rotation angle correction. Thus, the rotation angle of the captured image is corrected based on the reference point of the disc wheel DW so that, for example, the reference point appears at a highest position in the captured image. For example, the position at which the air valve AV is attached in the disc wheel DW may be used as the reference point. This allows obtaining an image in which the wheel nuts WN appear at their predetermined positions, and which is thus qualified as a reference image.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In step <b>5</b>, the smartphone <b>200</b> writes and stores the captured image after the above corrections as a reference image in the nonvolatile memory. In this event, it is preferable to store each reference image so that it can be identified which wheel WH is associated with the reference image.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In step <b>6</b>, the smartphone <b>200</b> determines whether it has captured images of all the disc wheels DW by determining whether it has captured an image of the disc wheel DW of the last wheel WH in the order specified by the operator <b>300</b>. When the smartphone <b>200</b> determines that it has captured images of all the disc wheels DW (Yes), the reference image generation processing ends. On the other hand, when the smartphone <b>200</b> determines that it has not yet captured images of all the disc wheels DW (No), the operation returns to step <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the reference image generation processing, when the operator <b>300</b> operates the smartphone <b>200</b> to capture an image of a disc wheel DW, the tilt and magnification of the captured image are corrected based on the contour of the wheel disc WD appearing in the captured image.
