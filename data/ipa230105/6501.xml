Complex and expensive machining may be required to adapt the separating element to the cooling jacket. In addition, such a separating element is not adapted to a cooling chamber which has a shape exhibiting symmetry of revolution whose axis is the axis of rotation, and the shape exhibiting symmetry of revolution of which has a first thickness, measured at a first axial end, and a second thickness, measured at a second axial end, the first thickness being smaller than the second thickness. Specifically, this type of cooling chamber may have a very small thickness, or even no thickness at one of its ends. It is difficult to adapt the thickness of the separating element to this very small thickness. This lack of adaptation may lead to excessive circulation of cooling fluid between the inlet zone of the cooling chamber and the outlet zone of the cooling chamber. Such excessive circulation around the separating element may reduce the cooling capacity of the cooling system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0009">The present invention seeks to eliminate all or some of these drawbacks.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0010">The invention relates to a cooling system for a rotary electric machine having an axis of rotation, comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0011">a cooling jacket that is able to receive a stator of the rotary electric machine,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0012">a housing receiving the cooling jacket,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0013">wherein an outer wall of the cooling jacket forms, together with an inner wall of the housing, a cooling chamber that is able to be passed through by a cooling fluid,</p><p id="p-0011" num="0014">and wherein the housing comprises an inlet opening for the inlet of the cooling fluid into an inlet zone of the cooling chamber, and an outlet opening for the outlet of the cooling fluid from an outlet zone of the cooling chamber, the inlet opening and the outlet opening being formed in the housing,</p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">and wherein a separating element, which is separate from the cooling jacket and from the housing, is fixed to one of the outer wall of the cooling jacket and the inner wall of the housing in order to separate the inlet zone of the cooling chamber and the outlet zone of the cooling chamber, the separating element comprising:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0016">a fixing part, with a first length, having a fixing face with a shape that is complementary to the shape of the one of the outer wall of the cooling jacket and the inner wall of the housing to which the separating element is fixed,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0017">a first separation part, with a second length, that is inclined with respect to the fixing part and not parallel to the fixing part,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0013" num="0018">the first length being smaller than the second length such that the first separation part comprises a first free end which is not directly connected to the fixing part.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0019">The use of a separating element which is separate from the cooling jacket and from the housing makes it possible to simplify the manufacture of the cooling jacket and of the housing and thus to reduce the manufacturing costs of the cooling system and of the machine in which it is used. Specifically, the one of the outer wall of the cooling jacket and the inner wall of the housing to which the separating element is fixed may have a cylindrical shape that is easy to produce.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0020">In addition, the use of a separating element whose fixing part is shorter than its separation part allows better separation between the inlet zone of the cooling chamber and the outlet zone of the cooling chamber. Specifically, since the first end is not limited by the manufacturing constraints of the fixing part, it is possible to produce a free end whose shape is close to the shape of the cooling chamber. The possibilities for the cooling fluid to pass around the separation element are reduced and the cooling of the rotary electric machine is thus improved.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0021">According to an additional feature of the invention, the first separation part forms an angle of between 20 degrees and 160 degrees, in particular between 45 degrees and 135 degrees, with the fixing part.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0022">According to an additional feature of the invention, the first separation part is formed in continuity of material with the fixing part beyond a first bending zone.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0023">Producing a separating element whose first separation part and fixing part are formed in continuity of material and are separated by a bent zone makes it possible to reduce the manufacturing costs of the separating element.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0024">According to an additional feature of the invention, the cooling chamber has a shape exhibiting symmetry of revolution whose axis is the axis of rotation, the shape exhibiting symmetry of revolution having a first thickness, measured at a first axial end, and a second thickness, measured at a second axial end, the first thickness being smaller than the second thickness, and the first free end is oriented toward the first axial end, another end of the first separation part that is opposite to the free end being oriented toward the second axial end.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0025">The use of a cooling chamber exhibiting symmetry of revolution whose thickness at a first end is smaller than its thickness at a second end makes it possible to use a housing and/or a cooling jacket whose manufacturing method, in particular casting and pressing, requires the presence of a taper on the components. Since the free end of the separating element may have a small radial thickness, it is possible to separate the inlet zone of the cooling chamber and the outlet zone of the cooling chamber even in the zones where the cooling chamber is thinnest.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0026">According to an additional feature of the invention, the separating element is made from a sheet material, in particular of sheet steel.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0027">The use of a sheet material makes it possible to simplify the manufacture of the separating element and thus to reduce the manufacturing costs of the electric machine.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0028">According to an additional feature of the invention, an edge surface of the sheet material of the first free end faces toward the one of the outer wall of the cooling jacket and the inner wall of the housing to which the separating element is fixed.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0029">Such a feature allows the shape of the first free end to be adapted to the shape of the chamber. It is thus possible to improve the separation between the inlet zone of the cooling chamber and the outlet zone of the cooling chamber.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0030">According to an additional feature of the invention, the separating element comprises a second separation part, with a third length, that is inclined with respect to the fixing part face and not parallel to the fixing part face, the first length being smaller than the third length such that the second separation part comprises a second free end which is not directly connected to the fixing part.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0031">The use of a separating element comprising a second separation part in addition to the first separation part makes it possible to further improve the separation between the inlet zone of the cooling chamber and the outlet zone of the cooling chamber and thus to improve the cooling performance of the cooling system. Since this improvement in performance does not require the use of additional components, it has a reduced cost.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0032">According to an additional feature of the invention, the second separation part is formed in continuity of material with the fixing part beyond a second bending zone.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0033">According to an additional feature of the invention, the separating element is welded to one of the outer wall of the cooling jacket and the inner wall of the housing.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0034">The invention also relates to an electric machine comprising:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0035">a stator,</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0036">a rotor,</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0037">a cooling system as described above.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0030" num="0038">According to an additional feature of the invention, the stator is mounted by force in the cooling jacket.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0039">Throughout the preceding text, the rotor may be a claw-pole rotor. This rotor then comprises a first and a second pole wheel that are nested, the first pole wheel defining a series of claws of trapezoidal overall shape, each claw extending axially in the direction of the second pole wheel, the second pole wheel defining a series of claws of trapezoidal overall shape, each claw extending axially in the direction of the first pole wheel. A permanent magnet may be received between two consecutive claws, circumferentially speaking, for the rotor. As a variant, the rotor may be different than a claw-pole rotor, comprising for example a stack of laminations.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0040">Throughout the preceding text, the rotor may comprise any number of pairs of poles, for example six or eight pairs of poles.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0041">Throughout the preceding text, the rotary electric machine may have a stator having a polyphase electric winding, for example formed by wires or by conducting bars connected to one another.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0042">The rotary electric machine may comprise a power electronic component that is able to be connected to the on-board network of the vehicle. This power electronic component comprises for example an inverter/rectifier that allows an on-board network of the vehicle to be charged, or that can be electrically powered by this network, depending on whether the electric machine is operating as a motor or as a generator.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0043">The rotary electric machine may further comprise a pulley or any other means of connection to the rest of the powertrain of the vehicle. The electric machine is, for example, connected, in particular via a belt, to the crankshaft of the internal combustion engine of the vehicle. As a variant, the electric machine is connected at other locations in the powertrain, for example at the input to the gearbox, from the point of view of the torque passing toward the wheels of the vehicle, on the output side of the gearbox, from the point of view of the torque passing toward the wheels of the vehicle, at the gearbox, from the point of view of the torque passing toward the wheels of the vehicle, or on the front axle assembly or the rear axle assembly of this powertrain.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0044">The rotary electric machine is not necessarily a synchronous machine, and may be an asynchronous machine.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0037" num="0045">The invention may be understood better upon reading the following description of nonlimiting implementation examples thereof and upon studying the appended drawing, in which:</p><p id="p-0038" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a partial view of a rotary electric machine comprising a cooling system according to the invention,</p><p id="p-0039" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a partial cross-sectional view of the cooling system of the rotary electric machine in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to a first embodiment,</p><p id="p-0040" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts another partial cross-sectional view of the cooling system of the rotary electric machine in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to the first embodiment,</p><p id="p-0041" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts another partial cross-sectional view of the cooling system of the rotary electric machine in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to the first embodiment,</p><p id="p-0042" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a partial view of the cooling system of the rotary electric machine in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to the first embodiment,</p><p id="p-0043" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts a view of a separating element of the cooling system of the rotary electric machine in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to the first embodiment,</p><p id="p-0044" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts a view of a separating element of the cooling system of the rotary electric machine in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to a second embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0045" num="0053">Throughout the figures, elements that are identical or perform the same function bear the same reference numbers.
