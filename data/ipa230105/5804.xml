The number of solder balls <b>9</b> may be optionally set. The solder balls <b>9</b> contain a conductor, for example, solder. The solder balls <b>9</b> are connected to the respective terminals <b>10</b>. The solder balls <b>9</b> have a structure such as, for example, a Ball Grid Array (BGA) or a Land Grid Array (LGA). The BGA and the LGA are one of terminal layout schemes, and are used, for example, when there are many input and output pins and/or when the area of the semiconductor device <b>1</b> seen from the Z direction is prevented. The solder balls <b>9</b> are used as external terminals of the semiconductor device <b>1</b>.

Even when the height of the upper portion <b>13</b>A of the mounting component <b>13</b> in the Z direction exceeds the depth of the groove <b>5</b>, it is possible for the electronic device <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment to fix the semiconductor device <b>1</b> to the printed circuit board <b>15</b> by the mounting component <b>13</b> while minimizing a change in the height of the electronic device <b>100</b> compared to the comparative example.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Further, with the electronic device <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment, heat dissipation is easier compared to the comparative example.

Meanwhile, in the electronic device <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment, the mounting component <b>13</b> covers the upper surface of the semiconductor device <b>1</b> only in the groove <b>5</b>. Therefore, it is possible for the electronic device <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment to dissipate heat from a portion not covered with the mounting component <b>13</b>. Moreover, when the mounting component <b>13</b> is made of a material that easily dissipates heat, it may be expected to easily dissipate heat from a portion covered with the mounting component.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, with the electronic device <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment, it is possible to make it difficult to fix the semiconductor device <b>1</b> to the printed circuit board <b>15</b> in an incorrect orientation. Specifically, when the groove <b>5</b> is provided, for example, in a non-linearly symmetrical manner in the upper surface of the sealing resin <b>12</b>, it is possible to prevent the semiconductor device <b>1</b> from being placed in an incorrect orientation when the semiconductor device <b>1</b> is fixed to the printed circuit board <b>15</b>. For example, the intersection of the cross of the groove <b>5</b> may not be provided at the center of the sealing resin <b>12</b>, but may be shifted in the X direction and/or in the Y direction.

In other words, each edge of the substrate <b>41</b> extending in the Y direction has a portion that is not along the Y direction, and the portion that is not along the Y direction has a concave semicircular shape.

That is, the sealing resin <b>42</b> has a rectangular shape and has, for example, a semicircular concave shape at the edges along the Y direction in the XY plane. The sealing resin <b>42</b> has two grooves <b>8</b> having a shape that extends in the Y direction along the edges of the sealing resin <b>42</b> in the XY plane. In other words, each groove <b>8</b> has, for example, a rectangular parallelepiped shape. The two grooves <b>8</b> are respectively located at both edges of the sealing resin <b>42</b> in the Y direction. The groove <b>8</b> includes a semicircular concave portion.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Hereinafter, the groove <b>8</b> will be described in detail. The sealing resin <b>42</b> has a difference in height in the Z direction depending on the location. Specifically, it is as follows. The sealing resin <b>42</b> includes a first portion <b>42</b>A and a second portion <b>42</b>B. The first portion <b>42</b>A occupies a lower side (&#x2212;Z side) portion of the sealing resin <b>42</b>. The first portion <b>42</b>A has a shape in which, in a second surface of a rectangular parallelepiped along the ZY plane, a part of the edge is recessed in the Z direction, for example, in a semi-cylindrical shape. The recessed portion extends, for example, in the Z direction and spans from the upper surface in the Z direction to the bottom surface in the Z direction of the first portion <b>42</b>A.

That is, the sealing resin <b>42</b> has a lower height in the Z direction in the exposed region of the upper surface of the first portion <b>42</b>A compared to the other region. The groove <b>8</b> is a space created by a difference in height in the Z direction between the exposed portion of the upper surface of the first portion <b>42</b>A and the upper surface of the second portion <b>42</b>B.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In other words, the sealing resin <b>42</b> has a structure in which the second portion <b>42</b>B having a rectangular parallelepiped shape with a smaller size (or a shorter length) in the X direction than the first portion <b>42</b>A in the XY plane is provided on the first portion <b>42</b>A having a rectangular parallelepiped shape in which a part of the edge along the ZY surface is recessed in a semi-cylindrical shape in the Z direction.
