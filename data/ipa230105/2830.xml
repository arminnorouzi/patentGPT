Currently available imaging techniques and traditional blood biomarkers to capture minimal residual disease (MRD) state after surgery have poor sensitivity and do not play a role in clinical practice (Aurello, P. et al. <i>World journal of gastroenterology </i>23, 3379-3387, doi:10.3748/wjg.v23.i19.3379 (2017)).

For example, &#x201c;about&#x201d; can mean within 1 or more than 1 standard deviation, per the practice in the art. Alternatively, &#x201c;about&#x201d; can mean a range of up to 20%, up to 10%, up to 5%, or up to 1% of a given value or range. Alternatively, particularly with respect to biological systems or processes, the term can mean within an order of magnitude within 5-fold, and also within 2-fold, of a value. Where particular values are described in the application and claims, unless otherwise stated the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; meaning within an acceptable error range for the particular value should be assumed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The terms &#x201c;aligned&#x201d;, &#x201c;alignment&#x201d;, &#x201c;mapped&#x201d; or &#x201c;aligning&#x201d;, &#x201c;mapping&#x201d; refer to one or more sequences that are identified as a match in terms of the order of their nucleic acid molecules to a known sequence from a reference genome.

Generally, a nucleotide base is deemed a called variant based on the presence of an alternative allele on sequence reads obtained from a sample, where the sequence reads each cross over the position in the genome. The source of a candidate variant may initially be unknown or uncertain. During processing, candidate variants may be associated with an expected source such as genomic DNA (e.g., blood-derived) or cells impacted by cancer (e.g., tumor-derived). Additionally, candidate variants may be called as true positives. A variant of interest is particular variant of a genetic sequence that is to be measured, qualified, quantified, or detected.

Patients with confirmed stage IB-IVA gastric adenocarcinoma eligible for perioperative treatment with systemic chemotherapy were randomized upfront to receive three cycles of preoperative chemotherapy followed by three cycles of postoperative chemotherapy or to receive the same preoperative regimen followed by postoperative radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy. A blood draw was collected for each patient at the time of study enrollment (baseline), after three cycles of preoperative chemotherapy (preoperative timepoint), and after surgery (postoperative timepoint). Blood samples were initially processed to allow proper extraction of cfDNA from plasma and genomic DNA (gDNA) from white blood cells (WBC). Both cfDNA and WBC gDNA libraries were hybrid captured with custom RNA oligo pools encompassing 80,930 bases across 58 cancer driver genes. Capture libraries were sequenced at high coverage (&#x3e;30,000&#xd7;), followed by sequence alignment, error correction, and variant calling.

The methods embodied herein, provide that ctDNA detection after completion of preoperative treatment as well as minimal residual disease detection after surgery can predict recurrence and survival in patients with resectable gastric cancer treated with multimodal therapeutic regimens. Preferred methods were able to distinguish ctDNA alterations from cfDNA variants related to clonal hematopoiesis and whether ctDNA elimination before or after surgery can serve as a predictive biomarker of patient outcome to perioperative treatment.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Accordingly, in certain embodiments, methods to identify circulating tumor-derived DNA (ctDNA) alterations include ultrasensitive targeted sequencing analyses of matched cf-DNA and white blood cells from the same patient. The results obtained are described in detail in the examples section which follows. Briefly, samples from patients in the CRITICS trial, a phase III study evaluating perioperative treatment in 788 patients with resectable gastric cancer were analyzed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). Liquid biopsy analyses of 50 patients with available blood samples at multiple time points (n=120) revealed that 52% of alterations in cfDNA were derived from white blood cells. After filtering blood cell alterations from cfDNA, it was found that the presence of ctDNA can predict recurrence when analyzed after preoperative treatment (median 18.4 months vs. median not reached, P=0.012, HR=3.0, 95% CI=1.3-6.9) and after surgery (median 18.7 months vs. median not reached, P&#x3c;0.001, HR=21.8, 95% CI=3.9-123.1) in patients eligible for multimodal treatment. These analyses provide a facile method for distinguishing ctDNA from other cfDNA alterations, and highlight the utility of ctDNA as a predictive biomarker of patient outcome to perioperative therapy and resection in patients with, for example, gastric cancer, as well as other cancers including colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and/or esophageal cancer.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Candidate tumor-specific mutations in cfDNA, consisting of point mutations, small insertions, and deletions can be identified across the targeted regions of interest as described in detail in the examples section which follows. Briefly, an alteration was considered a candidate somatic mutation only when: (i) Three distinct paired reads contained the mutation in the cf-DNA and the number of distinct paired reads containing a particular mutation in the plasma was at least 0.05% of the total distinct read pairs; or (ii) one distinct paired read contained the mutation in the cfDNA and the mutation had also been detected in at least one additional timepoint at the level specified in (i); (iii) the mismatched base or small indel was not identified in matched white blood cell sequencing data of samples collected at baseline at the level of one distinct read (Table 9); (iv) the mismatched base or small indel was not present in a custom database of common germline variants derived from dbSNP; (v) the altered base did not arise from misplaced genome alignments including paralogous sequences; and (vi) the mutation fell within a protein coding region and was classified as a missense, nonsense, frameshift, or splice site alteration. Candidate alterations were defined as somatic hotspots if the nucleotide change and amino acid change were identical to an alteration observed in &#x3e;20 cancer cases reported in the COSMIC database.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Genomes and Cancer</heading><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Cancer genome sequencing studies have collectively identified various genetic mutations that make human tumors grow and progress. Unlike hereditary or germline mutations that are passed from parent to child, somatic mutations form in the DNA of individual cells during a person's life and are not passed from parent to child. Therefore, sequence variants due to somatic DNA mutations that are associated with cancers provide biomarkers to detect cancers and measure development of cancers.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Tumor tissues per se include large amount of DNA materials that may be analyzed to detect cancer variants, or sequence variants that are known to or suspected to be associated with various cancers. This can be performed through biopsy of tumor tissues. However, due to the continuously changing location and form of cancers, it is often difficult to continuously obtain biopsy samples at various locations to obtain cancer tissues and cancer originating DNA. Dying tumor cells release small pieces of their DNA into the bloodstream and other bodily fluids. These pieces are called cell free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), which coexists with cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from non-cancer cells. Screenings of ctDNA related to somatic mutations detect and follow the progression of a patient's tumor. These methods are also referred to as liquid biopsy.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Various current liquid biopsy methods utilize high throughput sequencing to analyze cfDNA collected from patients. However, the ability to detect tumor-specific variants is bounded by several factors. Liquid biopsy methods utilizing high throughput sequencing are limited by sequencing error rate and sequencing depth. In some cancer patients, tumor load may be very load for some tumor variant. For instance, the ctDNA may be fewer than 0.1%, or 0.01% in some samples. So the fraction of cfDNA originating from tumors can fall below the margin of error of sequencing pipeline. Tumor-specific variants called from low tumor burden patients can be plagued by high false positive rates, because there is small but existing chance that a sequence matching the tumor variant in a putative read is in fact due to sequencing errors instead of an actual mutation. It is desirable to increase true positive to improve sensitivity and decrease false positive to improve selectivity.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Accordingly, in certain embodiments, a method of detecting tumor specific mutations in a subject's circulating tumor DNA, comprises obtaining a sample from a subject at risk or suffering from cancer. In certain embodiments, the sample is whole blood. The whole blood is processed, e.g. centrifuged to separate the plasm from the cellular components. cfDNA is then extracted from the plasma and genomic DNA is extracted, for example, from white blood cells. Sequencing libraries of genomic DNA comprising cell free DNA (cfDNA) and cellular DNA are prepared to identify sequence variations in the cfDNA and cellular DNA as compared to a reference genomic sequence. The sequence variations between the cfDNA and cellular DNA are compared to identify differences in the sequences. Sequence specific mutations detected in both cfDNA and white blood cell DNA were excluded as tumor specific mutations. Sequence specific mutations detected exclusively in cfDNA were identified as tumor specific mutations.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In certain embodiments, detection of mutations in circulating tumor DNA of subjects with cancer are determinative of eligibility for surgical resection.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In certain embodiments, detection of changes in levels of circulating tumor DNA in patients treated with perioperative chemotherapy is determinative of whether the patient is responding to the therapy.

These enzymatic steps may include one or more of 5&#x2032; phosphorylation, end repair with a polymerase, A-tailing with a polymerase, ligation of one or more sequencing adapters with a ligase, and linear or exponential amplification of a plurality of fragments with a polymerase. In some embodiments, a plurality of fragments whose sequence composition matches a pre-defined panel of sequences may be targeted or selected by hybridization-capture, such that a subset of the starting library is carried forward for additional steps.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Amplification adapters may be attached to the fragmented nucleic acid. Adapters may be commercially obtained, such as from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa). In certain embodiments, the adapter sequences are attached to the template nucleic acid molecule with an enzyme. The enzyme may be a ligase or a polymerase. The ligase may be any enzyme capable of ligating an oligonucleotide (RNA or DNA) to the template nucleic acid molecule. Suitable ligases include T4 DNA ligase and T4 RNA ligase, available commercially from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, Mass.). Methods for using ligases are well known in the art. The polymerase may be any enzyme capable of adding nucleotides to the 3&#x2032; and the 5&#x2032; terminus of template nucleic acid molecules.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The ligation may be blunt ended or utilize complementary overhanging ends. In certain embodiments, the ends of the fragments may be repaired, trimmed (e.g. using an exonuclease), or filled (e.g., using a polymerase and dNTPs) following fragmentation to form blunt ends. In some embodiments, end repair is performed to generate blunt end 5&#x2032; phosphorylated nucleic acid ends using commercial kits, such as those available from Epicentre Biotechnologies (Madison, Wis.). Upon generating blunt ends, the ends may be treated with a polymerase and dATP to form a template independent addition to the 3&#x2032;-end and the 5&#x2032;-end of the fragments, thus producing a single A overhanging. This single A is used to guide ligation of fragments with a single T overhanging from the 5&#x2032;-end in a method referred to as T-A cloning. Alternatively, because the possible combinations of overhangs left by the restriction enzymes are known after a restriction digestion, the ends may be left as-is, i.e., ragged ends. In certain embodiments, double stranded oligonucleotides with complementary overhanging ends are used.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In certain embodiments, barcode sequences are attached to the template nucleic acids. In certain embodiments, a barcode is attached to each fragment. In other embodiments, a plurality of barcodes, e.g., two barcodes, are attached to each fragment. A barcode sequence generally includes certain features that make the sequence useful in sequencing reactions. For example the barcode sequences are designed to have minimal or no homo-polymer regions, i.e., 2 or more of the same base in a row such as AA or CCC, within the barcode sequence. The barcode sequences are also designed so that they are at least one edit distance away from the base addition order when performing base-by-base sequencing, ensuring that the first and last base do not match the expected bases of the sequence.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The barcode sequences are designed such that each sequence is correlated to a particular portion of nucleic acid, allowing sequence reads to be correlated back to the portion from which they came. In certain embodiments, the barcode sequences range from about 5 nucleotides to about 15 nucleotides. In a particular embodiment, the barcode sequences range from about 4 nucleotides to about 7 nucleotides. Since the barcode sequence is sequenced along with the template nucleic acid, the oligonucleotide length should be of minimal length so as to permit the longest read from the template nucleic acid attached. For example, a plurality of DNA barcodes can comprise various numbers of sequences of nucleotides. In certain embodiments, the barcode sequences comprise 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 or more nucleotides. When attached to only one end of a polynucleotide, the plurality of DNA barcodes can produce 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 or more different identifiers. Alternatively, when attached to both ends of a polynucleotide, the plurality DNA barcodes can produce 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400 or more different identifiers (which is the 2 of when the DNA barcode is attached to only 1 end of a polynucleotide).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Generally, the barcode sequences are spaced from the template nucleic acid molecule by at least one base (minimizes homo-polymeric combinations).

Suitable ligases include T4 DNA ligase and T4 RNA ligase, available commercially from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, Mass.). The ligation may be blunt ended or via use of complementary overhanging ends.

In certain embodiments, a next generation sequencing method is used. See, for example, Phallen, J. et al. Direct detection of early-stage cancers using circulating tumor DNA. <i>Sci Transl Med </i>9, doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.aan2415 (2017). Li B. T. et al. <i>Annals of Oncology </i>30: 597-603, 2019, doi:10.1093/annonc/mdz04, each of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety. Non-limiting examples of NGS include sequencing-by-synthesis using reversible dye terminators, and sequencing-by-ligation. This method is based on targeted capture and deep sequencing (&#x3e;30,000&#xd7;) of DNA fragments to identify single base substitutions and small insertions or deletions in cfDNA across 80,930 bp of coding gene regions while distinguishing these from PCR amplification and sequencing artifacts.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Sequencing may also be by any method known in the art. DNA sequencing techniques include classic dideoxy sequencing reactions (Sanger method) using labeled terminators or primers and gel separation in slab or capillary, sequencing by synthesis using reversibly terminated labeled nucleotides, pyrosequencing, 454 sequencing, Illumina/Solexa sequencing, allele specific hybridization to a library of labeled oligonucleotide probes, sequencing by synthesis using allele specific hybridization to a library of labeled clones that is followed by ligation, real time monitoring of the incorporation of labeled nucleotides during a polymerization step, polony sequencing, SOLiD sequencing targeted sequencing, single molecule real-time sequencing, exon sequencing, electron microscopy-based sequencing, panel sequencing, transistor-mediated sequencing, direct sequencing, random shotgun sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, sequencing by hybridization, capillary electrophoresis, gel electrophoresis, duplex sequencing, cycle sequencing, single-base extension sequencing, solid-phase sequencing, high-throughput sequencing, massively parallel signature sequencing, emulsion PCR, co-amplification at lower denaturation temperature-PCR (COLD-PCR), multiplex PCR, sequencing by reversible dye terminator, paired-end sequencing, near-term sequencing, exonuclease sequencing, sequencing by ligation, short-read sequencing, single-molecule sequencing, real-time sequencing, reverse-terminator sequencing, nanopore sequencing, MS-PET sequencing, and a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the sequencing method is massively parallel sequencing, that is, simultaneously (or in rapid succession) sequencing any of at least 100, 1000, 10,000, 100,000, 1 million, 10 million, 100 million, or 1 billion polynucleotide molecules. In some embodiments, sequencing can be performed by a gene analyzer such as, for example, gene analyzers commercially available from Illumina or Applied Biosystems. Sequencing of separated molecules has more recently been demonstrated by sequential or single extension reactions using polymerases or ligases as well as by single or sequential differential hybridizations with libraries of probes. Sequencing may be performed by a DNA sequencer (e.g., a machine designed to perform sequencing reactions).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">A sequencing technique that can be used includes, for example, use of sequencing-by-synthesis systems. In the first step, DNA is sheared into fragments of approximately 300-800 base pairs, and the fragments are blunt ended. Oligonucleotide adaptors are then ligated to the ends of the fragments. The adaptors serve as primers for amplification and sequencing of the fragments. The fragments can be attached to DNA capture beads, e.g., streptavidin-coated beads using, e.g., Adaptor B, which contains 5&#x2032;-biotin tag. The fragments attached to the beads are PCR amplified within droplets of an oil-water emulsion. The result is multiple copies of clonally amplified DNA fragments on each bead. In the second step, the beads are captured in wells (pico-liter sized). Pyrosequencing is performed on each DNA fragment in parallel. Addition of one or more nucleotides generates a light signal that is recorded by a CCD camera in a sequencing instrument. The signal strength is proportional to the number of nucleotides incorporated. Pyrosequencing makes use of pyrophosphate (PPi) which is released upon nucleotide addition. PPi is converted to ATP by ATP sulfurylase in the presence of adenosine 5&#x2032; phosphosulfate. Luciferase uses ATP to convert luciferin to oxyluciferin, and this reaction generates light that is detected and analyzed.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Another example of a DNA sequencing technique that can be used is SOLiD&#x2122; technology by Applied Biosystems from Life Technologies Corporation (Carlsbad, Calif.). In SOLiD&#x2122; sequencing, genomic DNA is sheared into fragments, and adaptors are attached to the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends of the fragments to generate a fragment library. Alternatively, internal adaptors can be introduced by ligating adaptors to the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends of the fragments, circularizing the fragments, digesting the circularized fragment to generate an internal adaptor, and attaching adaptors to the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends of the resulting fragments to generate a mate-paired library. Next, clonal bead populations are prepared in microreactors containing beads, primers, template, and PCR components. Following PCR, the templates are denatured and beads are enriched to separate the beads with extended templates. Templates on the selected beads are subjected to a 3&#x2032; modification that permits bonding to a glass slide. The sequence can be determined by sequential hybridization and ligation of partially random oligonucleotides with a central determined base (or pair of bases) that is identified by a specific fluorophore. After a color is recorded, the ligated oligonucleotide is removed and the process is then repeated.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Another example of a DNA sequencing technique that can be used is ion semiconductor sequencing using, for example, a system sold under the trademark ION TORRENT by Ion Torrent by Life Technologies (South San Francisco, Calif.). Ion semiconductor sequencing is described, for example, in Rothberg, et al., An integrated semiconductor device enabling non-optical genome sequencing, Nature 475:348-352 (2011); U.S. Pub. 2010/0304982; U.S. Pub. 2010/0301398; U.S. Pub. 2010/0300895; U.S. Pub. 2010/0300559; and U.S. Pub. 2009/0026082, the contents of each of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Another example of a sequencing technology that can be used is Illumina sequencing. Illumina sequencing is based on the amplification of DNA on a solid surface using fold-back PCR and anchored primers. Genomic DNA is fragmented, and adapters are added to the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends of the fragments. DNA fragments that are attached to the surface of flow cell channels are extended and bridge amplified. The fragments become double stranded, and the double stranded molecules are denatured. Multiple cycles of the solid-phase amplification followed by denaturation can create several million clusters of approximately 1,000 copies of single-stranded DNA molecules of the same template in each channel of the flow cell. Primers, DNA polymerase and four fluorophore-labeled, reversibly terminating nucleotides are used to perform sequential sequencing. After nucleotide incorporation, a laser is used to excite the fluorophores, and an image is captured and the identity of the first base is recorded. The 3&#x2032; terminators and fluorophores from each incorporated base are removed and the incorporation, detection and identification steps are repeated. Sequencing according to this technology is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,960,120; 7,835,871; 7,232,656; 7,598,035; 6,911,345; 6,833,246; 6,828,100; 6,306,597; 6,210,891; U.S. Pub. 2011/0009278; U.S. Pub. 2007/0114362; U.S. Pub. 2006/0292611; and U.S. Pub. 2006/0024681, each of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Another example of a sequencing technology that can be used includes the single molecule, real-time (SMRT) technology of Pacific Biosciences (Menlo Park, Calif.). In SMRT, each of the four DNA bases is attached to one of four different fluorescent dyes. These dyes are phospholinked. A single DNA polymerase is immobilized with a single molecule of template single stranded DNA at the bottom of a zero-mode waveguide (ZMW). It takes several milliseconds to incorporate a nucleotide into a growing strand. During this time, the fluorescent label is excited and produces a fluorescent signal, and the fluorescent tag is cleaved off. Detection of the corresponding fluorescence of the dye indicates which base was incorporated. The process is repeated.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Another example of a sequencing technique that can be used is nanopore sequencing (Soni &#x26; Meller, 2007, Progress toward ultrafast DNA sequence using solid-state nanopores, Clin Chem 53(11):1996-2001). A nanopore is a small hole, of the order of 1 nanometer in diameter. Immersion of a nanopore in a conducting fluid and application of a potential across it results in a slight electrical current due to conduction of ions through the nanopore. The amount of current which flows is sensitive to the size of the nanopore. As a DNA molecule passes through a nanopore, each nucleotide on the DNA molecule obstructs the nanopore to a different degree. Thus, the change in the current passing through the nanopore as the DNA molecule passes through the nanopore represents a reading of the DNA sequence.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Another example of a sequencing technique that can be used involves using a chemical-sensitive field effect transistor (chemFET) array to sequence DNA (for example, as described in U.S. Pub. 2009/0026082). In one example of the technique, DNA molecules can be placed into reaction chambers, and the template molecules can be hybridized to a sequencing primer bound to a polymerase. Incorporation of one or more triphosphates into a new nucleic acid strand at the 3&#x2032; end of the sequencing primer can be detected by a change in current by a chemFET. An array can have multiple chemFET sensors. In another example, single nucleic acids can be attached to beads, and the nucleic acids can be amplified on the bead, and the individual beads can be transferred to individual reaction chambers on a chemFET array, with each chamber having a chemFET sensor, and the nucleic acids can be sequenced.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Another example of a sequencing technique that can be used involves using an electron microscope as described, for example, by Moudrianakis, E. N. and Beer M., in Base sequence determination in nucleic acids with the electron microscope, III. Chemistry and microscopy of guanine-labeled DNA, PNAS 53:564-71 (1965). In one example of the technique, individual DNA molecules are labeled using metallic labels that are distinguishable using an electron microscope. These molecules are then stretched on a flat surface and imaged using an electron microscope to measure sequences.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Sequence Reads: Sequencing generates a plurality of reads. Reads generally include sequences of nucleotide data less than about 150 bases in length, or less than about 90 bases in length. In certain embodiments, reads are between about 80 and about 90 bases, e.g., about 85 bases in length. In some embodiments, methods of the invention are applied to very short reads, i.e., less than about 50 or about 30 bases in length. Sequence read data can include the sequence data as well as meta information. Sequence read data can be stored in any suitable file format including, for example, VCF files, FASTA files or FASTQ files, as are known to those of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">FASTA is originally a computer program for searching sequence databases and the name FASTA has come to also refer to a standard file format. See Pearson &#x26; Lipman, 1988, Improved tools for biological sequence comparison, PNAS 85:2444-2448. The FASTQ format is a text-based format for storing both a biological sequence (usually nucleotide sequence) and its corresponding quality scores. It is similar to the FASTA format but with quality scores following the sequence data. Both the sequence letter and quality score are encoded with a single ASCII character for brevity. The FASTQ format is a de facto standard for storing the output of high throughput sequencing instruments such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer.

In assembly by alignment, for example, the reads are aligned to each other or to a reference. By aligning each read, in turn to a reference genome, all of the reads are positioned in relationship to each other to create the assembly. In addition, aligning or mapping the sequence read to a reference sequence can also be used to identify variant sequences within the sequence read. Identifying variant sequences can be used in combination with the methods and systems described herein to further aid in the diagnosis or prognosis of a disease or condition, or for guiding treatment decisions.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In certain embodiments, sequence reads are aligned against the human reference genome (hg19) with additional realignment of select regions. Candidate tumor-specific mutations in cfDNA, consisting of point mutations, small insertions, and deletions are identified using across the targeted regions of interest. Candidate alterations are defined as somatic hotspots if the nucleotide change and amino acid change are identical to an alteration observed in &#x2265;20 cancer cases reported in the COSMIC database.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">For alterations detected in cfDNA that were not identified by matched white blood cell sequencing, the posterior probability that such an alteration was tumor derived was determined from a Bayesian statistical model using the frequency of altered alleles and total coverage of cfDNA and WBCs sequences.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">A processing system, such as a processor of a computer, is used for executing the code for performing the variant computational analysis.

The sampling distribution of the observed number of reads with an altered mutation in cfDNA and WBC sequencing is a binomial parameterized by the total coverage at that mutation and unknown probability theta. This method is described in detail in the examples section which follows.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some embodiments, the processing system uses one or more different types of models. For example, a Bayesian hierarchical model is one of many possible model architectures that may be used to generate candidate variants. Further, multiple different models may be stored in a database or retrieved for application post-training. For example, a first model is trained to model single nucleotide variants (SNV) noise rates and a second model is trained to model insertion deletion noise rates. Further, the processing system may use parameters of the model to determine a likelihood of one or more true positives in a sequence read. The processing system may determine a quality score (e.g., on a logarithmic scale) based on the likelihood. Other models, such as a joint model, may use output of one or more Bayesian hierarchical models to determine expected noise of nucleotide mutations in sequence reads of different samples.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some embodiments, any or all of the steps of the invention are automated.

Patients with tumors of the gastroesophageal junction were permitted to enroll when the bulk of the tumor was predominantly located in the stomach and could therefore consist of Siewert types II (true gastroesophageal junction) and III (subcardial stomach) tumors. Patients with Siewert type I (distal esophagus) tumors were not eligible. An exploratory laparoscopy was indicated when the preoperative CT scan suggested peritoneal carcinomatosis.

The Two Histological Main Types of Gastric Carcinoma: Diffuse and So-Called Intestinal-Type Carcinoma. An Attempt at a Histo-Clinical Classification. <i>Acta pathologica et microbiologica Scandinavica </i>64, 31-49 (1965)).

For detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the tumor areas were demarcated on H&#x26;E slides of the resection specimens. In case of sufficient amount of tumor tissue, 3 cores per tumor were taken for construction of a tissue microarray (TMA). TMA sections were cut and used for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA in-situ hybridization (EBER-ISH).

Under the tumor derived model, theta_WBC is zero and only theta_plasma is unknown. For the hematopoietic model, it is assumed that theta_WBC and theta_plasma are the same. As a prior for theta_plasma, a beta distribution was used with shape parameters 2.4 and 340 that loosely centers most of the mass on the observed mutation allele frequencies in samples for which mutations were identified in both cfDNA and WBC sequencing. This prior is equivalent to a sample with 2.4 altered reads per 340 distinct molecules. Simulating a large number of theta's from the prior, the probability of the observed data for each simulated theta was computed. The ergodic average of these probabilities approximates the likelihood of the observed data conditional on the model but unconditional on theta. Assuming a prior odds of 1, the posterior odds (PO) was the same as the Bayes factor and the probability that the mutation was tumor derived by PO/(1+PO) was obtained.

E. et al. <i>BMC Cancer </i>18, 877, doi:10.1186/s12885-018-4770-2 (2018)). There is however still an urgent clinical need to select patients who do need adjuvant treatment because of the presence of minimal residual disease. Here a new ctDNA approach for detection of MRD that could select patients for adjuvant strategies is presented herein. The findings herein, support the investigation of real-time minimal residual disease assessment based on ctDNA analyses after surgery in future interventional trials to address the clinical utility of such an approach to assist clinicians in the decision-making process of selecting patients in need of adjuvant treatment.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">The study herein is the first study to investigate the value of parallel deep sequencing of cfDNA and WBCs to detect cfDNA alterations associated with clonal hematopoiesis in the circulation and to use this approach to longitudinally identify bonafide tumor-specific alterations. This approach allows direct identification of ctDNA without requiring tumor tissue, which is often available to a limited extent and where sequencing analyses may be hampered by intra-tumoral heterogeneity. It was also demonstrated herein, that plasma samples from patients with Lauren's intestinal subtype were associated with higher mutant allele fractions when compared with patients with diffuse subtype tumors.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">A major challenge for the development of MRD assays using noninvasive liquid biopsies is distinguishing tumor-specific mutations from background changes associated with biological variation. The vast majority of cfDNA in healthy individuals arises from hematopoietic cells (Moss, J. et al. <i>Nat Commun </i>9, 5068, doi:10.1038/s41467-018-07466-6 (2018)). Normal ageing is associated with the accumulation of somatic mutations in bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cells in the form of CHIP in asymptomatic individuals (Xie, M. et al. <i>Nat Med </i>20, 1472-1478, doi:10.1038/nm.3733 (2014)). WBC-derived alterations that arise as a consequence of CHIP may confound liquid biopsy analyses that are based on characterization of cfDNA as these may occur in common cancer driver genes, as observed with hotspot alterations in TP53 and <i>KRAS </i>(Hu, Y. et al. <i>Clin Cancer Res </i>24, 4437-4443, doi:10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0143 (2018)). As shown in the cohort of 50 patients, cfDNA analyses without WBC filters would have been unable to appropriately identify patients that benefit from perioperative treatment in terms of event-free and overall survival.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">It was reported herein, that a tissue-independent approach designed to detect tumor-specific cfDNA alterations in patients with resectable gastric cancer treated with perioperative chemotherapy can be applied to predict treatment response and identify patients under higher risk of disease relapse. Recent ctDNA analyses to assess response to preoperative immune checkpoint blockade for patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer similarly revealed dramatic molecular responses in the circulation in individuals with major pathological responses (Anagnostou, V. et al. <i>Cancer Res </i>79, 1214-1225, doi:10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-1127 (2019)). These results reinforce a paradigm of using ctDNA analyses for response to therapy and minimal residual disease assessment in solid tumors. The approach herein provides evidence that noninvasive detection of ctDNA would be useful for early risk stratification of patients with gastric cancer and therapeutic decisions for novel interventions in clinical trials.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 2: Early Detection and Detection of Minimal Residual Disease in Stage II and III Colorectal Cancer Patients Using a Noninvasive, White Blood Cell-Guided Liquid Biopsy Approach to Identify Mutations as Biomarkers</heading><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Over 1.2 million individuals are diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) every year and more than 608,000 deaths occur annually making it the third most common cancer as well as the third highest cause of cancer related death in the developed world (1, 2). CRC can be curable at early stage when the tumor is detected and removed however the disease often develops without symptoms until advanced stage (3, 4). High morbidity and mortality are associated with diagnoses at late stages when less effective surgical and therapeutic interventions are available. There is an urgent need to develop effective screening and early detection strategies to move the detection of disease from late to early stage. Currently, there is a lack of effective biomarkers for CRC screening and interception. Colonoscopy is a useful means of identifying CRC, however the procedure is invasive, requires skilled practitioners, places a burden on healthcare systems in terms of cost and workforce needs, and has suboptimal compliance with only &#x2dc;64% of the United States population participating in regular screening (5). CEA is a biomarker of recurrence but is not useful for screening (6, 7), and other possible noninvasive strategies such as fecal occult blood testing or methylated SEPT9 testing suffer from low compliance and specificity (8-11). Detection of minimal residual disease post-resection in early stage colorectal cancer patients could be improved beyond the current standard of care. Patients diagnosed with stage II CRC have a surgical resection but no additional therapy; 20% of patients recur within 5 years indicating that these patients may benefit from additional treatment (12-18). Stage III patients with CRC undergo surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy, however a subset of these individuals may be cured with surgery alone.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Development of noninvasive liquid biopsy methods based on analyses of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) provides the opportunity for early detection and detection of minimal residual disease post resection in CRC patients through sensitive and specific direct detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Next-generation sequencing technologies together with advanced bioinformatics have brought ctDNA-based assays to the forefront of genotyping in a variety of cancer types, however current studies have mostly been applied to patients with late-stage cancers or have used tumor tissue sequencing to guide mutational analyses in the blood (19-26). Screening and early detection of cancer require direct detection of ctDNA in the blood with no prior knowledge of tumor presence and high specificity yet existing approaches have suffered from a background of hematopoietic alterations identified in the plasma. We here present a white blood cell-guided liquid biopsy approach for detection of tumor-derived alterations in the plasma in the setting of early detection and detection of minimal residual disease in stage II and III CRC patients.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">We analyzed samples from 52 patients enrolled in the MEDOCC-PLCRC study, a prospective, observational study ongoing in the Netherlands to collect biospecimens from stage II and III CRC patients. Patients had a baseline blood draw at the time of diagnosis and were treatment na&#xef;ve. Based on the current standard of care all stage II and III patients had a surgical resection during which tumor tissue was collected for genomic analyses. A post-resection liquid biopsy was collected between one and 12 weeks after surgery to allow time for the patient to heal and to define a window of therapeutic intervention where possible adjuvant therapy would be efficacious for patients in whom minimal residual disease was identified. Buffy coat was collected from the baseline liquid biopsy as source of white blood cells.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">We first analyzed the baseline and post-resection liquid biopsies from the 52 patients in the study using the ultra-deep, targeted sequencing approach we previously developed (27). We identified mutations down to 0.05% mutant allele fraction when the mutation was present in least three distinct DNA molecules with three duplicate molecules having the identical base change (27). Each liquid biopsy was analyzed independently without knowledge of mutations identified in the other sample. In total, 152 mutations were identified in the 52 patients across both timepoints (Table 1 below). 128 mutations in 47 patients were identified at baseline while 76 mutations in 38 patients were identified post resection (Table 1 below). We hypothesized that a subset of the alterations in the plasma were tumor-derived, while a subset resulted from clonal hematopoiesis or germline changes. We next analyzed the matched white blood cells from the 52 patients using independent ultra-deep, targeted sequencing to identify mutations present in at least one distinct DNA molecule with at least three duplicate molecules having the identical mutation. Mutations in the baseline or post-resection plasma which were also identified in the matched white blood cells were removed from further analysis and considered hematopoietic or germline alterations. To limit the mutations in the plasma to tumor-derived mutations, we took a conservative approach and called mutations in the white blood cells to a much deeper level compared to the plasma analyses to remove any mutation that was present even at 0.01% mutant allele fraction in the white blood cells.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Mutations identified in white blood cells included variants in DNMT3A, a gene well-known to be altered in clonal hematopoiesis, as well as genes more commonly thought of as cancer drivers such as TP53, APC, and KRAS. We observed that the mutant allele fractions of alterations in the white blood cells and of the same alteration in baseline of post-resection plasma were highly correlated, R<sup>2</sup>=0.97 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>). Hematopoietic mutations were also likely to be present in both the baseline and post-resection plasma samples at a similar mutant allele fraction.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">After removing alterations from the plasma that were also identified in the matched white blood cells, 65 mutations in 28 patients remained in the baseline plasma and 13 mutations in eight patients remained in the post-resection plasma (Table 1 below). To further investigate the origin of these mutations, we analyzed matched tumor tissue using independent targeted sequencing to identify variants. We found that 50 of 65 mutations at baseline, 77%, in 23 patients, 82%, were concordant at high level (&#x2265;10%) in the matched tumor (Table 1 below). While tumor sequencing is not possible in the setting of early detection, confirmation of concordance between plasma and tumor alterations shows that the majority of mutations remaining after analysis using the white blood cell-guided approach are tumor derived and likely to be indicative of the presence of CRC.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Using the white blood cell-guided approach for detection of tumor-derived mutations in plasma, we detected 28 of 52 patients at baseline, 54%, and 8 of 52 patients post resection, 15% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). Tumor-derived mutations ranged from 0.1% to 6.17% at baseline and 0.09% to 4.06% post resection. Mutations derived from clonal hematopoiesis were clustered at low mutant allele fractions, and germline changes above 25% were also evident through analyses of matched white blood cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref>). For patients with detected minimal residual disease post resection, n=8, we assessed whether a clinical recurrence had been documented; none of the eight patients with molecular recurrence had developed recurrent CRC using standard monitoring. While 20% of patients recur within 5 years, the follow up time for our cohort has reached only 2.5 years and it is possible that patients will recur as the timeline extends.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">We have shown that early detection and detection of minimal residual disease in stage II and III colorectal cancer patients using a noninvasive, white blood cell-guided liquid biopsy approach to identify mutations as biomarkers is feasible and results in identification of tumor-derived mutations representative of disease. The removal of alterations in white blood cells is a necessary step to remove the background of germline and hematopoietic changes which confound plasma analyses. Our data suggest that high concordance of plasma mutations with those identified in the matched tumor can only be achieved through removal of white blood cell alterations identified in the white blood cells. Overall, white blood cell-guided liquid biopsy analyses have the potential to enhance the specificity of noninvasive detection of cancer in the settings of early detection and disease monitoring.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="301pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Identification of mutations in baseline and post-resection plasma</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="168pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Cohort</entry><entry/><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="112pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Analysis</entry><entry/><entry>All</entry><entry>Recurrence</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Mutations</entry><entry>Patients</entry><entry>52</entry><entry>6</entry></row><row><entry>identified in</entry><entry>Mutations</entry><entry>152&#x2002;</entry><entry>18&#x2002;</entry></row><row><entry>plasma samples</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="168pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Baseline plasma</entry><entry>Post-resection plasma</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="112pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>All</entry><entry>Recurrence</entry><entry>All</entry><entry>Recurrence</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Mutations</entry><entry>Patients</entry><entry>47</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>38</entry><entry>5</entry></row><row><entry>identified in</entry><entry>Fraction detected</entry><entry>90%</entry><entry>83%</entry><entry>73%</entry><entry>83%&#x2002;</entry></row><row><entry>plasma</entry><entry>Mutations</entry><entry>128&#x2002;</entry><entry>14&#x2002;</entry><entry>76</entry><entry>9</entry></row><row><entry>timepoint</entry></row><row><entry>Mutations</entry><entry>Patients</entry><entry>28</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>&#x2002;8</entry><entry>0</entry></row><row><entry>filtered to</entry><entry>Fraction detected</entry><entry>54%</entry><entry>50%</entry><entry>15%</entry><entry>0%</entry></row><row><entry>remove any</entry><entry>&#x2265;1 mutation concordant with tumor</entry><entry>23</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>&#x2002;1</entry><entry>0</entry></row><row><entry>identified in</entry><entry>Fraction</entry><entry>82%</entry><entry>100%&#x2002;</entry><entry>13%</entry><entry>NA</entry></row><row><entry>white blood cells</entry><entry>Mutations</entry><entry>65</entry><entry>8</entry><entry>13</entry><entry>0</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Concordant with tumor</entry><entry>50</entry><entry>8</entry><entry>&#x2002;3</entry><entry>0</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Fraction</entry><entry>77%</entry><entry>100%&#x2002;</entry><entry>23%</entry><entry>0%</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">REFERENCES FOR EXAMPLE 2</heading><p id="p-0149" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0147">1.

We designed a study to explore and model ctDNA dynamics during systemic treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with immunotherapy-containing regimens to predict clinical outcomes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b><i>a</i></figref>)<sup>10</sup>. Using a prospective bio-specimen collection protocol of longitudinal plasma and whole blood specimens, we identified patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treated with immunotherapy (IO) containing regimens. Plasma and whole blood specimens were collected at times where clinical venipuncture was indicated. When available, tumor tissue was collected for whole exome sequencing (WES). Clinical characteristics, including histopathology, PD-L1 status, and clinical tissue-based tumor mutational profiling (TMP), were collected in addition to response assessments including: radiographic response (RECIST1.1); progression-free and overall survival (PFS and OS); and durable or no durable clinical benefit (DCB or NDB) at 6 months.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0175">A total of 31 patients were selected for inclusion in the study cohort that: (i) received at least one cycle of IO or chemo-IO treatment; (ii) had at least two plasma samples evaluable for cell-free DNA sequencing; (iii) had at least one whole blood sample evaluable for matched WBC sequencing; and (iv) had clinical follow-up through time of death or at least 6 months from time of treatment initiation. The cohort included patients with primarily smoking history (n=27 of 31), stage IV disease (n=28), adenocarcinoma histology (n=23), and positive PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS; n=20) across the treatment categories.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0176">Classification of plasma variants. We performed deep targeted error correction sequencing of 142 plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and 46 white blood cell genomic DNA (gDNA) specimens for the cohort of 31 patients. Plasma cfDNA sequencing was completed for baseline samples, prior to treatment, in 24 patients (range &#x2212;2.6-0 weeks). Matched WBC sequencing was completed in 26 patients. For all reported samples, targeted capture libraries encompassing regions of 58 cancer-associated genes were subjected to ultrasensitive targeted sequencing followed by sequence alignment, error correction, and variant calling. A total of 160 variants in 38 genes were detected in plasma cfDNA and 66 variants in 21 genes in WBC gDNA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). These plasma cfDNA variants were classified as WBC or ctDNA variants. In cases where matched plasma cfDNA and WBC gDNA were evaluable, plasma variants detected in WBC gDNA were classified as WBC variants and excluded as ctDNA variants. Using this classification system, 46% of plasma variants (n=74 of 160) were found only in the plasma (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C</figref>). Almost a third of the plasma cfDNA variants (32%, n=51 of 160) were deemed CH variants, confirming our previous findings regarding the diversity of the cfDNA pool and the importance of our paired plasma/matched leukocyte DNA sequencing approach to filter out clonal hematopoiesis alterations that may confound the assessment of molecular response. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>B and <b>17</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0154" num="0177">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref> we implemented biospecimen and clinical metadata collection protocols that allow for collection of serial blood and tissue samples from lung cancer patients treated with immunotherapy. Plasma and matched leukocyte DNA samples were deeply sequenced, clonal hematopoiesis variants were filtered out and ctDNA molecular responses were interpreted with respect to the clinical phenotypes of the patients. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>B and <b>17</b>C</figref>, we found cfDNA mutations from white blood cells in genes not canonically associated with clonal hematopoiesis, again highlighting the importance of deep sequencing of matched leukocyte DNA in order to determine whether cfDNA mutations are tumor or CH-derived.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0178">A representative example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, for a patient responding to immunotherapy, with several variants detected by plasma next generation sequencing; appropriately classified into CH- and tumor-derived categories which allowed for assessment of molecular response 3 weeks after treatment initiation. Change in levels of tumor derived variants but not germline or clonal hematopoiesis derived variants were predictive of benefit to immune checkpoint blockade (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>C and <b>2</b>D</figref>). Overall, for our IO treated cohort, ctDNA dynamics accurately captured clinical response only after CH-derived mutations were filtered out.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0179">To further explore these findings and the importance of matched leukocyte DNA sequencing and analysis, we investigated the predictive and prognostic performance of ctDNA molecular responses with and without filtering out CH-derived mutations. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, inclusion of CH-derived variants completely obliterated the clinical utility of ctDNA dynamics in predicting progression-free and overall survival.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0180">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, inclusion of CH-derived and germline mutations did not allow for accurate determination of ctDNA molecular response and ctDNA dynamics were not associated with progression-free and overall survil (top panel). In contrast, when matched leukocyte DNA deep sequencing was employed, variants were accurately classified in tumor-derived and CH-derived categories, which in turn allowed for distinction of molecular ctDNA responders from non-responders. Post filtering, ctDNA responders had a significantly longer progression-free and overall survival (bottom panel).</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 4: Matched Leukocyte DNA Guided Liquid Biopsy Approaches for Response Monitoring in the Context of Immunotherapy for Early Stage Esophageal Cancer Patients</heading><p id="p-0158" num="0181">The importance of our matched leukocyte DNA approach is also exemplified in the setting of disease monitoring for early stage esophageal cancer treated with combined immune checkpoint inhibition and chemo-radiotherapy. We examined the utility of serial liquid biopsies to monitor clonal dynamics and predict pathologic response in patients with esophageal/gastroesophageal junction (E/GEJ) cancer undergoing treatment with neoadjuvant immunotherapy and concurrent chemoradiation (CA209-906; NCT03044613). Using targeted error correction sequencing, we performed high-depth next generation sequencing on 79 serial plasma samples and matched leukocyte DNA from 16 patients with operable stage II/III E/GEJ cancer undergoing treatment with neoadjuvant nivolumab, followed by nivolumab plus chemoradiation and surgery as part of the CA209-906 trial. Liquid biopsies were evaluated pre-treatment, after each of two cycles of neoadjuvant nivolumab, and after concurrent nivolumab and chemoradiation immediately prior to surgery, for an average of 4 time points per patient.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0182">For each plasma variant identified, we investigated whether these were also present in matched leukocyte DNA by deep next-generation sequencing. Variants identified in plasma and leukocyte DNA were considered germline or clonal hematopoiesis derived and further excluded from analyses. Eight of 16 patients had detectable circulating tumor-derived DNA (ctDNA) at any time point. Additionally, 13 CH-derived mutations were detected in plasma of eight patients. The number of CH-derived mutations was correlated with increasing patient age. Identification and removal of CH-derived mutations via comparison to matched leukocyte sequencing allowed for accurate assessment of kinetics of bona fide tumor-derived mutations in plasma.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0183">A representative example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, where ctDNA dynamics captured by the tumor-derived TP53 G245S mutation were concordant with tumor regression noted at the time of resection (10% residual tumor) only when germline-derived and a TP53 CH-derived variant were excluded by matched leukocyte DNA sequencing analyses.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0184">Post filtering, detectable ctDNA at the last pre-surgery time point was found in 3 patients and was associated with residual tumor&#x3e;20% (50% vs 23% with or without detectable ctDNA respectively). ctDNA clearance, that is detectable ctDNA at one or more earlier time points that subsequently becomes undetectable before surgery, occurred in 5 patients and was associated with improved pathologic response (80% of patients with ctDNA clearance had residual tumor&#x3c;=20% and no evidence of disease progression). Furthermore, of the three patients who did not have ctDNA clearance, two of them subsequently developed disease progression.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0185">In summary, our new data summarized in parts I-III above provide additional evidence on the innovative aspects and clinical utility of our matched plasma-leukocyte DNA sequencing approach that is applicable to almost every stage of the management of patients with cancer, including diagnosis, the detection of residual disease and response monitoring and spans over multiple cancer types, stages of disease and therapeutic settings.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">REFERENCES FOR EXAMPLES 3 AND 4</heading><p id="p-0163" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0186">1 Coombs, C.
