However, the present invention can be implemented in many different aspects and should not be construed as being limited to the description of the following embodiments. For the sake of clarity of explanation, although the drawings may be schematically represented with respect to widths, thicknesses, shapes, and the like of the respective portions in comparison with actual embodiments, they are merely examples and do not limit the interpretation of the present invention. In addition, in this specification and each of the drawings, the same symbols (or symbols denoted by a, b, and the like) are given to the same elements as those described above with reference to the preceding drawings, and detailed description thereof may be omitted as appropriate. Furthermore, the letters &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; to each element are convenient labels used to distinguish each element and have no further meaning unless otherwise stated.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this specification, in the case where a member or area is &#x201c;above (or below)&#x201d; another member or area, it includes not only being directly above (or below) another member or area, but also being above (or below) another member or area unless otherwise limited. i.e., including the case where other components are included in between above (or below) another member or area.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment of the present invention, a micro-LED means a chip having a size of several micrometers or more and 100 &#x3bc;m or less, and a mini-LED means a chip having a size of 100 &#x3bc;m or more. An embodiment of the present invention can use LEDs of any size and can be appropriately used depending on the screen size and pixel density of a display device.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Incidentally, the light-emitting element described in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 2016-109932, the reflection suppressing layer is formed of a diffusing material by glass beads or resin beads, and the reflection of external light on the light-emitting surface is reduced by scattering the external light, thereby causing a problem of lowering the resolution. In addition, since the light-emitting element described in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 2016-109932 is based on a configuration in which an LED chip is provided in a mold resin, there is a problem that the reflection suppressing layer cannot be applied to pixels of the display device formed by fine LED chips called a micro-LED and mini-LED. Furthermore, since the mask member is a flat plate-shaped member painted in black lacquer with no gloss, the temperature rises when exposed external light, causing the brightness of the light-emitting element (LED chip) to decrease, which is a problem. An embodiment of the present invention disclosed below will overcome these problems.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a configuration of a display device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention.

In addition, the light emitted from the active layer at a shallow angle (the light emitted in the lateral direction) is reflected by the first layer <b>121</b> of the first reflection control layer <b>120</b>, so that stray light can be reduced, and the light emitted from adjacent pixels can be prevented from being overlapped and color-mixed.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">On the other hand, the reflection of external light can be reduced by the action of the second layer <b>122</b> and the third layer <b>123</b> of the first reflection control layer <b>120</b>.

However, the light-shielding layer which merely absorbs light can reduce reflection of external light, but it becomes a problem that the light-shielding layer absorbs external light and generates heat. The energy conversion efficiency of the LED chip is about 30%, and the remaining 70% is converted into heat to generates heat. Therefore, the display device generates a certain amount of heat generation when the LED chip of each pixel is driven to display an image. In addition to this, when the light-shielding layer heats up, the temperature of the display unit becomes even higher, so that a decrease in the amount of light of the LED chip becomes a problem.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">On the other hand, since the first reflection control layer <b>120</b> does not absorb external light but acts to visually blacken by utilizing interference effect of light, so that the temperature-rise problem can be solved.
