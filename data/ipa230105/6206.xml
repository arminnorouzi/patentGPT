relates to an irreversible additive contained in a cathode material for a secondary battery that minimizes generation of impurities or gas and has excellent structural stability, a cathode material including the same, and a secondary battery including the cathode material.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0003">Due to the rapid increase in the use of fossil fuels, the demand for the use of alternative energy or clean energy is increasing, and as part thereof, the fields that are being studied most actively are the fields of power generation and power storage using electrochemistry.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Currently, a secondary battery is a representative example of an electrochemical device that utilizes such electrochemical energy, and the range of use thereof tends to be gradually expanding.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">Recently, as the technological development and demand for mobile devices such as portable computers, portable phones, and cameras increase, the demand for secondary batteries as an energy source rapidly increases. Among such secondary batteries, many studies have been conducted on a lithium secondary battery that exhibits high energy density and operating potential, have a long cycle life, and a low self-discharge rate, and also has been commercialized and widely used.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">In addition, as interest in environmental issues grows, studies are frequently conducted on an electric vehicle, a hybrid electric vehicle, etc. which can replace a vehicle using fossil fuels such as a gasoline vehicle and a diesel vehicle, which are one of the main causes of air pollution.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">Although a nickel metal hydride secondary battery is mainly used as a power source for the electric vehicle and the hybrid electric vehicle, research on the use of a lithium secondary battery having high energy density and discharge voltage is actively being conducted, a part of which are in a commercializing stage.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">Carbon materials are mainly used as an anode active material of such lithium secondary battery, and lithium transition metal composite oxide is used as a cathode active material of lithium the secondary battery. Among them, in addition to lithium cobalt composite metal oxides such as LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>having high operating voltage and excellent capacity characteristics, various lithium transition metal oxides such as LiNiO<sub>2</sub>, LiMnO<sub>2</sub>, LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>or LiFePO<sub>4 </sub>have been developed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">Meanwhile, due to the consumption of Li ions at the time of the initial charge/discharge, the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and the irreversibility of cathode and anode ions can occur.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">Consequently, the energy density is reduced, and there is a problem that the theoretical amount that can be designed cannot be sufficiently used.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">In order to solve these problems, an irreversible additive was added to the cathode material to supplement lithium ions. However, Li<sub>2</sub>NiO<sub>2</sub>, which is a commonly used irreversible additive, had an orthorhombic crystal structure and belonged to a space group of Immm. However, the above material has a problem of causing the generation of impurities or gas while undergoing three stages of structural changes in the operating voltage range after the initial charge of the secondary battery.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">Specifically, the above material maintains an orthorhombic crystal structure in the range of 3.0 to 3.5V, but depending on the de-intercalation of Li, the crystal structure changes three times to a trigonal system at 3.5 to 4.0 V and to a monoclinic system at 3.5 to 4.25 V. When such material is decomposed, it may cause some problems such as the generation of impurities and the generation of gases.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">In particular, the irreversible additive (Li<sub>2</sub>NiO<sub>2</sub>) having an orthorhombic crystal structure leads to unpredictable by-product and extra gas generation when the crystal structure is changed to a trigonal system.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">Moreover, since it causes a change in the crystal structure, there also is a problem that the structural stability is deteriorated.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">Therefore, there is an urgent need for a technique that solves the above problems and thus, does not cause generation of impurities or gas and has excellent structural stability within the operating voltage range of the secondary battery, even while sufficiently expressing Li ions at the initial charge.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0016">The present disclosure has been designed to solve the above-mentioned problems, and therefore, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide an irreversible additive that minimizes generation of impurities or gas and has excellent structural stability in the working voltage range of a secondary battery, even while providing Li ions at the initial charge to reduce irreversibility.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">It is another object of the present disclosure to provide a cathode material for a secondary battery including the irreversible additive, and a secondary battery exhibiting excellent electrochemical properties by including the same.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0018">It should be understood that the terms and wordings used herein should not be construed to be limited to general or lexical means, nor should the concepts of the terms be considered to be defining or describing the present disclosure made by the inventor(s) in the best way. Further, the terms and wordings should be constructed to have meanings and concepts that agree with the technical spirit of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">Through the following disclosure and examples, certain embodiments of an irreversible additive contained in a cathode material for a secondary battery, a cathode material including the irreversible additive, and a secondary battery including the same will be described. These particular described embodiments and examples are for illustration only and the present disclosure should not be considered to be limited to such embodiments and examples herein.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">The irreversible additive contained in a cathode material for a secondary battery according to one embodiment of the present disclosure is an oxide represented by the following chemical Formula 1, wherein the oxide has a trigonal crystal structure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Li<sub>2+a</sub>Ni<sub>1-b</sub>Mo<sub>b</sub>O<sub>2+c</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0024" num="0021">in Formula 1, &#x2212;0.2&#x2264;a&#x2264;0.2, 0&#x3c;b&#x2264;0.2, 0&#x2264;c&#x2264;0.2.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0022">In this regard, conventionally, the oxide having Formula 1 were prepared by mixing a lithium raw material and a nickel raw material, and then heat-treating the mixture.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0023">When the general raw materials were mixed and heat-treated in this way, the oxide was produced into a material having an orthorhombic crystal structure, which is the most stable form. Therefore, conventionally, an oxide having an orthorhombic crystal structure has been added as the irreversible additive.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0024">However, as a result of repeated in-depth studies, the present inventors have found that the material having the crystal structure as described above is added, impurities or gas are generated within the working voltage range of the secondary battery, and thus there is a problem that the battery performance is rapidly deteriorated as the cycle proceeds, confirmed that the above causes occur as a result of undergoing three stages of crystal structure changes as mentioned above, and found out that when the oxide represented by the chemical Formula 1 is added as a material having a trigonal crystal structure from the beginning, the trigonal and monoclinic crystal structures can be reversibly maintained according to the voltage of the secondary battery within the operating voltage range of the secondary battery.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0025">On the other hand, when the structure changes according to the voltage in the secondary battery, a trigonal crystal structure causes de-intercalation of Li ions. When the molar ratio is 1, it produces LiNiO<sub>2 </sub>and has the crystal structure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0026">However, according to the present disclosure, the irreversible additive may have a trigonal crystal structure while Li is an extra litigated oxide with a molar ratio of about twice that of the transition metal, as represented by the chemical formula 1.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0027">Furthermore, the lithium-rich irreversible additive having the trigonal crystal structure does not have an orthorhombic crystal structure which is a stable crystal structure, and subsequently, the crystal structure changes according to the voltage, so that the structural stability is deteriorated.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0028">Thus, as a result of repeated in-depth studies, the present inventors have found that when a part of Ni is doped and substituted with Mo in the irreversible additive, it is possible to enhance the structural stability, thereby further reducing by-products and increasing the stability.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0029">At this time, the Mo may dope or substitute a part of Ni in an amount of more than 0 to 20% or less on a molar basis, and specifically, the oxide may be Li<sub>2</sub>Ni<sub>0.9</sub>Mo<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0030">The irreversible additive represented by the chemical Formula 1 may belong to a space group of P3-m1, and more particularly, the crystal lattice of the oxide may be a=3.0954 &#x212b;, c=5.0700 &#x212b;, &#x3b3;=120.00&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0031">The material as above is prepared by a process in which Mo-doped LiNi<sub>1-b</sub>Mo<sub>b</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(where 0&#x3c;b&#x2264;0.2) is mixed with Li<sup>+</sup>benzophenone<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and reacted under THF to obtain a trigonal Li<sub>2</sub>Ni<sub>1-b</sub>Mo<sub>b</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(where 0&#x3c;b&#x2264;0.2) having weak crystallinity, which is then heat-treated under an inert atmosphere to obtain a trigonal Li<sub>2</sub>Ni<sub>1-b</sub>Mo<sub>b</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(where 0&#x3c;b&#x2264;0.2) having high crystallinity.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0032">The reaction under THF is specifically performed by a process in which the mixture is stirred, filtered, washed with dry THF, and then dried under vacuum.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0033">The heat treatment is performed at 200 to 400&#xb0; C. for 10 to 24 hours under an inert atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0034">The inert atmosphere may be a helium or argon atmosphere, and the heat treatment is performed while flowing the gases.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0035">Further, the preparation must be performed within the range of temperature and time during the heat treatment, thereby making it possible to improve only the crystallinity without changing the crystal structure of the trigonal Li<sub>2</sub>Ni<sub>1-b</sub>Mo<sub>b</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(where 0&#x3c;b&#x2264;0.2) formed by reacting under THF. When the temperature is too low or the time is short, the crystallinity is not sufficiently improved, and when the temperature is too high or the time is long, it may give changes in the crystal structure itself, which is not preferable.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0036">The LiNi<sub>1-b</sub>Mo<sub>b</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(where 0&#x3c;b&#x2264;0.2) can be prepared by a method of substituting Mo in a conventionally known method for producing LiNiO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0037">For example, it is prepared by mixing a lithium raw material and a nickel raw material together with a molybdenum raw material in a molar ratio satisfying the composition ratio and heat-treating the mixture.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0038">The heat treatment is performed at 650 to 800&#xb0; C. for 12 to 36 hours under an air atmosphere. In the case of wet method, a drying process may be further included.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0039">The preparation must be performed within the range of the temperature and time of the heat treatment, so that the reaction between the lithium raw material and the nickel raw material and further the molybdenum raw material can sufficiently occur, and unreacted materials can be minimized.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0040">As the lithium raw material, lithium-containing oxides, sulfates, nitrates, acetates, carbonates, oxalates, citrates, halides, hydroxides or oxyhydroxides, and the like can be used, and specific examples thereof include Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, LiNO<sub>3</sub>, LiNO<sub>2</sub>, LiOH, LiOH.H<sub>2</sub>O, LiH, LiF, LiCl, LiBr, LiI, CH<sub>3</sub>COOLi, Li<sub>2</sub>O, Li<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>COOLi, or Li<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. Any one or a mixture of two or more of them may be used.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0041">As the nickel raw material, nickel-containing oxides, sulfates, nitrates, acetates, carbonates, oxalates, citrates, halides, hydroxides or oxyhydroxides, and the like can be used, and specific examples thereof include NiO, Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, LiNiO2, NiSO<sub>4</sub>, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and the like. Any one or a mixture of two or more of them may be used.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0042">The molybdenum raw material may be a molybdenum-containing oxide.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0043">The irreversible additive of the crystal structure as above can provide sufficient Li at the initial charge with an excessive amount of lithium to solve the irreversibility problem and also reduce the stage of change in crystal structure within the operating voltage range, thereby being able to not only minimize incidental problems such as generation of impurities or gas resulting from de-intercalation of an excessive amount of Li ions, but also improve the structural stability to minimize side reactions.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0044">Meanwhile, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a cathode material including the irreversible additive and a cathode active material.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0045">In this case, the content of the irreversible additive may be 0.1% by weight to 10% by weight, more specifically 1% by weight to 5% by weight, and more specifically 1% to 3% by weight based on the total weight of the cathode material.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0046">When the content of the irreversible additive is less than 0.1% by weight outside the above range, the compensation effect of anode efficiency due to the addition of an irreversible additive cannot be obtained, and when the content exceeds 10% by weight, problems such as volume expansion of the electrode due to the generation of impurities or gas, and deterioration of life may occur.</p><p

Specifically, a porous polymer film, for example, a porous polymer film made of polyolefin-based polymers such as ethylene homopolymer, propylene homopolymer, ethylene/butene copolymer, ethylene/hexene copolymer, and ethylene/methacrylate copolymer, or a laminated structure having two or more layers thereof may be used. In addition, a conventional porous nonwoven fabric, for example, a nonwoven fabric made of high melting point glass fiber, polyethylene terephthalate fiber, or the like may also be used.
