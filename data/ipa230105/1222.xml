In degenerative diseases, the synthesis of the growth factors which enable vital functions of retina nerve cells are damaged genetically. In ischemic patients however, the blood flow and supply to retina nerve cells are damaged. In both cases, chronic and progressive visual loss is experienced and in the end legal blindness occurs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The stimulation of the retina and optical nerve electromagnetically leads to retina blood flow increase at a cellular level, increase in vascular permeability and increase of receptor sensitivity in growth factors. Simultaneous stimulation of the occipital cortex leads to an increase in neurotrophic growth factor levels in the retina. The simultaneous electromagnetic stimulation of the retina, optical nerve, optical tracts and visual cortex leads to cellular depolarization and phosphene formation. In order for all of these effects to be realized a suprathreshold electromagnetic field is required. The required suprathreshold magnetic field can be obtained by the correct positioning of electromagnetic coils, correct frequency, power, intensity and time. These effects that are reparative in retina and optical nerve diseases must be applied at certain periods and times mostly for a lifelong period in chronic diseases. Due to this reason, in order to obtain an efficient result, the patient needs to use an electromagnetic stimulator on his/her own at home continuously and correctly.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order for electromagnetic stimulation to be effective in retina and optical nerve diseases, the occipital cortex, inter-hemispherical sulcus, and the retina and optical nerves need to be stimulated at the same time. Retina and optical nerve stimulation is carried out from a vertex distance which is the most efficient distance. The vertex distance, is the closest distance to the cornea apex which does not prevent the closing of the eyelids. However the electromagnetic stimulator devices in the prior art, may cause thermal damage at a cellular level and therefore it is not possible to stimulate the eyeball, retina and optical nerve from the vertex distance. At the same time the devices of the prior art are suitable to be used under the supervision of a health personnel. The incorrect usage applied under the supervision of people who are not experts, may lead to many complications including visual loss. Some drug injections are applied in treating retina diseases. In order for these drugs to reach the retina, an iontophoresis procedure is required. In order for an iontophoresis procedure to be electromagnetically efficient the coils need to be effective simultaneously, in the same way, in the correct position and at the correct distance. In order to establish correct stimulation points and correct electrical polarization, the device needs to have a standard design. The present iontophoresis devices have effect not with an electromagnetic field but with an electric current. Electromagnetic iontophoresis is designed such that it does not contact the eye and therefore it is much safer than electrical iontophoresis devices.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The document numbered US2017165485 can be given as an example to the stimulator device in literature. In said document a device that has been developed to treat visual complaints during headaches and migraines is described. It is not possible to stimulate the eyeball, retina and optical nerves from the vertex distance with said device, it is possible to stimulate the supraorbital region at most with this device. It is not possible to reach effective suprathreshold values in the eye, during the treatment of retina and optical nerves with this device that is not indicated for treating degenerative and ischemic retina optical nerve diseases. The device does not have any cooling mechanism in order for the device to be used from the vertex distance. The device does not have a standard cap system placement design to the correct poles in order to perform electromagnetic iontophoresis. This design that has been defined with general terms according to requirements for placement of electromagnetic coils and electrodes does not have the required standard design in order to perform iontophoresis. This device does not comprise a design having the standard shape, number, distance and parameters that can apply an electromagnetic field at the vertex distance, and to establish standard poles between other electromagnetic coils.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another example is the document numbered WO2009063435. Said document is related to a sensor system which shows if the coils have been placed in the correct position on the occipital cortex during amblyopia treatment. It is not indicated for being used in treating retina and optical nerve diseases. The device does not have any cooling mechanism in order for the device to be used from the vertex distance. The device does not have a standard cap system placement design to the correct poles in order to perform electromagnetic iontophoresis. Therefore said system is not designed to stimulate the eyeball, retina and optical nerves from the vertex distance.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another example is the document numbered US2009099623. Said document is related to the treatment of medical conditions associated with the central nervous system and to increasing cognitive functions.

The stimulator and iontophoresis device (A) according to the invention basically comprises; a cap (<b>10</b>) made of two parts, one being the front cap (<b>10</b><i>a</i>) and the other being the rear cap (<b>10</b><i>b</i>) connected to each other by a connection rail (<b>11</b>) having an electromagnetic coil assembly (<b>12</b>) which enables to reach the required threshold values in order to treat retina and optical nerve diseases with very low magnetic fields, and an electronic control box (<b>20</b>) connected via the connection pipe (<b>30</b>) to the cap (<b>10</b>) having electric cables (<b>123</b>) and cooling pipes (<b>124</b>) passing therein.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0059">As it can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the cap (<b>10</b>) that is worn over the head of the patient is made of two parts being the front cap (<b>10</b><i>a</i>) and the rear cap (<b>10</b><i>b</i>) connected to each other with a connection rail (<b>11</b>) from their edges. Said front cap (<b>10</b><i>a</i>) and the rear cap (<b>10</b><i>b</i>) can be adjusted according to the diameter of the user by being brought closer or by being distanced apart via the connection rail (<b>11</b>). Therefore by means of the adjustable configuration of the cap (<b>10</b>) suitable positioning of the electromagnetic coil assembly (<b>12</b>) has been provided for all head diameters. The front cap (<b>10</b><i>a</i>) and the rear cap (<b>10</b><i>b</i>) is made of non-inflammable, antibacterial, antistatic medical plastic, carbon fibre or any other kind of medical material.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0060">The cap (<b>10</b>) comprises a total of 9 electromagnetic coil assemblies (<b>12</b>) that are fixedly embedded in order to reach the required threshold values with very low magnetic fields to treat retina and optical nerve diseases.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0061">The front cap (<b>10</b><i>a</i>) comprises 4 electromagnetic coil assemblies (<b>12</b>) that create electromagnetic fields at the vertex distance to the eyeballs and the rear cap (<b>10</b><i>b</i>) comprises a total of 5 electromagnetic coil assemblies (<b>12</b>) that are in contact with the scalp wherein 4 electromagnetic fields stimulate the occipital cortex region and 1 electromagnetic field stimulates the inter-hemispheric region.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0062">The sections besides the electromagnetic coil assembly (<b>12</b>) at the inner surfaces of the front cap (<b>10</b><i>a</i>) and the rear cap (<b>10</b><i>b</i>) are covered with a smart medical sponge rubber (<b>13</b>) that is non-inflammable, biocompatible, antiallergic and antibacterial. Said smart sponge rubber (<b>13</b>) enables the electromagnetic coil assemblies (<b>12</b>) to remain in the correct position during usage.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0063">The electromagnetic coil assembly (<b>12</b>) illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, is generally formed of an electromagnetic coil (<b>121</b>) and a cooling cage (<b>122</b>). Said electromagnetic coils (<b>121</b>) have polygonal form, which enables at least 2 electromagnetic coils (<b>121</b>), which stimulate an eyeball, to contact each other with a large surface area and which enables the two electromagnetic coils (<b>121</b>) that are in contact with each other to form a magnetic effective field that reaches the retina and optical nerve depth continuously from a vertex distance. The vertex distance is the distance which does not prevent the closing of the eyelids and which is the distance closest to the cornea apex. Therefore the electromagnetic coils (<b>121</b>) can affect the eyeball completely at the magnetic field depth without touching the eye. Therefore the placement of the electromagnetic coil assemblies (<b>12</b>) in the cap (<b>10</b>), the distance of the coils to each other, the polygonal structure and the intensity of the magnetic field allow the formation of suitable poles for iontophoresis. The arrangement of the electrical connections of the electromagnetic coils (<b>121</b>) are arranged in the front cap (<b>10</b><i>a</i>) and the rear cap (<b>10</b><i>b</i>) in order to form a standard and correct polarization on the cap (<b>10</b>); such that random placement is not allowed.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0064">LED indicators (<b>1211</b>) and magnetic field sensors (<b>1222</b>) are provided on each of the electromagnetic coils (<b>121</b>). Therefore the tracking of active and passive electromagnetic coils (<b>121</b>) have been enabled. The magnetic field sensors (<b>1222</b>) enable the transmission of the magnetic field formed, when the electromagnetic coil (<b>121</b>) is active onto the screen (<b>24</b>) of the electronic control box (<b>20</b>). As a result when the stimulator device (A) is active, by which electromagnetic coil (<b>121</b>) the amount of magnetic field is created and if this field is correct or not can be tracked during the duration of the treatment process.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0065">The electromagnetic coils (<b>121</b>) receive their power from the power supply (<b>27</b>) in the electronic control box (<b>20</b>) to which it is connected via electrical cables (<b>123</b>). Said power supply (<b>27</b>) can be an adapter and/or battery-accumulator that operates directly with the electric network. If the stimulator and iontophoresis device (A) is operated with electricity, the battery-accumulator steps in order not to delay the treatment time and the battery-accumulator percentage can be seen on the screen (<b>27</b>).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0066">In order to prevent thermal damage risk at the cellular level that may be encountered due to electromagnetic coils (<b>121</b>), a cooling cage (<b>122</b>) has been covered over each electromagnetic coil (<b>121</b>). The cooling cages (<b>122</b>) are made of fibreglass, fibre carbon or any kind of other medical material, formed as two layered hollow impermeable boxes. Each cooling cage (<b>122</b>) has a cooling tank (<b>1221</b>) which allows gas circulation therein, and a gas outlet hole (<b>1222</b>) and a gas inlet hole (<b>1223</b>) allowing the entrance and discharging of the cooling gas. The cooling compressor (<b>22</b>) in the electronic control box (<b>20</b>) and the elastic cooling pipes (<b>124</b>) extending from the gas perfluorocarbon tank (<b>23</b>) pass through each cooling cage (<b>122</b>) and allow the gas to be pumped into the cooling tank (<b>1221</b>) via the gas inlet hole (<b>1222</b>). The cooling gas exiting out of the cooling tank (<b>1221</b>) via the gas outlet hole (<b>1223</b>) cools the next cooling tank (<b>1221</b>) and then returns to the cooling compressor (<b>22</b>) and the cooling tank (<b>1221</b>) by recirculation.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0067">The electric cables (<b>123</b>) connected to the electromagnetic coils (<b>121</b>) have been isolated below the cooling cage (<b>122</b>) and the cooling pipes (<b>124</b>) used in the cooling process is isolated under sponge rubber (<b>13</b>). Although said electric cables (<b>123</b>) and cooling pipes (<b>124</b>) pass through the connection rails (<b>11</b>), they are formed as an accordion such that they can be extended or shortened. This ensures adjustment ease for each head diameter.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0068">As it can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the electronic control box (<b>20</b>) connected to the cap (<b>10</b>) via the electric cables (<b>123</b>) passing through the connection pipe (<b>30</b>), includes an electronic card and a processor (<b>21</b>) which adjusts the electromagnetic field intensity, frequency and time created by the electromagnetic coils (<b>121</b>). These parameters cannot be changed by the patient in order for the stimulator device (A) to be used safely and efficiently at home, alone by the patient. The patient can only control the on/off button (<b>28</b>). When the on/off button (<b>28</b>) is pressed, as standard, the stimulator device (A) creates 2000 milligauss electromagnetic field for 30 minutes at 42 hertz frequency from each electromagnetic coil (<b>121</b>). These parameters are the average suprathreshold values that are obtained following clinical trials. The determined frequency and electromagnetic field intensity in order to carry out effective electromagnetic iontophoresis, has been fixed and it cannot be changed by the patient.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0069">In the case that the doctor following up the patient desires to conduct changes in the parameters with an aim besides performing electromagnetic iontophoresis, the technical staff can adjust the magnetic field intensity, frequency and time and which electromagnetic coil (<b>121</b>) needs to be passive-active. This adjustment is carried out by USB or WIRELESS connections or a password entered via the control panel (<b>26</b>) located inside the electronic control box (<b>20</b>).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0070">By means of the counter (<b>211</b>) located on the electronic card and processor (<b>21</b>), the usage frequency of the stimulator device (A) by the patient and compatibility with treatment can be monitored by the doctor that is following up the patient.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0071">The cooling compressor (<b>20</b>) and the gas perfluorocarbon tank (<b>23</b>) in the electronic control box (<b>20</b>) step in as soon as the stimulator device (A) creates an electromagnetic field and the electromagnetic coils (<b>121</b>) are cooled during the operation of the stimulator device (A) via the cooling cages (<b>122</b>) with +4&#xb0; C. gas perfluorocarbon circulation. This cooling degree can be changed via the control panel (<b>26</b>) by the technical staff following the request of the doctor.

Thereby the audio guidance of the patient is provided with the speaker (<b>25</b>) following the detection by the magnetic field sensors (<b>1212</b>) connected to the electronic card and processor (<b>21</b>) that determine if the front cap (<b>10</b><i>a</i>) is at a vertex distance to the eyeball or not, and if the electromagnetic coil assemblies (<b>12</b>) at the rear cap (<b>10</b><i>b</i>) are at the correct contact distance symmetrically to the occipital cortex and inter-hemispheric regions. At the same time the starting of the treatment, ending of the treatment and remaining time are vocally notified to the patient via the speaker (<b>25</b>).
