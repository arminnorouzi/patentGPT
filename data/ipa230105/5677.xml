No. 17/177,983, filed Feb. 17, 2021, which claims priority to European Patent Application Number EP20166517.1, filed Mar. 27, 2020, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties herein.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the field of switch assemblies. Such switch assemblies can be used for example in a vehicle such as on a dashboard and/or on any control panel.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Switches, buttons or controls are widely used, for example for using electronic appliances at home, in the industry or in a vehicle. In particular, car dashboards are usually provided with switches in order to trigger safety or comfort functions, such as headlights, windshield wipers, air conditioning or to interact with multimedia functions of the car infotainment system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Among switch assemblies currently used in vehicles, capacitive switches detect a contact between the finger of a user and a touch-sensitive surface of the switch. However, these capacitive switches do not provide haptic feedback and are not always appreciated for this reason.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Toggle switches have the advantage of providing a haptic feedback. Further, several actions can be triggered and/or selected with a single toggle switch. An example of a toggle switch is described in document DE9421644U1. However, such a toggle switch has the disadvantage that a space must exist between the top cap, which is pressed by a user, and a cover surrounding the top cap, such as a cover surface of the dashboard or the control panel. Such a space may allow dust and particles to penetrate the inside of the toggle switch and does not provide for a high level of perceived quality.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Consequently, the present disclosure relates to a switch assembly providing a haptic feedback with a minimal space between a top cap of the switch assembly and a cover surrounding the top cap.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure concerns a switch assembly including: a socket, a top cap and an intermediate cart located in the socket, wherein: the intermediate cart is slidable with regard to the socket, the top cap is in a spherical or pivot engagement with the intermediate cart, and wherein an activation force of the sliding movement is lower than an activation force of the pivot movement.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Consequently, a pressure on the top cap is first transmitted to the intermediate cart and the top cap and the intermediate cart both translate along a first axis. Then, an increased pressure may trigger the pivot movement or rotation movement of the top cap around a second axis.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This switch assembly allows to trigger at least one function while requiring only a tiny gap between the top cap and a cover, for example located flush or at least surrounding the top cap. This tiny gap limits the dust entering the switch assembly and provides a more attractive appearance of the switch assembly and a higher perceived quality.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In aspects, the switch assembly has at least one intermediate contactor which is activated by the pivot movement of the top cap.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In aspects, the at least one intermediate contactor is located between the top cap and the intermediate cart, the at least one intermediate contactor defining at least part of the activation force of the pivot or spherical movement. This embodiment provides a cost-efficient and visually attractive switch assembly.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In aspects, the socket has a bottom surface and at least one elastic member arranged between the intermediate cart and the bottom surface, the at least one elastic member defining at least part of the activation force of the sliding movement.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In aspects, the elastic member brings back the top cap from the switch position (after the translation movement) to the initial position or rest position.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In aspects, the switch assembly has at least one bottom contactor which is activated by the sliding movement of the intermediate cart. This bottom contactor allows to perform another action or trigger another function with the same switch assembly.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In aspects, the at least one elastic member is or includes the at least one bottom contactor. The contactor may be electrically connected if a double action (i.e. with two clicks) switch assembly is required or not electrically connected if only a single action (i.e. with one click) switch assembly is required. Alternatively or in combination, elastic elements or one or several spring members may be used to generate the appropriate activation forces and/or provide the appropriate haptic feedback.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In aspects, the intermediate cart is slidable with regard the socket along a first axis, which allows a smooth translation movement. For example, the top cap may be substantially planar and this first axis may be orthogonal to the top cap.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In aspects, the top cap is in a pivot engagement with the intermediate cart around a second axis, or in a spherical engagement with the intermediate cart along two second axes. Preferably the second axis or the second axes are orthogonal to the first axis, for example a plan parallel to the top cap.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In aspects, the top cap includes at least a first pushing surface and a second pushing surface and the at least one intermediate contactor is aligned with the first pushing surface along a third axis parallel to the first axis. Such a switch assembly is reliable, provides a smooth activation of the intermediate contactor and can control several functions through several different interactions.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In aspects, the at least one bottom contactor is aligned with the second pushing surface along the first axis, or with the second pushing surface along the first axis, in order to provide a natural activation of the switch assembly.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In aspects, the top cap includes a third pushing surface and the switch assembly includes at least another intermediate contactor aligned with the third pushing surface along a fourth axis parallel to and offset from the third axis. This switch assembly allows to intuitively command multiple functions. For example, the first pushing surface and the third pushing surface are located on both sides of the second axis and/or on both sides of the second pushing surface.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In aspects, at least one of the pushing surfaces of the top cap are provided with a touch sensor that can detect a contact, for example with a user or a user's finger. Preferably, each of the pushing surfaces of the top cap are provided with a touch sensor. This switch assembly allows to intuitively command multiple functions.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In aspects, the switch assembly includes a pusher located between the top cap and the at least one intermediate contactor, in order to transfer a pressure from the top cap to the intermediate contactor. This pusher provides a stable transfer of a pressure between the top cap and the intermediate contactor and a smooth activation of the switch assembly.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A second aspect of the disclosure concerns a switch assembly including: an intermediate cart translating along a first axis according to a push activation force; at least one intermediate contactor fixed to the intermediate cart; a top cap rocking or pivoting around a second axis with regard to the intermediate cart and triggering the at least one intermediate contactor, wherein when a pressure is applied on the top cap, the top cap and the intermediate cart first translate along the first axis and then the top cap rocks around the second axis.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">This switch assembly according to the second aspect of the present invention may have all the features of the switch assembly according to the first aspect of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In particular, the push activation force may be lower than the rocker activation force. Alternatively or in combination, guiding means may prevent the rocking movement as long as the translation movement is not completed.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A third aspect of the present invention is a car infotainment system including a processing system and a switch assembly according to any of the first aspect or the second aspect of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In aspects, the switch assembly is configured to send a rocker signal upon activation of the intermediate contactor and the processing system is programmed so that a predetermined action is selected or triggered by said rocker signal.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In aspects, the switch assembly is configured to send a push signal upon activation of the bottom contactor and the processing system is programmed so that a predetermined action is selected or triggered by said rocker signal.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In aspects, the switch assembly is configured to send a touch signal upon activation of the touch sensor and wherein the processing system is programmed so that a predetermined action is selected by said touch signal.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In aspects, the switch assembly send: a rocker signal upon activation of the intermediate contactor, a push signal upon activation of the bottom contactor, and a touch signal upon activation of the touch sensor; wherein the processing system is programmed so that a predetermined action or function is selected by said touch signal and triggered by the push signal and/or the rocker signal. Such a car infotainment system provides a simple and intuitive operation and a high perceived quality.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A fourth aspect of the present invention is a vehicle integrating the switch assembly according to any of the first or second aspect of the invention and/or a car infotainment system according to the third aspect of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Other features and purposes of the disclosure will become more explicit by means of reading the detailed statement of the non-restrictive embodiments made with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a top view of a switch assembly according to an example of the present invention, i.e. as viewed by the user.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a side, cross-section view of the switch assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in a rest or initial position.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a side, cross-section view of the switch assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> in a switch position.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a side, cross-section view of the switch assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in a tilted position.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a top view of a switch assembly according to another example of the present invention, i.e. as viewed by the user.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a side, cross-section view of the switch assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> in a rest or initial position.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a side, cross-section view of the switch assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> in a switch position.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a side, cross-section view of the switch assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> in a tilted position.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a side, cross-section view of the switch assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> in a switch position.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present invention relates to a switch assembly that can be implemented in all kinds of electronic panels, consoles and appliances, such as household appliances, portable electronics, TV and video games, as well as in private, utility, industrial or military vehicles, construction machines, ships, aircraft or industrial systems.
