More particularly, the present invention relates to a production method for an organoid, a medium, an organoid, an evaluation method for a test substance, and a chimeric FGF. Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2019-226710, filed Dec. 16, 2019, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">An organoid is a mass of cultured cells formed as cells accumulate, and has a structure and functions similar to those of an organ in a living body. In recent years, studies have been actively conducted to produce various organoids from stem cells such as somatic stem cells, embryonic stem cells (ES cells), and artificial pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), and for example, brain organoids, intestinal organoids, liver organoids, kidney organoids, gastric organoids, lung organoids, ovarian cancer organoids, and biliary tract cancer organoids have been produced.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The production of organoids from stem cells has been carried out by controlling signaling pathways and inducing proliferation, differentiation, and the like of stem cells. The MAPK signaling pathway is known to be a signaling pathway that controls proliferation, growth, differentiation, and transformation of stem cells, apoptosis, and the like. Furthermore, it is known that the MAPK signaling pathway is down-regulated by growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2, FGF2) and epidermal growth factor (Epidermal Growth Factor, EGF). These growth factors are components that are usually added to a medium for producing organoids from stem cells (see Patent Document 1 and Non-Patent Document 1).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="2">[Patent Document 1]</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">European Patent Application, Publication No. 3460042</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Non-Patent Document</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="2">[Non-Patent Document 1]</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0005">Huch M., et al., Long-term culture of genome-stable bipotent stem cells from adult human liver, Cell, 160 (1-2), 299-312, 2015.</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the production of organoids from stem cells, it is necessary to exchange the medium regularly during cell culture because the medium components become inactivated. Particularly, when organoids are used for regenerative medicine, drug screening, and the like, organoids of sufficient sizes are required, and the number of times the medium needs to be exchanged also increases accordingly. On the other hand, growth factors such as FGF2 and EGF are very expensive and have a risk of containing endotoxin and the like. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the amount of growth factors that are added to the medium. Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a technology for producing organoids by which the content of the growth factors to be included in a medium can be reduced.</p><heading

however, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the following embodiments.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Unless stated otherwise, regarding each component mentioned as an exemplary example in the present specification, for example, a component included in a medium or a component used in each step, one kind thereof may be used alone, or two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the present specification, the notation representing a numerical value range such as &#x201c;A to B&#x201d; is synonymous with &#x201c;A or greater and B or less&#x201d; and implies that A and B are included in the numerical value range.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the present specification, the terms &#x201c;medium including substance X&#x201d; and &#x201c;in the presence of substance X&#x201d; mean a medium to which an exogenous substance X has been added, a medium including an exogenous substance X, or in the presence of an exogenous substance X. That is, when a cell or tissue present in the medium expresses, secretes, or produces the substance X endogenously, the endogenous substance X is distinguished from the exogenous substance X, and it is to be noted that a medium which does not include the exogenous substance X does not fall under the category of &#x201c;medium including substance X&#x201d; even when the medium includes the endogenous substance X.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">[Production Method for Organoid]</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">One embodiment is a production method for an organoid, the production method including: a step of culturing adult stem cells or a cell tissue piece including adult stem cells in a medium containing a chimeric FGF (hereinafter, also referred to as &#x201c;FGFC&#x201d;) that includes a partial region of Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1 and a partial region of FGF2.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to the production method of the present embodiment, the content of growth factors to be added to the medium in the production of an organoid can be reduced. The production method of the present embodiment is particularly suitable for producing organoids such as intestinal organoids, liver organoids, ovarian cancer organoids, lung organoids, and gastric organoids.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">With regard to the production of an organoid, the reason why the content of growth factors included in a medium could be reduced by incorporating a chimeric FGF in the medium is presumed to be as follows. That is, it is known that FGF has a fixed fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) that reacts with FGF, and there are seven types including isoforms. It is speculated that by chimerizing FGF, the chimeric forms are enabled to react with many types of FGFR, and as a result, cells could be cultured even at a low concentration. Particularly, epithelial stem cells, which are important for culturing adult stem cells, are said to highly express FGFR2b; however, FGF2 does not have good reactivity with FGFR2b. On the other hand, it is known that FGF1 can react with all seven types of FGFR including FGFR2b, and it is speculated that FGFC having the properties of both FGF2 and FGF1 can react with FGFR2b, and as a result, the cells could be cultured even at a low concentration.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Adult stem cells are stem cells which are also called somatic stem cells, tissue stem cells, and cancer stem cells, and are cells that are present in the body of a living body and have not undergone terminal differentiation.
