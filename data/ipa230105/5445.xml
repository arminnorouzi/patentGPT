id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A transistor whose channel region includes an oxide semiconductor is used as a pull down transistor. The band gap of the oxide semiconductor is 2.0 eV or more, preferably 2.5 eV or more, more preferably 3.0 eV or more. Thus, hot carrier degradation in the transistor can be suppressed. Accordingly, the circuit size of the semiconductor device including the pull down transistor can be made small. Further, a gate of a pull up transistor is made to be in a floating state by switching of onion of the transistor whose channel region includes an oxide semiconductor. Note that when the oxide semiconductor is highly purified, the off-state current of the transistor can be 1 aA/&#x3bc;m (1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;18 </sup>A/&#x3bc;m) or less. Therefore, the drive capability of the semiconductor device can be improved.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="51.48mm" wi="114.47mm" file="US20230005446A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="189.57mm" wi="139.78mm" file="US20230005446A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="189.65mm" wi="145.71mm" file="US20230005446A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="194.39mm" wi="145.71mm" file="US20230005446A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="193.55mm" wi="149.35mm" file="US20230005446A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="221.66mm" wi="134.96mm" file="US20230005446A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="222.50mm" wi="132.08mm" file="US20230005446A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="169.76mm" wi="141.48mm" file="US20230005446A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="164.76mm" wi="134.54mm" file="US20230005446A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="196.26mm" wi="141.39mm" file="US20230005446A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="166.12mm" wi="144.27mm" file="US20230005446A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-D00011" he="233.60mm" wi="145.71mm" file="US20230005446A1-20230105-D00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-D00012" he="221.91mm" wi="143.34mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230005446A1-20230105-D00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00013" num="00013"><img id="EMI-D00013" he="233.17mm" wi="132.00mm" file="US20230005446A1-20230105-D00013.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00014" num="00014"><img id="EMI-D00014" he="197.70mm" wi="147.83mm" file="US20230005446A1-20230105-D00014.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00015" num="00015"><img id="EMI-D00015" he="228.01mm" wi="151.81mm" file="US20230005446A1-20230105-D00015.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00016" num="00016"><img id="EMI-D00016" he="230.12mm" wi="146.81mm" file="US20230005446A1-20230105-D00016.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser.

For example, one embodiment of the present invention relates to liquid crystal display devices. One of the technical fields relates to display devices in which images are displayed when pixels are selected by gate signal lines and source signal lines. Further, one of the technical fields relates to semiconductor devices such as driver circuits used in display devices and electronic devices including display devices.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Gate driver circuits including amorphous silicon transistors (also referred to as a-Si TFTs) have been developed. Such a gate driver circuit has a problem of malfunctions due to a shift in the threshold voltage of a transistor for keeping the potential of a gate line low (at an L level) (such a transistor is also referred to as a pull down transistor). In order to solve this problem, a gate driver circuit in which a pull down transistor is repeatedly turned on and off in a period during which the potential of a gate line is kept low has been disclosed (see References 1 and 2, for example). With such a gate driver circuit, a period during which the pull down transistor is on can be shortened; thus, deterioration of the pull down transistor can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, the gate driver circuit including amorphous silicon transistors includes a transistor for controlling timing of outputting high voltage to the gate line (such a transistor is also referred to as a pull up transistor). One of a source and a drain of the pull up transistor is connected to a clock signal line. The other of the source and the drain of the pull up transistor is connected to a gate signal line. A driving method by which the potential of a gate of the pull up transistor is made higher than the high (H-level) potential of a clock signal by capacitive coupling is employed. In order to realize the driving method, it is necessary to make the gate of the pull up transistor be in a floating state. Thus, it is necessary to turn off all the transistors that are connected to the gate of the pull up transistor.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">REFERENCE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">[Reference 1] Japanese Published Patent Application No. 2007-207413</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0006">[Reference 2] Japanese Published Patent Application No. 2008-009393</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0007">In a conventional technique, in order that a pull down transistor may be repeatedly turned on and off, a circuit for controlling the on-off of the pull down transistor is needed. Thus, there is a limit to the decrease in the circuit size of a semiconductor device. In addition, even when all the transistors that are connected to a gate of the pull up transistor are turned off, electrical charges accumulated in the gate of the pull up transistor are lost due to the off-state current of the transistor as time passes. Therefore, it is difficult to lower the drive frequency of a semiconductor device such as a gate driver circuit. Further, the range of drive frequency at which the semiconductor device can operate is narrowed. Accordingly, there is a limit to improvement in the drive capability of the semiconductor device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0008">In view of the foregoing problems, an object of one embodiment of the present invention is to make the circuit size of a semiconductor device small.

That is, carriers (electrons) in the oxide semiconductor are not easily accelerated. Therefore, in the transistor whose channel region includes the oxide semiconductor, fluctuations in the threshold voltage of the transistor due to injection of carriers (electrons) into a gate insulating layer (so-called hot carrier degradation) can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0011">Further, the number of carriers in the transistor whose channel region includes the oxide semiconductor is extremely small.

Further, in the period B, a potential difference between the gate and the source of the transistor <b>101</b> (V<sub>gs</sub>) can be increased, so that the rise time of V<b>112</b> can be shortened.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0060">Note that in a conventional semiconductor device, the subthreshold swing of a transistor is large.

Further, the problems of the conventional semiconductor device are as follows. The length of the period A needs to be made longer; thus, it is difficult to raise drive frequency. The rise time of V<b>112</b> is long (the rise time of an output signal is long). A load which can be connected to the wiring <b>112</b> is decreased. The channel width of the transistor <b>101</b> is increased.

Thus, the amount of electrical charges that are lost from the node <b>11</b> as time passes is large. Further, the problems of the conventional semiconductor device are as follows. The potential of the node <b>11</b> is decreased. The time during which the potential of the node <b>11</b> can be kept higher than a potential at which the transistor <b>101</b> is turned on is short. It is difficult to lower drive frequency.

That is, the time during which the potential of the node <b>11</b> can be kept higher than the potential at which the transistor <b>101</b> is turned on can be extended. Accordingly, the drive frequency can be lowered thus, the range of drive frequency at which the semiconductor device can operate can be broadened.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0064">Note that in the conventional semiconductor device, the transistor easily deteriorates and the amount of shifts in the threshold voltage of the transistor is large. Thus, the transistor is driven so as to be repeatedly turned on and off. Further, the problems of the conventional semiconductor device are as follows. Two transistors are connected in parallel and are alternately turned on. A circuit for controlling the on-off of the transistors is complicated. The number of transistors is increased. In order to suppress deterioration of the transistors, it is necessary to make the channel widths of the transistors large. Further, in order to suppress deterioration of the transistors, it is necessary to make the channel lengths of the transistors long.

Here, a high-density plasma apparatus refers to an apparatus which can realize a plasma density of 1&#xd7;10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or higher. For example, plasma is generated by application of a microwave power of 3 to 6 kW so that an insulating layer is formed. Since the insulating layer formed using the high-density plasma apparatus can have a uniform thickness, the insulating layer has excellent step coverage. Further, as for the insulating layer formed using the high-density plasma apparatus, the thickness of a thin film can be controlled precisely.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0104">The film quality of the insulating layer formed using the high-density apparatus is greatly different from that of an insulating layer formed using a conventional parallel plate PCVD apparatus. The etching rate of the insulating layer formed using the high-density plasma apparatus is lower than that of the insulating layer formed using the conventional parallel plate PCVD apparatus by 10% or more or 20% or more in the case where the etching rates with the same etchant are compared to each other.

Thus, the gate insulating layer (GI) which is in contact with the highly purified oxide semiconductor needs high quality. Therefore, high-density plasma-enhanced CVD using microwaves (2.45 GHz) is preferable because a dense high-quality insulating layer having high withstand voltage can be formed. This is because when the highly purified oxide semiconductor is closely in contact with the high-quality gate insulating layer, the interface state can be reduced and interface properties can be favorable. It is important that the gate insulating layer have lower interface state density with an oxide semiconductor and a favorable interface as well as having favorable film quality as a gate insulating layer.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0106">Then, an oxide semiconductor film <b>430</b> is formed to a thickness of 2 to 200 nm over the gate insulating layer <b>402</b>.

Note that it is preferable that pulsed direct-current (DC) power be used because powdery substances generated in deposition can be reduced and the film thickness can be uniform. The thickness of an In-Ga-Zn-O-based film is 5 to 200 nm. In this embodiment, as the oxide semiconductor film, a 20-nm-thick In-Ga-Zn-O-based film is deposited by sputtering with the use of an In-Ga-Zn-O-based metal oxide target.

Here, after the substrate is put in an electric furnace which is a kind of heat treatment apparatus and heat treatment is performed on the oxide semiconductor layer at 450&#xb0; C. for one hour in a nitrogen atmosphere, water and hydrogen are prevented from being mixed into the oxide semiconductor layer by preventing the substrate from being exposed to the air; thus, oxide semiconductor layer <b>431</b> is obtained (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0109">Note that the heat treatment apparatus is not limited to an electric furnace, and may be provided with a device for heating an object to be processed by thermal conduction or thermal radiation from a heater such as a resistance heater.

LRTA apparatus is an apparatus for heating an object to he processed by radiation of light (an electromagnetic wave) emitted from a lamp such as a halogen lamp, a metal halide lamp, a xenon arc lamp, a carbon arc lamp, a high pressure sodium lamp, or a high pressure mercury lamp.

A resist mask formed using a multi-tone mask has a plurality of thicknesses and can be changed in shape by ashing; therefore, the resist mask can be used in a plurality of etching processes for processing films into different patterns. Therefore, a resist mask corresponding to at least two or more kinds of different patterns can be formed by one multi-tone mask. Thus, the number of exposure masks and the number of corresponding photolithography processes can be reduced, so that the process can be simplified.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0123">Next, plasma treatment is performed using a gas such as nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), or argon (Ar). With this plasma treatment, absorbed water and the like which attach to a surface of the oxide semiconductor layer exposed are removed. Alternatively, plasma treatment may be performed using a mixture gas of oxygen and argon.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0124">After the plasma treatment, an oxide insulating layer <b>416</b> which serves as a protective insulating film and is in contact with part of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>431</b> is formed without exposure to the air.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0125">The oxide insulating layer <b>416</b> can be formed to have a thickness of at least 1 nm or more by a method by which an impurity such as water or hydrogen is not mixed into the oxide insulating layer <b>416</b>, such as sputtering, as appropriate. When hydrogen, is contained in the oxide insulating layer <b>416</b>, hydrogen enters the oxide semiconductor layer, so a backchannel of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>431</b> has lower resistance (has n-type conductivity) and a parasitic channel is formed. Therefore, it is important that a deposition method in which hydrogen is not used be employed in order that the oxide insulating layer <b>416</b> contain as little hydrogen as possible.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0126">In this embodiment, a 200-nm-thick silicon oxide film is deposited as the oxide insulating layer <b>416</b> by sputtering. The substrate temperature at the time of deposition is in the range of from room temperature to 300&#xb0; C., and 100&#xb0; C. in this embodiment. The silicon oxide film can be deposited by sputtering in a rare gas (typically argon) atmosphere, an oxygen atmosphere, or an atmosphere including a rare gas (typically argon) and oxygen. Further, a silicon oxide target or a silicon target can be used as a target. For example, a silicon oxide film can be deposited using a silicon target in an atmosphere including oxygen and nitrogen by sputtering.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0127">Next, second heat treatment (preferably at 200 to 400&#xb0; C., for example, 250 to 350&#xb0; C.) is performed in an inert gas atmosphere, a dry air atmosphere, or an oxygen gas atmosphere. For example, the second heat treatment is performed at 250&#xb0; C. for one hour in a nitrogen atmosphere. Through the second heat treatment, part of the oxide semiconductor layer (a channel region) is heated while being in contact with the oxide insulating layer <b>416</b>. Thus, oxygen is supplied to the part of the oxide semiconductor layer (the channel region).</p><p id="p-0128" num="0128">Through the above steps, after the heat treatment for dehydration or dehydrogenation is performed on the oxide semiconductor layer, the part of the oxide semiconductor layer (the channel region) is selectively made to be in an oxygen excess state. Through the steps, the transistor <b>410</b> is formed.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0129">Further, heat treatment may be performed at 100 to 200&#xb0; C. for 1 to 30 hours in an air atmosphere. In this embodiment, the heat treatment is performed at 150&#xb0; C. for 10 hours. This heat treatment may be performed at a fixed heating temperature. Alternatively, the following change in the heating temperature may be conducted plural times repeatedly: the heating temperature is increased from room temperature to a temperature of 100 to 200&#xb0; C. and then decreased to room temperature.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0130">A protective insulating layer may be formed over the oxide insulating layer <b>416</b>. For example, a silicon nitride film is formed by RF sputtering. Since RF sputtering has high productivity, it is preferably used as a deposition method of the protective insulating layer. The protective insulating layer is formed using an inorganic insulating film which does not contain an impurity such as moisture, a hydrogen ion, and OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and blocks entry of such an impurity from the outside, typically a silicon nitride film, an aluminum nitride film, a silicon nitride oxide film, or an aluminum oxynitride film. In this embodiment, as the protective insulating layer, a protective insulating layer <b>403</b> is formed using a silicon nitride film (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0131">In this embodiment, the oxide semiconductor layer of the transistor <b>410</b> is an intrinsic (i-type) or substantially intrinsic oxide semiconductor layer obtained by removal of hydrogen, which is an n-type impurity, from the oxide semiconductor and the increase in purity so that an impurity other than the main components of the oxide semiconductor is not included as much as possible. In other words, the oxide semiconductor layer of the transistor <b>410</b> is a highly purified intrinsic (i-type) semiconductor layer or a semiconductor layer which is close to a highly purified i-type semiconductor layer not by addition of an impurity but by removal of an impurity such as hydrogen or water as much as possible. In this manner, the Fermi level (E<sub>i</sub>) can be equal to the intrinsic Fermi level (E<sub>i</sub>).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0132">It is said that the band gap (E<sub>g</sub>) of the oxide semiconductor is 3.15 eV and electron affinity (&#x3c7;) is 4.3 eV. The work function of titanium (Ti) used for the source electrode layer and the drain electrode layer is substantially equal to the electron affinity (&#x3c7;) of the oxide semiconductor. In this case, the Schottky electron barrier is not formed at an interface between the metal and the oxide semiconductor.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0133">For example, even in the case of a transistor whose channel width W is 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>&#x3bc;m and whose channel length L is 3 &#x3bc;m, off-state current at room temperature can be 10<sup>&#x2212;13 </sup>A or less and a subthreshold swing can be 0.1 V/decade (the thickness of the gate insulating layer is 100 nm).</p><p id="p-0134" num="0134">By the increase in purity so that an impurity other than the main components of the oxide semiconductor is not included as much as possible in this manner, the transistor <b>410</b> can operate favorably.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0135">In order to prevent variation in electrical characteristics of the oxide semiconductor, an impurity that causes the variation, such as hydrogen, moisture, a hydroxyl group, or hydride (also referred to as a hydrogen compound), is intentionally removed. Additionally, the oxide semiconductor becomes a highly purified electrically i-type (intrinsic) oxide semiconductor by supply of oxygen which is a main component of the oxide semiconductor that is simultaneously reduced in a step of removing the impurity.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0136">Therefore, it is preferable that the amount of hydrogen in the oxide semiconductor be as small as possible. Further, the number of carriers in the highly purified oxide semiconductor is significantly small (close to zero), and the carrier density is lower than 1&#xd7;10<sup>12</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably 1&#xd7;10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or lower. That is, the carrier density of the oxide semiconductor layer can be extremely close to zero. Since the number of carriers in the oxide semiconductor layer is significantly small, the off-state current of the transistor can be reduced. It is preferable that the off-state current be as low as possible. The amount of current per micrometer of the channel width (W) in the transistor is 100 aA or less, preferably 10 zA (zepto-ampere)&#x3bc;m or less, more preferably 1 zA/&#x3bc;m or less. Further, the transistor has no pn junction and does not deteriorate due to hot carriers; thus, the electrical characteristics of the transistor are not adversely affected.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0137">In a transistor whose channel region includes an oxide semiconductor which is highly purified by drastic removal of hydrogen contained in an oxide semiconductor layer as described above, the amount of off-state current can be significantly reduced. In other words, in circuit design, the oxide semiconductor layer can be regarded as an insulator when the transistor is off. In contrast, it can be estimated that the oxide semiconductor layer has better current supply capability than a semiconductor layer including amorphous silicon when the transistor is on.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0138">A transistor including low-temperature polysilicon is designed on the assumption that off-state current is about 10000 times that of a transistor including an oxide semiconductor. Therefore, in the case where the transistor including an oxide semiconductor is compared with the transistor including low-temperature polysilicon, the voltage hold time of the transistor including an oxide semiconductor can be extended about 10000 times when storage capacitances are equal or substantially equal to each other (about 0.1 pF). For example, when moving images are displayed at 60 fps. the hold time for one signal writing can be approximately 160 seconds, which is 10000 times that of the transistor including low-temperature polysilicon. In this manner, still images can be displayed on a display portion even by less frequent writing of image signals.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Embodiment 4</heading><p id="p-0139" num="0139">In this embodiment, an example of a display device which is one embodiment of the present invention is described.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0140"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> illustrates an example of a display device including the shift register circuit in Embodiment 2.
