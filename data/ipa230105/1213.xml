No. 15/073,294, which was filed on 17 Mar. 2016, the complete subject matter of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention relate to medical apparatus and methods. More specifically, the present invention relates to systems and methods for manufacturing a header assembly of an implantable electronic device such as an implantable pulse generator or implantable cardiac monitor.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Implantable electronic devices (IEDs) include pulse generators (IPGs) such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), which are used in the treatment of cardiac conditions, and neuromodulators or neurostimulators, which are used in chronic pain management or the actuation and control of other body systems. These IPGs commonly include a housing, feedthrus, and a connector assembly that is enclosed in a header and includes many internal electrically conductive components such as, for example, wires, ribbon, antennas, blocks, rings, etc. Electrical stimulation originating in the housing is led to the connector assembly through feedthrus. The connector assembly serves to transmit electrical signals out of the IPG and to a lead electrically connected to the connector assembly, the lead transmitting electrical signals between the IPG and patient tissue.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Other IEDs include implantable cardiac monitors (ICMs). ICMs also employ a housing, feedthrus, a header, and internal electrically conductive components of the header, such as, for example, antennas and sensing electrodes. ICMs are used to monitor heart function or other electrical signals, but do not administer electrotherapy.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional processes for fabricating a header of an IED employ epoxy casting the header about the header's electrically conductor components and to the device after the feedthru has been welded to the device case. The epoxy casting process is a labor intensive process that requires significant secondary operations such as, for example, buffing, sanding and cleaning of the header and the housing. Such secondary processes require a dedicated wet room that is outside the cleanroom used in the assembly of the header to the housing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a need in the art for an IED that is less expensive and labor intensive to manufacture.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Disclosed herein is an implantable electronic device.

The IPG administers electrotherapy or other neurostimulation via an implantable lead having a lead connector end on a proximal end of the implantable lead. The IPG includes a housing or can and a connector assembly enclosed in a header to form a header connector assembly that is coupled to the housing or can. The header connector assembly has at least one lead connector receiving bore or receptacle that includes electrical contacts of the connector assembly that make electrical contact with corresponding electrical terminals on the lead connector end on the proximal end of the implantable lead when the lead connector end is plugged into or otherwise received in the lead connector receiving bore or receptacle. Via the electrical connection between the corresponding electrical terminals of the lead connector end and the electrical contacts of the lead connector receiving bore, electrical signals can be administered from the IPG and through the lead to patient tissue. Similarly, but in reverse, electrical signals originating in patient tissue can travel via the lead to the IPG to be sensed at the IPG.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The ICM is similar to the IPG in that it also includes a housing or can and a header. However, unlike the IPG, the ICM does not attach to leads and the ICM simply monitors electrical signals and does not administer therapy.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The implantable electronic device configurations and methods of assembly disclosed herein are advantageous for at least the reason that they save manufacturing costs. Specifically, the implantable electronic devices disclosed herein employ an advantageous modular assembly of an IED <b>20</b> that is able to take advantage of direct injection molding for the manufacture of a modular header-feedthru assembly <b>106</b>, which can then be plugged into the device housing <b>24</b> and welded thereto. The resulting IED <b>20</b> are advantageous in that they have a robust configuration that has less associated manufacturing costs than those devices known in the art.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Before beginning a detailed discussion of the modular aspects of the IED <b>20</b> and the corresponding methods of manufacture, a general discussion is first given regarding features of a lead connector end at the proximal end of an implantable medical lead followed by a general discussion of the features of an IPG <b>20</b>. A general discussion is then given regarding the features of an ICM <b>20</b>, followed immediately thereafter by a detailed discussion of the modular aspects of the devices <b>20</b> and the related methods of manufacture.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">A. Overview of a Lead Connector End and IPG</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a proximal end portion <b>10</b> of a conventional transvenous, bipolar pacing lead, but is generally representative of any type of implantable lead whether in the cardiac, pain management or other medical treatment space. The diameter of such a lead may be made a sufficiently small diameter to facilitate the lead's implantation into small veins such as those found in the coronary sinus region of the heart and to allow implantation of a plurality of leads into a single vessel for multi-site or multi-chamber pacing. It should be understood, however, that other lead designs may be used, for example, multipolar leads have proximal ends portions that are bifurcated, trifurcated or have other branched configurations. While the lead whose proximal end is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is of the bipolar variety, there are unipolar leads that carry but a single electrode, and multipolar leads that have more than two electrodes.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As is well known in the art, bipolar coaxial leads typically consists of a tubular housing of a biocompatible, biostable insulating material containing an inner multifilar conductor coil that is surrounded by an inner insulating tube. The inner conductor coil is connected to a tip electrode on the distal end of the lead. The inner insulating tube is surrounded by a separate, outer multifilar conductor coil that is also enclosed within the tubular housing. The outer conductor coil is connected to an anodal ring electrode along the distal end portion of the lead. The inner insulation is intended to electrically isolate the two conductor coils preventing any internal electrical short circuit, while the housing protects the entire lead from the intrusion of body fluids. These insulating materials are typically either silicone rubber or polyurethane. More recently, there have been introduced bipolar leads in which multifilar cable conductors contained within multilumen housings are substituted for the conductor coils in order to reduce even further the overall diameter of the lead.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The proximal lead end portion <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a lead connector end <b>11</b> that conforms to the IS-1 standard, comprising a pair of coaxial spaced-apart electrical terminals including a tip terminal <b>12</b> and a ring terminal <b>14</b>. The tip terminal <b>12</b> is electrically connected by means of the inner conductor coil to the tip electrode at the distal end of the lead, while the ring terminal <b>14</b> is electrically connected to the anodal ring electrode by means of the outer conductor coil. The tip and ring terminals of the lead connector end may each be engaged by a conductive garter spring contact or other resilient electrical contact element in a corresponding lead connector receiving bore of the header, the resilient electrical contact element being carried by a connector assembly enclosed in the header as described below. The lead connector end <b>11</b> on the proximal lead end portion <b>10</b> further comprises spaced-apart pairs of seal rings <b>16</b> for abutting against in a fluid-sealing manner the inner circumferential surface of the lead connector receiving bore of the header, thereby preventing body fluids from reaching the electrical terminals and contacts when the lead connector end <b>11</b> is plugged into the corresponding lead connector receiving bore. With the lead connector end <b>11</b> of the lead inserted in the lead connector receiving bore of the header and connector assembly, the tip and ring terminals <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are electrically coupled via the contacts of the connector assembly and a feedthru to the electronic circuits within the hermetically sealed housing of the IPG (e.g., cardiac pacemaker, ICD, or other implantable tissue stimulation and/or sensing device such as those used in pain management, etc.).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a multi-site or multi-chamber cardiac pacemaker/defibrillator unit that is generally representative of any type of IPG <b>20</b> incorporating a header connector assembly <b>22</b> coupled to a housing <b>24</b>.
