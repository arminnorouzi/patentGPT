The method may include loosening a bracket on a first portion of the roof rack. The method may further include sliding the first portion of the roof rack and the bracket along a connecting rail of a roof structure of the vehicle. The method may also include tightening the bracket in a new location of on the connecting rail of the roof structure of the vehicle. The method may further include loosening a second bracket on a second portion of the roof rack. The method may also include sliding the second portion of the roof rack and the second bracket along the connecting rail in an opposite direction from the first portion of the roof rack. The method may further include tightening the second bracket on the connecting rail of the roof structure of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another embodiment of the present disclosure may include a roof rack mounting structure. The structure may include a mounting structure of a roof rack. The structure may further include a mounting bracket coupled to the mounting structure. The mounting bracket may include a spacing element extending substantially transverse to the mounting bracket extending between the mounting bracket and the mounting structure. The mounting bracket may further include clamping hardware extending from the mounting bracket to the mounting structure from a position laterally offset along the mounting bracket from the spacing element.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"
