The prostate early in life is the size and shape of a walnut and weighs about 20 grams. Prostate enlargement appears to be a normal process. With age, the prostate gradually increases in size to twice or more its normal size. As the prostate grows, it presses against and narrows the urethra, causing prostatic urethra compression and urinary obstruction that makes voiding difficult or impossible.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Male urethral stricture disease occurs at a rate as high as 0.6% in some populations. Urethral stricture diseases appear to be more common in the elderly population. The patients with the strictures experience moderate to severe complications, such as lower urinary tract voiding symptoms or urinary retention, recurrent urinary tract infection and the need for repeat urethral procedures such as dilation, urethrotomy, or urethroplasty.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Ureteral strictures of the upper urinary tract are either congenital or acquired. Congenital ureteral strictures are most commonly located at the ureteropelvic junction. Most of ureteral strictures are acquired and usually are iatrogenic. The most common etiology of the ureteral strictures is injury during endoscopic, open, or laparoscopic surgical procedures.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Strictures in the digestive body lumen or the gastrointestinal tracts include esophageal strictures, achalasia strictures, biliary strictures, stomach strictures, small intestine strictures, duodenum strictures, jejunum strictures, ileum strictures, colon strictures, rectum strictures, and large intestine strictures. The type of disease classifies a stricture into benign or malignant.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A biliary stricture, also referred to as a bile duct stricture, occurs when the bile duct gets smaller or narrower. The bile duct is the tube that takes bile from the liver to the small intestine. When the bile duct becomes narrow, it makes it difficult for food to digest. Biliary strictures can be caused by any injuries to the bile duct, swelling, pancreatitis, intestinal injuries, and cancers in the bile duct or pancreas. The symptoms of the biliary stricture include pain, chills and fever, itching, and nausea or vomiting.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Esophageal strictures are a problem commonly encountered in gastroenterological medicine and can be caused by malignant or benign lesions. Dysphagia is the symptom experienced by all patients. Most of these patients require palliative treatment to relieve the dysphagia.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Gastrointestinal strictures are a narrowing of a section of the intestine that causes problems by slowing or blocking the movement of food through the area. The strictures are caused by recurrent inflammations, cancer, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. The strictures include esophageal strictures, achalasia strictures, strictures in stents, biliary strictures, stomach strictures, small intestine strictures, duodenum strictures, jejunum strictures, ileum strictures, colon strictures, rectum strictures, and large intestine strictures.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a term used to classify two major airflow obstruction disorders: chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Approximately 16 million Americans have COPD, 80-90% of them were smokers throughout much of their lives. COPD is a leading cause of death in the U.S. Chronic bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchial airways. The bronchial airways connect the trachea with the lungs. When inflamed, the bronchial tubes secrete mucus, causing a chronic cough. Emphysema is an over-inflation of the alveoli, or air sacs in the lungs. This condition causes shortness of breath.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by inflammation of the airways, excess mucus production and airway hyper-responsiveness, and a condition in which airways narrow excessively or too easily respond to a stimulus. Asthma episodes or attacks cause narrowing of the airways, which make breathing difficult. Asthma attacks can have a significant impact on a patient's life, limiting participation in many activities. In severe cases, asthma attacks can be life threatening.

The new methods open the lumen and prevent, reduce, or minimize renarrowing and recurrent strictures. The methods involve delivering of therapeutic agents such as anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative drugs (e.g., paclitaxel, taxol, docetaxel, rapamycin, sirolimus, tacrolimus, everolimus, mTOR inhibitors, or their analogues) and one or more water-soluble additives to a target tissue.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Embodiments of the present invention provide a medical device coating formulation including a drug for treatment of the strictures in nonvascular body lumens, and additives that enhance absorption of the drug into tissue of body lumens.

The balloon catheter includes a coating layer overlying an exterior surface of the balloon, wherein the coating layer includes one or more water-soluble additives and an initial drug load of an antiproliferative therapeutic agent.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">By coating the exterior surface of the balloon catheter, for example, with a layer including a therapeutic agent and additives, it is useful in solving problems associated with the coatings. For example, the additive can have a hydrophilic part and a drug affinity part. The drug affinity part can be a hydrophobic part and/or can have an affinity to the therapeutic agent by hydrogen bonding and/or van der Waals interactions. Surprisingly, additives according to embodiments of the present invention which include a hydrophilic part and a drug affinity part, in combination with an antiproliferative therapeutic agent, form an effective drug delivery coating on a medical device without the use of oils and lipids, thereby avoiding the lipolysis dependence and other disadvantages of conventional oil-based coating formulations. Moreover, the additives according to embodiments of the present invention facilitate rapid drug elution and superior permeation of drug into tissues at a disease site. Thus, coatings according to embodiments of the present invention provide an enhanced rate and/or extent of absorption of the antiproliferative therapeutic agent in nonvascular diseased tissues or nonvascular body lumens. In embodiments of the present invention, the coated device delivers antiproliferative therapeutic agent to nonvascular tissues during a very brief deployment time of less than 10 minutes, less than 2 minutes, and reduces renarrowing and reoccurring of the strictures of a nonvascular body lumen.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Various embodiments of the present invention relate to a medical device for delivering a therapeutic agent to strictures of vascular or nonvascular body lumen, the device including a layer overlying an exterior surface of the medical device.

The nominal diameters of the BPH stricture balloons can be 25 mm, 30 mm, 35 mm, 40 mm, and 45 mm with balloon lengths of 20 mm, 25 mm, 30 mm, 35 mm, 40 mm, 45 mm, 50 mm, 55 mm, and 60 mm balloon catheters at nominal pressure of 2 atm, 3 atm, 4 atm, 6 atm, or 9 atm inflation. Table 1 illustrates examples of nominal balloon sizes, nominal pressures, and ratios of minimal balloon diameter to normative lumen diameter for used to treat strictures of various diseases. Nominal pressure is the pressure required to bring the balloon to its labeled nominal diameter in an unconstrained pressure ramp test. Nominal diameter is the desired diameter that the product is labeled with. All physicians purchase balloons and select balloons for use according to the nominal diameter. The rated burst pressure is the maximum pressure that the balloon can be inflated to and have a very high confidence that it will not burst, a labeling requirement for balloon catheters that is calculated from a statistical analysis of the pressures observed when the balloons burst in an unconstrained pressure ramp test.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Examples of nominal balloon sizes, nominal pressures, and </entry></row><row><entry>ratios of minimal balloon diameter to normative lumen diameter </entry></row><row><entry>for used to treat strictures of various diseases.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Nominal</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>balloon</entry><entry/><entry>Rated</entry><entry>Ratio of nominal</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>diameter &#xd7;</entry><entry>Nominal</entry><entry>burst</entry><entry>balloon</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>length</entry><entry>pressure</entry><entry>pressure</entry><entry>diameter/normative</entry></row><row><entry>Disease</entry><entry>(mm)</entry><entry>(atm)</entry><entry>(atm)</entry><entry>lumen diameter</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>BPH</entry><entry>20-50 &#xd7;</entry><entry>1.5</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>2.5-10&#x2009;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>20-80,</entry><entry>minimum,</entry><entry>minimum,</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>such as</entry><entry>such as 2</entry><entry>such as 4</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>30-40 &#xd7;</entry><entry>atm or</entry><entry>or more</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>35-45</entry><entry>more</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Urethral</entry><entry>6-14 &#xd7;</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>8</entry><entry>1-2</entry></row><row><entry>stricture</entry><entry>20-180,</entry><entry>minimum,</entry><entry>minimum,</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>such as</entry><entry>such as 8</entry><entry>such as </entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>6-14 &#xd7;</entry><entry>or more</entry><entry>10-12</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>30-50</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Esophageal</entry><entry>6-20 &#xd7;</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>9</entry><entry>1-2</entry></row><row><entry>stricture</entry><entry>30-80</entry><entry>minimum</entry><entry>minimum</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Achalasia</entry><entry>30-40 &#xd7;</entry><entry>1.5</entry><entry>9</entry><entry>1-2</entry></row><row><entry>(stricture of</entry><entry>80-100</entry><entry>minimum</entry><entry>minimum</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>lower</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>esophagus)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Gastrointestinal</entry><entry>6-20 &#xd7;</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>9</entry><entry>1-2</entry></row><row><entry>strictures</entry><entry>40-60</entry><entry>minimum</entry><entry>minimum</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Biliary</entry><entry>4-10 &#xd7;</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>9</entry><entry>1-2</entry></row><row><entry>strictures</entry><entry>20-40</entry><entry>minimum</entry><entry>minimum</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">In various embodiments, the balloon catheter can be sufficient such that at a predetermined pressure (e.g., the nominal pressure) the balloon can have any suitable ratio of inflated balloon catheter diameter to a normative diameter of the body lumen at the location of treatment; for example, at a pressure of about 1 atm (304 kPa) to about 30 atm (3040 kPa) (e.g., about 1 atm or less, or less than, equal to, or more than about 4 atm, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, or about 30 atm or more).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">The stretch ratio is defined herein, unless otherwise indicated, as the ratio of the nominal diameter of the balloon to the normative diameter of the body lumen in the area being treated by the balloon catheter. The nominal diameter of the balloon is the diameter the balloon achieves in an unrestricted environment at the nominal pressure. The normative lumen diameter is the average of the diameters of healthy lumen adjacent to the stricture, stenosis, or lesion, that is proximal and distal of the stricture or stenosis or lesion of the lumen. For the urinary tract, for example, in the urethra and prostatic urethra, the normative body lumen diameter will be the average diameter of the voiding urethra of the healthy lumen distal and proximal to the obstruction. For all lumens, if the average diameter of healthy tissue distal and proximal is not obtainable, the normative body lumen diameter will be the diameter of what the lumen would have been with biological matter flowing through it had it been healthy. The inflated balloon diameter can be the actual diameter of the balloon following inflation, which in some embodiments can equal to, less than, or greater than the nominal diameter of the balloon. In various embodiments, the stretch ratio of the balloon catheter of the present invention makes it more effective for treating non-vascular lumens than other catheters. During performance of a method of the present invention, the stretch ratio of can be selected to be any suitable ratio that achieves the desired ratio of actual inflated balloon diameter to normative lumen diameter at the range of pressures used during the method. In various embodiments, the stretch ratio of the balloon can be about 1.01 to about 20, 1.31 to 20, or about 1.01 to about 15, or about 1.1 to about 10, 1.2 to 10, 1.3 to 10, 1.31 to 10, 1.4 to 10, 1.5 to 10, 1.6 to 10, 1.7 to 10, 1.8 to 10, 2 to 10, 2.2 to 10, 2.5 to 10, or less than, equal to, or greater than about 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.31, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, or about 20 or more; such a stretch ratio can result in a desired ratio of inflated balloon diameter to normative lumen diameter at the pressures used during the inflation period that can be the same, similar to, or different than the stretch ratio, such as about 1.01 to about 20, 1.31 to 20, or about 1.01 to about 15, or about 1.1 to about 10, 1.2 to 10, 1.3 to 10, 1.31 to 10, 1.4 to 10, 1.5 to 10, 1.6 to 10, 1.7 to 10, 1.8 to 10, 2 to 10, 2.2 to 10, 2.5 to 10, or less than, equal to, or greater than about 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.31, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, or about 20 or more.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">In various embodiments, the method includes measuring the body lumen stricture to be treated. The distal and proximal healthy tissue diameter and the length of the stricture can be assessed to select the drug coated balloon to be used. The physician will select a balloon based on the normative diameter of the body lumen stricture and achieving a stretch ratio of the nominal diameter of the balloon to the normative diameter of the body lumen stricture of 1.0-20, or 1.1-15, or 1.2-10, or 1.31-8. The physician can then inflate the balloon to at least the nominal pressure, and in some cases, can inflate the balloon past the nominal pressure, up to the rated burst pressure of the balloon. The range of pressure used during the inflation period can be called the working pressure range of the drug coated balloon. In some cases, the method can include exceeding the rated burst pressure of the balloon. Because the nominal diameter of the balloon is determined without any constrictions, the inflated diameter of the balloon during treatment while in the stricture will be about the same or less or greater than the nominal diameter. At or above burst pressure, the inflated diameter of the balloon can be less than the nominal diameter, equal to the nominal diameter, or can exceed the nominal diameter. For example, a body lumen stricture can be measured to have a normative diameter of 10 mm. The physician can choose a 14 mm nominal diameter drug coated balloon that has a nominal pressure of 6 atm and a rated burst pressure of 10 atm. The stretch ratio is 1.4. The physician would inflate the balloon to at least 6 atm and in some cases inflate to 10 atm and in some cases inflate to over 10 atm to achieve the desired inflated balloon diameter during treatment.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">In various embodiments, the balloon catheter has one or more neck sections separating one or more main sections, and the at least one neck section of the balloon catheter of the present invention, or the configuration of the one or more neck sections, allows the balloon catheter to stay in place during treatment more consistently and effectively to dilate the stricture and deliver the drug, as compared to other balloon catheters lacking such a neck section or configuration of neck sections.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">In various embodiments, the balloon catheter can be assembled with a sheath. The catheter assembly and scope (e.g., cystoscope) are inserted transurethrally into the prostatic urethra and they are positioned side by side near the external sphincter. Using the live video feed from the scope, the external sphincter can be located. The balloon can be positioned adjacent to the external sphincter and within the prostatic urethra. The balloon dilation, drug release, and balloon deflation can be visualized by the scope.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">In various embodiments, the balloon catheter can be assembled with a cystoscope by backloading the shaft through the working channel and attaching a Tuohy Borst and one-way stopcock at the proximal end. The cystoscope-catheter assembly is inserted transurethrally into the prostatic urethra. Using the live video feed from the cystoscope, the external sphincter can be located. The balloon can be positioned adjacent to the external sphincter and within the prostatic urethra.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">In some embodiments, when treating the prostate, it is preferable to place the proximal balloon waist in the external sphincter so that the external sphincter is not dilated. It is also preferable to size the balloon so that when the balloon waist is in the external sphincter, a balloon neck (e.g., a distal-most balloon neck) is aligned with the bladder neck. This arrangement provides holding forces so that the balloon will not slip during expansion. If a balloon neck cannot be aligned with the bladder neck, it may be preferable to inflate the balloon slowly so that the prostate can yield as the balloon is inflated.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">Once properly positioned the balloon is dilated, such as using an inflation device with a pressure gauge. The balloon can be inflated slowly, allowing the prostatic tissue to yield and reducing the propensity for the balloon to slip proximally into the bladder and slip backward distally. Although a single- or multi-necked shape of the balloon can prevent balloon movement by aligning the distal-most neck with the bladder neck, in some abnormal situations such as with an enlarged median lobe (e.g., about 10-15% of cases) the neck of the balloon may not stay aligned to the neck of the bladder during inflation and additional techniques can be useful to further prevent balloon migration. In some examples, inflating at a rate of about 0.5 to 1 atm/min can prevent balloon movement. As the tissue yields, the balloon pressure correspondingly drops, allowing for additional fluid to be instilled within the balloon without increasing the pressure. When the pressure is stable for about 1-2 minutes the pressure can be increased in 0.5 or 1 atm increments and maintained in a similar method. The pressure can be continually increased, following this method of increasing pressure, allowing pressure to stabilize after pressure drops, and continuing to increase pressure, until a commissurotomy or a split is achieved. Alternatively, a very slow inflation can prevent balloon migration to achieve a commissurotomy or a prostate split. Once a commissurotomy or a prostatic urethra and prostate split is observed and confirmed with the video feed from the scope, mechanical decompression can be achieved. The balloon can remain inflated for a period of about 1 minute to 7 days, 1 minute to 1 day, or 1-10 minutes to allow the drug in the coating to transfer into the tissue. Once the treatment is completed, the balloon can be deflated and the catheter and scope can be removed from the body lumen of the patient.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">In some embodiments, when treating the prostate, it may be desirable to predilate the stricture. In this embodiment, the predilation catheter may be shorter and/or of less diameter than the drug-coated balloon treatment catheter. In this scenario, the predilation catheter is positioned with the proximal waist of the balloon in the external sphincter and a neck region aligned with the bladder neck. The balloon is slowly inflated as described herein to aid in yielding the prostate while protecting against balloon slippage. Once inflated, the predilation balloon is deflated and removed and the drug-coated treatment balloon is inserted. The treatment balloon's proximal waist is aligned with the external sphincter. If the BPH was properly predilated, it is not as necessary to align a balloon neck with the bladder neck as the balloon will not be as prone to slipping as it would be in a non-predilated body lumen.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">The drug-coated balloon catheter can include an elongated balloon body with multiple main sections, two cones at distal and proximal ends of the balloon body, an inflation lumen, and a wire lumen, wherein the balloon body includes at least two main sections with a larger diameter and at least one neck section with a smaller diameter, wherein the main section with a larger diameter and neck section are aligned alternatively and adjacently. The elongated balloon can have a generally cylindrical shape, with the exception of any neck section on the balloon, any tapered sections (e.g., cones) between the neck section and the main sections having the main diameter, and any tapered or shaped sections at the longitudinal ends of the balloon. The elongated balloon can have any suitable profile taken perpendicular to a longitudinal direction of the balloon, such as circular (e.g., cylindrical balloon), oval, or polygonal (e.g., pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, octagonal, and the like), or a combination thereof. The diameter of a non-cylindrical balloon can be the largest size perpendicular to the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">The balloon can be formed from any suitable material, such as a non-compliant or semi-compliant biocompatible material. In some embodiments, the balloon can be made by blow-forming to accomplish a desired geometry. In some embodiments, the balloon can include materials that do not interact with the drug coating, or materials such as nylon (e.g., any suitable nylon, such as nylon 6,6 or nylon 12), polyether block amide (PEBA), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyester, polyurethane, derivatives thereof, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">The balloon can have any suitable size. The balloon can be designed to fit within the prostatic urethra with the distal section of the balloon being positioned in the bladder. Main diameters and nominal balloon diameters can range from about 5 mm to about 50 mm, 25 mm up to 45 mm, at least 10 mm, at least 15 mm, at least 20 mm, at least 30 mm, such as about 5 mm or less, or less than, equal to, or greater than about 6 mm, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or about 50 mm or more; main section diameters can independently range from any of these ranges or specific sizes. The balloon can have a length of about 20 mm to about 160 mm, 40 mm to about 80 mm, or about 20 mm or less, or less than, equal to, or greater than about 22 mm, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78 mm, or about 80 mm or more. Balloon length and diameter can be selected based on the unique prostate anatomy of the patient.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">The balloon can include at least one neck section. The neck section is a section of the balloon having a smaller diameter than the main nominal diameter of the balloon. The neck section diameter can be about 5 mm to about 35 mm, 10 mm to about 35 mm, or about 5 mm or less, or less than, equal to, or greater than about 6 mm, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34 mm, or about 35 mm or more. The at least one neck section can have a diameter that is independently about 5% to about 99% of the main diameter, such as about 20% to about 99%, or about 5% or less, or less than, equal to, or greater than about 10%, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, or about 99% or more. In some embodiments, the neck section diameter is from 35% to 75% of the diameter of the main section of the balloon. In some embodiments where the balloon main section has a nominal diameter of 35 to 40 mm, the neck section would have a diameter of 15 to 20 mm. In some embodiments, if the neck diameter is too similar to the diameter of the main section, its ability to prevent balloon slippage may be lessened.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">The neck section can be a rigid or semi-rigid neck section, such that the diameter of the neck section (e.g., the portion of the neck section having the neck section diameter) remains substantially static during inflation of the balloon. The neck section can include a substantially nonelastic (e.g., non-compliant, or minimally non-compliant) portion of the balloon, a reinforced portion of the balloon, or a combination thereof. The neck section can include an inelastic material circulated around a circumference of the neck section, such as a suture or monofilament or multifilaments of such material, such as nylon, polyamide, aromatic polyamides, ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), polyesters, aromatic polyesters, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">In some embodiments, the balloon neck section can be semi-compliant and expand at different rates than the main balloon body. The neck section compliance can be more, less or equal to the compliance of the balloon body. Table 2 illustrates example measurements of a balloon that has neck section that expands more than the balloon body. The expansion rate of the neck diameter can be higher than the expansion rate of the diameter of the main body section in the tested pressure range of 1-5 atm. The expansion rate of the neck diameter can be in the range of 1.1 to 10 times that of the diameter of the main body section (main diameter) in the tested pressure range of 1-5 atm, such as in the range of 2 to 6 times the main diameter. The expansion rate of the neck diameter is 12.38% per atm. The expansion rate of the body diameter is 2.4% per atm. The difference of the expansion rates is 9.98% per atm. Table 3 illustrates example measurements of a balloon that has a neck section that expands less than the balloon body when inflated from 2 atmospheres to 4 atmospheres. The expansion rate of the neck diameter can be less than the expansion rate of the diameter of the main body section in the tested pressure range of 2-4 atm.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Example measurements of a balloon that has neck</entry></row><row><entry>section that expands more than the balloon body.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Balloon</entry><entry>Neck</entry><entry>Body</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Pressure</entry><entry>Diameter</entry><entry>Diameter</entry><entry>Body</entry><entry>Neck</entry></row><row><entry>[atm]</entry><entry>[mm]</entry><entry>[mm]</entry><entry>Compliance</entry><entry>Compliance</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>1</entry><entry>21.5</entry><entry>39.0</entry><entry>2.3% (1-2 atm)</entry><entry>12.2% </entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>(1-2 atm)</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>24.0</entry><entry>40.0</entry><entry>2.4% (2-3 atm)</entry><entry>15.7% </entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>(2-3 atm)</entry></row><row><entry>3</entry><entry>27.5</entry><entry>40.5</entry><entry>2.6% (3-4 atm)</entry><entry>13.4% </entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>(3-4 atm)</entry></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry>31.5</entry><entry>41.5</entry><entry>2.3% (4-5 atm)</entry><entry>&#x2002;8.2% </entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>(4-5 atm)</entry></row><row><entry>5</entry><entry>34.0</entry><entry>42.5</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0091" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Example measurements of a balloon that has a neck</entry></row><row><entry>section that expands less than the balloon body.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Balloon</entry><entry>Neck</entry><entry>Body</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Pressure</entry><entry>Diameter</entry><entry>Diameter</entry><entry>Body</entry><entry>Neck</entry></row><row><entry>[atm]</entry><entry>[mm]</entry><entry>[mm]</entry><entry>Compliance</entry><entry>Compliance</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>15.28</entry><entry>34.06</entry><entry>8.7% (2-4 atm)</entry><entry>0.4% (2-4 atm)</entry></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry>15.34</entry><entry>37.02</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0092" num="0088">The neck section can create a wedge of tissue between the larger diameter sections of the balloon that can hold the balloon in place.

The device includes a layer applied to an exterior surface of the balloon catheter. The layer includes a therapeutic agent and one or more additives. The additive can be any suitable additive. The layer can include one additive, or the layer can include more than one additive, such as a water-soluble first additive and a water-soluble second additive. For example, as shown in the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the balloon <b>12</b> is coated with a layer <b>20</b> that includes a therapeutic agent and an additive. In some embodiments, the layer consists essentially of a therapeutic agent and an additive, e.g., the layer includes only the therapeutic agent and the additive, without any other materially significant components. In some embodiments, the device may optionally include an adherent layer. For example, as shown in the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the balloon <b>12</b> is coated with an adherent layer <b>22</b>. A layer <b>24</b> that includes a therapeutic agent and an additive is overlying the adherent layer. The adherent layer, which is a separate layer underlying the drug coating layer, improves the adherence of the drug coating layer to the exterior surface of the medical device and protects coating integrity. For example, if drug and additive differ in their adherence to the medical device, the adherent layer may prevent differential loss of components and maintain drug-to-additive ratio in the coating during transit to a target site for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the adherent layer may function to facilitate rapid release of coating layer components off the device surface upon contact with tissues at the target site. In other embodiments, the device may include a top layer. The top layer may reduce loss of the drug layer before it is brought into contact with target tissues, for example during transit of the balloon <b>12</b> to the site of therapeutic intervention or during the first moments of inflation of balloon <b>12</b> before coating layer <b>20</b> is pressed into direct contact with target tissue.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0139">Embodiments of the present invention are directed to the treatment of strictures in nonvascular body lumens by delivering of an effective amount of a therapeutic agent such as anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative drugs (e.g., rapamycin, sirolimus, everolimus, tacrolimus, paclitaxel, taxol, docetaxel or their analogues).

One part is hydrophilic and the other part is a drug affinity part. The drug affinity part is a hydrophobic part and/or has an affinity to the therapeutic agent by hydrogen bonding and/or van der Waals interactions. The drug affinity part of the additive may bind the lipophilic drug, such as rapamycin or paclitaxel. The hydrophilic portion accelerates diffusion and increases permeation of the drug into tissue. It may facilitate rapid movement of drug off the medical device during deployment at the target site by preventing hydrophobic drug molecules from clumping to each other and to the device, increasing drug solubility in interstitial spaces, and/or accelerating drug lumen through polar head groups to the lipid bilayer of cell membranes of target tissues. The additives of embodiments of the present invention have two parts that function together to facilitate rapid release of drug off the device surface and uptake by target tissue during deployment (by accelerating drug contact with tissues for which drug has high affinity) while preventing the premature release of drug from the device surface prior to device deployment at the target site.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0156">In embodiments of the present invention, the therapeutic agent is rapidly released after the medical device is brought into contact with tissue and is readily absorbed. For example, certain embodiments of devices of the present invention include drug coated balloon catheters that deliver a therapeutic agent such as a lipophilic antiproliferative pharmaceutical (such as paclitaxel or rapamycin) to nonvascular tissue through brief, direct pressure contact at high drug concentration during balloon nonvascular body balloon dilation. The lipophilic drug, for example, is retained in target tissue at the delivery site, where it inhibits hyperplasia and restenosis yet allows epithelization. In these embodiments, coating formulations of the present invention not only facilitate rapid release of drug from the balloon surface and transfer of drug into target tissues during deployment, but also prevent drug from diffusing away from the device during transit through tortuous anatomy prior to reaching the target site and from exploding off the device during the initial phase of balloon inflation, before the drug coating is pressed into direct contact with the surface of the body lumen.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0157">The additive according to certain embodiments has a drug affinity part and a hydrophilic part. The drug affinity part is a hydrophobic part and/or has an affinity to the therapeutic agent by hydrogen bonding and/or van der Waals interactions. The drug affinity part may include aliphatic and aromatic organic hydrocarbon compounds, such as benzene, toluene, and alkanes, among others. These parts are not water soluble. They may bind both hydrophobic drug, with which they share structural similarities, and lipids of cell membranes. The drug affinity part may include functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds with drug and with itself. The hydrophilic part may include hydroxyl groups, amine groups, amide groups, carbonyl groups, carboxylic acid and anhydrides, ethyl oxide, ethyl glycol, polyethylene glycol, ascorbic acid, amino acid, amino alcohol, glucose, sucrose, sorbitan, glycerol, polyalcohol, phosphates, sulfates, organic salts and their substituted molecules, among others. One or more hydroxyl, carboxyl, acid, amide or amine groups, for example, may be advantageous since they easily displace water molecules that are hydrogen-bound to polar head groups and surface proteins of cell membranes and may function to remove this barrier between hydrophobic drug and cell membrane lipid. These parts can dissolve in water and polar solvents. The additive of embodiments of the present invention has components to both bind drug and facilitate its rapid movement off the medical device during deployment and into target tissues.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0158">The additives in embodiments of the present invention can be surfactants and chemical compounds with one or more hydroxyl, amino, carbonyl, carboxyl, acid, amide, or ester moieties.

To function as an additive in exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the compound includes polar or charged hydrophilic moieties as well as non-polar hydrophobic (lipophilic) moieties.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0160">An empirical parameter commonly used in medicinal chemistry to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of pharmaceutical compounds is the partition coefficient, P, the ratio of concentrations of unionized compound in the two phases of a mixture of two immiscible solvents, usually octanol and water, such that P=([solute]octanol/[solute]water). Compounds with higher log Ps are more hydrophobic, while compounds with lower log Ps are more hydrophilic. Lipinski's rule suggests that pharmaceutical compounds having log P&#x3c;5 can be more membrane permeable. For purposes of certain embodiments of the present invention, for example, the additive has log P less than log P of the drug to be formulated (as an example, log P of paclitaxel is 7.4). A greater log P difference between the drug and the additive can facilitate phase separation of drug. For example, if log P of the additive is much lower than log P of the drug, the additive may accelerate the release of drug in an aqueous environment from the surface of a device to which drug might otherwise tightly adhere, thereby accelerating drug delivery to tissue during brief deployment at the site of intervention. In certain embodiments of the present invention, log P of the additive is negative. In other embodiments, log P of the additive is less than log P of the drug. While a compound's octanol-water partition coefficient P or log P is useful as a measurement of relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, it is merely a rough guide that may be useful in defining suitable additives for use in embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0161">Suitable additives that can be used in embodiments of the present invention include, without limitation, organic and inorganic pharmaceutical recipients, natural products and derivatives thereof (such as sugars, vitamins, amino acids, peptides, proteins, and fatty acids), low molecular weight oligomers, surfactants (anionic, cationic, non-ionic, and ionic), and mixtures thereof.

Such surfactants can be anionic, cationic, zwitterionic or non-ionic. Mixtures of surfactants are also within the scope of various embodiments of the invention, as are combinations of surfactant and other additives. Surfactants often have one or more long aliphatic chains such as fatty acids that may insert directly into lipid bilayers of cell membranes to form part of the lipid structure, while other components of the surfactants loosen the lipid structure and enhance drug penetration and absorption. The contrast agent iopromide does not have these properties.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0163">An empirical parameter commonly used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of surfactants is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (&#x201c;HLB&#x201d; value). Surfactants with lower HLB values are more hydrophobic, and have greater solubility in oils, while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic, and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Using HLB values as a rough guide, hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10, as well as anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable. Similarly, hydrophobic surfactants are compounds having an HLB value less than about 10. In certain embodiments of the present invention, a higher HLB value is utilized, since increased hydrophilicity may facilitate release of hydrophobic drug from the surface of the device. In one embodiment, the HLB of the surfactant additive is higher than 10. The additive HLB can be higher than 14. Alternatively, surfactants having lower HLB may be utilized to prevent drug loss prior to device deployment at the target site, for example in a top coat over a drug layer that has a very hydrophilic additive.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0164">The HLB value of a surfactant is merely a rough guide generally used to enable formulation of industrial, pharmaceutical and cosmetic emulsions, for example. For many important surfactants, including several polyethoxylated surfactants, it has been reported that HLB values can differ by as much as about 8 HLB units, depending upon the empirical method chosen to determine the HLB value (Schott, J. Pharm. Sciences, 79(1), 87-88 (1990)).

Furthermore, surfactant additives improve the integrity and quality of the coating layer, so that particles do not fall off during handling. When the surfactants described herein are formulated with paclitaxel, experimentally it protects drug from premature release during the device delivery process while facilitating rapid release and elution of paclitaxel during a very brief deployment time of 0.2 to 10 minutes at the target site. Drug absorption by tissues at the target site is unexpectedly high experimentally.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0000">Chemical Compounds with One or More Hydroxyl, Amino, Carbonyl, Carboxyl, Acid, Amide, or Ester Moieties.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0183">The chemical compounds with one or more hydroxyl, amino, carbonyl, carboxyl, acid, amide, or ester moieties include creatine, creatinine, agmatine, citrulline, guanidine, sucralose, aspartame, hypoxanthine, theobromine, theophylline, adenine, uracil, uridine, guanine, thymine, thymidine, xanthine, xanthosine, xanthosine monophosphate, caffeine, allantoin, (2-hydroxyethyl)urea, N,N&#x2032;-bis(hydroxymethyl)urea, pentaerythritol ethoxylate, pentaerythritol propoxylate, pentaerythritol propoxylate/ethoxylate, glycerol ethoxylate, glycerol propoxylate, trimethylolpropane ethoxylate, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, crown ether, 18-crown-6, 15-crown-5, 12-crown-4, N-acetylglucosamine, N-octyl-D-gluconamide, C6-ceramide, dihydro-C6-ceramide, cerabroside, sphingomyelin, galaclocerebrosides, lactocerebrosides, N-acetyl-D-sphingosine, N-hexanoyl-D-sphingosine, N-octonoyl-D-sphingosine, N-Lauroyl-D-sphingosine, N-palmitoyl-D-sphingosine, N-oleoyl-D-sphingosine, PEG caprylic/capric diglycerides, PEG8 caprylic/capric glycerides, PEG caprylate, PEG8 caprylate (e.g., Labrasol&#xae;), PEG caprate, PEG caproate, glyceryl monocaprylate, glyceryl monocaprate, glyceryl monocaproate, monolaurin, monocaprin, monocaprylin, monomyristin, monopalmitolein, and monoolein.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0184">The chemical compounds with one or more hydroxyl, amino, carbonyl, carboxyl, acid, amide, or ester moieties include amino alcohols, hydroxyl carboxylic acid, ester, anhydrides, hydroxyl ketone, hydroxyl lactone, hydroxyl ester, sugar phosphate, sugar sulfate, ethyl oxide, ethyl glycols, amino acids, peptides, proteins, sorbitan, glycerol, polyalcohol, phosphates, sulfates, organic acids, esters, salts, vitamins, combinations of amino alcohols and organic acids, and their substituted molecules. Hydrophilic chemical compounds with one or more hydroxyl, amino, carbonyl, carboxyl, acid, amide, or ester moieties having a molecular weight less than 5,000-10,000 are utilized in certain embodiments. In other embodiments, molecular weight of the additive with one or more hydroxyl, amino, carbonyl, carboxyl, acid, amide, or ester moieties is less than 1000-5,000, or less than 750-1,000, or less than 750. In these embodiments, the molecular weight of the additive is to be less than that of the drug to be delivered. Further, the molecular weight of the additive is to be higher than 80 since molecules with molecular weight less than 80 very easily evaporate and do not stay in the coating of a medical device. Small molecules can diffuse quickly. They can release themselves easily from the delivery balloon, accelerating release of drug, and they can diffuse away from drug when the drug binds tissue of the body lumens.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0185">In certain embodiments, additives with more than four hydroxyl groups are utilized, for example in the case of a high molecular weight additive. Large molecules diffuse slowly. If the molecular weight of the additive or the chemical compound is high, for example if the molecular weight is above 800, above 1000, above 1200, above 1500, or above 2000; large molecules may elute off the surface of the medical device too slowly to release drug under 2 minutes. If these large molecules contain more than four hydroxyl groups they have increased hydrophilic properties, which is necessary for relatively large molecules to release drug quickly. The increased hydrophilicity helps elute the coating off the balloon, accelerates release of drug, and improves or facilitates drug movement through water barrier and polar head groups of lipid bilayers to penetrate tissues. In one embodiment, the hydroxyl group is utilized as the hydrophilic moiety because it is unlikely to react with water insoluble drug, such as paclitaxel or rapamycin. In some embodiments, the chemical compound having more than four hydroxyl groups has a melting point of 120&#xb0; C. or less. In some embodiments, the chemical compound having more than four hydroxyl groups has three adjacent hydroxyl groups that in stereo configuration are all on one side of the molecule. For example, sorbitol and xylitol have three adjacent hydroxyl groups that in stereo configuration are all on one side of the molecule, while galactitol does not. The difference impacts the physical properties of the isomers such as the melting temperature. The stereo configuration of the three adjacent hydroxyl groups may enhance drug binding. This will lead to improved compatibility of the water insoluble drug and hydrophilic additive, and improved tissue uptake and absorption of drug.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0186">Some of the chemical compounds with one or more hydroxyl, amine, carbonyl, carboxyl, or ester moieties described herein are very stable under heating. They survive an ethylene oxide sterilization process and do not react with the water insoluble drug paclitaxel or rapamycin during sterilization. L-ascorbic acid and its salt and diethanolamine, on the other hand, do not necessarily survive such a sterilization process, and they react with paclitaxel. A different sterilization method is therefore utilized for L-ascorbic acid and diethanolamine. For example, hydroxyl, ester, and amide groups are utilized because they are unlikely to react with therapeutic agents such as paclitaxel or rapamycin. Sometimes, amine and acid groups do react with paclitaxel, for example, experimentally, benzoic acid, gentisic acid, diethanolamine, and ascorbic acid were not stable under ethylene oxide sterilization, heating, and aging process and reacted with paclitaxel. When the chemical compounds described herein are formulated with paclitaxel, a top coat layer may be advantageous to prevent premature drug loss during the device delivery process before deployment at the target site, since hydrophilic small molecules sometimes release drug too easily. The chemical compounds herein rapidly elute drug off the balloon during deployment at the target site. Surprisingly, even though some drug is lost during transit of the device to the target site when the coating contains these additives, experimentally drug absorption by tissue is unexpectedly high after only 0.2-10 minutes of deployment, for example, with the additive hydroxyl lactones such as ribonic acid lactone and gluconolactone.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="2">Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Salts Thereof</heading><p id="p-0194" num="0187">Vitamins A, D, E and K in many of their various forms and provitamin forms are considered as fat-soluble vitamins and in addition to these several other vitamins and vitamin sources or close relatives are also fat-soluble and have polar groups, and relatively high octanol-water partition coefficients.

Formulations including mixtures of the two additives with water-insoluble drug are in certain cases superior to mixtures including either additive alone. The hydrophobic drugs bind extremely water-soluble small molecules more poorly than they do surfactants. They are often phase separated from the small water-soluble molecules, which can lead to suboptimal coating uniformity and integrity. The water-insoluble drug has Log P higher than both that of the surfactant and that of small water-soluble molecules. However, Log P of the surfactant is typically higher than Log P of the chemical compounds with one or more hydroxyl, amine, carbonyl, carboxyl, or ester moieties. The surfactant has a relatively high Log P (usually above 0) and the water-soluble molecules have low Log P (e.g., below 0). Some surfactants, when used as additives in embodiments of the present invention, adhere so strongly to the water-insoluble drug and the surface of the medical device that drug is not able to rapidly release from the surface of the medical device at the target site. On the other hand, some of the water-soluble small molecules (with one or more hydroxyl, amine, carbonyl, carboxyl, or ester moieties) adhere so poorly to the medical device that they release drug before it reaches the target site, for example, into serum during the transit of a coated balloon catheter to the site targeted for intervention. Surprisingly, by adjusting the ratio of the concentrations of the small hydrophilic molecule and the surfactant in the formulation, the inventor has found that the coating stability during transit and rapid drug release when inflated and pressed against tissues of the lumen wall at the target site of therapeutic intervention in certain cases is superior to a formulation including either additive alone. Furthermore, the presence of the surfactant improves the miscibility and compatibility of the water-insoluble drug and the highly water-soluble molecules. The surfactant also improves coating uniformity and integrity by its good adhesion to the drug and the small molecules. The long chain hydrophobic part of the surfactant binds drug tightly while the hydrophilic part of the surfactant binds the water-soluble small molecules.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0203">The surfactants in the mixture or the combination include all of the surfactants described herein for use in embodiments of the invention.

In various embodiments, the chemical compound with one or more hydroxyl, amine, carbonyl, carboxyl, or ester moieties in the mixture has at least one hydroxyl group. In certain embodiments, additives with more than four hydroxyl groups are utilized, for example in the case of a high molecular weight additive. In some embodiments, the chemical compound having more than four hydroxyl groups has a melting point of 120&#xb0; C. or less. Large molecules diffuse slowly. If the molecular weight of the additive or the chemical compound is high, for example if the molecular weight is above 800, above 1000, above 1200, above 1500, or above 2000; large molecules may elute off the surface of the medical device too slowly to release drug under 2 minutes. If these large molecules contain more than four hydroxyl groups they have increased hydrophilic properties, which is necessary for relatively large molecules to release drug quickly. The increased hydrophilicity helps elute the coating off the balloon, accelerates release of drug, and improves or facilitates drug movement through water barrier and polar head groups of lipid bilayers to penetrate tissues. In one embodiment, the hydroxyl group is utilized as the hydrophilic moiety because it is unlikely to react with water insoluble drug, such as paclitaxel or rapamycin.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0205">The chemical compound with one or more hydroxyl, amine, carbonyl, carboxyl, or ester moieties in the mixture is chosen from L-ascorbic acid and its salt, D-glucoascorbic acid and its salt, tromethamine, triethanolamine, diethanolamine, meglumine, glucamine, amine alcohols, glucoheptonic acid, glucomic acid, hydroxyl ketone, hydroxyl lactone, gluconolactone, glucoheptonolactone, glucooctanoic lactone, gulonic acid lactone, mannoic lactone, ribonic acid lactone, lactobionic acid, glucosamine, glutamic acid, benzyl alcohol, benzoic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, lysine acetate salt, gentisic acid, lactobionic acid, lactitol, sorbitol, glucitol, sugar phosphates, glucopyranose phosphate, sugar sulphates, sinapic acid, vanillic acid, vanillin, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, xylitol, 2-ethoxyethanol, sugars, galactose, glucose, ribose, mannose, xylose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, arabinose, lyxose, fructose, cyclodextrin, (2-hydroxypropyl)-cyclodextrin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, retinoic acid, lysine acetate, gentisic acid, catechin, catechin gallate, tiletamine, ketamine, propofol, lactic acids, acetic acid, salts of any organic acid and amine described herein, polyglycidol, glycerol, multiglycerols, galactitol, monolaurin, monocaprin, monocaprylin, monomyristin, monopalmitolein, monoolein, creatine, creatinine, agmatine, citrulline, guanidine, sucralose, aspartame, hypoxanthine, theobromine, theophylline, adenine, uracil, uridine, guanine, thymine, thymidine, xanthine, xanthosine, xanthosine monophosphate, caffeine, allantoin, (2-hydroxyethyl)urea, N,N&#x2032;-bis(hydroxymethyl)urea, pentaerythritol ethoxylate, pentaerythritol propoxylate, pentaerythritol propoxylate/ethoxylate, glycerol ethoxylate, glycerol propoxylate, trimethylolpropane ethoxylate, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, crown ether, 18-crown-6, 15-crown-5, 12-crown-4, di(ethylene glycol), tri(ethylene glycol), tetra(ethylene glycol), penta(ethylene glycol), poly(ethylene glycol) oligomers, di(propylene glycol), tri(propylene glycol), tetra(propylene glycol, and penta(propylene glycol), poly(propylene glycol) oligomers, a block copolymer of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, and derivatives and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0206">Mixtures or combinations of a surfactant and a water-soluble small molecule confer the advantages of both additives. The water insoluble drug often has a poor compatibility with highly water-soluble chemical compounds, and the surfactant improves compatibility. The surfactant also improves the coating quality, uniformity, and integrity, and particles do not fall off the balloon during handling. The surfactant reduces drug loss during transit to a target site. The water-soluble chemical compound improves the release of drug off the balloon and absorption of the drug in the tissue. Experimentally, the combination was surprisingly effective at preventing drug release during transit and achieving high drug levels in tissue after very brief 0.2 to 2 minute deployment. Furthermore, in animal studies it effectively reduced stenosis and late lumen loss.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0207">Some of the mixtures or combinations of surfactants and water-soluble small molecules are very stable under heating. They survived an ethylene oxide sterilization process and do not react with the water insoluble drug paclitaxel or rapamycin during sterilization. In one embodiment, the hydroxyl, ester, amide groups are utilized because they are unlikely to react with therapeutic agents such as paclitaxel or rapamycin. Sometimes amine and acid groups do react with paclitaxel and are not stable under ethylene oxide sterilization, heating, and aging. When the mixtures or combinations described herein are formulated with paclitaxel, a top coat layer may be advantageous in order to protect the drug layer and from premature drug loss during the device.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0208">Examples of additives include p-isononylphenoxypolyglycidol, PEG glyceryl oleate, PEG glyceryl stearate, polyglyceryl laurate, plyglyceryl oleate, polyglyceryl myristate, polyglyceryl palmitate, polyglyceryl-6 laurate, plyglyceryl-6 oleate, polyglyceryl-6 myristate, polyglyceryl-6 palmitate, polyglyceryl-10 laurate, plyglyceryl-10 oleate, polyglyceryl-10 myristate, polyglyceryl-10 palmitate, PEG sorbitan monolaurate, PEG sorbitan monolaurate, PEG sorbitan monooleate, PEG sorbitan stearate, octoxynol, octoxynol-9, monoxynol, tyloxapol, sucrose monopalmitate, sucrose monolaurate, decanoyl-N-methylglucamide, n-decyl-&#x3b2;-D-glucopyranoside, n-decyl-&#x3b2;-D-maltopyranoside, n-dodecyl-&#x3b2;-D-glucopyranoside, n-dodecyl-&#x3b2;-D-maltoside, heptanoyl-N-methylglucamide, n-heptyl-&#x3b2;-D-glucopyranoside, n-heptyl-&#x3b2;-D-thioglucoside, n-hexyl-&#x3b2;-D-glucopyranoside, nonanoyl-N-methylglucamide, n-nonyl-&#x3b2;-D-glucopyranoside, octanoyl-N-methylglucamide, n-octyl-&#x3b2;-D-glucopyranoside, octyl-&#x3b2;-D-thioglucopyranoside; cystine, tyrosine, tryptophan, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and methionine (amino acids), cetotiamine, cyclothiamine, dexpanthenol, niacinamide, nicotinic acid and its salt, pyridoxal 5-phosphate, nicotinamide ascorbate, riboflavin, riboflavin phosphate, thiamine, folic acid, menadiol diphosphate, menadione sodium bisulfite, menadoxime, vitamin B12, vitamin K5, vitamin K6, vitamin K6, and vitamin U (vitamins); albumin, immunoglobulins, caseins, hemoglobins, lysozymes, immunoglobins, a-2-macroglobulin, fibronectins, vitronectins, firbinogens, lipases, benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, docecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, sodium docecylsulfates, dialkyl methylbenzyl ammonium chloride, and dialkylesters of sodium sulfonsuccinic acid, L-ascorbic acid and its salt, D-glucoascorbic acid and its salt, tromethamine, triethanolamine, diethanolamine, meglumine, glucamine, amine alcohols, glucoheptonic acid, glucomic acid, hydroxyl ketone, hydroxyl lactone, gluconolactone, glucoheptonolactone, glucooctanoic lactone, gulonic acid lactone, mannoic lactone, ribonic acid lactone, lactobionic acid, glucosamine, glutamic acid, benzyl alcohol, benzoic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, lysine acetate salt, gentisic acid, lactobionic acid, lactitol, sinapic acid, vanillic acid, vanillin, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, sorbitol, xylitol, cyclodextrin, (2-hydroxypropyl)-cyclodextrin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, retinoic acid, lysine acetate, gentisic acid, catechin, catechin gallate, tiletamine, ketamine, propofol, lactic acids, acetic acid, salts of any organic acid and organic amine, polyglycidol, glycerol, multiglycerols, galactitol, monolaurin, monocaprin, monocaprylin, monomyristin, monopalmitolein, monoolein, creatine, creatinine, agmatine, citrulline, guanidine, sucralose, aspartame, hypoxanthine, theobromine, theophylline, adenine, uracil, uridine, guanine, thymine, thymidine, xanthine, xanthosine, xanthosine monophosphate, caffeine, allantoin, (2-hydroxyethyl)urea, N,N&#x2032;-bis(hydroxymethyl)urea, pentaerythritol ethoxylate, pentaerythritol propoxylate, pentaerythritol propoxylate/ethoxylate, glycerol ethoxylate, glycerol propoxylate, trimethylolpropane ethoxylate, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, crown ether, 18-crown-6, 15-crown-5, 12-crown-4, di(ethylene glycol), tri(ethylene glycol), tetra(ethylene glycol), penta(ethylene glycol), poly(ethylene glycol) oligomers, di(propylene glycol), tri(propylene glycol), tetra(propylene glycol, and penta(propylene glycol), poly(propylene glycol) oligomers, a block copolymer of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, and derivatives and combinations thereof (chemical compounds with one or more hydroxyl, amino, carbonyl, carboxyl, or ester moieties). Some of these additives are both water-soluble and organic solvent-soluble. They have good adhesive properties and adhere to the surface of polyamide medical devices, such as balloon catheters. They may therefore be used in the adherent layer, top layer, and/or in the drug layer of embodiments of the present invention. The aromatic and aliphatic groups increase the solubility of water insoluble drugs in the coating solution, and the polar groups of alcohols and acids accelerate drug permeation of tissue.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0209">Other additives according to embodiments of the invention include hydroxyl ketone, hydroxyl lactone, hydroxyl acid, hydroxyl ester, and hydroxyl amide. Examples are gluconolactone, D-glucoheptono-1,4-lactone, glucooctanoic lactone, gulonic acid lactone, mannoic lactone, erythronic acid lactone, ribonic acid lactone, glucuronic acid, gluconic acid, gentisic acid, lactobionic acid, lactic acid, acetaminophen, vanillic acid, sinapic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, and derivatives thereof.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0210">From a structural point of view, these additives share structural similarities and are compatible with water insoluble drugs (such as paclitaxel and rapamycin). They often contain double bonds such as C&#x2550;C, C&#x2550;N, C&#x2550;O in aromatic or aliphatic structures. These additives also contain amine, alcohol, ester, amide, anhydride, carboxylic acid, and/or hydroxyl groups. They may form hydrogen bonds and/or van der Waals interactions with drug. They are also useful in the top layer in the coating. Compounds containing one or more hydroxyl, carboxyl, or amine groups, for example, are especially useful as additives since they facilitate drug release from the device surface and easily displace water next to the polar head groups and surface proteins of cell membranes and may thereby remove this barrier to hydrophobic drug permeability. They accelerate movement of a hydrophobic drug off the balloon to the lipid layer of cell membranes and tissues for which it has very high affinity. They may also carry or accelerate the movement of drug off the balloon into more aqueous environments such as the interstitial space, for example, of nonvascular tissues that have been injured by balloon angioplasty or stent expansion. Additives such as polyglyceryl fatty esters, ascorbic ester of fatty acids, sugar esters, alcohols and ethers of fatty acids have fatty chains that can integrate into the lipid structure of target tissue membranes, carrying drug to lipid structures. Some of the amino acids, vitamins and organic acids have aromatic C&#x2550;N groups as well as amino, hydroxyl, and carboxylic components to their structure. They have structural parts that can bind or complex with hydrophobic drug, such as paclitaxel or rapamycin, and they also have structural parts that facilitate tissue penetration by removing barriers between hydrophobic drug and lipid structure of cell membranes.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0211">For example, isononylphenylpolyglycidol (Olin-10 G and Surfactant-10G), PEG glyceryl monooleate, sorbitan monolaurate (Arlacel 20), sorbitan monopalmitate (Span-40), sorbitan monooleate (Span-80), sorbitan monostearate, polyglyceryl-10 oleate, polyglyceryl-10 laurate, polyglyceryl-10 palmitate, and polyglyceryl-10 stearate all have more than four hydroxyl groups in their hydrophilic part. These hydroxyl groups have very good affinity for walls of the body lumen and can displace hydrogen-bound water molecules. At the same time, they have long chains of fatty acid, alcohol, ether, and ester that can both complex with hydrophobic drug and integrate into the lipid structure of the cell membranes to form the part of the lipid structure. This deformation or loosening of the lipid membrane of target cells may further accelerate permeation of hydrophobic drug into tissue.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0212">For another example, L-ascorbic acid, thiamine, maleic acids, niacinamide, and 2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid all have a very high water and ethanol solubility and a low molecular weight and small size. They also have structural components including aromatic C&#x2550;N, amino, hydroxyl, and carboxylic groups. These structures have very good compatibility with paclitaxel and rapamycin and can increase the solubility of these water-insoluble drugs in water and enhance their absorption into tissues. However, they often have poor adhesion to the surface of medical devices. They are therefore used in combination with other additives in the drug layer and top layer where they are useful to enhance drug absorption. Vitamin D2 and D3 are especially useful because they themselves have anti-restenotic effects and reduce thrombosis, especially when used in combination with paclitaxel.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0213">In embodiments of the present invention, the additive is soluble in aqueous solvents and is soluble in organic solvents. Extremely hydrophobic compounds that lack sufficient hydrophilic parts and are insoluble in aqueous solvent, such as the dye Sudan Red, are not useful as additives in these embodiments. Sudan red is also genotoxic.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0214">In one embodiment, the concentration density of the at least one therapeutic agent applied to the surface of the medical device is from about 1 to 20 &#x3bc;g/mm<sup>2</sup>, or from about 2 to 6 &#x3bc;g/mm<sup>2</sup>, or about 0.5 microgram/mm<sup>2 </sup>or less, or less than, equal to, or greater than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, or about 20 micrograms/mm<sup>2 </sup>or more. If the medical device is a balloon, these measurements are calculated at nominal diameter. In one embodiment, the concentration of the at least one additive applied to the surface of the medical device is from about 0.5 to 20 &#x3bc;g/mm<sup>2</sup>, or from about 2 to 6 &#x3bc;g/mm<sup>2</sup>, or about 0.5 microgram/mm<sup>2 </sup>or less, or less than, equal to, or greater than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, or about 20 micrograms/mm<sup>2 </sup>or more. The ratio of additives to drug by weight in the coating layer in embodiments of the present invention can be about 20 to 0.05, about 10 to 0.1, or about 5 to 0.15.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0215">The relative amount of the therapeutic agent and the additive in the coating layer, may vary depending on applicable circumstances. The optimal amount of the additive can depend upon, for example, the particular therapeutic agent and additive selected, the critical micelle concentration of the surface modifier if it forms micelles, the hydrophilic-lipophilic-balance (HLB) of a surfactant or an additive's octonol-water partition coefficient (P), the melting point of the additive, the water solubility of the additive and/or therapeutic agent, the surface tension of water solutions of the surface modifier, and the like.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0216">Other considerations will further inform the choice of specific proportions of different additives.

A solvent in the top coating layer can be, for example, methanol, ethanol, and acetone.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0226">Organic solvents, such as short-chained alcohol, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide, etc., are particularly useful solvents in embodiments of the present invention because these organic solvents generally disrupt colloidal aggregates and co-solubilize all the components in the coating solution.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0227">The therapeutic agent and additive or additives may be dispersed in, solubilized, or otherwise mixed in the solvent. The weight percent of drug and additives in the solvent may be in the range of 0.1-80% by weight, or 2-20% by weight.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0228">Various embodiments provide a method for preparing a balloon catheter. First, a coating solution or suspension including at least one solvent, at least one therapeutic agent, and at least one additive is prepared. In at least one embodiment, the coating solution or suspension includes only these three components. The content of the therapeutic agent in the coating solution can be from 0.5-50% by weight based on the total weight of the solution. The content of the additive in the coating solution can be from about 0.1 wt % to about 45 wt %, about 0.2 wt % to about 40 wt % by weight, about 0.3 to about 15 wt %, or about 0.1 wt % or less, or less than, equal to, or greater than about 0.2 wt %, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 35, 40, or about 45 wt % or more, based on the total weight of the solution.

In the coating, the therapeutic agent is not encapsulated in polymer particles.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0231">Various techniques may be used for applying a coating solution to a medical device such as casting, fixed volume liquid dispensing, metering (e.g., dispense a fixed amount of coating solution based on volume onto the balloon), spinning, spraying, dipping (immersing), ink jet printing, electrostatic techniques, and combinations of these processes. During the application of the coating solution, the balloon can be at least partially inflated. The metering can be performed in any suitable way, such as by pumping liquid coating solution from a reservoir to a nozzle that is proximate the surface of the balloon (e.g., the surface of an at least partially inflated balloon). The nozzle can dispense the liquid therefrom, which can be immediately transferred to the exterior of the balloon due to its proximity to the nozzle (e.g., the nozzle can be so close to the balloon that the liquid emerging from the nozzle can contact and be transferred to the exterior of the balloon before forming a drop of liquid that leaves the nozzle). The nozzle can dispense the liquid to the exterior of the balloon such that substantially none of the liquid is lost. The balloon can be rotated around its longitudinal axis during the dispensing of the liquid from the nozzle. The nozzle can move during the dispensing, such as along the exterior of the balloon parallel to the longitudinal axis of the balloon. In some embodiments, the balloon can be rotated around its longitudinal axis during the dispensing, and the nozzle can move parallel to the longitudinal axis of the balloon, such that substantially all of the balloon surface is coated with the coating solution (e.g., similar to the movement of a woodworker's chisel on a cylindrical piece of spinning wood in a lathe).</p><p id="p-0243" num="0232">Choosing an application technique principally depends on the viscosity and surface tension of the solution. In some embodiments of the present invention, metering can be utilized because it makes it easier to control the uniformity of the thickness of the coating layer as well as the concentration of the therapeutic agent applied to the medical device.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0233">In one embodiment of the present invention, the balloon is inflated or partially inflated, the coating solution is applied to the inflated balloon by metering it on while the balloon is inflated and rotating along its longitudinal axis.

Any suitable metering or other technique may be used for coating the balloon catheter.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0235">After the medical device is coated with the coating solution, the coated balloon is subjected to a drying in which the solvent in the coating solution is evaporated. This produces a coating matrix on the balloon containing the therapeutic agent. One example of a drying technique is placing a coated balloon into an oven at approximately 20&#xb0; C. or higher for approximately 24 hours. Any other suitable method of drying the coating solution may be used. The time, temperature, and relative humidity may vary with particular additives and therapeutic agents.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0236">An embodiment of the present invention relates to a method of treating a benign prostatic hyperplasia. The method includes inserting a medical device including a coating into a prostatic urethra. The coating layer includes a therapeutic agent and an additive. In this embodiment, the medical device can be configured as having at least an expandable portion. Some examples of such devices include balloon catheters, fixed wire balloon catheter, over the wire balloon catheter, rapid exchange catheter, perfusion balloon catheters, an infusion catheter (e.g., distal perforated drug infusion catheters, a perforated balloon, spaced double balloon, porous balloon, and weeping balloon, cutting balloon catheters), spaced double balloons, cutting balloon catheter, scoring balloon catheters, self-expanded and balloon expanded-stents, guide catheters, guide wires, embolic protection devices, and various imaging devices.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0237">As mentioned herein, one example of a medical device that is particularly useful in the present invention is a coated balloon catheter. A balloon catheter typically has a long, narrow, hollow tube tabbed with a miniature, deflated balloon. In embodiments of the present invention, the balloon is coated with a drug solution. Then, the balloon is maneuvered through the stricture in the nonvascular body lumen to the site of a blockage, occlusion, or other tissue requiring a therapeutic agent. Once in the proper position, the balloon is inflated and contacts the walls of the stricture in the nonvascular body lumen and/or a blockage or occlusion. It is an object of embodiments of the present invention to rapidly deliver drug to and facilitate absorption by target tissue. In various embodiments, it can be advantageous to efficiently deliver drug to tissue in as brief a period as possible while the device is deployed at the target site. The therapeutic agent can be released into such tissue, for example the lumen walls, in about 0.1 to 30 minutes, for example, or about 0.1 to 10 minutes, or about 0.2 to 2 minutes, or about 0.1 to 1 minutes, of balloon inflation time pressing the drug coating into contact with diseased nonvascular tissue.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0238">Given that a therapeutically effective amount of the drug can be delivered by embodiments of the present invention into, for example, the prostate, in some cases the need for a stent may be eliminated, obviating the complications of fracture and dripping associated therewith.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0239">The balloon catheter may be used to treat nonvascular tissue/disease alone or in combination with other methods and medical devices for treating the non-vasculature, for example, direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU) for strictures and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for BPH. DVIU is a procedure used to open a urethral stricture. Specifically, DVIU is a procedure in which relaxing incisions are made in a stricture to create urethral luminal gain. DVIU may be accomplished using cold knife (urethrotome) or a hot knife (electrode). The cutter is inserted into the body and advanced through the urethra to the area of narrowing. After the relaxing incisions have been made, balloon dilation using the coated balloon of embodiments of the present invention may be performed. In addition, stenting may be performed thereafter, or simultaneous with expansion of the coated balloon as described herein. In another embodiment, balloon dilation using the coated balloon of embodiments of the present invention may be performed inside a placed stent. For TURP the medical device typically used is a hot knife (electrode) or a laser. In either case the device is inserted into the body and advanced through the urethra to the area of narrowing. After the prostatic tissue has been excised, balloon dilation using the coated balloon of embodiments of the present invention may be performed. In addition, stenting may be performed thereafter, or simultaneous with expansion of the coated balloon as described herein. In another embodiment a self-expanding stent coated with the therapeutic agents and additives of the present invention may be delivered and placed inside the body lumen strictures including esophageal strictures, achalasia strictures, biliary strictures, stomach strictures, small intestine strictures, duodenum strictures, jejunum strictures, ileum strictures, colon strictures, rectum strictures, and large intestine strictures.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="2">Preparation.</heading><p id="p-0251" num="0240">Various embodiments of the present invention provide a method of forming a balloon.

Also, the coating solution can be prepared by sequentially adding each component based on solubility or any other parameters. For example, the coating solution can be prepared by first adding the therapeutic agent to the solvent and then adding the additive. Alternatively, the additive can be added to the solvent first and then the therapeutic agent can be later added. If the solvent used does not sufficiently dissolve the drug, it is useful to first add the additive to the solvent, then the drug, since the additive will increase drug solubility in the solvent.</p><heading id="h-0027" level="2">International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Q<sub>max</sub>.</heading><p id="p-0254" num="0243">Q<sub>max </sub>is a measure of the maximum urine flow rate obtained during a urodynamics test.

The os penis urethra was not treated. Prior to inserting the catheter approximately 5 mL of saline was used to flush the urethra. The 8 mm nominal diameter balloons were inflated to 12 atmospheres at the treatment sites for 2 min to release drug and additive, then deflated and withdrawn from the dogs. The stretch ratio for the anterior urethra balloons was approximately 2.0-2.5.

Balloon catheters were constructed with 20 mm diameter&#xd7;80 mm length 7233 PEBAX&#xae; balloons. Two balloon neck sections were created in the balloon using an UHMWPE suture. The suture was tied to the balloon at the desired location to prevent balloon expansion, thereby creating necks. Necks were positioned symmetrically along the length of the balloon splitting the 80 mm length into three about 20 mm body sections. Neck sections were sized to 10 mm lengths and were about 8 mm in diameter. Neck section lengths are measured from one larger body section to the adjacent larger body section.

Balloons were inflated until visual evidence of a urethral split or to the maximum rated burst pressure (RBP) of 6 atm. Balloons were deflated immediately after the urethral split was confirmed. Inflation speed was varied across samples using 0.5 atm/min, 1.0 atm/min, and 2.0 atm/min. Total inflation time was between 3 and 10 minutes depending on the inflation speed.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0309">Necked balloons for this study were able to prevent balloon movement during inflation. The stretch ratio of the inflated balloon diameter to the normative prostatic urethral diameter was between about 3.0-3.5. Additionally, this study indicated that inflation rate played a role in balloon movement. By inflating the balloon slower, and allowing the tissue to stress relax and yield, migration of the balloon into the bladder was further minimized. Rates of 0.5 atm/min and 1.0 atm/min had less balloon movement during inflation.</p><heading id="h-0056" level="2">Part III.

The IPSS is based on the answers to eight questions&#x2014;seven regarding disease symptoms and one question related to the patient's quality of life: 1) Incomplete Emptying; How often have you had the sensation of not emptying your bladder? 2) Frequency; How often have you had to urinate less than every two hours? 3) Intermittency; How often have you found you stopped and started again several times when you urinated? 4) Urgency; How often have you found it difficult to postpone urination? 5) Weak Stream; How often have you had a weak urinary stream? 6) Straining; How often have you had to strain to start urination? 7) Nocturia; How many times did you typically get up at night to urinate? 8) Quality of Life Due to Urinary Symptoms; If you were to spend the rest of your life with your urinary condition just the way it is now, how would you feel about that? Although the IPSS was developed for BPH it can be applied to other bladder outlet obstructive diseases such as stricture to determine if obstructive symptoms are improved after a medical treatment. For the symptom questions, the patient is asked to choose the rating that best represents their condition. The scale ranges from 0 to 5, with 5 representing the most symptomatic disease. The seven symptom scores are summed to give an overall maximum possible score of 35. The answer to the quality of life question is scored on a scale of 0 to 6. According to these scoring systems, the scores can be categorized as follows: symptoms are mild if the score is 7 or less; symptoms are moderate if the score is 8 to 19; and symptoms are severe if the score is 20 to 35. This questionnaire was given prior to treatment (baseline) and at follow-up visits of 1, 3, 6, and 12 months to demonstrate the longevity of the treatment.</p><heading id="h-0057" level="1">Example III-1.

The matrix of drug coated balloon catheters had a rated burst pressure of 4 atmospheres. Each drug coated balloon catheter had four distinct balloon features that provided special functionality. The four features were the proximal balloon lobe, the balloon neck, distal balloon lobe and the Coude tip. The proximal balloon lobe dilates the prostatic urethra when the balloon is inflated. The balloon neck anchors into the bladder neck during balloon inflation and prevents migration of the proximal balloon lobe into the bladder. The balloon neck is reinforced with ultra high molecular weight high density polyethylene (UHMHDPE) fibers that wrap around the balloon neck and are fixed in place. The balloon neck reinforcement ensures the balloon neck does not grow in diameter as the balloon is inflated. The distal balloon lobe is used for positioning and also provides dilation of the bladder neck and any intra prostatic protrusion present during balloon inflation. The balloon is made of a higher durometer polyethylene oxide polyamide block copolymer (74D PEBAX&#xae;). The Coude tip is a specially curved tip that allows the catheter to be tracked in the prostatic urethra. The Coude tip was made of silicone rubber. The balloon portion of the catheter was pleat and folded down to a caliber of 19 French. Each catheter had a delivery sheath placed over the catheter. The delivery sheath had two functions.

Then the cystoscope was removed, and the drug coated balloon was inserted into the urethra and tracked so the Coude tip was in the bladder. Next the delivery sheath was removed to expose the drug coated balloon and the cystoscope was inserted side by side with the catheter shaft. Next the position of the drug coated balloon was slightly adjusted such that the proximal bond of the balloon was adjacent to the external sphincter. The balloon was held uninflated for at least 1 minute prior to inflating to hydrate the drug coating. Then the drug coated balloon was inflated with a mixture of saline and contrast media using the syringe with pressure gage.
