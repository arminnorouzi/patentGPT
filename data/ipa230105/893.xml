Further described herein are compounds, compositions and methods for the treatment of thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) deficiency.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Mitochondria are known as the energy producing organelles of cells. These double membraned organelles function independently of the cells in which they reside and even have their own genome, separate from the nuclear genome. While the nuclear genome encodes for some mitochondrial proteins, the mitochondrial genome specifically encodes for proteins associated with energy associated metabolic processes, including the electron transport chain and ATP production. Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDS) is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of disorders all characterized by highly reduced cellular mitochondrial DNA. MDS is the result of mutations in nuclear genes involved in nucleotide synthesis or replication of mitochondrial DNA, and have been associated with a variety of genes including TK2, SUCLA2, SUCLG1, POLG, DGUOK, MPV17, TYMP, and RRM2B. (Chansprasert et al., 2017). As a result, these autosomal recessive disorders result in extreme depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) which in turn negatively impacts energy production. (El-Hattab et al., 2013).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Symptoms appear in infancy or early childhood and primarily impact the tissues of the muscles, liver, or brain and generally present as muscle weakness, organ and neurological dysfunction, and weight loss. However, these disorders are phenotypically heterogeneous. For example, mutations in SUCLA2, SUCLG1, or RRM2B result in encephalomyopathic MDS and clinically present as hypotonia and neurological issues. Mutations in DGUOK, MPV17, or POLG present as early-onset liver dysfunction. (El-Hattab et al., 2013). Mutations in TYMP are associated with progressive gastrointestinal dysmotility and peripheral neuropathy. (El-Hattab et al., 2013). The severity and progression of these disorders is also highly variable, from mild manifestations to severe symptoms that result in death during infancy and childhood. Because of such heterogeneity in clinical manifestations, treatment options are limited to managing symptoms primarily through nutritional supplementation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) deficiency is a specific type of MDS. The enzyme thymidine kinase 2 is a nuclear encoded enzyme involved in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) synthesis involved in the recycling of nucleotides. (Genetics Home Reference, 2013). Mutations in the TK2 gene reduce enzyme activity and impair mtDNA nucleotide recycling, resulting in low levels of deoxythymidine monophosphate and deoxycytidine monophosphate. This shortage in the nucleotide pool impacts mtDNA synthesis and ultimately results in progressive myopathy that may begin in early childhood, eventually resulting in loss of motor skills. (Garone et al., 2018).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Currently, no disease modifying therapies exist for TK2 disease and treatment is primarily supportive. Although oral supplementation of deoxythymidine monophosphate, (dTMP) and deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) has demonstrated the ability to restore mtDNA depletion in animal models and increase overall survival, such treatments require high doses of each of the deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates (dNMP) in order to achieve an overall therapeutic benefit with significant side effects.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One embodiment described herein is a method of treating mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a multinucleotide composition comprising the compound of Formula I</p><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="46.57mm" wi="72.39mm" file="US20230000894A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0010" num="0000">wherein:</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">R<sub>1 </sub>is H or OH;</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0008">R<sub>2 </sub>is a purine derivative or pyrimidine derivative;<br/>R<sub>3 </sub>is a purine derivative or pyrimidine derivative; and</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">R<sub>4 </sub>is H or OH.</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0009">In one aspect, the composition comprises the compound of Formula I wherein R<sub>1 </sub>is H, R<sub>2 </sub>is 5-methyl-2H-1&#x3bb;2-pyrimidine-2,4(3H)-dione, R<sub>3 </sub>is 4-amino-2H-1&#x3bb;2-pyrimidine-2-one, and R<sub>4 </sub>is OH.

When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example when it is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is designated (R) or (S) according to the rules of Cahn and Prelog (Cahn et al., 1966, <i>Angew. Chem. </i>78: 413-447, <i>Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl. </i>5: 385-414 (errata: <i>Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl. </i>5:511); Prelog and Helmchen, 1982, <i>Angew. Chem. </i>94: 614-631, <i>Angew. Chem.
